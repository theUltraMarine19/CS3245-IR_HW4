2770813,R v Manevski (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1465,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 13 July 2016, Rachel Manevski (the offender) was arraigned on an indictment before a jury panel and me at Newcastle. The indictment contained two counts. The first averred that she had murdered Kieran Priestland (the deceased) at Narara on 13 February 2014. That count was based on the allegation that the offender had joined in a joint criminal enterprise with her then boyfriend, Andrew Perkins (the co-offender), to murder the deceased. The second count, which was in the alternative to the first, averred that, on the same date, the offender had been an accessory after the fact to that murder by the co-offender. The offender pleaded not guilty to both counts when arraigned.
	
	
	A trial ensued over the next two weeks, and the jury retired to consider its verdicts on Monday 25 July 2016. On Friday 29 July 2016, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of accessory after the fact to that offence.
	
	
	As a result of those verdicts, the principle that a person cannot be punished for a more serious offence than the one of which he or she has been found guilty has a particular importance in this case: see R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383; [1981] HCA 31.
	
	
	A further significant factor is that the co-offender separately pleaded guilty to murder, and has already been sentenced by me: see R v Perkins [2016] NSWSC 1080. It is important, of course, that I put from my mind all of the evidence that was placed before me in the proceedings on sentence with regard to the co-offender. With the assistance of the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the offender, I have done so.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder is imprisonment for 25 years. Parliament has prescribed no standard non-parole period. I regard the maximum penalty provided by Parliament for the offence as an important guidepost in the exercise of my sentencing discretion.
	
	
	I have approached my findings of fact on sentence as follows. Any matters of aggravation above and beyond the elements of the offence of which the offender has been found guilty must be proven to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. Any matters reducing the culpability of the offender need only be proven on the balance of probabilities. Some matters, of course, may be unable to be determined by me.
	


Objective features

Undisputed evidence


	
	I turn to provide a brief conspectus of the undisputed evidence in the trial.
	
	
	The offender, the co-offender, and a female friend of the co-offender, Ms Ashleigh Cornish, enjoyed a social event at the Perkins family home on the evening of 12 February 2014. They were all young adults who lived on the Central Coast of New South Wales. A large quantity of alcohol, and a quantity of cannabis, was consumed by the three of them.
	
	
	At the time, Ms Cornish was in a relationship with the deceased, himself barely 18 years of age. That had had its ups and downs. As part of that, the deceased turned up at the home with some young male friends between 9 and 10 PM that evening, and publicly accused Ms Cornish of being unfaithful to him. There was a degree of shouting and ugly behaviour on the suburban street outside the home, but nothing overly distressing. After a short period, the deceased and his friends left.
	
	
	The small social event between the three young persons resumed. At 10.34 PM, the co-offender sent the deceased a Facebook message in abusive terms. At about 10.49 PM, the offender telephoned the deceased, and they engaged in a conversation that was not at all friendly and featured, at the least, sarcasm on her part.
	
	
	At the end of the night, Ms Cornish – who had been upset and angry about the unannounced arrival of the deceased and his friends – had a change of heart, and decided that she would spend the evening with him. As a result, she telephoned the deceased and asked him to come to the home and pick her up. He promptly did so.
	
	
	After his arrival, the co-offender obtained a large knife from the kitchen of the home. He walked out of the home, down the driveway, and to the driver’s side door of the motor vehicle, in which the deceased was sitting still restrained by his seat belt. The co-offender stabbed the deceased repeatedly, and the death of that young man was rapid and inevitable.
	
	
	Very shortly thereafter, the co-offender gave the bloodied knife to the offender on the driveway leading from the street to the home. She immediately returned to the premises, washed it thoroughly, and replaced it in its knife block. She took the co-offender into the backyard of the home and told him to sit down. Finally, after having been arrested at the scene, she told countless bald-faced and subsequently admitted lies to police about what the co-offender had done or not done. In particular, she attempted to give him a completely false alibi whereby he and she had remained in the home at all relevant times.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	There was a dispute on sentence about which acts of the offender were captured by the count of which she was found guilty. The Crown Prosecutor, whilst giving full deference to the principle I mentioned a moment ago, submitted that I could be satisfied that the offender was standing next to the co-offender at the car of the deceased when the co-offender stabbed him to death, in accordance with the sworn evidence of Ms Cornish in the trial. In other words, it was submitted that I could be satisfied that the offender was well aware that the co-offender had committed murder from the earliest possible stage. The Crown Prosecutor also submitted that I could accept the evidence of Ms Cornish that, shortly before the stabbing, both the offender and the co-offender expressed an intention to kill the deceased.
	
	
	Defence counsel submitted that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time she washed and replaced the bloodied murder weapon, the offender was aware that there had been a murder (as opposed to merely a stabbing). In other words, it was submitted that I should sentence on the basis that the only assistance given by the offender with the necessary mental element was the telling of many lies in her recorded interview in a futile attempt to assist the co-offender to escape justice.
	
	
	It is certainly true that the principle to which I have referred does not prohibit taking facts into account on sentence that would make an offence objectively more serious, so long as they are not aggravating features that would constitute the elements of a more serious offence. It is also true that, although it is clear from the verdicts that the jury was not prepared to rely upon the uncorroborated evidence of Ms Cornish beyond reasonable doubt, I am called upon to make my own findings about discrete facts, so long as those findings are consistent with the verdicts of the jury.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I think that, both as a matter of principle and in a practical sense, in light of the cautious approach adopted by the jury to the evidence of Ms Cornish, I should do the same. Despite the impression she made on me as an honest and generally reliable witness, I do not propose to sentence the offender on the basis that she expressed an intention to kill, or that the co-offender did so in her presence. Nor do I sentence her on the basis that she was standing next to the co-offender when he committed the murder. I believe that taking such an approach would either infringe the limiting principle, or come so close to doing so as not to give due deference to the acquittal.
	
	
	On the other hand, in a sense that approach of mine does not resolve the central question, which is the time at which the offender came to know that a murder had been committed. Contrary to the submission of defence counsel, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, from a very early stage, the offender was well aware that the co-offender had stabbed the deceased to death. That is for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, on her own case, she was handed a bloodied knife early one morning by her boyfriend, and made no enquiry of him as to his well-being. Nor did she rush to the victim to see whether he was alive or dead. Nor did she call an ambulance for any person at any stage. Nor did she make the slightest enquiry of Ms Cornish, who was nearby, about what had happened. Instead, the offender simply immediately commenced to hide what the co-offender had done.
	
	
	Secondly, on her own case, the offender was standing on the driveway of a suburban home, a short distance from the deceased, when she was handed the weapon moments after the murder had been committed.
	
	
	Thirdly, because of the many lies she has told, both to police investigating the murder and in the witness box before a jury and me, I assess her credibility as negligible or worthless, including with regard to her assertion that she only became aware of the fact that a murder had been committed at the police station.
	
	
	Fourthly, the evidence in the trial was that, two days after the murder, the offender was visited by her uncle at a prison. When asked by that relative if she knew whether the deceased was dead or injured, she replied laconically “Oh yeah, he pretty much died in three minutes”. That statement was not disputed, either at trial or on sentence. I reject the submission of defence counsel that that seemingly heartless statement could have been based on something the offender had been told by police between the time of death of the deceased and the commencement of her recorded interview. In all the circumstances, I consider that the offender said that to her uncle because she either saw the murder happen from a short distance away, or was told of it by the co-offender before she did anything to assist him.
	
	
	In short, I sentence the offender on the basis that, with knowledge that a murder had very recently been committed by her romantic partner, she spontaneously washed and hid the murder weapon, and then, after a period of reflection, over an extended period told many lies in order to protect him.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	Turning to an assessment of the objective gravity of this example of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder, I accept the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that the assistance given had more than one aspect, and extended at least until the end of the recorded interview. That was many hours after the offender first knew of the murder, and first commenced to try to conceal it. I also accept the proposition that the murder weapon was almost sufficiently cleaned by the offender to remove any scientific link between it and the attack upon the deceased. In other words, the offender almost succeeded in breaking the link between the co-offender, the murder weapon, and the deceased.
	
	
	It is true that the washing of the knife was a spontaneous reaction by a young woman who acted to protect a person whom she believed she loved. It is also true that, as things transpired, the criminal acts of the offender did not deflect the authorities at all from bringing the murderer to justice.
	
	
	Still and all, this example of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder cannot be assessed as being anything other than grave.
	


Utilitarian discount?


	
	Turning to a separate disputed issue, a question arose in the proceedings on sentence about whether the offender should be granted a utilitarian discount on any sentence of imprisonment. It arose in the following circumstances.
	
	
	It was agreed at the Bar table that, after she had been charged with murder, the offender repeatedly offered to plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact to that offence, in full satisfaction of the indictment. Indeed, I was told that she formally entered a plea of guilty to the alternative charge in the Local Court at Gosford on 28 August 2015. That offer was rejected, and the trial concluded with the verdicts that I have discussed. In those circumstances, one may readily accept, in accordance with R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 and other decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, that a substantial utilitarian discount would be appropriate.
	
	
	That was not, however, the entirety of the circumstances relevant to the question. As I have said, when arraigned at the start of the trial, the accused pleaded not guilty to the alternative count of which she was ultimately found guilty. Furthermore, she gave evidence on oath in the trial, and explicitly denied on oath that she was guilty of the alternative count, in particular giving evidence that she did not possess the mental element necessary for the offence. In other words, in the trial there was no express or implied concession that she was guilty of the alternative count; to the contrary, that proposition was denied on oath.
	
	
	Once one bears in mind those additional circumstances, it is not easy to see how the principles explained in R v Oinonen can have application. In particular, one can respectfully very much doubt that a person who offers to plead guilty to an offence, but thereafter not only pleads not guilty to it, but also explicitly denies on oath his or her guilt of it, can nevertheless have the benefit of any utilitarian discount whatsoever.
	
	
	Having said all of that, I record that the Crown Prosecutor who appeared on sentence explicitly conceded that there should be a utilitarian discount of between 10 to 15%. That was in the context of defence counsel having submitted that there should be a utilitarian discount of 25%.
	
	
	I resolve the question as follows. I think that I should be slow to reject a considered concession made by a highly competent Crown Prosecutor. I do not accept the submission that there should be a utilitarian discount of 25%, or respectfully anything like it, in the circumstances that I have set out. Instead, I propose to apply a utilitarian discount of 10%, in accordance with the lower concession made by the Crown Prosecutor.
	


Subjective features


	
	Turning to the life and character of the offender, she was born in September 1993, and accordingly was aged 20 years at the time of the offence and is currently aged 23. It is also the case that she has no prior criminal record whatsoever. Those two factors – her youth, and her lack of prior intersection with the criminal justice system – sound powerfully in mitigation.
	
	
	As well as that, a psychological report was placed before me by defence counsel on sentence. It provides background about the life of the offender, and discussion of her psychological difficulties. Although it is largely based on things she said to the doctor, and although the many admitted lies of the offender cast serious doubt on her credibility, I am prepared to accept matters of background on the balance of probabilities, especially bearing in mind that they were not placed in dispute by the Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	Suffice to say the life of the offender has not been free of tragedy. In particular, her mother died of cancer when the offender was a little short of 10 years old, she having been ill for many years beforehand. As one might expect, the offender was damaged psychologically by that event; indeed, I accept that that damage has never been fully explored, let alone repaired. There came a time when she became more and more isolated and depressed and was neither working nor studying. She also commenced as an adolescent to self-medicate by abusing alcohol and prohibited drugs, to self-harm by repeatedly cutting herself, and to think often of suicide. Her relationship with the co-offender – which began approximately 15 to 18 months before the offence – did little or nothing to improve her psychological condition. I accept that that family tragedy and the psychological condition that arose from it must also play a significant role in mitigation.
	
	
	The elder of two sisters, the offender had been a promising athlete as a student, but her sporting career was cut short by injury. She left school before completing her HSC because the stress of exams was too much for her. To her credit, she worked at a number of jobs and studied at TAFE for a time, before her downward spiral became more pronounced. Having seen her in a lengthy recorded interview with police and giving evidence before me, I assess her as an intelligent person capable of achievement in the future.
	
	
	Furthermore, she enjoys a large degree of family support, including from her father (who raised the offender and her sister single-handedly after the death of his wife) and her grandmother, who gave sincere and impressive evidence before me on sentence.
	
	
	Finally, I accept that the romantic relationship between the offender and a convicted murderer has come to an end. To the extent that that relationship led to the commission of this offence, that must be seen as a positive development.
	
	
	To be weighed against those factors that operate in mitigation and provide optimism about the future are a number of adverse matters. They are the following.
	
	
	First, as I have said, the offender told very many admitted lies to the police in her recorded interview about the death of a fellow human being. Not only that, her presentation in the video of that interview bordered on the bizarre. For example, she referred insouciantly to the death of the deceased, and likened her feelings about it to the feelings she experienced when reading in a magazine about the death of a celebrity. One can accept that she was in something of a state of shock, and was affected by alcohol and cannabis to a degree. Nevertheless, her demeanour captured on video only a few hours after the murder is troubling.
	
	
	Secondly, the verdict of the jury demonstrates that the offender lied on oath when she denied that she did an act to assist the co-offender with knowledge that he had committed murder. Again, that denial bordered on the bizarre, and was based upon an arcane distinction between knowledge of killing and knowledge of murder. As well as that, her presentation in the witness box during the trial (the offender did not give evidence on sentence) was also unusual: amongst other things, it featured her swearing in the witness box, answering questions very discursively, and displaying something of a casual attitude to the whole process of being on trial for murder.
	
	
	Again, I accept that she was a young person, with no prior contact with the criminal justice system, in the position of giving evidence in denial of an allegation of murder that, if proven, would have ruined her life by way of many years of incarceration. No doubt, that is an extremely stressful experience, and one should not draw too much from the demeanour of anyone in that situation. Nevertheless, her manner was, again, very troubling.
	
	
	Thirdly, whilst being asked questions in evidence-in-chief by her own counsel, the offender raised her character. Because I have delivered a separate judgment about that process and its consequences, I shall not pause to provide detail about it: see R v Manevski [2016] NSWSC 1032. Suffice to say, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was done deliberately, and that, in doing so, the offender was being, at the least, economical with the truth about herself.
	
	
	Fourthly, that led to the Crown being permitted by me to cross-examine the offender about her bad character. She admitted before the jury that, prior to February 2014, there had been an incident in which she had threatened another young woman and her family, and used a weapon in the form of a small tree branch that she applied to the forehead of the victim. In other words, the offender is not a person whose life has been free of aggression on her part towards others.
	
	
	Fifthly, the record of offences against prison discipline of the offender over the past two and a half years has something of a flavour of the threat of violence. Yet again, that is troubling, in that one might have thought that the offender would be frightened of the threats of other prisoners, not making them herself.
	
	
	Sixthly, I certainly do not accept on the balance of probabilities the assertion, seemingly fleetingly made by the offender to the psychologist, and not supported by any evidence on oath, that she had been abused in some way as a child.
	
	
	Seventhly and finally, it was said by her counsel that I would accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender is remorseful. That was based in part on her repeated offers to plead guilty to the offence, and also upon a conversation that the offender’s grandmother had with her at a prison some time ago.
	
	
	I accept that her grandmother was being truthful when she told me on oath about that conversation. I also accept that the offender offered to plead guilty to the offence. And I further accept that the offender has reflected on the enormity of the criminality in which she has involved herself. But I am not satisfied that the offender is remorseful in the sense that s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) speaks of that subject. That is because the offender denied the offence on oath; I did not hear from her on sentence; and her credibility, including with regard to the truthfulness of her expressions of regret to her grandmother, I assess as being of negligible weight.
	
	
	In short, the subjective picture is a clouded one. In particular, there are grounds for optimism in the future, but that optimism must be tempered by significant caution.
	


Various aspects


	
	I discuss briefly a number of discrete aspects of my task.
	
	
	First, these remarks on sentence set out all of the aggravating and mitigating features of the matter that I have found to exist. I have referred myself to the statute, and taken care to avoid double counting. For that reason, I do not propose to engage formalistically with s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Secondly, it was agreed between the parties that the offender has been in custody since her arrest on the date of the offence, that being 13 February 2014. The sentence that I shall impose will commence on that date.
	
	
	Thirdly, I think that this is a case that cries out for a finding of special circumstances that will reduce to some degree the time spent in custody by the offender, and increase her time spent on parole. I say that because of the offender’s age, her prior good character, her psychological problems, and her undoubted need for help after the experience of being incarcerated for the first time with regard to a murder comes to an end.
	


Sentencing for accessory after the fact to murder


	
	Each counsel took me to a number of sentences imposed by other judges of this Court for the offence in question. I have also referred myself to the range of sentences imposed. Of course, those sentences are not binding in some statistical or rigid way. Having said that, they undoubtedly represent the accumulated wisdom of many judges over many years.
	
	
	I respectfully think that it could be said that some sentences imposed for this offence are surprisingly short. I express that view for three reasons.
	
	
	First, as I have said, Parliament has created a maximum penalty for the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder for 25 years. There is no greater penalty in the criminal law of New South Wales, other than imprisonment for life without possibility of parole.
	
	
	Secondly, without delving into detail, it can be seen from s 348 to s 350 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) that Parliament has created a detailed regime of maximum penalties for being an accessory after the fact to various offences. The particular offence under consideration sits at the apex of that structure.
	
	
	Thirdly and finally, the offence is founded upon an intentional effort to assist a murderer to escape justice, well knowing that he or she has committed murder. That is conduct that inherently demonstrates significant moral culpability. Of course, each case will turn on its own facts. But the conduct that founds the offence will sometimes call for significant denunciation.
	


Conclusion


	
	In short, I am called upon to sentence the offender for what I assess as a serious example of a serious offence. I am amply satisfied that no sentence other than full-time imprisonment is open to my discretion; counsel for the offender at no stage sought to persuade me to the contrary.
	
	
	My sentence reflects my assessment of the serious criminality of what the offender has done, combined with the powerful mitigating features, further combined with the notes of caution and concern that I have sounded. The latter include the imperative need for this young woman to receive psychological help in the future.
	
	
	Finally, as I have done previously, I extend my condolences to the family and friends of Kieran Priestland, both for what they have endured in the past, and for what they will endure in the future.
	


Imposition of sentence


	
	Rachel Manevski, you are convicted of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Kieran Priestland.
	
	
	I impose a non-parole period of 3 years, to date from 13 February 2014, with a parole period of 18 months to expire on 12 August 2018. The first date upon which you will be eligible for possible release to parole is 12 February 2017.
	
	
	To express my sentence another way, I have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years. Were it not for the utilitarian value of the offer to plead guilty, I would have imposed a head sentence for 5 years. Were it not for my finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period would have been 3 years, 4 months and 2 weeks.

2770814,R v Pratsch [2016] NSWSC 1466,"Judgment


	
	Mark Beverstock had a difficult life.
	
	
	He was born on 19 May 1964. At the age of 6 Mr Beverstock was in a car crash and suffered a brain injury that left him with motor and cognitive deficits for the remainder of his life. He was physically uncoordinated to the extent that others referred to him by the nickname “Shakey”. He had difficulties with speech and his capacity to learn and manage independently was impaired. He was largely illiterate and innumerate. He required assistance with day to day tasks such as banking. It would seem that Mr Beverstock drank too much, struggling with alcoholism in the last years of his life. He was 50 years old when he was murdered on 25 October 2014.
	
	
	Mr Beverstock was murdered by the offender, Leanne Gai Bernadette Pratsch. She was charged with his murder on 28 October 2014, and pleaded guilty to it on 9 August 2016, on what would have been the second day of her trial. A conviction was recorded on that date.
	
	
	Murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment is specified in the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). These are statutory guideposts that the Court is required to bear in mind.
	
	
	The statutory maximum penalty of life applies because of the serious nature of the crime of murder. A member of the community died in violent circumstances and there has been loss to the community and, more particularly, to the family and loved ones of the person violently killed.
	
	
	Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides for the imposition of the maximum penalty where the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme as to require that sentence to be imposed. The Crown did not submit that a life sentence should be imposed in this case. I accept that concession.
	


The Facts of the Offence


	
	At the time of his death Mr Beverstock was living in a granny flat at the rear of a family owned property in Booker Bay. The main house on the property was not continuously occupied, but Mr Beverstock’s brother, Larry, shared the two bedroom granny flat with him when he was not away in Sydney.
	
	
	The offender was acquainted with Mr Beverstock, and had on occasion visited him at his home.
	
	
	She came to see him on Saturday 25 October 2014, arriving by car at about 11.30 that morning. A neighbour saw the offender’s car parked in the driveway of the deceased’s property, and heard a female voice call out to him.
	
	
	Soon after, the offender and Mr Beverstock left the property, driving away in the offender’s car.
	
	
	A little after midday the offender, Mr Beverstock, and a man not identified by police, were at the Ocean Beach Hotel at Umina. Mr Beverstock and the offender drank some beers together before the pair went to an automatic teller machine within the hotel. Using Mr Beverstock’s bank keycard, and with him standing in the near vicinity, the offender withdrew an amount of $400 from Mr Beverstock’s bank account. That occurred at about 1.20pm.
	
	
	The offender left the hotel with two males at 1.21pm, returning without either man at 1.35pm. She rejoined Mr Beverstock, and they left the hotel together at 1.37pm. The offender re-entered the hotel briefly at 1.45pm, before again leaving the building. She and Mr Beverstock, who had been waiting outside for her, walked away.
	
	
	At some point Mr Beverstock returned to his home, accompanied by the offender.
	
	
	What happened thereafter is not entirely clear on the evidence.
	
	
	Mr Beverstock must have undressed at some point since the clothing he was observed to be wearing when he was at the Ocean Beach Hotel was later found draped over a chair in the lounge room of the granny flat.
	
	
	Mr Beverstock went naked to his brother’s bedroom where the offender tied him to a bed, using items of clothing as makeshift ligatures with which to secure his wrists and ankles to the bed head and foot respectively.
	
	
	The statement of facts tendered by the Crown, and not disputed by the offender, relates what happened thereafter as follows:
	


“After Ms Pratsch had tied him to the bed she obtained a knife and stabbed Mark a number of times to the chest and stomach area”: (Ex. A, p.4)


	
	As he was being stabbed Mr Beverstock managed to free his left wrist from the cloth tie and he tried to protect himself with his left arm. Later, he was found to have six separate stab and superficial incised wounds to his left arm, those injuries being consistent with defence injuries. Crime scene photographs in evidence suggest that Mr Beverstock also managed to free his left leg from the binding, assuming it had been secured initially.
	
	
	After the attack upon Mr Beverstock, the offender placed a pillow over his face and left the bedroom. She barricaded the bedroom door so that it could not be opened other than by force.
	
	
	The offender left Mr Beverstock’s home at 3.26pm, taking his black bag and wallet with her. Mr Beverstock’s bank keycard was inside the wallet.
	
	
	The offender drove to a cinema complex at Ettalong where she used the deceased’s bank keycard to withdraw the sum of $600 from his account.
	
	
	By 4pm she had entered the Ettalong Hotel where she made her way to the poker machines and began to play.
	
	
	Later that night the offender went to the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club where, prior to midnight, she used an automatic teller machine to make a balance inquiry on Mr Beverstock’s bank account. Shortly after midnight, the offender withdrew the sum of $700 from the account.
	
	
	At some point the offender discarded Mr Beverstock’s wallet and bag by throwing them into a public garbage bin in Ettalong, although she retained his keycard. The bag and wallet were found on the following afternoon by a man hunting in council bins for aluminium cans.
	
	
	On 26 October 2014, at 3.49 in the afternoon, the offender again used Mr Beverstock’s card, on this occasion to purchase cigarettes costing $17 from a supermarket in the Deepwater Shopping Plaza at Woy Woy. This last transaction emptied Mr Beverstock’s account of all but 83 cents.
	
	
	During this time Mr Beverstock’s body had lain undiscovered where the offender had left him, tied to a bed in the Booker Bay residence. Precisely when he died is not established by the evidence, although it cannot have been long after he was stabbed by the offender, given the nature of his injuries.
	
	
	When Larry Beverstock was away from home, he regularly telephoned the granny flat, to check on his brother’s welfare. He generally made the call around 5pm on such occasions.
	
	
	At about 5pm on 25 October 2014 Larry Beverstock telephoned the granny flat as was his habit. The call went unanswered.
	
	
	He telephoned again at about 7 o’clock the following morning, 26 October 2014, but the phone rang out. Larry Beverstock made a further telephone call to his brother at 5 o’clock that afternoon, but the phone continued unanswered. Concerned, Larry Beverstock telephoned Gosford Hospital and inquired whether his brother had been admitted there. He had not.
	
	
	Larry Beverstock then telephoned neighbours who lived close by, Mr and Mrs Kenyon, and asked them to go to the granny flat and look for Mr Beverstock. They did as they were asked but they were unable to raise Mr Beverstock at the granny flat. They noticed that the carport gates were unlocked and the flyscreen door to the flat was wide open. The television was on and, although Mr Beverstock’s sandals were on the floor in front of his arm chair, his black bag was nowhere to be seen.
	
	
	A sliding door from the living room to a bedroom was jammed closed and Mr Kenyon was not able to open it.
	
	
	Mr and Mrs Kenyon called out for Mr Beverstock but there was no response.
	
	
	Mr Kenyon telephoned Larry Beverstock from inside the granny flat to tell him what he and his wife had found.
	
	
	Thereafter, Larry Beverstock telephoned Woy Woy Police Station to report the situation.
	
	
	The following morning, 27 October 2014, Larry Beverstock left Sydney and drove home to Booker Bay. He arrived at about 5.25 in the morning. There was no sign of Mr Beverstock in the granny flat.
	
	
	Sometime after 7.15 that morning, Larry Beverstock forced open the sliding door that Mr Kenyon had been unable to open the previous day. When he went into the bedroom he saw his brother lying naked on his back on the bed. Mr Beverstock’s face was covered by a pillow. There was dried blood on his stomach. Larry Beverstock called an ambulance.
	
	
	Ambulance officers arrived at the residence a little after 7.30 that morning. The officers saw numerous puncture wounds to Mr Beverstock’s stomach and chest and observed that his right wrist and ankle were bound to the bed. He was dead.
	
	
	Mr Beverstock’s body was later forensically examined by Dr Leah Clifton and Professor Tim Lyons of the Department of Forensic Medicine in Newcastle.
	
	
	Mr Beverstock had sustained some twenty separate stab and incised wounds.
	
	
	One stab wound had penetrated to a depth of 80 milimetres (+/- 20 milimetres) and into the right ventricle of the heart. This wound was the direct cause of death. There were a further four stab wounds to the left chest area, two of which had entered the superficial capsule of the spleen, whilst two had penetrated into the subcutaneous fat and muscle of the chest wall.
	
	
	A further complex of nine stab and incised wounds were observed to the stomach, with these wounds having caused a number of underlying injuries. All but one of these wounds penetrated beyond the skin. One wound penetrated the external wall of the stomach, three penetrated the external wall of the small bowel, two entered the lumen of the small bowel, and one went entirely through the small bowel. There were additionally a penetrating injury to the lumen of the large bowel, and two wounds into the mesenteric fat of the large bowel.
	
	
	A further six stab and incised wounds were located on Mr Beverstock’s left arm, consistent with defensive injuries.
	
	
	The wound to the heart had caused bleeding into the pericardium and was of such a nature that Mr Beverstock could not have long survived it in the absence of immediate medical intervention. The other sharp force penetrating injuries hastened death.
	
	
	The wounds were consistent with having been inflicted with a single edged, non-serrated knife with a blade length of between 80 and 100 mm, and a width of 20 to 30mm. The wounds had been inflicted from the front to the back, left to right, and mostly in the horizontal plane.
	
	
	No significant injuries were noted to the wrists, suggesting to the pathologists that the ligatures had been loosely applied.
	
	
	Mr Beverstock had a post-mortem blood alcohol level of 0.133 grams / 100 mililitres which was most likely attributed to alcohol consumption rather than to post-mortem decompositional changes.
	
	
	At about 7.45 on the evening following the discovery of Mr Beverstock’s body, 28 October 2014, the offender went with her de facto spouse, Peter Howe, to visit Mr Howe’s parents at their home. The facts tendered by the Crown state that the offender “told Mr David Howe that she had stabbed a man but didn’t know that she had killed him” (Ex. A, p.8). It would appear (from Ex. 1) that the offender heard that Mr Beverstock was dead from a radio broadcast.
	
	
	The offender gave David Howe some other information as to the incident that she said occurred at Mr Beverstock’s home on 25 October 2014. She said that, after seeing blood on the deceased, she had run from the room and barricaded the door. She took the deceased’s key to open the carport gate, and drove away. She said that she had put $400 she had taken from the deceased’s bank account through the pokies.
	
	
	The offender said that she could not recall what had happened to the knife.
	
	
	David Howe told police about the conversation later that evening.
	
	
	Late that night, at about 11 o’clock, the offender was arrested. She was interviewed by police, giving an account of events of 25 October 2014. The interview is not in evidence. The only evidence about what was said by the offender during the interview is, “amongst other things” as the Crown facts notes, a list of matters (at Ex. A, p.8) to which she referred.
	
	
	The list includes an acknowledgment that the offender went to Mr Beverstock’s home on the morning of Saturday 25 October 2014, to ask about payment for a necklace. After going out with Mr Beverstock to Umina and Ocean Beach Park she returned with him to the granny flat. She told the police that the deceased had said “rude things” to her and there was an argument about which of the two was to have a shower first (Ex. A, p.9). The deceased ended up on the bed and the offender “retrieved” a knife and stabbed him. She thereupon locked Mr Beverstock in the bedroom.
	
	
	When she left she took the deceased’s keycard with her, and withdrew money from his bank account which was used to play poker machines. Another attempt to withdraw money from the deceased’s account was unsuccessful, because the daily limit for withdrawals had been reached. Having used the keycard to purchase some cigarettes, the offender said she thereafter threw it down a drain.
	
	
	The offender said to police that “she did not want him [Mr Beverstock] to be hurt” and had not acted to kill him, but he had done things that were “inappropriate and not right” and “she wanted to be free” (Ex. A, p.9). The offender said that she had not done anything wrong.
	
	
	A crime scene examination of Mr Beverstock’s home found evidence to link the offender forensically to the killing. A DNA profile matching the offender was found on a cigarette butt collected from an ashtray beside the bed where the deceased was killed, and on a beer can found in the lounge room. Biological material from underneath three fingernails of the deceased’s right hand also produced a DNA profile consistent with that of the offender. DNA extracted from a swab of the deceased’s right wrist, and from his stolen black bag, had a mixed profile, to which the offender could have contributed, and it is likely that she did contribute to a further mixed profile recovered from a swab of part of the bed frame. Her fingerprint was found on the beer can from the lounge area.
	


Other Evidence in the Crown Case


	
	The Crown also tendered a statement of the offender’s criminal antecedents (Exhibit B) and her custodial history (Exhibit C).
	
	
	The offender’s first appearance before a criminal court was in May 1990 when she was convicted and fined for larceny. In February 2000 she was again fined in the Local Court, on this occasion for possessing a prohibited drug. In 2005 the offender was dealt with by the Drug Court for two counts of break and enter with intent to steal, sixteen counts of break enter steal, and one of goods in custody. The sentences were initially suspended by the Drug Court pursuant to s 7(3) of the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW) but sentences of imprisonment were subsequently imposed. The longest sentence, imposed concurrently for ten counts of break enter steal, was for a term of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 18 months. Conditions directed to drug and alcohol rehabilitation were specified.
	
	
	The offender was before the courts in 2007 for further offences of dishonesty, with one offence, for break enter and steal, attracting a short custodial sentence. More recent offences, for possessing a prohibited drug (in February 2014), shoplifting (in March 2014) and drink driving (in June 2014) were all dealt with by way of fine.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown tendered a report, heavily redacted, from Associate Professor Anthony Samuels.
	
	
	A/Professor Samuels had been provided by the Crown with considerably more information than was tendered in evidence to the Court. He referred to two psychiatric reports from Dr Christopher Bench concerning the offender (from September 2015 and March 2016) and to a Crown Case Statement that evidently set out factual material not relied upon in this Court (Ex. G, p. 2-5). A/Professor Samuels was additionally briefed with medical records from the offender’s general practitioner, Area Health Service medical records, and witness statements and other documents from the police brief of evidence.
	
	
	The professor interviewed the offender on 6 July 2016 via an audio-visual link. He took a history from the offender of long term drug addiction and mental illness, and of previous violent relationships.
	
	
	The offender told A/Professor Samuels that she was one of four daughters of her parents, and one of twins. Her parents were both dead, as was her step-father. The offender had had no contact with her sisters since her mother’s death in 2010. She has four children, but has no contact with them now, and had little contact with them prior to going into custody in October 2014.
	
	
	The offender described having been in an abusive relationship with Peter Howell (presumably the Peter Howe referred to in Exhibit A, and so referred to hereafter) for three years, ending in early 2016. She told A/Professor Samuels that there had been a very violent incident about 6 months before Mr Beverstock was murdered, in which the offender had been held hostage by Mr Howe who had “gone crazy” (Ex. G, p. 19). The offender complained that she had been bashed by Mr Howe, who tied her up and doused her and their house with petrol. The incident ended when police, alerted by neighbours, arrived and arrested Mr Howe.
	
	
	The offender asserted that criminal charges brought against Mr Howe did not proceed after she “wrote a letter withdrawing her allegations” (Ex. G, p. 19), something she did because she would have otherwise been kicked out of her home. She remained with Mr Howe, despite being in considerable and continual fear of him.
	
	
	The offender asserted that Mr Howe was responsible for other serious violence in January 2014 when he attacked a former partner of hers, Jason, who had come to see her. The offender said that Mr Howe had stabbed Jason ten times to the head, but he was not criminally charged, apparently because he claimed to have acted in self-defence.
	
	
	The offender said that she ran away from Mr Howe and had a short relationship with Jason, which ended when he was killed in a car crash. She thereafter returned to Mr Howe.
	
	
	The offender gave A/Professor Samuels a history of Bipolar Disorder diagnosed when she was aged 18 with two admissions to psychiatric institutions, in 2004 and 2008. She referred to herself as always “manic” (Ex. G, p. 20).
	
	
	The offender said that she had not been taking any medication in the six months prior to the offence, but is now prescribed an anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication.
	
	
	The offender said that she is also prescribed methadone and takes it daily. Previously, the offender used “ice”, heroin and occasionally marijuana. In the period before Mr Beverstock’s murder she was also drinking alcohol with her partner.
	
	
	As to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, the offender said that she had gone to Mr Beverstock’s house on 25 October 2014 because she did not want to go home, following an argument with her spouse. After going out with Mr Beverstock to a pub they had returned to Booker Bay with some beers. The two had argued about where the offender was to park her car and about the fact that Mr Beverstock locked the gate to his property.
	
	
	The offender asked Mr Beverstock if he wanted to be tied up, intending to leave the flat after having done so. She tied one of his arms and one leg, and after that she said that she stabbed him, “three or four or many times” (Ex. G, p.22).
	
	
	A/Professor Samuels quoted the offender as saying:
	


“I don’t know how it happened. I can’t believe it happened. It was like I was on the roof watching myself doing it” (Ex. G, p.22).


	
	The offender claimed not to know that Mr Beverstock was seriously injured when she barricaded the bedroom door and left through the gate, which was in fact unlocked. She returned briefly to take Mr Beverstock’s bag and wallet, which she said she did to “piss him off” (Ex. G, p.22).
	
	
	She drove to Ettalong pub where she said she took $600 from Mr Beverstock’s account. After that she went home, telling Mr Howe what she had done when he arrived home. Although she was not able to tell Mr Howe what had happened to the knife she used to kill Mr Beverstock, she told A/Professor Samuels that he found it in a cupboard and “cut it up” (Ex. G, p.23).
	
	
	She and Mr Howe later went to a club where she withdrew more money from Mr Beverstock’s account, she thought $600.
	
	
	When she discovered that Mr Beverstock was dead she said that she went with her spouse to see his father. She claimed that Mr Howe’s parents gave her money to buy ice so that she and Mr Howe could have a “last drink” before she went to gaol (Ex. G, p.23).
	
	
	On examination, A/Professor Samuels noted the offender to be emotionally reactive, distressed and with pressured speech. She reported poor sleep, saying that she thought a lot about what happened to the deceased. Because she no longer had contact with Mr Howe she reported feeling less jumpy, and regarded herself as “healing”.
	
	
	Although A/Professor Samuels concluded that there was evidence of mental instability in the offender’s history, he considered the most significant aspect of her presentation was the history of polysubstance abuse. He did not support a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, noting that the offender’s admissions to psychiatric facilities had been few and of short duration, and her use of psychotropic medications most likely to be as an adjunct to her consumption of illicit drugs.
	
	
	The doctor concluded that the most likely psychiatric diagnoses are a range of personality disturbances with prominent dependent and borderline and anti-social type features. Polysubstance misuse was significant. He thought that she “almost certainly” has a complex trauma syndrome with features of Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome (“PTSD”) (Ex. G, p.26).
	
	
	A/Professor Samuels thought that the offender was in a heightened state of emotional arousal on the day of the murder because of ongoing problems with her spouse. She may have used drugs on the day, and had consumed some alcohol.
	
	
	He speculated that in the context of tension developing between the offender and Mr Beverstock on 25 October 2014, and against a general background of emotional arousal, the offender may not have been able to control her feelings of anger.
	
	
	The account the offender gave to A/Professor Samuels of sitting on the garage roof observing herself commit the crime was, in the doctor’s view, implausible. He considered that any dissociation would more typically be momentary, and ended by the “victim’s struggles, cries, pain and presumably requests for her to stop” (Ex. G, p.27). He also thought her act of barricading the door to the room in which the deceased was left, and returning to the flat to steal his bag and wallet were, “vengeful”, and not consistent with the fear she expressed to him of the deceased. He concluded (Ex. G, p.28):
	


“The violent attack on the deceased is more likely to have been motivated by a combination of personality factors, alcohol, stimulants and marijuana leading to disinhibition, aggression, fear and release of repressed anger.”

Other Evidence as to the Offender’s Mental State


	
	The other evidence of the offender’s mental state at the time of the commission of the offence comes from evidence tendered by her, being a report from Dr Mary Jurek, a consultant psychiatrist.
	
	
	Dr Jurek saw the offender on 9 September 2016. She had been extensively briefed prior to the consultation, including with a copy of A/Professor Samuel’s report.
	
	
	The offender gave Dr Jurek a similar history of mental instability and drug use to that given to A/Professor Samuels. She said that she had continued using illicit drugs in gaol, although she expressed a desire to overcome her addictions.
	
	
	The offender referred to a series of violent relationships with men, commencing with violence from her first boyfriend, with whom she lived for three years from age 14. She complained that her second significant partner, the father of her four children, was also violent to her, referring the doctor to “a large Police file” about the violence (Ex.1, p.5).
	
	
	She attributed responsibility for the many break and enter offences of which she has been convicted to a boyfriend who, she said, committed the crimes. She claimed to have taken “the rap” for him because to do otherwise would have meant that she would have been shot or bashed by him.
	
	
	The offender described Peter Howe as an “insanely jealous” and controlling individual who frequently assaulted her. She described an incident in April 2014 (also described by her to A/Professor Samuels) when Mr Howe had detained her in their home, tying her up and pouring petrol over her and the house. To Dr Jurek, the offender gave an involved account of how it came about that criminal charges against Mr Howe arising from that incident were withdrawn, including details of a conspiracy between her and Mr Howe’s parents to pervert the course of justice:
	


“She said she, Peter and his parents sat around and helped make up a Stat Dec (Statutory Declaration) that she was a “drug fucked sex pervert” and that they had been engaged in a sex game. She said she was charged with “being a hostage”. She is pleased that she was able to reconcile Peter with his family.” (Ex.1, p.7)


	
	As to the circumstances of Mr Beverstock’s murder, the offender said to Dr Jurek that she and Mr Howe had used drugs on the morning of 25 October 2014, injecting ice and oxycontin and sharing a fentanyl patch of uncertain dose. The latter had made her head and brain feel hot.
	
	
	After arguing with Mr Howe she went out, eventually going to Mr Beverstock’s home. The two went out for a time and, on returning to the Booker Bay residence they had argued about the carport gates and whether they were to be locked. She claimed that Mr Beverstock had said rude things to her, such as expressing a wish to “grab her arse.”
	
	
	Dr Jurek recorded the following:
	


“She said she had an image of herself sitting on the roof of the garage swinging her legs watching herself stab him. When she regained awareness after seeing herself sitting on the roof, she thought “Oh my God, Oh my God” and felt sick. She thought she stabbed him two or three times and was surprised to learn later that she had inflicted twenty wounds. She said she could not recall putting a pillow over his face. She jammed the door of the room shut so that he could not follow her and left.” (Ex. 1, p.8)


	
	The offender told Dr Jurek that she took the knife home with her and hid it in a beer box. Her partner later cut it up and threw it down a drain.
	
	
	She acknowledged having gone to an ATM to take money from Mr Beverstock’s account, money she used on poker machines.
	
	
	The offender said that she thought about Mr Beverstock each day with guilt and regret, and felt very sorry for what had happened.
	
	
	Dr Jurek set out the offender’s history of interaction with mental health professionals, much of it being in the context of the offender’s use of illicit drugs and encounters with the criminal justice system. From the history the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder seems to have only ever been tentative, with drug-induced psychosis regarded as a likely diagnosis from time to time.
	
	
	Drug use has been a constant feature of the offender’s presentations to hospitals or doctors more generally. Her drug use evidently continues, with Dr Jurek referring to the offender using intravenous heroin, oxycontin, ice, and suboxone, as well as smoking cannabis in custody. She additionally uses methadone prescribed to her.
	
	
	An assessment in January 2015 by a psychiatry registrar pointed to the existence of a bipolar affective disorder and PTSD. Stress relating to the outstanding criminal proceedings was noted.
	
	
	Having reviewed the documentary history and assessed the offender, Dr Jurek concluded that the offender suffered from Polysubstance Abuse Disorder, PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder. She referred to Bipolar Disorder having been earlier discounted. Dr Jurek notes (Ex. 1, p.16):
	


“From the history obtained, medical records, and clinical evaluation, Ms Pratsch has a number of significant problems including childhood trauma, domestic violence relationships, alcohol abuse, illicit drug use including ice, heroin, cannabis and unstable moods which are inextricably linked.”

The Gravity of the Offence


	
	The sentence to be imposed upon the offender must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and provide reasonable proportionality between it and the circumstances of the crime: R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152, at [15].
	
	
	Objectively, the gravity of this offence can only be assessed as very high.
	
	
	Mr Beverstock was a particularly vulnerable individual. The acquired brain injury that affected him left him cognitively impaired and physically unstable. As a friend or acquaintance of the deceased, the offender would have been well aware of his situation, and of the difficulties under which he laboured. She must also have known that he would be less able to resist a physical attack upon his person than would an adult male of ordinary health and strength.
	
	
	Having spent the preceding few hours with Mr Beverstock, and having accompanied him to licenced premises where he consumed alcohol, the offender must also have known that he was intoxicated, even if she did not know the extent of it. Mr Beverstock had a blood alcohol level of 0.133 on autopsy, a mid-range concentration of alcohol for a driver of a motor car. It is unlikely that post-mortem decompositional change contributed to that level significantly or at all, and it is open to infer that Mr Beverstock was affected by the alcohol he had consumed, and was even more vulnerable to physical attack as a consequence.
	
	
	The offence occurred in Mr Beverstock’s home, where he should have been safe and secure. The offender, as someone known to Mr Beverstock, had been invited or allowed entry by him to his home, on the unstated but no less clear basis that she posed no risk to him. In attacking Mr Beverstock as she did in his home, the offender breached the trust that reposed in her in the most terrible way imaginable.
	
	
	I note specifically that, in light of the current debate as to the application of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to a person other than an intruder, [1]  I have not treated the commission of the offence in the victim’s home as an aggravating feature. However, the breach of trust inherent in the offender, as a trusted guest in Mr Beverstock’s home, murdering him there, elevates the seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	Although the evidence does not establish how or why, the offender chose to arm herself with a weapon, a knife, with which to attack Mr Beverstock. The use of a weapon does not necessarily make a murder any worse in terms of its factual seriousness, since most offences of murder involve the use of a weapon. However, the use of a knife in the context of this case does elevate the seriousness of the offence to some extent, and even more so in the context of Mr Beverstock’s disability. With his lack of coordination it can be safely concluded that he would have struggled to fight off a physical assault; his chances of doing so when a knife was used as the instrument of attack would have been further reduced.
	
	
	The circumstances of the infliction of the many stab wounds upon Mr Beverstock also make it a gravely serious offence. How or why Mr Beverstock was tied by the offender to a bed is nowhere satisfactorily explained on the evidence. That he was so tied made him even more vulnerable to an attack of the nature mounted on him than would otherwise have been the case, particularly where the attack was made with a weapon with immediate lethal capacity.
	
	
	The crime scene photographs and forensic pathologists’ report taken together make it clear that both of Mr Beverstock’s wrists were initially secured by cloth ligatures to the bedhead, whilst at least his right ankle was also secured, at the base of the bed. Photographs 31 and 98 of Exhibit F suggest that his left ankle was also tied at some point, by a piece of blue cloth or clothing that can be seen in those images. It appears to be tied to the bottom of the bed frame on the left hand side in the same way as the other three ligatures.
	
	
	With four limbs secured, Mr Beverstock would have been wholly unable to defend himself during the initial onslaught of knife blows. It is clear that he could have offered no real resistance to the attack upon him until such time as he was able to free his left arm from its binding. Even then, however, he remained tied to the bedframe, and all he could do in his own defence was to attempt to shield his body from the knife with his left arm, receiving knife blows to that arm in the process.
	
	
	Despite the fact that Mr Beverstock posed no threat to the offender, and could have offered no meaningful resistance to her attack upon him, the offender’s assault was merciless. The existence of twenty separate knife wounds is testimony to the savagery of the attack.
	
	
	That there was time during the course of that attack for Mr Beverstock to free his left arm and use it as a shield to his body shows that the attack was not of fleeting duration. It must have proceeded for sufficient time for Mr Beverstock to perceive his danger, and take what steps he could to defend himself. He must have been, over that period of time, sensible of the pain that would have accompanied the many knife blows, aware that he was struggling for his life, and terrified. The horror of that situation is palpable even at a distance.
	
	
	Given the use of a knife, the number of wounds inflicted, the fact that most of them were directed to Mr Beverstock’s left chest and abdomen, and the serious nature of many of the wounds, in that many penetrated the body to a dangerous depth, I conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the offender acted with an intention to kill.
	
	
	It is not possible on the evidence to determine whether Mr Beverstock was living or dead when the offender pushed a pillow across his face and barricaded him alone inside the bedroom. It does appear, however, that she herself believed him to be alive. That she would leave him wounded and tied to a bed, without aid or the means of summoning it, contributes to the gravity of the crime. It was a heartless act, shocking in its callousness.
	
	
	Finally, the offender’s considered and deliberate choice to return to Mr Beverstock’s home after leaving it to steal his bag and wallet, knowing he could not resist the theft, and then to drain his account of all but some cents over the ensuing days, can only heighten the objective criminality of her act.
	
	
	Without any satisfactory evidence as to why this crime happened, it is difficult to assess the spontaneity or otherwise of it. Despite the theft that followed the murder, the Crown does not suggest that robbery was the motivation, and that suggestion was not put to the offender when she gave evidence. The Court must therefore set it entirely aside.
	
	
	Probably, the crime was largely spontaneous, although there was planning at least to the extent that the offender determined to arm herself with a knife and use it. Whilst the offender may have tied Mr Beverstock up to facilitate the commission of her crime, I am not able to conclude that such was the case beyond reasonable doubt. It may be that Mr Beverstock was tied up for some other, not unlawful, purpose.
	
	
	In considering the nature and gravity of the offending I have considered those matters which might aid in assessment of the offender's moral culpability for her crime, but have found making that assessment a singularly difficult task. Although the offender gave evidence she said nothing to the Court that might have explained why she killed Mr Beverstock in the brutal way in which she did, or what could have motivated that crime.
	
	
	In her evidence the offender asserted the truth of what she had said to Dr Jurek, but the account that she gave the doctor does not greatly aid in determining what motivation may have operated upon the offender to act as she did. Some parts of her account do not sit well with objective evidence, or are inconsistent with other comments by her, such as her account of drug use on the morning, or her assertion to Dr Jurek that the gates to the property were not locked, and that to her father-in-law that she took the keys to the gate on leaving the flat. The offender’s account of events cannot be embraced without question.
	
	
	Drug use on the morning of the murder may have played a role, however, there is a difference between what the offender told A/Professor Samuels about her consumption of drugs, and what she told Dr Jurek, that leads me to treat her assertions in that regard with caution. There is, in any event, no evidence of intoxication, and self-induced intoxication cannot mitigate crime.
	
	
	The offender gave Dr Jurek an account of an argument with Mr Beverstock about the locking of the carport gate, with her fearing that he had locked it, and feeling trapped. Her anxiety about being locked in was heightened because of her experiences as the victim of domestic violence, and the PTSD Dr Jurek opines that the offender suffers. Dr Jurek notes:
	


“Ms Pratsch was seeking refuge from a domestic violence situation but found herself in a similar situation where she felt she was confined as she had been with Peter in the hostage situation.”


	
	I interpose that there is no evidence that the offender was in a “similar situation”, or was confined in a “hostage situation”. Dr Jurek continues,
	


Not only did she have to deal with that situation but she was uncertain whether her partner would find out and how he would react as he was “insanely jealous”.” (Ex. 1, p.20)


	
	There is no suggestion that the offender thought that she was to be taken hostage at Mr Beverstock’s hands, or harmed in some way by him. Indeed, his physical and cognitive deficits would surely have made escape by the offender readily possible, should she have needed to flee for some reason.
	
	
	The offender’s anxiety about the gate being locked sits uncomfortably with her own acknowledgement that, on leaving the premises after having murdered Mr Beverstock she found that the gate was not locked, and additionally with the openness of the layout of the premises overall. It is clear from the crime scene photographs that, even had the carport gates been padlocked, egress from the premises was by no means prevented. Photograph 16 of Exhibit F shows that the rear of the property was bounded by a waist height fence, which could have been readily scaled. Further, the deceased’s keys were in plain sight, and the offender could presumably have taken them to unlock the gate, as she told her father-in-law she did.
	
	
	Even accepting the offender’s anxiety at what she believed to be a padlocked gate, as Dr Jurek says in the paragraph following that extracted at [121] above, “It is not clear when the knife was produced” (Ex. 1, p.20). Nor is it clear why a knife was taken up. It is even less clear to me why the offender used the knife in the way that she did.
	
	
	She specifically resiled in her evidence from some assertions that she made to interviewing police on or about 28 October 2014 that it was the deceased who obtained the knife, holding it against her cheek. There could be no question about a struggle for a knife, since there is no evidence that Mr Beverstock ever had the knife, and he was in any event, tied to a bed and incapable of offering threat when the offender stabbed him.
	
	
	Dr Jurek speculated – and it is no more than speculation – that previous trauma and drug use had a role to play:
	


“Her past history of sexual assaults may have been triggered/re experienced by this event as was the terror of being held captive in a life threatening situation some few months previously. Depending on the time frame, she may also have been also withdrawing from the drugs she had used earlier as well as being fatigued.” (Ex.1, p.21)


	
	Even to the lower standard of proof applicable to matters in mitigation, that opinion is sufficiently speculative as to fail to constitute proof on the balance of probabilities. I do not accept it.
	
	
	I find myself quite unable to determine why the offender armed herself on this day, or why she stabbed Mr Beverstock with such lethal violence. Although it is unsatisfactory, and must be so to those who cared for Mr Beverstock and would no doubt wish to know why he died as he did, I have approached the determination of sentence on the basis referred to by the High Court in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29, at [70]:
	


“Certainly, a sentencing judge must do his or her best to find the facts which determine the nature and gravity of the offending, including the facts which inform the offender's moral culpability. Even so, it is sometimes not possible for the judge to ascertain everything which is relevant, especially where an offender chooses not to offer any evidence on the plea. Where that occurs, the judge must proceed on the basis of what is proved and leave to one side what is not proved to the requisite standard.”


	
	On the evidence presented to the Court by the parties, I am simply unable to determine what caused the offender to act in the murderously violent way she did.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept that the offender was in a state of heightened emotional arousal as a consequence of her own domestic situation. Her drug use no doubt led to some disinhibition. I accept that the offender’s capacity to exercise appropriate powers of self-control was likely to have been lessened by the Post Traumatic Stress and other disorders from which she suffered, and her condition thus had a bearing on the circumstances of the commission of the offence. No matter how irrational, she may have felt trapped to a degree, not because of any act of Mr Beverstock’s or because of any objective circumstance present on the day, but because of her own history of abuse at the hands of violent men, exacerbated by her own drug use.
	
	
	The reduction in the offender’s moral culpability cannot, however, be great in the circumstances of this case because of its complete failure to explain the act of murder itself. Once Mr Beverstock had been tied to the bed, nothing in the evidence as to the offender’s mental state explains why she took up a knife and stabbed him in the frenzied way she did. If she was labouring under fears of being trapped, it should have been apparent at that stage that she was able to leave the property without fear of being stopped or detained. That she stabbed Mr Beverstock with the violence she did, and then stole from him in a way A/Professor Samuels suggested was “vengeful”, was not in my view causally connected to her mental state to any significant degree, on the limited evidence available. Disinhibition through drug use is likely to have had a greater role to play in the commission of the crime.
	
	
	I do not consider that the offender’s mental condition was so causally connected to the commission of the crime as to diminish or obviate the need for the sentence imposed upon her to denounce the crime she committed, particularly having regard to the role of illicit drug use.
	


The Offender’s Subjective Case


	
	In addition to tendering Dr Jurek’s report the offender gave brief evidence in her case.
	
	
	In her evidence the offender disavowed some things she said about her crime to her partner’s father and to police, but otherwise acknowledged the correctness of the contents of Exhibit A, the Statement of Facts. She also asserted that the account she had given to Dr Jurek of her life was truthful.
	
	
	As to her crime, the offender said that she was sorry for what she had done.
	
	
	She was not cross-examined.
	
	
	The offender was born on 3 April 1970 and is now aged 46 years. To Dr Jurek she described a childhood marked by physical and emotional abuse and neglect, with inattentive parents and frequent changes in her accommodation and schooling.
	
	
	The offender’s education was much disrupted, and she left school at 14 years of age. She trained in nursing and apparently worked as an Assistant Nurse until she was aged 24, when she left work to have a child. In later years she worked briefly and intermittently in unskilled positions. At the time of Mr Beverstock’s murder the offender was not employed, receiving a disability pension.
	


Other Considerations Relevant to Sentence


	
	The offender’s disordered mental state is relevant in other ways to the question of sentence, principally as to whether she is a suitable vehicle for the application of the principle of general deterrence. In the circumstances of this case, where the offender’s disordered thinking had some, albeit minimal, role to play, general deterrence has a lesser role to play in the determination of sentence. The diminution must be relatively slight however, because of the conclusions I have reached as to the limited role her condition had in the commission of the crime.
	
	
	There remains a need for general deterrence to figure in the sentence imposed on the offender, if to a lesser degree than would otherwise be the case.
	
	
	There is also a need for the sentence to reflect the requirement of specific deterrence, although not to any great extent. The offender had never before committed a violent crime, and the risk of the commission of a crime of a similar nature in the future must be slight. It cannot be removed completely however, in circumstances where the offender continues to use illicit drugs, on the evidence of Dr Jurek’s report, even when incarcerated, and even with some likely insight into the destructive role that drugs have played in her life, and in the crime she committed.
	
	
	The offender’s prospects of rehabilitation must be viewed with some circumspection in light of her continuing drug use. If she takes advantage of the drug and alcohol counselling services available to her within the prison system, the offender will considerably improve her prospects. Whether she does can only be a matter of speculation, informed by her continuing use of illicit drugs to date, and by her earlier failure to rehabilitate when offered that opportunity through the Drug Court.
	
	
	There is no reason to conclude that the offender’s PTSD and other disorders will lead to the offender finding a custodial environment more onerous than she otherwise would. Indeed, it appears that the offender has adjusted well to prison.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty to the offence charged against her on what would have been the second day of her trial, had it proceeded as listed on 8 August 2016. Counsel for the offender submitted that there was a significant utilitarian value in the plea, and that may be accepted insofar as it relates to the fact that it was not necessary for a trial to be heard.
	
	
	It was submitted that the offender’s instructions to the legal representatives who appeared at trial were always to plead guilty, but it is not clear when the present representatives were retained. The matter proceeded as a committal for trial and, upon arraignment before this Court on 8 April 2016, the offender entered a plea of not guilty. A trial date was fixed. The prospect of a plea of guilty was first conveyed to the Court on the day fixed for the offender’s trial, 8 August 2016.
	
	
	It would appear that the offender hoped to prevail upon the Crown to proceed on a less serious charge, and accept a plea to manslaughter, but whatever the motivation behind the delay in entering the plea of guilty to the indictment, there was delay. The utilitarian value to the criminal justice system consequent upon the late entry of the plea was in obviating the need to conduct the trial. That benefit is appropriately acknowledged by a reduction of ten per cent in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, rounded up in favour of the offender.
	
	
	There is evidence of remorse, which I accept. The offender told Dr Jurek that she deeply regretted what had happened to Mr Beverstock and, to the Court, she said that she was “incredibly sorry” for what she had done (T6:18 on 7 October 2016). She said that thinking of her crime sickened her. The plea itself is some evidence of the remorse the offender feels.
	
	
	It was submitted on the offender’s behalf that the Court should make a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There is evidence that would allow such a finding to be made, being the mental disorders from which the offender suffers, and her ongoing need for drug rehabilitation. However, the fact that there is a basis for making such a finding does not mandate that it be made.
	
	
	The practical point of making a finding pursuant to s 44(2) is to vary the ordinary ratio of sentence by reducing the non-parole period, to allow for an extended period of supervision on parole. Certainly, the offender would benefit from the support and supervision that will be available to her as a consequence of a parole order, particularly having regard to her psychiatric condition, her long-term drug addiction, and her estrangement from family and other persons in the community who might support her upon release from prison.
	
	
	Her sentence for murder will necessarily be a lengthy one, and the parole period that would ordinarily apply as a consequence of statute will also be a relatively lengthy one. I am not persuaded that the offender requires a parole period which is greater than that which will apply in the usual course. The period that will apply as a consequence of the ordinary ratio should be adequate to assist her to maintain such rehabilitation as she may achieve in custody, and to reintegrate into the community. I therefore decline to make a finding of special circumstances.
	


Sentence


	
	Having been convicted of the murder of Mark Beverstock, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 22 years and 6 months. That sentence comprises a non-parole period of 16 years and 10 months commencing on 28 October 2014 and expiring on 27 August 2031, with a balance of term of 5 years and 8 months, expiring on 27 April 2037.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) the offender is advised of the existence of the Act and its application to her for this offence.

2770817,R v Adams (No 4) [2016] NSWSC 1446,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Objection has been taken to a large number of paragraphs in voir dire exhibits J and K, which constitute the proposed evidence of Mr Ross Adams. I have already delivered a short ex tempore ruling earlier today explaining why I regard all of that evidence as relevant and admissible, subject to the Crown Prosecutor having made clear that certain evidence will only be relied on for limited purposes.
	
	
	Subsequently, further objection was taken by defence counsel on the basis that the proposed evidence is credibility evidence, as defined by statute, and accordingly is inadmissible in evidence-in-chief.
	
	
	It is certainly the case that, in accordance with s 102 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), evidence that is credibility evidence (as defined) is inadmissible. There are exceptions to that, but, as ss 103 and 106 of the Evidence Act demonstrate, those exceptions are founded upon cross-examination.
	
	
	The thrust of the Evidence Act, I accept, is that a calling party is not permitted to bolster the credibility of its own witness, in conformity with the “common law” rules of evidence that existed until 1995.
	
	
	So much may be accepted. But I respectfully do not accept that the objection is well-founded in the main. That is because I do not accept that any of the foreshadowed evidence, with one exception, falls within the definition of credibility evidence to be found within s 101A of the Evidence Act, which is as follows:
	


101A Credibility evidence

Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that:

(a) is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or

(b) is relevant:

(i) because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and

(ii) for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.


	
	In particular, I do not accept that much of the foreshadowed evidence is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of Mr Ross Adams, or because it is relevant only for that purpose and for some other prohibited purpose.
	
	
	In other words, it is true that the evidence is relevant to the credibility of Mr Ross Adams. But I by no means consider that much of it is relevant only to that question.
	
	
	To my mind, the evidence is also relevant to the whole factual matrix of how the two men lived; the relationship between the accused and the witness and others; the behaviour of the accused towards the witness; their drinking habits; their living arrangements; places of residence; and daily habits generally. And all of that, of course, is far closer in time to the disappearance of the deceased in 1983 than now in late 2016.
	
	
	It needs also to be borne in mind that the Crown case is a circumstantial one alleging murder, founded upon inferences, including, of course, inferences said to be able to be drawn from an alleged tendency of the accused.
	
	
	Quite apart from those rather general ways in which I consider the evidence to be relevant to the Crown case, in particular I consider that the entirety of the relationship between the two men; their living arrangements; their contact over the years; their use of alcohol; things said to each other over the years, and the way they were said, is all directly relevant to what assessment I am to make of the alleged conversation between the two of them about the death of the deceased, foreshadowed at para 12 of voir dire exhibit K. And I include in that the alleged use of force by the accused against the witness when the latter spoke of moving out, some months after the alleged conversation, as foreshadowed at para 7 of voir dire exhibit K.
	
	
	I should make it clear that, contrary to the submissions of the learned Crown Prosecutor, I do not admit any of the evidence that is objected to on the basis that it shows a tendency on the part of the accused to be violent, or to change suddenly from being pleasant to being aggressive or antagonistic. That is because no notice has been given of that proposition, and there has been no argument about its admissibility as a result.
	
	
	Nor do I admit the evidence as shedding light on the character of the accused, it having been made clear by defence counsel that the character of his client will not be raised in this trial.
	
	
	Rather, I consider that the entirety of the relationship between the two men is relevant to how I am to understand the alleged conversation between them, and its alleged aftermath when the witness spoke of departure. I also consider that much of it is relevant to the circumstances and way of life of the accused many years ago.
	
	
	In summary then, almost all of the paragraphs objected to in voir dire exhibits J and K do not, to my mind, fall within the definition of credibility evidence. That is because they are not relevant only to the credibility of Mr Ross Adams, or relevant only to his credibility and for a prohibited purpose. Rather, they are relevant to many other matters in the trial beyond the credibility of that witness, the foremost of which is the meaning, in context, of the conversation alleged to have taken place about the death of the deceased, and the alleged act of violence towards the witness a few months later.
	
	
	Accordingly, with one exception, I reject the objection based on s 102 of the Evidence Act because, in a nutshell, the evidence does not fall within the definition of credibility evidence contained in s 101A of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	That exception is the reference to the writing by the witness of the letter, since destroyed, contained at para 36 of voir dire exhibit J and para 19 of voir dire exhibit K. I say that because I consider that the writing of the letter and its contents is relevant only to the credibility of the witness, in the sense of why the witness may have delayed speaking to police or spoken to them incompletely in his first statement. In examination-in-chief, I consider that the whole of those two paragraphs is not to be admitted. As necessary, the question of the admissibility of those two paragraphs may be re-agitated, pursuant to s 39 and s 108 of the Evidence Act, by the learned Crown Prosecutor after cross-examination is completed.

		14 October 2016",2016-10-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2770819,Cross v R [2016] NSWCCA 214,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Garling J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and proposed orders.
	
	
	GARLING J: On 29 April 2016, Mr Benjamin James Cross, the applicant, filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal in respect of a sentence imposed on him in the District Court (King SC DCJ) on 20 March 2015.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to a single offence of influencing a witness contrary to s 323(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (“the subject offence”). The offence consisted of the applicant conducting himself in a manner which was intended to persuade a prosecution witness to give false evidence, withhold true evidence and not attend as a witness pursuant to a subpoena, with the intention of procuring his acquittal on two serious indictable offences of reckless wounding and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	An offence against s 323(a) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. As the offence in this case was committed with the intention of procuring an acquittal on serious indictable offences, s 324 of the Crimes Act applied, with the consequence that the applicable maximum penalty was increased to 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On 20 March 2015, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a non‑parole period of 3 years commencing on 13 April 2015 and expiring on 12 April 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years, expiring on 12 April 2020.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was to commence on a date after the sentence was announced because, on 3 February 2015, the applicant was sentenced in the Lismore Local Court by Heilpern LCM for an offence of reckless wounding and an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (“the primary offences”). For each of those offences, the applicant was sentenced to a non‑parole period of 18 months, with a balance of term of 6 months. Those sentences, ordered to be served wholly concurrently, were backdated to commence on 13 April 2014.
	
	
	Accordingly, the sentence imposed in the District Court for the offence the subject of this appeal was accumulated on the sentence for the primary offences by 12 months.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	In his Notice, the applicant relied upon two grounds of appeal, namely that:
	



	
	the sentencing Judge erred in allowing an extraneous or irrelevant matter to guide or affect him, namely, the telephone calls the applicant made to Ms Toni Carroll that she did not answer; and
	
	
	the sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the applicant’s case.
	


Facts


	
	A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge. A brief summary of these facts is set out below.
	
	
	The victim, Ms Carroll, was aged about 19 at the time of the primary offences. The applicant was then aged 32. They were in a relationship, and living together in a caravan in West Ballina.
	
	
	The relationship was a violent one. An Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (“ADVO”) was made on 14 November 2013 for a period of 12 months to protect Ms Carroll.
	
	
	On 12 and 13 April 2014, while the ADVO was in place, the applicant assaulted Ms Carroll at their caravan. A report was made to the police. As a result, the applicant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and reckless wounding. He was charged with other related matters as well. Those other charges are of no present relevance.
	
	
	As a consequence of being charged with the primary offences, the applicant was refused bail, taken into custody and held on remand. The matter was set down for a defended hearing at the Ballina Local Court on 30 May 2014. Ms Carroll, the victim, was the principal prosecution witness in those proceedings.
	
	
	Between 6 May and 27 May 2014, the applicant, using the telephone at Grafton Correctional Facility where he was first held, and then at Cessnock Correctional Facility, called Ms Carroll on her mobile telephone. In accordance with the usual practice, those telephone calls were recorded by Corrective Services.
	
	
	The Statement of Facts included the following paragraph, which was in essence a summary of the detail in the balance of the statement. It read:
	


“Between 6 May and 27 May 2014, the offender called the victim from jail more than 100 times, however many of these calls were not answered. In a number of them, the offender either advised the victim to withdraw her statement, or alternatively to give false evidence in the proceedings, or otherwise not attend as a witness at the hearing. On several occasions, the offender would refer to the victim using the false name of ‘Kate’, instead of the victim’s real name (Toni), in order avoid detection by Corrective Services.”


	
	The Statement of Facts then went on to include the actual words used in a number of the phone calls.
	
	
	The sequence of phone calls commenced with a phone call between the applicant and a male friend. In that phone call, the applicant recounted to his friend that, having spoken to his lawyers, it had become apparent to him that if Ms Carroll “… turns around and … changes her story sort of in court and that, they’ll let me out …” and “… you know … there’s not much to sort of back it up, like if she turns around and says ‘nah, you know, I had psychotic episode and that’s what happened … and the police just pressured me into saying, making a statement, well then I’ll be let out on that day”.
	
	
	This conversation set the scene for the phone calls which followed between the applicant and Ms Carroll. The first of these was on 6 May 2014. In that conversation the applicant suggested to Ms Carroll that she ought to tell the Court that she had a “psychotic episode”.
	
	
	Two days later, on 8 May 2014, the applicant again rang Ms Carroll pretending that he was talking to “Kate”. During this conversation, the applicant said: “I was, I was talking to a few people and that, and apparently if Toni doesn’t turn up at court, it gets thrown out”. He went on to say: “And because she’s in another State, they can’t do anything”. He further said: “Yeah, either that or she can sign a statutory declaration saying that she doesn’t want to testify against me because it will be detrimental to our relationship”. There was further conversation about how Ms Carroll could avoid giving evidence.
	
	
	According to the Statement of Facts, the applicant tried to call Ms Carroll 10 times between 8 May and 10 May 2014. She did not answer those calls. He then telephoned his friend, Mr Weston, and asked him to speak with Ms Carroll because she was not answering her telephone.
	
	
	On 10 May 2014, the applicant phoned Ms Carroll again. Ms Carroll answered the telephone. The call was described in this way in the Statement of Facts:
	


“During the conversation, the victim told the offender she was going to have to go to court because the police won’t give back their laptop and phone until after court. The offender said ‘If you wanna, what happens if you go to court, you know what I mean, if thingo goes to court and gets on the stand and says ‘I don’t remember making that statement, I was under influence of drugs and alcohol at the time’ it’ll then, we’re sweet’. The victim replied ‘Mmmm’. The offender then said: ‘Yeah, I just really want to get out’. The victim said: ‘I think she knows that’. The offender said: ‘Who?’ Victim: ‘Toni’.”


	
	On 15 May 2014, the applicant rang Ms Carroll and informed her that he had received the brief of evidence. Ms Carroll told him she did not know if she could help this time, and that she had to go to Court. The applicant responded: “So, you’re gonna fuck me”. He then said: “Like, if you just tell them, tell them that you were drinking, you know and with your, with your medication that you’re on, it doesn’t go down well with it, and you just had a psychotic episode”. Further conversation took place about their past relationship. At the end of the call, Ms Carroll told the applicant that she would do what he asked of her, but that she was “moving on”. She told him that when he got out of jail, he needed to get a job and start his life again.
	
	
	According to the Statement of Facts, the applicant continued to call Ms Carroll on a daily basis.
	
	
	A week before the hearing, in a telephone conversation on 23 May 2014, the applicant told Ms Carroll that he thought the police were “playing her” and that she would not get the laptop back even if she did attend court for the hearing. He then told her he had been thinking about the fact that he was going to lose another two years of his son’s life, and that he would not see his grandparents before they died. This was a reference by him to the consequence of remaining in custody if convicted of the primary offences.
	
	
	On the following day, a further telephone call occurred which had similar features. During that conversation, the applicant told Ms Carroll that he was going to spend two years “rotting in a cage”, that he would not get to see his son grow up, that he was going to lose $25,000 on the course he was enrolled in, that he would lose his laptop, and that his physical and mental health had gone downhill. Following this, Ms Carroll replied “Alright, here’s what I’m gonna say, OK. I’m gonna go to that court, and I’m going to tell the truth, and if the truth scares you then I’m sorry, but I’m gonna tell the truth, not for you, not for the Court, but for myself, alright”.
	
	
	Later the same day, the applicant rang again. Ms Carroll asked him to stop ringing her. The call was terminated. Less than 20 minutes later, the applicant telephoned again. He said: “Fucking hell. How can’t you get it through your head that fucking that doing 2 years is not the fucking best thing”. The applicant continued to call Ms Carroll on a number of occasions on and following that day. These calls contained a mixture of pleas and promises. In one call, the applicant promised to reward Ms Carroll by way of a house and a dog and weekends going horse-riding and fishing if she did not go to Court and give evidence against him.
	
	
	Ms Carroll attended Court as required on 30 May 2014. The facts of the telephone calls were made known to the police and, as a consequence, the proceedings were adjourned. Ultimately, the applicant pleaded guilty to the two primary offences and was sentenced by the Local Court on 3 February 2015.
	


Proceedings on Sentence


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty in the Lismore Local Court to the subject offence and, on 16 December 2014, was committed for sentence to the District Court.
	
	
	In the District Court, the proceedings on sentence took place on 20 March 2015. The applicant was arraigned and pleaded guilty. The Crown tendered a bundle of documents including a Statement of Agreed Facts, which I have summarised above, the applicant’s criminal history, Heilpern LCM’s Remarks on Sentence in the Lismore Local Court when dealing with the primary offences, and a pre-sentence report dated 27 January 2015 that had been prepared for the purpose of the Local Court sentence.
	
	
	The applicant did not place any material before the Court in the proceedings on sentence, nor did he give any evidence.
	
	
	Both the lawyers appearing for the applicant and the Crown made relatively short oral submissions and referred the Court to previous cases of relevance on sentence.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	His Honour delivered his Remarks on Sentence on the same day that submissions were made to him. He commenced by identifying the offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty and the applicable maximum penalty. He then noted that it was accepted by the Crown that the applicant had entered his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, and indicated that he would provide a discount of 25% on any sentence which was to be imposed on account of the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	His Honour then summarised the Agreed Facts. He noted what had occurred in the Lismore Local Court when the applicant was sentenced for the two primary offences. He also noted that, at the time of committing the present offence, the applicant was subject to three bonds imposed pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. One of those bonds had been imposed six months before the commencement of the series of conversations. His Honour also noted that the applicant was in custody because bail had been refused on the primary offences.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant appreciated that because Ms Carroll was the key witness against him in the proceedings with respect to the primary offences, if he could either induce her to be unavailable, withdraw from the prosecution, provide a false statutory declaration, or provide false evidence at Court when called, he would be able to avoid conviction on those primary offences. His Honour went on to say:
	


“He abused the privilege of being able to make telephone calls while in custody, and he abused that privilege by endeavouring to persuade the victim to assist him in one of a number of alternative ways from being convicted. He did so – clearly with the knowledge that his prison phone calls would be recorded – by pretending that the person he was speaking to was someone other than the victim. When she was non-responsive to his calls, he engaged the services of a friend to ensure that she would take his calls, although there is no evidence that the friend acted on the request.”


	
	His Honour described the effect of the calls. He found that the applicant’s plan was not a particularly sophisticated one, although it did involve an element of deception in order to avoid detection by prison authorities. His Honour then said:
	


“His conduct was persistent and continuing between 6 May and 27 May 2014. Apart from the calls which connected and were answered, he made a significant number of other calls attempting to speak to the victim, to which she did not respond, but which would have been evident to her from her mobile phone records. There is, in that sense, not only an effort at emotional blackmail but also in effect a form of harassment.”


	
	His Honour found that the applicant was clearly aware at all times that his conduct constituted a criminal offence, and that he undertook that conduct with the intention of procuring his acquittal on the primary offences. His Honour then found that the offence was in all of the circumstances “objectively serious” and that it was an offence which struck at the integrity of the system of justice. His Honour noted that a custodial sentence was normally considered appropriate for offences of this kind.
	
	
	His Honour went on to consider the subjective circumstances of the applicant. He noted that the applicant did not give evidence or put any evidence before the Court except for the Pre-Sentence Report prepared for the purposes of the sentencing proceedings in the Local Court. His Honour found that that report had limited utility in the proceedings before him because it did not address the offending behaviour for which the applicant was being sentenced. Nevertheless, his Honour noted the subjective matters which were of general import.
	
	
	His Honour noted that there was no evidence of remorse or contrition and that he did not regard the plea of guilty in all of the circumstances as being evidence of those matters, although he did make full allowance for its utilitarian value.
	
	
	His Honour turned to consider the cases to which he had been referred in submissions. He noted that each of those cases referred to offences where the maximum penalty was 7 years imprisonment, and not the maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment which applied by virtue of s 324 of the Crimes Act. There was one exception to this: Asplund v R [2014] NSWCCA 237.
	
	
	His Honour noted that, apart from the legal principles stated in those cases, he was not assisted by the individual sentences imposed in those cases because they turned on the particular circumstances involved. He noted that it was not possible to discern a pattern of sentencing from three or four such cases. His Honour noted that he was referred to statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of NSW. He noted that because of limitations on those statistics, and the small number of offences on which those statistics were based, he did not derive any assistance from them.
	
	
	His Honour then referred to the two primary offences, and the remarks of the sentencing Magistrate in the Local Court.
	
	
	His Honour went on to consider the purposes of sentencing and the particular circumstances which he found relevant. He noted that the applicant had not spent any time in custody prior to the sentence imposed in the Local Court, and that whilst he had a not insignificant number of prior offences, they did not provide much indication of matters relevant to the sentence which he was imposing.
	
	
	His Honour considered that both specific deterrence and general deterrence were important and significant matters for the Court to take into account. His Honour considered general deterrence to be a significant matter because offences such as the one with which he was dealing frequently went undetected because of the nature of the relationship between a victim and an offender.
	
	
	His Honour then considered the question of concurrency. He accepted the submission that, in light of the principle of totality, any sentence which he imposed should have regard to the sentences imposed in the Local Court for the primary offences. He said:
	


“In my view, it would be entirely inappropriate to make the sentence imposed in this matter entirely concurrent with those sentences, but noting the terms of the sentences that he is already serving and the sentence that I intend to impose in this matter, I’ll provide for some concurrency particularly as this is the first significant period of custody that the offender has had imposed on him.”


	
	His Honour then went on to indicate that he would date the sentences which he imposed to commence one year after those imposed in the Local Court.
	
	
	His Honour went on to find special circumstances, and then imposed the sentences. He made a recommendation that, when the applicant was released on parole, he be subject to supervision, counselling and treatment, particularly in respect of the use of prohibited drugs or prescribed medications. He also recommended that he receive treatment for anger management.
	
	
	His Honour then imposed the sentence to which previous reference has been made.
	
	
	It is convenient now to consider the two grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1: Irrelevant Material Considered on Sentence


	
	The applicant submitted that in determining an appropriate sentence, the sentencing Judge took into account a fact which was agreed, but which was irrelevant to the conduct which constituted the offence.
	
	
	As identified above at [15], one of the agreed facts was that the applicant called the victim from jail more than 100 times. Many of these calls were not answered.
	
	
	The conduct constituting the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty was conduct which was intended to persuade the victim to give false evidence. The offending conduct was particularised as being confined to a series of telephone conversations which actually took place with the victim. The unanswered calls were not particularised as forming any part of the alleged criminal conduct.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that having regard to the remarks of the sentencing Judge, his Honour erroneously treated the unanswered calls as forming part of the applicant’s criminal conduct for which he was to be sentenced, and thereby overstated the objective seriousness of the offending. In particular, the applicant drew attention to his Honour’s remark that the applicant’s conduct was “persistent and continuing” and that the calls constituted “an effort at emotional blackmail … [and] also an effective form of harassment”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was important to keep in mind that the Remarks on Sentence were delivered, in effect, ex tempore and that the Court has always been concerned to provide a degree of latitude to the sentencing Judge in these circumstances: Gal v R [2015] NSWCCA 242 at [38]; Cullen v R [2014] NSWCCA 162 at [35].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the remarks of the sentencing Judge, which referred to facts that were agreed, did nothing more than provide a context within which the offending conduct occurred and that the sentencing Judge had not erroneously taken that context into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence because he was simply summarising the agreed facts.
	
	
	The paragraph recording the large number of conversations appears in a portion of the Remarks on Sentence in which his Honour summarised all of the agreed facts in a thorough and careful manner. His Honour then recorded the proceedings in the Local Court for the primary offences, and he proceeded to consider other factors relevant to the applicant’s offending, including that the applicant was subject to three s 9 bonds at the time of the present offence.
	
	
	His Honour returned to consider the calls, describing the applicant’s conduct as “persistent and continuing”. That was a fair description of the applicant’s conduct, whether it included the unanswered calls or not. When considering the unanswered calls specifically, his Honour merely commented that they indicated both an effort at emotional blackmail and a form of harassment.
	
	
	His Honour did not proceed at that stage to assess the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending. No complaint is made with respect to that. All that his Honour did was make an assessment that the offence was, in all the circumstances, an “objectively serious offence”. His Honour justified that finding by reference to the applicable maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and the fact that such offences strike at the integrity of the system of justice.
	
	
	The essence of the applicant’s submission is that if one commences with the proposition that the sentence is an excessive one, and notes the sentencing Judge’s comment with respect to the unanswered calls, one can reason to the conclusion that the sentencing Judge impermissibly took that matter into account in sentencing the applicant.
	
	
	I am wholly unpersuaded by that submission. The unanswered calls were matters of context and appropriately remarked upon by his Honour. There is simply no material which would justify a conclusion that his Honour impermissibly took these matters into account in sentencing the applicant. I would not be prepared to uphold this ground.
	


Ground 2: Manifest Excess


	
	The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances.
	
	
	It is to be recalled that the sentencing Judge discounted the sentence by 25% in recognition of the utilitarian value of the applicant’s guilty plea. Allowing for that discount, the starting point of the sentence was 6 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years. The maximum sentence for the offence was 14 years. Accordingly, it can be seen that the sentencing Judge’s starting point was just below one half of the maximum sentence.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions accepted that to succeed on this ground he needed to demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Hili v The Queen; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [58]-[67]. Importantly, the applicant’s submissions accepted that there is no single correct sentence, and that it is not a matter for this Court to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because it may have exercised the sentencing discretion in a different manner to the sentencing Judge: R v Vuni [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33].
	
	
	The applicant principally seeks to argue that the sentence is manifestly excessive by reference to other decisions. The applicant accepted that, in those circumstances, the applicable principle is that identified by the High Court of Australia in Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; (2014) 253 CLR 58 at [41]:
	


“As the plurality pointed out in Hili v The Queen, in seeking consistency sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. Those other cases may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But that history does not establish that the sentences which have been imposed mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion. The history stands as a yard stick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important is the unifying principles which those sentences both reveal and reflect …”


	
	The applicant argued, by reference to two particular decisions (Asplund and R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128), other Court of Criminal Appeal decisions involving sentences for offences against s 323 of the Crimes Act (unenhanced by s 324), recent Court of Criminal Appeal decisions involving sentences for public justice offences, and Judicial Commission statistics, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The applicant drew attention to the fact that the sentence he received was the most severe sentence among those identified in the comparable cases and the Judicial Commission statistics. The applicant argued that, while this fact alone did not render his sentence manifestly excessive, it provided a sound basis to argue that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the present offence was the last in a series of offences committed against the same victim. It was designed to defeat the course of justice and, had the applicant been successful in procuring an acquittal, he might also have been able to resume his relationship with the victim.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, particularly in the context of the previous domestic violence offences, both specific and general deterrence were of particular importance in the sentence imposed by King SC DCJ.
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to the fact that, at the time of his offending, the applicant was the subject of three s 9 bonds and was in custody having been refused bail. The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge correctly took into account the seriousness of the primary offences, and that having regard to the seriousness of those offences, the sentencing Judge was entitled to impose a stern penalty on the applicant with respect to this offence because of his attempts to avoid criminal responsibility for the primary offences.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant had failed to establish that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	It is convenient to examine two of the cases principally relied upon by the applicant. The first is Burton. This case involved a series of assaults (two offences of common assault; two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm) in a domestic context. The offender, whilst detained at a correctional centre, telephoned the victim of the domestic assaults on a number of occasions over a 10 day period. Those telephone calls were recorded. In each of those phone calls the offender attempted to persuade the victim, his domestic partner, to withdraw the allegations about the assaults, and to give evidence that her original complaints to the police were false. These facts are similar to those in this case. The underlying offences were less serious.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge (Murrell SC DCJ) was persuaded that the offence was towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for offences against s 323(a) of the Crimes Act. In particular, her Honour found that the offence did not involve any threats of violence, and the offender was not in a position to carry out any threats of violence because he was in custody.
	
	
	The offender had a strong subjective case. He gave evidence that the offending conduct had occurred whilst he was addicted to methylamphetamine (ice). As well, the victim of the offence gave evidence as part of the offender’s case. The evidence confirmed that upon his release, she would resume cohabiting with him and that it was their intention to marry. She also accepted that his offending was drug related.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal of Appeal upheld the Crown appeal against sentence. The sentence originally imposed of a 3 year good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, was quashed and in lieu thereof the Court of Criminal Appeal sentenced the offender to imprisonment for a non‑parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 1 year.
	
	
	The second case to which attention was drawn was Asplund. The primary offence with which the offender was charged related to the possession of child pornography. The offender was also under investigation at the relevant times for offences against s 474.27(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), namely child grooming offences.
	
	
	In February 2008, a search warrant was executed in support of the investigation of the child grooming offences. The offender’s computer was seized. Upon forensic examination of the computer hard drive, the police located child pornography material. This led to the offender being charged with an offence of possessing child pornography. At the time of these events the offender lived with his 17 year old son. Soon after he was charged, the offender asked his son to help him by making a written statement in which he (the offender’s son) took the blame for many of the facts which constituted the possession of child pornography offences and the child grooming offences.
	
	
	Later, whilst awaiting trial, the offender asked his son to write a second statement. The contents of each statement were largely dictated by the offender.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal declined to grant the offender an extension of time to appeal against his sentence of 4 years with a non‑parole period of 1 year and 6 months on the basis that the offender’s grounds of appeal had no prospects of success.
	
	
	It can be readily accepted that in this particular area of offending, the facts vary from case to case. The decision of Asplund involved offending which was reasonably serious. The offender asked his son to procure two false statements and asked him to procure two other witnesses to corroborate those statements. Nothing is known about what discount, if any, was allowed for what was an apparently late plea. The plea was entered in circumstances where the charge had been almost completely heard by a jury, including the giving of evidence by, and cross-examination of, the offender’s son. The jury was discharged. At the time the second trial was due to commence, a plea of guilty was entered.
	
	
	The offender’s subjective case included the fact that he was suffering from a major depressive disorder as well as an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, he was genuinely remorseful, he had insight into the seriousness of his behaviour, he was of advanced age and he had been the subject of a successful appeal by the Crown in the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of other offences. He had no relevant past criminal history.
	
	
	The other matter to be observed about Asplund is that the grounds of appeal did not directly attack the sentence which was imposed for the offence of influencing a witness. Rather, they attacked the process of sentencing, and, based on the principle of totality, the aggregate effective sentence that was imposed with respect to both offences. There was no finding in the Court of Criminal Appeal that the sentence for the s 323(a) and s 324 offences was unduly lenient or unduly stern. The Court of Criminal Appeal did note that the offence of influencing a witness was one which “… struck at the very heart of the criminal justice system”. It also noted that there was an added dimension to the seriousness of that offence because of the effect it had on the offender’s son. The Court of Criminal Appeal was not called upon to consider whether the sentence was either manifestly excessive, or manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	It can be accepted that the decision in Burton involved facts that were reasonably similar to those involved in this application for leave to appeal. Both Burton and the present case involve offenders in custody telephoning the victim of their domestic violence offence in an attempt to discourage them from giving evidence. However, the circumstances of the offence in Burton did not attract the operation of s 324 of the Crimes Act. Consequently, the applicable maximum penalty in Burton was half of the applicable maximum penalty in this case.
	
	
	The subjective case for Mr Burton demonstrated a disturbed family upbringing, behavioural problems from the time he attended school, and a significant history of drug use which was relevant at the time of the offences. As well, there was expert evidence that the offender had a depressive illness and a propensity towards violence and anger which required treatment from an expert. The victim of the offences gave evidence for Mr Burton as part of his subjective case, and indicated that, subject to him overcoming his drug dependency, she and her children looked forward to resuming their lives together with Mr Burton. This powerful subjective case was not present in the sentence proceedings under consideration here.
	
	
	It is difficult to draw links between the circumstances of Burton and the present case. There are significant differences. The charges in the case of Burton were different and the subjective circumstances of the offender were different.
	
	
	The decision in Asplund is significantly different from the facts here. The Court was not called upon to express a view about the appropriateness of the sentence. Rather, it simply determined whether any error was demonstrated of the kind alleged. Although the offence is the same as that relied upon here, the circumstances are so different that they do not provide any guidance to assist in resolving whether the sentence imposed here was manifestly excessive or not.
	
	
	In this case, one feature which does have prominence is that, after pleading guilty to the primary offences, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months and a total period of 2 years. In contrast, after pleading guilty to the subject offence the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years and a total period of 5 years.
	
	
	Although the primary offences and the offence the subject of this appeal are distinct offences, and the sentences for them ought not to be strictly compared, it does seem surprising that the applicant would be required to serve a non-parole period for the subject offence which is double the length of the non-parole period imposed for the primary offences.
	
	
	The starting point for the sentence for the subject offence is just under half of the maximum penalty available. In circumstances where the telephone calls which were made were not accompanied by any threats of violence, whether made directly over the phone or else by a third party to the victim, and where, although little was known about the applicant subjectively, he had not previously committed an offence of this kind, there is no obvious reason why the appropriate starting point was as high as it was.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I am persuaded that the sentence imposed for the subject offence was manifestly excessive. It is difficult to point to any specific error in the Remarks on Sentence. However, I am left in the end with a strong sense that the sentence well exceeded what was reasonable in the circumstances.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am persuaded that this ground succeeds and the sentence ought be quashed.
	


Re-sentence


	
	No complaint is made with respect to special circumstances or the proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of term fixed by the sentencing Judge. No complaint is made with respect to the commencement date, and the degree of accumulation upon the earlier sentences for the two primary offences.
	
	
	The Court should proceed to re-sentence the applicant in accordance with these parameters.
	
	
	In the event that the applicant was to be re-sentenced, an affidavit sworn by him and dated 31 August 2016 was read. That affidavit established that the applicant has taken steps towards providing himself with educational qualifications and work skills. He is participating in the methadone program and is on anti-depressant medication.
	
	
	He has said that his days are “now filled with work, exercise and study”. He attributes a significant improvement in his mental health and his health generally to these activities. He has maintained his relationship with his parents. He has made enquiries about entry into various rehabilitation programs whilst in custody but will not become eligible for those until closer in time to his release on parole.
	
	
	As well, an affidavit affirmed on 30 August 2016 by the applicant’s solicitor, Ms Hill, was read. A series of notes made by the Department of Corrective Services with respect to the applicant’s behaviour whilst in custody were attached to Ms Hill’s affidavit.
	
	
	The affidavit corroborates the applicant’s evidence and proves that the applicant has diligently undertaken his studies and work tasks. In general, his attitude to work and study is commended. Some hope is expressed that the applicant will be able to proceed to tertiary studies.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that the applicant’s behaviour whilst in custody has been anything other than appropriate. This additional material does provide further support for a conclusion that the applicant has shown encouraging prospects of rehabilitation with the consequence that his prospect of reoffending has lessened.
	
	
	Nevertheless, an offence against ss 323 and 324 of the Crimes Act is a serious one. The integrity of justice is placed at risk if individuals arrogate to themselves the role of determining what evidence will or will not be given in Court, and whether that evidence will or will not be truthful in circumstances where the individual is seeking to promote their own self-interest.
	
	
	Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s subjective case, and taking into account that the applicant received a 25% discount for his early plea of guilty, I would impose a sentence of imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 18 months.
	
	
	I would fix the sentence to commence on 13 April 2015.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Sentence imposed in the District Court on 20 March 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for a non‑parole period of 2 years commencing on 13 April 2015, and expiring on 12 April 2017, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring on 12 October 2018.
	



	
	HIDDEN AJ: I agree with Garling J.

2770845,Elchiekh v R [2016] NSWCCA 225,"Judgment


	
	PRICE J: Tommous Elchiekh (“the applicant”) seeks leave to appeal, out of time, against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Parramatta by Mahony SC DCJ (“the judge”) on 8 November 2013. The applicant pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing four counts, all of which were alleged to have occurred when prohibited drugs were found by police after executing a search warrant at premises leased by the applicant at Meadowbank on 30 May 2005.
	
	
	On 7 August 2013, the applicant was arraigned before a jury. On 15 August 2013, the jury found the applicant guilty of each count being:
	



	
	Count 1: supplied 294.28 grams of methylamphetamine, an amount not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug, contrary to ss 25(2) and 29 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (“DMT Act”).
	
	
	Count 2: supplied 11.05 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (‘MDMA’) contrary to ss 25(1) and 29 DMT Act.
	
	
	Count 3: supplied 409.7 grams of ketamine contrary to ss 25(1) and 29 DMT Act.
	
	
	Count 4: supplied 1689.1 grams of cannabis leaf contrary to ss 25(1) and 29 DMT Act.
	



	
	The maximum penalty for count 1 was 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The maximum penalty for counts 2 and 3 was 15 years imprisonment, whereas the maximum penalty for count 4 was imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	The judge sentenced the applicant to an aggregate sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months commencing on 8 January 2013 and expiring on 7 January 2023. The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 7 July 2020.
	
	
	Before imposing the aggregate sentence, the judge provided the following indicative sentences:
	



	
	Count 1: 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	Count 2: 3 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months.
	
	
	Count 3: 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	Count 4: 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	



	
	The aggregate sentence was backdated by the judge in order to reflect the time that the applicant had spent in custody prior to sentence. However, the Crown said in this Court that there was an error in the calculation of pre-trial custody. The judge said that he was backdating the sentence to take account of 304 days in custody, whereas it was common ground on appeal that pre-trial custody amounted to 314 days. This arithmetical error was brought to the Court’s attention by the Crown and did not form any part of the applicant’s grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The notice of appeal identifies four grounds:
	


“Ground 1: In determining the appropriate sentence in respect of count 4, his Honour took into account the wrong maximum penalty.

Ground 2: His Honour failed to give proper consideration to the seriousness of each offence.

Ground 3: In taking into account the delay prior to the Applicant’s arrest, his Honour erred in taking into account only half of the 7 year period between the commission of the offence and the Applicant’s arrest

Ground 4: The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.”

Facts


	
	The judge determined the facts relevant to sentencing the applicant that were consistent with the verdicts of the jury. His Honour found that upon executing a search warrant at the premises leased by the applicant, the police located the following items:
	



	
	three resealable bags of methylamphetamine, totalling 294.28 grams (count 1);
	
	
	50 pale green and brown tablets, totalling 11.05 grams of MDMA (count 2);
	
	
	a plastic bag containing white powder, analysed to be 409.7 grams of ketamine (count 3);
	
	
	a plastic container and four bags of vegetable matter totalling 1689.1 grams of cannabis leaf (count 4); and
	
	
	bundles of notes in various denominations, totalling $13,590.
	



	
	During the search, police located in the applicant’s bedroom a small book with a list of names and amounts and a small resealable bag containing nine SIM cards. His Honour noted that the Crown alleged that “this indicated it was the property of someone who was supplying drugs” (ROS 3-4). Plastic bags were found in the laundry sink, two of which were found to have the applicant’s fingerprint. His Honour noted that the Crown alleged that these bags previously contained cannabis.
	
	
	The applicant was not at the premises when police arrived to execute the warrant nor at any time during the search. The judge recounted that Wayne O’Farrell, who was sharing the premises with the applicant, had been called as a witness in the Crown case. He denied any knowledge of the drugs and had returned to the premises within two or three days of the execution of the search warrant to find the lock of the front door of the unit broken and the premises open. Mr O’Farrell gave evidence that he did not call the applicant when he returned to the premises but that the applicant’s brother contacted him.
	
	
	His Honour observed that the applicant was not located despite enquiries following the search of his premises and was ultimately arrested pursuant to the execution of a police warrant on 20 June 2012. His Honour recounted that “[a]t the time of his arrest [the applicant] was given the usual caution and then said “My name is Tom Elchiekh. I feel like I’ve been in gaol for the past seven years. I just want to get these charges over and done with” (ROS 4).
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	During the proceedings on sentence, the applicant neither gave nor called evidence. In oral submissions, the applicant’s counsel referred to the applicant’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	His Honour recounted that the applicant was 38 years old and had, at the time of sentencing, been in custody for 304 days. He had no relevant criminal history, namely this was his first offending concerning drugs.
	
	
	The judge said that the applicant left school at the age of 16 and commenced work in the panel beating industry. Some years prior to his arrest he operated his own panel beating business and had significant contracts with a number of motor dealers as well as work from the public. He employed a number of people and had always been in full employment.
	
	
	His Honour noted a pre-sentence report was not tendered on sentence; however, the applicant submitted that he had used drugs recreationally in his youth but in the years prior to the offending had not used drugs at all, nor had he used them in the seven year period between the offending and his arrest.
	
	
	The judge recounted that in 2003, the applicant entered into a relationship with a woman who became his de facto partner. Together they have a son who was aged six years at the time of sentencing. They separated amicably in 2010; however, the applicant continued to support his former partner by way of payment of her rent together with a weekly amount. There were no Family Court orders in place. In 2009, his former partner was diagnosed with leukaemia and her treatment was ongoing at the time of sentencing. His Honour noted that the applicant provided support to her by having contact with his son from Monday to Friday each week and at other times to provide her with respite. It was a flexible arrangement. The applicant also provided financial support to his parents from time to time.
	
	
	Following his arrest, the applicant’s business lease had been transferred and the court was informed that his contracts had been sold.
	


Further remarks on sentence


	
	At the commencement of his Honour’s remarks, he said (ROS 1):
	


“In respect of count 1 the maximum penalty proscribed by s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, (“the Act”) is 20 years imprisonment or 3,500 penalty unit fine or both. There is a prescribed standard non-parole period of 10 years in respect of this offence. In respect of counts 2, 3 and 4 the maximum penalty proscribed by s 25 is 15 years imprisonment or 2,000 penalty unit fine or both.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	Later on in his remarks, his Honour said (ROS 10-11):
	


“In considering the appropriate sentence in respect of each of the offences, I have had regard to the maximum sentence proscribed in respect of count one of twenty five years and the standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment together with the maximum sentence prescribed in relation to s 25 subs (1), counts two, three and four of ten years imprisonment.

The maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods are guideposts which I have taken into account in considering all the circumstances of the offending.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	The judge accepted that general deterrence was an important matter to be taken into account in drug trafficking offences and that specific deterrence was relevant. His Honour said that he was persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was involved in drug trafficking for profit. In making this finding, his Honour had regard to the large sum of cash, the notebook, the resealable plastic bags and the used plastic bags that had previously contained cannabis.
	
	
	His Honour noted the applicant’s submission that he had not used drugs for some years but said that this “merely underlies his involvement in disseminating a variety of prohibited drugs into the community” (ROS 11). His Honour observed that the quantities of each drug were well below the large commercial quantities prescribed in the DMT Act and took into account that there was little evidence of repackaging the drugs for sale to end users. The judge said that it was clear that the applicant was not at or near the top of any hierarchy in the distribution of drugs. His Honour went on to say (ROS 11-12):
	


“…I find that the objective seriousness of the offending here falls below the mid-range of seriousness of offences pursuant to s 25 of the Act. However, it is not in the low range of seriousness of such offences given the quantities of drugs involved and therefore I find that it is just below the mid-range of seriousness for such offences.”


	
	On the question of delay, the judge said (ROS 11):
	


“… I am not persuaded that the whole of the period of seven years delay can be attributed to the offender secreting himself from the authorities. It was conceded that there was no evidence to establish that he knew that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. At the time of his arrest, that warrant had been outstanding for a period of five years. There was scant evidence of the attempts that the police made to find him immediately following the execution of the search warrant which led to the charges and the evidence established that he owned a property outside Sydney and travelled to his place of work regularly.

He was eventually arrested near his place of work. In those circumstances, the charges had been hanging over him for a substantial period of time which is reflected in which [sic] he said to the police upon his arrest as I have set out above.

I am therefore prepared to take into account as delay relevant to his sentence half the period of seven years that expired between the date of the offence and his arrest.”


	
	The judge declined to find special circumstances, observing that there was no evidence upon which to base a finding that the applicant required assistance in his rehabilitation back into the community.
	
	
	His Honour said that he had taken into account as a mitigating factor that the applicant did not have any significant record of previous convictions and that he did not offend during the seven year period between the offences and his arrest, together with the delay between the date of the offences and his sentencing.
	


Ground 1: In determining the appropriate sentence in respect of count 4, his Honour took into account the wrong maximum penalty

Submissions


	
	The applicant pointed to the judge’s incorrect recitation of the maximum penalty for count 4 as being imprisonment for 15 years. The maximum penalty was in fact 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the judge must have proceeded on the basis that the maximum penalty was 15 years rather than 10 years imprisonment when one considered the sentence indication given in respect of count 4, which related to a quantity only marginally above the indictable quantity and well below the commercial quantity of 25 kilograms. The applicant argued that the judge’s error pervaded his reasoning when one had regard to the facts found by his Honour and the characterisation of the applicant’s role and function.
	
	
	Whilst accepting that the judge incorrectly stated the maximum penalty at two points in his sentencing remarks, the Crown submitted that it was unclear from the indicative sentences and his Honour’s reasons whether the indicative sentences were imposed on the basis of the maximum penalty of 15 years or 10 years imprisonment. The Crown conceded that in circumstances where the Crown had erroneously stated the maximum penalty, it was appropriate for this Court to proceed on the basis that the judge had in mind that a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment was applicable when indicating a sentence for count 4.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that it was open for the Court to find that the judge’s misstatement in the maximum penalty for count 4 led to error in the indicative sentence for this count. However, the applicant’s appeal related to the aggregate sentence imposed upon him and not the judge’s error in relation to the indicative sentence. It was submitted that error in the indicative sentence for count 4 could not have affected the aggregate sentence imposed and did not vitiate the exercise of the judge’s discretion in respect of the aggregate sentence.
	


Consideration


	
	Unfortunately, during the proceedings on sentence, the judge was inadvertently misled by the Crown who informed him that the maximum sentence for counts 2, 3 and 4 was 15 years imprisonment, which was correct for counts 2 and 3 but not for count 4. The maximum penalty for this count was imprisonment for 10 years. In the passage of the sentencing remarks quoted at [18] above, his Honour referred to the maximum penalties in accordance with the information provided by the Crown. The judge correctly referred to the maximum penalty for count 1 as 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	However, before considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed for each count, his Honour incorrectly referred, in the passage of the sentencing remarks quoted at [19] above, to the maximum sentence for counts 2, 3 and 4 as being 10 years whereas the maximum penalty for counts 2 and 3 was 15 years. His Honour incorrectly referred to the maximum penalty for count 1 as 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	True it is that indicative sentences are not themselves amenable to appeal, but that does not relieve a sentencing judge from paying proper regard to the applicable maximum penalties for each offence before imposing an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	It is unclear whether his Honour had in mind the incorrect maximum sentence for count 4 or the incorrect maximum sentences for counts 2 and 3 at the time sentences for each count were indicated and the aggregate sentence imposed. The arguments advanced by the applicant and the Crown amount to no more than speculation.
	
	
	The plain fact is that the maximum penalties stated by the judge were incorrect on two occasions. In my respectful opinion, this was a material error that may have infected his Honour’s reasoning: Kentwell v R (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 at [41]-[42]; Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 per Kirby J at [60].
	
	
	It follows that Ground 1 of the appeal is established. As it will be necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, the remaining grounds may be dealt with succinctly, but the submissions made remain relevant to resentence.
	


Ground 2: His Honour failed to give proper consideration to the seriousness of each offence

Submissions


	
	The applicant’s complaint was that in assessing the objective gravity of the offences, the judge failed to distinguish between the quantities of the prohibited drugs involved in each offence and described the objective seriousness collectively as just below the mid-range. Another complaint was that the judge indicated non-parole periods for counts 2, 3 and 4 which were not standard non-parole period offences. This approach was said to be unnecessary and capable of giving rise to confusion.
	
	
	The Crown argued that the judge’s findings were within the range submitted by the applicant’s counsel during the sentencing proceedings. The submissions made on the applicant’s behalf did not ask his Honour to give separate consideration to each count. The Crown pointed out that the quantity of the prohibited drug was not the only matter when the objective seriousness of the offences came to be assessed.
	


Consideration


	
	During the proceedings on sentence, neither the Crown nor the applicant’s counsel asked the judge to assess individually the objective seriousness of the offences. The following exchange took place between his Honour and the applicant’s counsel (Tcpt, 25 October 2013, p 10(4-14)):
	


“HIS HONOUR: Where do you say the objective seriousness lies?

NEMATALLA: Well, your Honour, given the matters that I will again for the sake of just highlighting them briefly, the quantities that were found are acknowledged. Subject to your Honour’s findings as to whether or not he was trafficking in a substantial degree is a matter for your Honour but assuming that your Honour is not satisfied and approaches the indicia cautiously, your Honour would find that the material was intercepted before it got out into the community and these were not actual supplies. It would fall somewhere, if not in the mid range [sic], certainly at the top end of that range between low and mid. So in the top end of that area.”


	
	It appears that the applicant’s counsel submitted to the judge that the objective seriousness of the offences should be assessed as “fall[ing] somewhere, if not in the mid range [sic], certainly at the top end of that range between low and mid.”
	
	
	His Honour’s finding that the offences fell just below the mid-range of seriousness was in accordance with that submission: see [21] above.
	
	
	This Court has emphasised that appeals do not provide an occasion to revise or reformulate cases argued before a sentencing judge. Arguments that are raised on appeal that retract or contradict submissions made below will not be entertained unless it can be demonstrated that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [79]-[83].
	
	
	Putting aside for a moment the applicant’s position in the District Court, the applicant’s argument in this Court focused on the different quantities of the prohibited drugs in counts 2, 3 and 4. The applicant pointed out that count 2 involved an amount of ecstasy which was one eleventh of the commercial quantity for ecstasy, the ketamine involved in count 3 was approximately one third of the commercial quantity prescribed for ketamine and the cannabis involved in count 4 was only 6.7% of the commercial quantity prescribed for cannabis. The contention was that these significant differences were not recognised in the judge’s assessment of the objective gravity of the offences.
	
	
	Sentencing for drug offences is not dependent upon arithmetical calculations of how much more or less that the prohibited drug is than a particular prescribed quantity of that drug. The quantity of the drug is an important consideration which is reflected in an increase in the statutory penalty as the quantity of the drug involved comes to fall within the indictable, commercial or large commercial quantities. However, it is neither the only factor nor the most important factor in assessing the objective gravity of the offence. More important is the role of the offender and the level of his or her participation in the offence: R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34; (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 per Wood CJ (with whom Sully and Dowd JJ agreed) at [33].
	
	
	Another factor to be considered is the purity of the prohibited drug: R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; (2005) 152 A Crim R 462 at [56].
	
	
	The purity of the drugs was not an issue before the judge nor is it an issue in this Court. The applicant’s role was the subject of submissions before his Honour who found that he was not at or near the top of any hierarchy in the distribution of drugs. No criticism is made of that finding which applies to all counts.
	
	
	In any event, it is evident from the differences in the indicative sentences that whilst his Honour expressed his findings of objective gravity for all of the offences as falling just below the mid-range, he gave separate consideration to each count. This is demonstrated by the following table which is extracted from the Crown’s written submissions (CWS 9):

”


	
	In my view, the characterisation by the judge of objective seriousness for each count was reasonably open to his Honour. As counts 2, 3 and 4 were offences contrary to ss25(1) and 29 DMT Act, they did not attract a standard non-parole period. Accordingly, it was not necessary for his Honour to make a finding of where these offences lay on the hypothetical scale of objective seriousness but it was not an error that the judge did so: Nguyen v R [2011] NSWCCA 127 at [40]; Ballard v R [2011] NSWCCA 193 at [30].
	
	
	There has not been a miscarriage of justice arising from the submissions made by the applicant’s counsel before the judge.
	
	
	Ground 2 is not made good.
	


Ground 3: In taking into account the delay prior to the applicant’s arrest, his Honour erred in taking into account only half of the seven year period between the commission of the offence and the applicant’s arrest

Submissions


	
	The applicant argued that the judge erred in holding that only half of the period of seven years that expired between the date of the offence and his arrest should be taken into account on the issue of delay. The applicant complained that neither the facts nor evidence gave rise to any hiatus which could have led to a distinction between the anxiety experienced by the applicant during the first and second half of the period of time. At the very least, by failing to explain why only half of the period of time ought to be taken into account, the judge was said to have erred. The applicant disagreed with what was contended to be the judge’s view that the applicant had secluded himself.
	
	
	A further submission was that the fact that he had not been charged with any other offences during the seven year period was an important matter relevant to the assessment of his rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that there was no “bright line” point in time by which the judge could differentiate the delay attributable to the applicant. However, it was submitted that in referring to half of seven years, the judge was not making a temporal distinction but rather conveying a finding that there was to be a partial attribution of responsibility for the delay by the judge to the applicant. The Crown argued that the applicant was clearly aware that the authorities sought to arrest him in respect of his connection with the drugs found in the search warrant in 2007 because of his statement to police at the time of his arrest. The Crown submitted that an attribution of partial responsibility for the delay was open to the judge.
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence before the judge was that the prohibited drugs were found by police on the applicant’s premises on 30 May 2005. The applicant was not present at the time and a warrant for his arrest was issued some two years later. It was accepted that the Crown did not have available to it evidence that the applicant was aware of an outstanding warrant for his arrest.
	
	
	His Honour’s findings of fact on sentence included the applicant’s brother contacting Mr O’Farrell, and that the applicant was not located despite subsequent enquiries by police and was ultimately arrested pursuant to a warrant on 20 June 2012. The judge accepted that at the time of the arrest, the applicant said, “My name is Tom Elchiekh. I feel like I’ve been in gaol for the past seven years. I just want to get these charges over and done with”: see [11] above.
	
	
	It appears that the evidence did not disclose a reason for the delay of some two years in the issue of the warrant for the applicant’s arrest after the drugs were found. The applicant was arrested just over seven years after the commission of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint is that the judge erred in treating half of this seven year period as a mitigating factor.
	
	
	Delay may be taken into account in favour of an offender: firstly, when it relates to the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly, when there is demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, because sentencing for a stale crime calls for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 (“Todd”); R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 at [16]. Where delay is relied upon as a mitigating factor, the onus is upon the offender on the balance of probabilities: Sabra v R [2015] NSWCCA 38 at [47].
	
	
	As the applicant neither called nor gave evidence during the sentencing proceedings, the evidence of uncertain suspense was confined to his statement to police upon arrest. It was open to the judge to conclude from this statement that the applicant had been aware for the past seven years that police had found prohibited drugs on his premises and had chosen to remain silent.
	
	
	It is well settled that the Todd principle does not apply to a state of suspense or uncertainty experienced by an offender who remains silent and hopes that his offending will remain undetected: R v Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368 at [43]; R v Shorten [2005] NSWCCA 106 at [19]; R v Spiers [2008] NSWCCA 107 at [37]-[38]. It makes little sense that an offender who could bring to an end any anxiety by contacting police but chooses to say or do nothing can benefit from inaction by a reduction in sentence. In R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130, McColl JA (with whom Levine and Hidden JJ agreed) said at [33]:
	


“Rather, the applicant was content to remain silent, hoping, presumably, that his association with the October 2001 offence would not be detected. Having remained silent, he now argues that he ought, in effect, be rewarded for his successful concealment of his commission of the offence by a substantially reduced or even deferred sentence. The authorities make plain that the significance of the delay will turn on the circumstances of each case. In my view the circumstances of this case do not attract the Todd principle.”


	
	However, the judge said that he was not persuaded that the whole of the period of seven years delay could be attributed to the applicant secreting himself from the authorities: see [22] above. In these circumstances, it was open to his Honour to attribute equal responsibility for the delay between the police and the applicant. His Honour did not err in taking into account as a mitigating factor the applicant’s state of suspense during half the period of seven years.
	
	
	Furthermore, his Honour expressly took into account in mitigation the applicant’s lack of offending during the seven year period between the offences and his arrest.
	
	
	Ground 3 is not made good.
	


Ground 4: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive


	
	It is unnecessary to decide this ground of appeal.
	


Re-sentence?


	
	In an affidavit affirmed on 10 April 2016, the applicant seeks to explain the delay in seeking leave to appeal. During oral submissions, the applicant’s Queen’s Counsel advanced further reasons which I consider are unnecessary to examine.
	
	
	As I have found error in respect of Ground 1, I propose that leave to appeal out of time be granted. The function of this Court is then to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. The applicant does not have to establish that the aggregate sentence imposed by the judge was manifestly excessive in order for the Court to exercise its discretion in his favour under s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to ss 25(2) and 29 DMT Act (count 1) is 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. These two legislative guideposts are to be borne in mind when the appropriate penalty is considered, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the applicant. The maximum penalty for counts 2 and 3 is 15 years imprisonment, whereas the maximum penalty for count 4 is 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the variety and quantity of the prohibited drugs found in the applicant’s premises, together with the small book and cash totalling $13,590, disclose that the applicant was not a small time supplier whilst, as the judge found, he was not at or near the top of any hierarchy in the distribution of drugs. This was serious offending motivated by the desire for profit as he had not been a drug user for some years. The characterisation by his Honour that the objective seriousness of count 1 was just below the mid-range of seriousness was appropriate.
	
	
	Consistent with his plea of not guilty, the applicant has not shown any remorse for his offending. His sentence is not to be increased for that; however, no allowance can be made for remorse.
	
	
	The applicant does not have a relevant record of prior convictions, which entitles him to a measure of leniency. The intervening period of seven years between the commission of the offences and arrest without further offending supports a finding that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I take into account as a matter in mitigation the uncertainty experienced by the applicant because of delay in accordance with the judge’s findings of fact.
	
	
	General deterrence remains an important consideration to discourage others who might be prepared to engage in drug supply. As his Honour said, specific deterrence is also a relevant consideration.
	
	
	In considering the imposition of an aggregate sentence, I have assessed individually the criminality in each offence and have had regard to the requirements of Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57.
	
	
	Giving weight to all relevant factors, and in the exercise of my independent discretion, I am satisfied that the aggregate sentence imposed by the judge is the appropriate sentence. I conclude that no lesser sentence was warranted in law or should have been passed.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal out of time granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	
	
	In accordance with the agreement between the parties that the sentence should be backdated by a further 10 days, the applicant’s sentence imposed by Mahony SC DCJ on 8 November 2013 is to be adjusted as follows: the non-parole period of 7 years 6 months is to commence on 29 December 2012 and to expire on 28 June 2020 and the balance of term of 2 years 6 months is to commence on 29 June 2020 and to expire on 28 December 2022.
	



	
	The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 28 June 2020.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Price J.

		19 October 2016",2016-10-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2770864,R v Gerard Loreto [2016] NSWDC 252,"Judgment


	
	Mr Gerard Loreto has pleaded guilty to two charges, being:-
	



	
	Possess child abuse material, relating to 17 videos and 146 still images of child abuse; and
	
	
	Dissemination of child abuse material, relating to four videos.
	



	
	Both of these charges were brought pursuant to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), [1]  carrying a maximum penalty in each case of ten years.
	


FACTS


	
	On 23 October 2015, police attended the offender’s home at Newtown to conduct an inspection of his residence pursuant to s 16C of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (NSW). [2]  During the inspection police asked for the offender’s phone which he subsequently unlocked. Police examined the pictures and videos on the phone and found the material the subject of the offences referred to above.
	
	
	The offender denied searching the internet for child pornography. Police then put to the offender that there were photographs of him on the phone amongst the child abuse material, at which point the offender said to police:-
	


“Okay, I’m really sorry that I lied. I have downloaded those porn [sic] to my phone.”


	
	Police conducted an analysis of the mobile phone and applied the Child Exploitation and Trafficking Scheme (CETS) scale to the images and videos located on it. The CETS scale contains six categories which refer to activities depicted in child pornography material in the following way:
	



	
	Category 1 – Nudity or sexually suggestive posing with no sexual activity;
	
	
	Category 2 – non-penetrative sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child;
	
	
	Category 3 – non-penetrative sexual activity between adult(s) and child(ren);
	
	
	Category 4 – penetrative sexual activity between children or adult(s) and child(ren);
	
	
	Category 5 – sadism, humiliation or bestiality; and
	
	
	Category 6 – animated or virtual depictions of children engaged in sexual poses or activity.
	


COUNT 1 – POSSESSION

Category 1 material


	
	The phone contained 90 images that fall within Category 1 of the CETS scale.
	


Category 2 material


	
	The offender’s phone contained six images and six videos that fall within Category 2 of the CETS scale. The videos and the duration of each clip detected on the offender’s phone which fall within Category 2 are as follows:

Category 5 material


	
	Four images were located on the offender’s phone that fall within this category. Amongst the four images was an image of a girl aged approximately six years old naked and sitting on a toilet in handcuffs with a ball gag in her mouth.
	


COUNT 2 – DISSEMINATION


	
	The offender’s phone had also revealed that he had been involved in disseminating child abuse material. The offender used an instant messaging application called “KiK Messenger.” The following exchange occurred on KiK between the offender and a male named “Brad H”:-
	


Brad H: “Sorry, wasn’t on, u wanna trade?”

Offender: “Was hoping you had a group up?”

Brad H: “Don’t anymore, but I have plenty of vids.”

Offender: “Sure.”

Brad H then sent the offender four Category 4 child abuse videos before saying: “Ur turn (sic).”

The offender then sent Brad H four Category 4 child abuse videos in return.

Brad H then sent a further three videos back to the offender.

LEGAL PRINCIPLES


	
	In R v Porte, Johnson J [3]  cited with approval the factors to be taken into account in the assessment of the objective seriousness of matters of this kind, as set out in the decision of Minehan v R [4]  stating:
	


“[94] Drawing primarily from the authorities to which I have referred, the following matters may be relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of offences involving the possession or dissemination/transmission of child pornography:

1. Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material.

2. The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed.

3. The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material.

4. The number of images or items of material – in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted.

5. In a case of possession, the offender’s purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.

6. In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted.

7. Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission.

8. The proximity of the offender’s activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence.

9. The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material.

10. Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons.

11. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children.

12. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted.

13. Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence.

[95] This list of factors is, of course, not closed. Individual cases may always produce further matters relevant to the assessment of their objective seriousness.”


	
	In R v De Leeuw, Johnson J [5]  added
	


“[70] This Court has recently made general observations concerning the sentencing of offenders for Commonwealth and New South Wales child pornography offences: R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174 at [51]-[81]. Topics covered in that judgment included:

(a) the different vices addressed in the Commonwealth access offence under s.474.19 Criminal Code (Cth) and State possession offences, such as s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): R v Porte at [55]-[56], [157];

(b) the increased maximum penalties for these offences enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament (in 2010) and the New South Wales Parliament (in 2008): R v Porte at [57]-[58];

(c) general sentencing principles concerning child pornography offences which have emerged from decisions of intermediate appellate courts throughout Australia, where emphasis has been placed upon the paramount importance of general deterrence and denunciation, and the limited weight to be given to prior good character, together with the need to consider the objective gravity of the particular offences and to keep in mind that these are not victimless crimes: R v Porte at [59]-[72];

(d) the fact that prior good character and positive personal antecedents, and a reduced or absent need for personal deterrence, are relatively commonplace amongst offenders in possession of child pornography and that significant weight is to be given to general deterrence and correspondingly less weight to matters personal to the offender: R v Porte at [126];

(e) the fact that a common feature on sentence for this class of offence is the tender of material concerning steps taken with respect to counselling and treatment in aid of rehabilitation - whilst this aspect is important, undue focus should not be placed upon it at the expense of other legitimate and important sentencing considerations including denunciation and general deterrence: R v Porte at [71]-[72];

(f) the use to be made, in an assessment of objective gravity, of the CETS scale, relevant statutory definitions and an examination by a sentencing court of sample images: R v Porte at [73]-[81], [113]-[122];

(g) the importance of attention being given to issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality when sentencing for Commonwealth and State child pornography offences: R v Porte at [96], [98]-[100], [157];

(h) the importance of ensuring reasonable proportionality between the objective circumstances of the offences and the sentences actually imposed, with the offender’s subjective circumstances not being allowed to overshadow the objective gravity of the crimes: R v Porte at [128];

(i) the need for care in avoiding the inappropriate use of an ICO for serious child pornography offences where the appropriate form of punishment should involve immediate incarceration: R v Porte at [129]-[130].”

OBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES


	
	It is not in issue that Count 1 involved the use of actual children, with some as young as three or four years of age. The majority of the material, including a number of images/videos, were in Category 1 (90 out of a total of 146 pictures and 17 videos). However, the videos by proportion fall into a more serious category, with ten videos in Category 4. I was not requested to view any of the material, but rather I relied on the agreed descriptions provided. On those facts I am unable to determine the number of children involved.
	
	
	The Crown concedes that there may be duplication amongst the images and videos, but notwithstanding this, a number of the items in the material have multiple children depicted. The Defence concedes that although the majority of the images were in Category 1, there were example of images and videos within Categories 2, 3, 4 and 5 on the CETS scale. It accepts that the videos within the other categories involved children of a young age and can be described as “depraved” to the extent to which they depicted sexual activity between children of ages ranging from three and four, and up to 14. The Defence further accepts that there was a degree of overt humiliation and degradation present in a small number of the videos.
	
	
	On Count 2, the dissemination involved one person. Nevertheless it is clear that the child abuse material was being traded with that person who had videos and had previously had a group up and was interested in trading. There is no evidence of financial profit or possession for the purpose of sale.
	
	
	Again I was not requested to view any of the material but rather, to rely on the agreed descriptions provided. The number of videos, although small, fell within Category 4 on the CETS scale. The dissemination took place on one occasion with after the offender received material in the first instance. I accept that the videos were traded in a closed and not a public forum. The Defence concedes that once the material was traded, no limits on their use could be ensured by the offender. The Crown concedes that there was no evidence that there was a risk that vulnerable persons would have had access to the material on the offender’s phone. Even so the Crown submits that the offender’s involvement appears to have been in the context where he was actively seeking to participate in a collaborative network of like-minded persons although was not in fact involved in one at the time of the offences. The Crown further concedes that there was no evidence that the offender was proximate or had direct knowledge of the actual production of the material.
	
	
	The Crown concedes that there were no aggravating factors [6]  engaged in the current offences.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that the number of photos and videos involved was at the lower end of what is possible with modern digital storage technology and there was an absence of profit motive. However it argued that the material tended towards the more serious end of the scale and its subject matter certainly could not be at the lowest end. In summary, the Crown submitted that the offence(s) were not the most serious example of its kind but nor could it be found to be at the lowest end.
	
	
	On the offender’s behalf it was submitted that Count 1 fell toward the lower end in terms of objective seriousness having regard to the comparatively low number of images and the majority of those being in Category 1 of the CETS scale. It was submitted that the Court ought not to count the criminality covered in relation to Count 2 as an aggravating feature of Count 1 as the criminality involved would be accounted for within the sentence for Count 2.
	
	
	Overall bearing in mind all the objective features of the offending, I am satisfied in both instances, the offences fall below the middle range of objective seriousness but not at the lowest end.
	


SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES


	
	The offender is aged 36. He was born in Sabah, Malaysia and is of Filipino origin. His father arrived in Australia in 1983 and his family followed. The offender started school at the age of five, and did not repeat any years at school, or have any form of remedial education and did not report any conduct problems whilst at school.
	
	
	He was interviewed by Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, by audiovisual link on 30 August 2016 for the purposes of a report which was admitted into evidence in the Defence case. The report is dated 31 August 2016.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen obtained a history of the offender that indicated that he was quiet at school, and the subject of bullying for which he saw the school counsellor. He completed schooling at the HSC level and thereafter attended a number of TAFE courses in science, information technology, administration and hospitality. He stated he was brought up in a stable family and that his upbringing and school performance was normal. Dr Nielssen opined that from his educational background, he gained that the offender was of below average intellectual performance.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen noted no history of suicidal attempts, admissions to psychiatric hospitals or treatment with psychotropic medication. He did not report any contact with mental health services in prison, including individual assessments or counselling or referrals to any sexual offenders counselling program.
	
	
	The offender did have a previous conviction under s 91H(2) of the 1900 Act, in respect of which he was imprisoned for a total term of 15 months, with a 7 month non-parole period. The sentence for that offence concluded on 1 March 2014.
	
	
	Whilst on parole in relation to the previous offence, the offender was required to report to Community Corrections once per week and attend a sex offender counselling program. However, the offender told Dr Nielssen that he was referred to see a counsellor in private practice. Dr Nielssen reports that the offender saw a psychologist on a number of occasions but could not remember her name and he could not afford to continue the sessions. Although he was apparently invited to participate in an offenders’ group at the practice, he did not do so.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed a “probable disorder of abnormal sexual interest.” However, he made this diagnosis on the basis of a limited amount of information available about the content of the material on the offender’s computers at the time of the first offence and during the most recent offence. Whilst Dr Nielssen noted that the offender denied having a specific attraction to children, he opined that:
	


“… in the absence of reliable information to confirm the presence of other sexual outlets, the material referred to in the recent offences suggest that Mr Loreto is aroused by images of children.” [7] 


	
	The offender for his part denied to Dr Nielssen that he had become addicted to pornography and stated that he was bisexual in orientation. He denied an attraction to children and stated that his collection of images were a “morbid curiosity” and was not using the images for sexual gratification. So far as his use of the KiK messaging service, he denied using it for sexual gratification or re-offending as a reaction to the limitations imposed on him by the Sex Offenders Registration to which he was subject. Needless to say these assertions were inconsistent with his conduct on the KiK messenger service in which he had expressed interest in joining a group. I accept the Crown’s contention that the fact that he had made the request was inconsistent with the kind of idle curiosity, but rather, more consistent with actively seeking out the material.
	
	
	Whilst Dr Nielssen opined that there was a “possibility of an underlying or emerging psychotic illness,” [8]  he found that the offender’s denials, absence of delusional beliefs, good performance in employment and being able to live independently prior to arrest, was not consistent with any disabling psychotic illness.
	
	
	The Crown submits that in the circumstances, the Court cannot make positive findings that the offender is (a) unlikely to reoffend, [9]  (b) has good prospects of rehabilitation [10]  or (c) is remorseful. [11]  The Crown also draws attention to the fact that the offences occurred whilst the offender was subject of registration under the 2000 Act, reflecting poorly on his likelihood of not re-offending.
	
	
	The Defence submits that the following is relevant to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation:
	


“(a) Dr Nielssen detailed what may be submitted as being a considerable work history on the part of Mr Loreto. In addition Mr Loreto has the offer of future employment upon release;  [12] 

(b) Dr Nielssen assessed Mr Loreto as having a comparatively low risk of further offending based on the Static 99R test;  [13] 

(c) Dr Nielssen noted that Mr Loreto did not report extensive counselling and was vague about the details of past counselling sessions; [14] 

(d) Dr Nielssen noted that Mr Loreto does not perceive that he as a sexual attraction to children nor a problem with being addicted to child pornography; [15] 

(e) Mr Loreto has a very limited criminal record and one prior offence of this kind.” [16] 


	
	Despite the fact that Dr Nielssen found that the offender had a comparatively low risk of further offending based on the actuarial risk assessment, Mr Loreto does not appear to accept that he has a sexual attraction to children or an addiction to pornography. His guarded response to obtaining treatment does not give me much optimism as to his prospects of rehabilitation. On this question, Dr Nielssen expressed his view as follows:
	


“Mr Loreto did not report extensive counselling and was vague in his answers about what was covered in the counselling sessions he did attend, adding to the impression of a person with limited capacity for self examination in a counselling setting. However, he appears to have a pattern of sexual interest that is often longstanding and for which long term counselling is indicated, including counselling to help him to gain awareness about the possible reasons for his interests and assistance in developing acceptable sexual outlets. His longer term prognosis would appear to depend on his engagement with a suitable counsellor after his release.” [17] 


	
	The offender has expressed no remorse and in all the circumstances I am unable to make positive findings as to the offender’s prospects of not reoffending or rehabilitation.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In line with the principles discussed above and the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the 1999 Act, in sentencing for offences of this nature I must have particular regard to the importance of general deterrence and denunciation. [18] 
	
	
	The Crown concedes that the circumstances of the material being found on the offender on the occasion subject of the earlier offence with which the offender had been dealt with was of relatively greater gravity, in that a larger volume of material was involved. The Crown properly concedes that the prior criminal record is not a matter which in itself, is aggravating, but one which disentitles the offender to a leniency that the offender might have otherwise received.
	
	
	The Defence concedes that the offender’s previous conviction for a s 91H(2) offence, increases the need for specific deterrence to be given weight in the sentence for the current offences.
	
	
	Both the Crown and the Defence accept that a sentence of full time imprisonment is required in order to address the principles I have referred to above.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court, pre-committal, in relation to both offences. Both parties submit that the offender should be entitled to receive the maximum discount. [19]  In my view, it is appropriate to do so, to the extent of a 25% discount, in line with the decisions in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [20]  and R v Borkowski. [21] 
	
	
	Both the Crown and the Defence submit and I accept that it would be appropriate to impose a degree of accumulation in relation to the sentences imposed for Counts 1 and 2, to reflect the differing elements of criminality involved in possessing and disseminating the child abuse material.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the findings I have made, I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to vary the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term, except to preserve the relationship under s 44(2) of the 1999 Act [22]  and to round off the cumulative effect of the sentences. For this purpose and to achieve partial accumulation, it is unnecessary to set a minimum term in respect of Count 2 and I decline to do so.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 23 October 2015 and it is conceded that it is appropriate to take the period that has elapsed to date into account
	


SENTENCE


	
	For the reasons discussed above, the offender is convicted on both counts, and I sentence him as follows:
	



	
	On Count 2, taking into account the plea of guilty, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 14 months commencing on 23 October 2015 and expiring on 22 December 2016; and
	
	
	On Count 1, taking into account the plea of guilty, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month commencing on 23 April 2016 and expiring on 22 May 2017, with a balance of term of 7 months expiring on 22 December 2017. This makes a total term for Count 1 of 18 months.
	



	
	Effectively the offender is to be released on parole on 23 May 2017 and thereafter serve a balance of term for Count 1 on parole until 22 December 2017.

2770866,R v MM [2016] NSWDC 251,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 10 August 2016, the Applicant, MM, came to trial on an indictment comprising five counts relating to two sets of dates. Counts one and four were allegations of sexual intercourse without consent. Counts two and five were allegations of assault and count three alleged indecent assault. Counts one to three were said to have occurred between 1 May 2008 and 31 August 2008. Counts four and five were said to have occurred on 17 December 2011.
	
	
	MM was arraigned and an opening address given on behalf of the Crown. The Crown then sought and was granted an adjournment until the following day. On 11 August 2016, the Court was advised that the Director of Public Prosecutions had determined that there be no further proceedings in relation to any of the matters. MM was then discharged and his Counsel made an application for a certificate for costs pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW). [1]  That application was adjourned until 9 September 2016 for hearing.
	
	
	At the hearing each party tendered, without objection, a bundle of primary material relied on. The Applicant’s bundle was marked Exhibit A and the Crown’s bundle was Exhibit 1.
	
	
	The parties submitted written submissions and oral submissions were heard. Thereafter I granted MM leave to file further written submissions by 16 September 2016 in respect of any argument relating to s 3(1)(b) of the 1967 Act. The Crown was given leave to respond by 23 September 2016, however it did not do so. Judgment was formally reserved.
	
	
	It is not in issue that jurisdiction to grant such a certificate has been established under s 2(1)(a) of the 1967 Act, in that the trial had commenced and the Director of Public Prosecutions had directed that there be no further proceedings. The principal dispute arose as to the appropriateness of granting a certificate.
	


Legal principles


	
	Section s 3(1) of the 1967 Act provides as follows:-
	


3 Form of certificate

(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:

(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and

(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.


	
	The term “relevant facts” is defined in s 3A(1) of the 1967 Act as follows:-
	


3A Evidence of further relevant facts may be adduced 

(1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3 (1) (a) to

""all the relevant facts"" is a reference to:

(a) the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and

(b) any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and

(c) any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:

(i) relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and

(ii) were not adduced in the proceedings.


	
	In Kamali & Ors v R, [2]  R A Hulme J detailed what facts constituted “relevant facts” for the purposes of the section, stating:-
	


“[7] As may be seen, the definition of ""relevant facts"" in s 3A is limited: while categorising different types of relevant facts, it does not expand upon what makes a fact ""relevant"". In Chalal v DPP [2008] NSWCA 152; (2008) 185 A Crim R 580, Ipp JA (Giles JA agreeing) found at [29] that the necessary construction of ""relevant facts"" was ""facts relevant to the reasonableness of the institution of the criminal proceedings."" Three types of relevant facts may be considered:

(1)The first are those relevant facts ""established in the proceedings"": s 3A(1)(a). Basten JA, giving separate judgment in Chalal, took ""proceedings"" to have the same meaning as it has in s 2(1) (at [62]). That is, the criminal proceedings instituted by the Crown and concluded by the discharge or acquittal of the applicants. I am not bound by his Honour's reasoning, but the construction is logical and I can find no other authority on point. An implication is that this category includes material established at committal and on the voir dire.

(2)The second are relevant facts established by the defendant, in conjunction with the making of the CCC Act application, to the satisfaction of the Court: s 3A(1)(b).

(3)The third type of relevant facts are those established by the Crown which ""relate to evidence"" in the possession of the Crown at the time the decision to institute proceedings was made and which were not adduced in the proceedings: s 3A(1)(c). These facts may include, for example, credibility evidence that supports primary evidence to be adduced at trial and may influence a decision to institute proceedings, but is not itself admissible. (For the purposes of the application, the institution of proceedings means the date of arrest or charge: Mordaunt [36(c)].)”


	
	A similar view was taken by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Pavy. [3] 
	
	
	MM draws attention to statements in R v Manley. [4]  There the case involved a conflict in testimony by medical witnesses. Simpson J noted, that when fully analysed, it would not have been reasonable to institute proceedings. [5]  In that same case, Wood CJ at CL stated:-
	


“[17] It was submitted by the Crown that, in determining whether it was or was not reasonable for the DPP to institute the proceedings, it was proper to take into account matters of public policy such as the necessity to ensure that justice is seen to be done in serious cases of criminality, and the necessity to secure public confidence in the justice system and in the Courts, and also to have regard to the prevalence of the offence being prosecuted and the degree of public concern in relation to it. In my view such considerations are irrelevant to the evaluation, by the hypothetical prosecutor of the evidence, the knowledge of which is imputed to the prosecution.

[18] The independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the presence in office of a Director responsible for the institution of criminal proceedings in the interests of the State, must be preserved. Neither is threatened by a construction of the provision which directs attention to the evidence of the relevant facts in an individual case. It would be unacceptable to impose some qualification upon the Section designed to encourage prosecutions in order to satisfy some ill defined community interest in bringing a particular accused, or kind of matter, before the Courts. Indeed, to do so may only serve to threaten the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.”


	
	Once the test in s 3(1)(a) is satisfied attention is then turned to s 3(1)(b). In this regard in R v Johnston, [6]  Simpson J (with Wood CJ at CL agreeing) stated:-
	


“[18] … In practical terms, s 3(1)(b) will be primarily directed to omissions, for example cases in which defence material has been, for tactical or strategic or other reasons, withheld from the prosecution; but it is also wide enough to encompass positive acts such as the (probably more unusual) case where the defence has deliberately in some way misled the prosecution. By the inclusion of the evaluation of reasonableness in this respect the legislature has recognised that tactical considerations and decisions are legitimate in the defence of criminal charges, and has recognised the potential value to an accused person of retaining the element of surprise in the confrontation of prosecution witnesses, or the presentation of the defence case. It is not in every case where defence evidence has been deliberately withheld from the prosecution that a court will consider that the omission to supply the material to the prosecution was not reasonable in the circumstances.”

Facts


	
	As the trial before me did not proceed into evidence, there were no established facts at the hearing. Nevertheless most of the primary facts were not disputed and rested on an account given by the complainant, KM.
	
	
	On the tendered material, it is not in issue that KM, made a statement to Police on 21 December 2011 [7]  regarding an alleged sexual assault by MM on 17 December 2011. This was asserted to have taken place at KM’s home where she resided with her two children [8]  and two adult friends.
	
	
	According to the statement, KM and MM had returned home after attending a rodeo that evening, where they both had consumed alcohol. MM helped KM remove her moon boot and asked if he could sleep on her bed – on top of the blankets. KM agreed and she went to bed. Sometime later KM awoke to find MM having penile – vaginal intercourse with her as she laid on her side. MM was said to be moving his penis in and out of KM’s vagina and his hand was around her throat. KM struck MM and he then grunted, rolled away and said: “Slut.” KM rolled herself up in her blanket, and cried before falling asleep. She stated that her vagina hurt and she had a sore neck where MM grabbed hold. The next morning the KM claims MM asked her “How did you sleep?” KM replied “How do you think I fucking slept?” and MM replied “Fuck you, you fucking cranky cunt.” [9]  KM then made a complaint to her housemate that: “MM raped me.” The housemate suggested that the Police be called, but this was declined. [10]  MM was then driven to a hotel by the housemate.
	
	
	On the evening of 19 December 2011 a number of text messages were exchanged between KM and MM. KM’s statement records these as follow:
	


“23 After this telephone conversation I received a number of text messages from [MM]. I knew that it was [MM] because on my telephone his telephone number of {REDACTED} is recorded in my telephone under the name of [MM] I replied to these texts messages [sic].

24 I text a reply of ‘No UR jusr sayin did u forget thst I forgave u for wat u done to me I bleed the next day u arsehole im a mess from iy.’

25 [MM] text ‘I’m so sorry I don’t know what got into me I haven’t even been thinking about sex.’

26 [MM] sent another text message ‘ I don’t know wat it is but its like I loose control of my self when im around you again im sorry I had such a great night just like me to fuck things up.’

27 [MM] sent another text message Can I ask why didn’t you stop me the other night.

28 I text back to him ‘I tried u had ur hsnd aroind my throat.’

29 [MM] sent another text message back ‘I can’t believe I would do that to someone I love so much I feel like some sort of monster no wonder you cant have me back in your life.’

30 I text back ‘Can u bring ur swag over Chrissy’

31 [MM] sent a text back saying ‘Why cant I sleep in {REDACTED} room.’

32 I text back ‘If {REDACTED} isn’t there u can.’

33 [MM] text back ‘My swag was ruined by rats when it was in the shed.’

34 [MM] sent another text ‘do I say anything wen that shit happens at nigh.’

35 I text back ‘Just callin me sluts n hore n’

36 I sent another text ‘Can you get {REDACTED} to put my money in please.’

37 I sent another text message ‘Can I come get it my banks in debt.’

42 [MM] TEXT ‘Wat now’

44 I sent a further text ‘I want to get help for it bur they will take it to the cops’

45 [MM] sent a text ‘Are you alone ill ring you’

46 [MM] sent a further text ‘Is it ok if I ring.’

47 I sent a text ‘I don’t want to talk to u how r u gunns fix it’

48 [MM] sent a text ‘I will in see someone with you if you want’

49 I sent a text Y would thst be something I want

50 [MM] sent a message ‘I don’t know just thought id ask’

51 [MM] sent a message ‘I don’t know watt else to do or say I love you and I cant believe that happened again go so sorry”  [11] 


	
	On 20 December 2011, KM asked her housemate to call the police for her. Police attended and KM made a statement the following day. The housemate also made a statement in support of KM’s complaint. [12] 
	
	
	There were other civilian statements asserting a varying level of intoxication by MM on the night of the rodeo. These were from the housemate’s partner, who also resided at the house; [13]  KM’s younger brother, and the younger brother’s partner who had been at the rodeo. [14] 
	
	
	On 22 December 2011, MM was arrested. He was taken to the police station, where he said to the Custody Manager Inspector Lynch:-
	


“Yeah, I need to contact a Solicitor, this is bullshit mate, I did nothing wrong. She set me up.” [15] 


	
	MM subsequently participated in an ERISP. [16]  MM relied generally on his right to silence, but was at one point, asked a question and responded as follows:
	


“Q62 OK. And it’s further alleged that she has attempted to elbow you, and kick you out of the way whilst you were doing that. And that, upon her doing that, you’ve grunted and rolled over and called her a slut. OK? Further to that - - -

A If any of this did happen, there were two other grown adults in the house. If she‘d have made, said anything, or made any noise, someone would’ve known.”


	
	The Crown submits that the response in the ERISP suggests that MM was denying anything happened and asserting that KM was making it up.
	
	
	MM was subsequently charged with the offences the subject of counts four and five on the indictment.
	
	
	MM was committed for trial on 5 November 2012.
	
	
	MM’s trial was first listed at Wagga Wagga District Court on 11 June 2013. It was adjourned on the application of MM having been refused legal aid.
	
	
	MM’s trial was next listed at the Wagga Wagga District Court on 3 February 2014. On that occasion the trial was adjourned on the Crown’s application, as KM was pregnant at the time. The trial was next listed for 20 October 2014 at the Wagga Wagga District Court.
	
	
	On 7 October 2014, the Defence served a notice in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), [17]  notifying in respect of the following paragraphs of s 143(1):-
	


“(b) The accused relies on the defence of sane automatism;

(c) to the extent that the material contained in the Prosecution brief goes to an intention to have sexual intercourse without consent with KM, issue is taken;

(d) the accused intends to raise points of law going to voluntariness and prior sexual relationships between the accused and the complainant.” [18] 


	
	A report from Dr Sharon Reutens, consultant neuropsychiatrist dated 22 September 2014, was provided to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions [19]  in support of the Defence. It is not in issue that Dr Reutens’ report raised the issue of sane automatism by reference to earlier incidents of similar conduct which had been reported to medical practitioners. Although Dr Reutens’ report was not contained in either of the parties’ tendered material, it is common ground that Dr Reutens reasoning as to the events of 20 December 2011 [20]  gave support to sexsomnia when the accused was asleep. [21] 
	
	
	Following this police again interviewed KM and obtained a statement dated 10 October 2014. [22]  In her account of an incident which she stated occurred in 2007 (but was ultimately charged as having occurred in 2008), KM stated that she went to sleep with MM and awoke to find him having penile – vaginal intercourse with her from behind as she laid on her side. His hand was said to be around her throat. When KM tried to move, the grip tightened to stop her moving. KM next states that she hit MM and he let go. MM is then said to have responded: “Sorry, I didn’t mean to. I am sorry,” which he kept on repeating. KM was crying and left the room and slept on the ground. The next morning, both got up and nothing was said until lunchtime, when KM asked MM, why he had done it to her (referring to the alleged rape), and he responded: “I am frustrated because you are not putting out” which came to be understood as her not giving him sex, since she found out that she was pregnant some months earlier. [23] 
	
	
	KM stated that after the incident she slept on the lounge and was too scared to sleep in the bed with MM. However after three weeks, she returned to sleep with him in the same bed, although a number of pillows were placed between them. This was so that MM was not tempted to touch her again in this way. As KM drifted off to sleep, she felt MM tugging at her pyjama pants and underwear, trying to pull them down. KM left the room and went to sleep on the lounge again. She subsequently said she told MM that he needed help.
	
	
	She went to a medical appointment with MM. MM told the doctor that he would fall asleep and KM would wake up yelling at him. She said that she told the doctor: “He was raping me, when I was asleep.” KM drove MM to other appointments and he was prescribed dexamphetamine. KM went onto say that after the birth of their daughter, their sexual relationship returned to normal with no reports of further incidents.
	
	
	Subsequent to the ODDP being in possession of the report of Dr Reutens and KM’s further statement, search warrants was executed by which further records were obtained [24]  from Cootamundra Community Health and from the Gundagai Medical Centre in respect of both MM and KM. On 16 October 2014 the Crown received further medical material under the cover of a letter from MM’s solicitors dated the same date. [25]  This included material relevant to events of 2008.
	
	
	I turn therefore to consider the records relating to 2008.
	
	
	On 4 August 2008, MM and KM attended on Dr Jodie Culbert. Her notes record the following history:-
	


“Presents with partner and initially says too embarrassed to talk about the problem.

Happy for partner to talk about problem.

She reports that 3 times in the last few months, [MM] has forced her to have sexual intercourse and been rough with her when he is apparently asleep.

On one occasion he ‘tried to strangle her.’

Says that this behaviour does not happen when their daughter is sleeping in bed with them …

has happened times x 2 when he has had a lot of alcohol to drink and once when he had not been drinking

…

Long history of sleepwalking since childhood, less since living with current partner.

As child parents had to put locks on doors as they were worried that he would get to the creek in his sleep.

Alcohol;

has increased intake of alcohol recently, under stress, remorseful about behaviour of drinking 6 - 8 beers a night.

Addit; Also reports 3 or 4 episodes where he has completely blacked out without warning and dropped to the floor x 1, passed out when driving tractor and drove it through the back wall of shed, and two other occasions? investigated.”  [26] 


	
	MM thereafter attended Cootamundra Community Health Centre on 26 August 2008, where the reasons for presentation noted:-
	


“[MM] presenting with concern re: behaviour towards ‘wife’. [KM] verifies the behaviour and states that she was unable to wake him during the events x 3.” [27] 


	
	On 26 August 2008, the Cootamundra Community Health patient notes record:-
	


“[MM] attended appt as planned. He is distressed that he has been aggressive in his sleep, unable to be woken during the event, and when finally awake, unable to remember. [KM], his wife/mother of his child and currently pregnant, collaborates this information. She tried to wake him throughout this alleged aggressive encounter. She told [MM] that he was having sex with her while he was sleeping which he couldn’t remember. [MM] is also concerned re: his ‘heavy drinking’ of alcohol.” [28] 


	
	On 24 October 2008 Dr Greg Patterson, consultant psychiatrist, noted a history as follows:-
	


“[MM] related that he experienced 3 or 4 episodes, over a 3-4 month period when, during sleep, he tried to strangle [KM] or impose sexual intercourse upon her – his defacto found him very difficult to wake, and he had no recollection of such events upon wakening. He is distressed by such episodes, and has arranged for [KM] to live apart from him at the moment. Although he had been drinking alcohol heavily before the first episode, other episodes occurred without any or minimal alcohol intake. He had been taking the prescribed medications Endone, Mobic, and Panadeine at the time, though fluoxetine was only commenced by your intern after these episodes had occurred.

More recently [MM] is perturbed by another unexplained event. He had recently ceased, then recommenced his medication – shortly thereafter on the 12th October 2008, reporting that he had only drunk 3 beers and taken his prescribed medication, he states that he experienced a three hour period that evening for which he had no recollection. Apparently he backhanded his wife, causing her nose to bleed, he rammed his father’s car with a four wheel drive and drove to Tumut.”

Later Dr Patterson opines:-

“[MM] as verified by [KM], maintains that he is not consciously aware or manufacturing his behaviour, and at first assessment, I am unable to define a clear secondary gain.” [29] 


	
	On 20 October 2014, the Crown successfully sought an adjournment of the trial and it next became listed for trial on 7 December 2015.
	
	
	The material in the ODPP’s possession in October 2014 was then forwarded to Dr Dev Banerjee, consultant sleep physician, who was retained to provide an opinion as to the defence of sane automatism and in particular, parasomnia.
	
	
	Dr Banerjee’s report was completed on 4 December 2014. [30]  Pages four and five of his report set out the material he was provided with and includes medical records from 2008. Dr Banerjee interviewed and took a history from MM, his current partner, and his parents in person. He also spoke by telephone to KM. In the report, Dr Banerjee opined as follows:-
	


“For [MM] to have his hand around [KM’s] throat, after stating to me that [KM] used to enjoy having his hand around her throat from previous sexual encounters, indicates higher cerebral functioning. This behaviour is very unusual in sexsomnia.” [31] 


	
	Subsequent to the receipt of that report the Crown determined to proceed on three further counts being Counts 1, 2 and 3 on the indictment presented on 8 August 2016.
	
	
	MM then retained Dr Peter Buchanan, whose report is dated October 2015. [32] 
	
	
	Dr Buchanan examined the role of an underlying sleep disorder in a specific violent act and referred to guidelines made by Mahowald Schenck. At pages 12 – 15, he commented on the guidelines and their application in the context of MM. He said he regarded the seven item checklist as a useful template to consider the most relevant aspects of the contentious behaviour before the Court. Specifically he noted the Applicant’s prior history of both sleepwalking and non-rapid eye moving parasomnia behaviours (NRPS) exhibited by MM over the many years. He stated that this set the scene for the occurrence of other more unusual NRPS or reliant behaviours such as sleep sex, that manifested itself in the events concerning KM, but from MM’s perspective may have occurred on an automatistic basis. He stated:
	


“I think that the case for [MM] having had a genuine background of NRPS through much of his (and including adult) life is well established by the evidence.” [33] 


	
	Dr Buchanan further noted that MM’s contextual responses when awake and informed of his alleged behaviours were consistent with that behaviour having been formed by him in an automatistic way, and his having been contrite when subsequently being informed and accepting that information as true. He noted that such responses included:
	


“… seeking professional assessment, to seek understanding and perhaps treatment for these alleged behaviours, expressing remorse, and not substantively fleeing from the scene of the event.” [34] 


	
	Dr Buchanan also noted the relevant fact of mutually agreed physical proximity on the nights in question allowing for the potential interpretation of a NRPS behaviour as being precipitated by the very proximity and inadvertent touching in sleep.
	
	
	With regard to the events in 2011, he stated that it was not possible to rule out, in the absence of toxicological data, whether alcohol intoxication influenced behaviour may have provided an explanation for the alleged acts. He noted that in relation to the events which were the subject of the 2008 offences, MM stated that he would have consumed little, if any, alcohol on the previous evening of that event, and also was not using anything other than mild analgesics for his chronic back pain at that time. [35] 
	
	
	The circumstances as to alcohol consumption was somewhat contradicted by the history contained in the 2008 medical records to be discussed later in these reasons.
	
	
	This aside, Dr Buchanan reported:-
	


“In summary, I believe that there is no absolutely conclusive way to determine retrospectively in a medical-scientific sense, the bases for [MM’s] alleged actions in 2008 (or ? 2007) and 2011 in relation to the complainant. However there are circumstantial factors outlined above that, if accepted, support the significant possibility* that [MM] had performed those actions in a state of automatism due to a medical condition, principally, that he had a profile consistent with being an ongoing sufferer from parasomnias, and was occasionally subject to the unusual variant of NRPS known as sleep sex

*I do not think that the * possibility can be meaningfully quantified.” [36] 

“In addition, imperfect memory by the protagonist(s) for events occurring months or years prior may obscure the accurate presentation of events in the contemporary scene.” [37] 


	
	On 7 December 2015, the trial was not reached and it came on for trial before me on 10 August 2016.
	
	
	The Crown interviewed KM on 8 August 2016 and their conference notes have been tendered. [38]  In the statement of 10 October 2014, KM had said that MM apologised immediately after the 2008 incident and did not ask what had happened. She said that she told her doctor that she did not think he was asleep. However, on 8 August 2016, KM had her attention drawn to the medical notes (which she had not seen before) from 2008, where she was recorded as reporting that she had trouble waking MM up and appearing to support MM’s account that he had no recollection of these events. In response, KM is recorded to have said that she was now unsure about her account of the 2008 sexual assault, and then stated:
	


“Maybe I dreamt that – ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry’

Obviously hard to wake

I still don’t believe he was asleep – the last time

Now I’m doubting myself

That is how I perceived it (as in the statement) back then

I don’t know now, I cannot remember now.” [39] 


	
	Although an account of her memory of what happened in 2008 was recorded in her 2014 statement, KM now doubted herself. She went on to say of the 2008 incident, “[MM] convinced me he was asleep” and she said what she said to doctors in 2008 because she believed him. In relation to the 2011 incident, she stated that there was nothing factually different from the 2008 incident but he had been trying to get back with her for some time. [40] 
	
	
	A telephone conference was held with Dr Banerjee on 8 August 2016. Dr Banerjee was advised that KM was unsure of the account she had provided in her 2014 statement about 2008. Dr Banerjee still considered that MM’s behaviour was more likely explained by him being drunk. He said that there were a number of steps or manoeuvres required to achieve penetration and that achieving full penetration without the victim waking up required finesse. He said unresponsiveness by MM was not uncommon in the context of alcohol consumption, as was a lack of awareness. [41] 
	
	
	On 10 August 2016, there was a further telephone conference with Dr Banerjee in which he advised that he was still of the opinion that MM was most likely awake at the time (in 2008) but was now unable to rule out the possibility of sane automatism. This was because the basis of his opinion relied upon facts which were now uncertain. In summary, Dr Banerjee stated that although he had an opinion, he had to rely on the established facts for the basis of that opinion. He said that if KM could not be sure of what happened immediately after the 2008 event, the material facts which formed the basis of his opinion were now in doubt. He acknowledged that MM’s conduct could be explained by sane automatism in 2008. He went on to say that even though alcohol was clearly present in the 2011 incident, if KM was to say that his behaviour was effectively identical in 2008 and 2011 (and bearing in mind that one of the 2008 events did not involve alcohol), this becomes important in looking at the 2011 incident and the case against sane automatism is weakened. [42] 
	
	
	It was in this context that a report was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions and a decision was made to discontinue proceedings.
	


Applicant’s submissions

Section 3(1)(a)


	
	MM submits that as at 2008, KM consistently reported that she accepted that MM had suffered from parasomnia and that these encounters were complex examples of the issues. It was noted that KM, in the Crown’s conference notes of 8 August 2016 stated that MM in 2008 would “sleep talk” and threw KM out of the bed because he thought there were snakes in the bed and sat up and said “There were snakes in the bed.”  [43]  At that time KM stated that she believed that MM was asleep.
	
	
	MM submitted that the Crown was not going to assert at trial that the evidentiary burden borne by MM had not been met. [44]  It is noted that whilst Dr Banerjee drew attention to MM’s asserted apology after the 2008 incident, KM on 8 August 2016 gave a different account.
	
	
	It was in this context that MM submitted that Dr Banerjee upon being informed about the 2008 and 2011 conduct being almost identical, it was understood that he conceded that the case against sane automatism was weakened. [45] 
	
	
	The Applicant submits that if the hypothetical prosecutor had known what the current prosecution knows, namely that sane automatism could not be disproved beyond reasonable doubt, it would not have been reasonable to institute those proceedings on MM.
	
	
	Despite the fact that KM resiled from her recollection in 2014 of what MM said to her in 2008, Dr Banerjee also relied on the description of sexual intercourse, particularly in 2011, involving MM having to re-position himself under the quilt, pull down his boxer shorts, come close to KM, pull her underwear to the side and have direct access to her vagina before penetrating it without waking her up. This together with the fact that MM had his hand around the neck of the complainant (which MM stated he did because KM used to enjoy having his hand around her throat from previous sexual encounters) was said to indicate a high cerebral functioning. [46] 
	
	
	Dr Buchanan on the other hand stated:-
	


“The medical diagnosis of sleep sex (also known as sexsomnia, sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviour) is made in the non-forensic, clinical context from an appropriate history provided by, most often, from a concerned partner who is usually then the victim of, or witness to, the (unrecognized-by-the-performer, at least initially) sexual acts of the person performing sexual behaviour in sleep; those sexual acts have been reported to include potentially the full gamut of usual human sexual behaviour ranging from sexualized groaning to full sexual intercourse. It is usually the case that sleep sex behaviours do not manifest on an every-night frequency basis, but more likely will occur in an apparently unpredictable pattern. This irregular and sometimes infrequent pattern of frequency of occurrence reflects the similar pattern manifested in other (non-sleep sex) NRPS behaviour such as sleepwalking.” [47] 


	
	Dr Buchanan also stated that:
	


“Sleep sex has no motivational aspect at the conscious level, as genuine sleep sex behaviour does not occur with the individual in full consciousness, and can instead be seen as the unhindered expression of primitive natural sexual urges.” [48] 

Section 3(1)(b)


	
	The Applicant further submitted that the assessment of reasonableness of notification as at 20 October 2014 should be viewed in the context that MM only received advice to do so at the time, and KM was aware, as at 2011, that MM was sleepwalking but did not mention it at the time of the complaint. Alternatively, it was submitted that if the Court was not in favour of the Applicant’s submission, that a certificate from at least from 20 October 2014 was sought.
	


Crown’s Submissions

Section 3(1)(a)


	
	The Crown submits that the essential issue in dispute in the matter was whether the acts of MM were voluntary and whether the Crown could prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The Crown draws particular attention to the fact that Dr Buchanan states that what is required is a carefully gleaned and consistent history stating:-
	


“Forensic Context is quite different in important respects from the clinical context and provides special challenges for medical practitioners, psychologists and others involved in the assessment of such individuals. These differentiating contextual factors include the possible lack of good faith interaction among players, the potential role of malingering by the accused party, and additional stressors associated with the legal process.


	
	The Crown acknowledges that the fact that MM genuinely would have no memory of any sexual/violent acts and was seeking treatment, was a reflection of the fact that “a person could be aware in time and space, but his faculties are skewed” by drunkenness, such that it was quite possible that he would no memory of his conduct. Dr Buchanan also stated that with specific regard to the events of 2011:-
	


“… I hold the opinion that it is not readily possible to rule out, in the absence of any relevant toxicological data, whether alcohol intoxicated-influenced behaviour may have been an alternative explanation for the alleged actions of [MM]. [49] 


	
	It is asserted that this could explain an honest assertion that MM had no recollection. It was further drawn to attention that on 4 August 2008, the medical notes recorded that “it happened on two occasions where MM had a lot of alcohol to drink, and once when he had not been drinking. There is no issue that alcohol was present in 2011. [50] 
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Dr Banerjee looked to other facts and histories given as not supporting sexsomnia. This included the number of acts required to undress and remove clothing, getting into position and achieving penetration as well as the report by the Applicant’s current partner, that MM had had sex with her four/five times while she thought he was asleep – the essential touching, and the activity being similar to when he was awake – as opposed to them being rough, “clunky” and without finesse, the real cases exhibit and the lack of primers for NRPS such as sleep deprivation or stress at the time of the 2011 offence.
	
	
	Dr Banerjee however, came to the view that without some certainty as to the material facts during and immediately following the 2008 sexual assault, the case for negating a defence of sane automatism was weakened.
	
	
	The Crown submits that ultimately the case depended upon the facts established to ground the opinions of the competing experts. It submitted that the facts established the actus reus for the offence, however the issue was what did the surrounding facts and history which grounded each of the experts’ opinions as to the possibility of parasomnia. It was noted that Dr Buchanan did not directly address the issue of MM immediately apologising in 2008 (on the account of KM in the 2014 statement) and assumed incorrectly that “[MM] returned to consciousness in both instances” the next morning, “presumably” some hours after the event. [51]  It also noted that this was not what KM’s 2014 statement indicated and it was unknown whether the opinion would have remained unchanged had that error not been made. Whatever force this submission may have is dissipated by the fact that the KM is now uncertain as to whether this in fact now occurred.
	
	
	In submitting that the test in s 3(1)(a) of the 1967 Act was not satisfied, the Crown stated that KM’s recollection of the 2008 events, six years after the events took place, was given in her 2014 statement. However, when the content of the 2008 medical notes became known to KM, she began to doubt her recollection about some crucial facts that she had asserted in 2014. This did not, it was submitted, make her a discredited witness but her uncertainty impacted upon the facts Dr Banerjee could rely upon to form his view. The Crown submitted that when faced with the possibility that KM’s recall of MM’s immediate apology was inaccurate, one of the main planks for Dr Banerjee’s opinion could not be relied upon and accordingly sexsomnia was a plausible explanation for the Applicant’s conduct. It was submitted that once that occurred, it could not be excluded as a possible explanation for the 2011 conduct given the similarity in behaviour.
	
	
	The Crown contended that it was not unreasonable to institute proceedings against MM. Whilst a hypothetical Crown is taken to be placed in the position at the time the proceedings were instituted, knowing “all of the relevant facts”, the Crown’s ability to prove voluntariness beyond reasonable doubt, relied upon KM’s evidence. The Crown submitted that these were matters of fact that would normally be determined by the tribunal of fact, and to the extent that the Director had exercised a discretion, a central foundation for the expert opinion being in doubt that did not make it unreasonable to institute proceedings.
	


Section 3(1)(b)


	
	The Crown contends that MM first raised the issue of voluntariness or sane automatism almost three years after MM was charged. It was before the third trial date, on 20 October 2014, that the Defence raised the issue and the report of Dr Sharon Reutens was provided. It was in this context that the Crown sought an adjournment to explore the issue and MM provided a further report of Dr Buchanan in October 2015.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in the chronology outlined, no history of voluntariness was raised at committal, the first trial date, or the second trial date and it was only raised just before the third trial date, without the Crown having had time to respond. It was submitted that there was no explanation as to why the issue was not raised before the third listing of the trial and the lateness in the disclosure of the Applicant’s defence in circumstances where the Defence carried the evidential burden and the Crown had to consider it, meant that it was not reasonable in the circumstances. It was argued that this delay by MM contributed significantly to the continuation of the proceedings such that the Court should decline to grant a certificate. The Crown contended that in the alternative, that any certificate should be limited to costs after October 2014.
	


Consideration


	
	The Crown is for the purposes of the assessment required by s 3(1)(a) to be placed in the position of knowing all the relevant facts within the terms of s 3A. In my view there was no uncertainty as to KM’s position as expressed in the 2008 medical records that MM was asleep at the time of the acts against her. The uncertainty arose only in relation to the assertions made for the first time in 2014 relating to the 2008 events once the contents of the 2008 medical notes were drawn to KM’s attention which was not until when the trial was listed to commence on 8 August 2016. The Crown conceded that KM’s assertion as to MM’s conduct as expressed in the 2014 statement was a “main plank” of Dr Banerjee’s opinion and it was from that point forward, undermined. When combined with KM’s acknowledgement that one of the incidents in 2008 did not involve alcohol and the 2011 incident was the same as 2008 the Crown conceded that it could not exclude sexsomnia as a plausible explanation. This was notwithstanding Dr Banerjee’s other observations as to the effects of alcohol and the actions of MM in performing intercourse.
	
	
	The text message exchange between MM and KM following the 2011 incident suggested that MM was not aware what had occurred. Specifically he asked KM “why didn’t you stop me’ and “do I say anything …” In response to a request “…how r u guns fix it”, MM replies “I will in see someone with you if you want”. In concluding the exchange MM stated “I don’t know what else to do or say I love you and I can’t believe that happened again so sorry.” In light of the contemporaneous nature of these exchanges, the Crown’s submission as to MM’s answer in the ERISP interview cannot be accepted.
	
	
	It follows that I am satisfied within the terms of s 3(1)(a) of the 1967 Act that if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings
	
	
	I accept that MM bore an evidentiary burden to raise the defence of sane automatism however in light of the aforementioned text messages that the Crown had in its possession it could not have assumed voluntariness would not become an issue. The Applicant did not identify that it intended to advance the defence of same automatism until around 7 October 2014 when the s 142 notice pursuant to the 1986 Act was served along with the report of Dr Reutens of 22 September 2014. Subsequently, the Applicant served records under cover of the letter of 16 October 2016. There is no evidence before me as to why this matter was not raised earlier although a submission was advanced that MM did not prior to then receive relevant legal advice. As mentioned earlier, one adjournment appears to be attributable to an inability to access legal aid.
	
	
	Be that as it may the police reinterviewed KM upon the receipt of Dr Reuten’s report on 10 October 2014. Having done so, three further charges were laid. The Crown received further material from MM on 16 October 2014 and followed that up by executing search warrants. The contents of that material were not brought to KM’s attention until 8 August 2016, at which stage KM had cast doubt on her earlier recollection.
	
	
	I do not consider that the terms of s 3 of the 1967 Act repose in me, discretion to issue a certificate in the limited terms suggested by the parties. Following the grant of a certificate it is by the terms of s 4(2) of the 1967 Act for the Director General (now the Secretary) to determine whether a payment is justified and the amount of costs that should be paid.
	
	
	In my view, viewed as a whole, the omission of MM to which the Crown has drawn attention was reasonable and it is appropriate in the circumstances of this case for a certificate to be issued.
	


Order


	
	Accordingly I grant a certificate pursuant to s 3 of the 1967 Act, specifying that in my opinion:
	



	
	if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and
	
	
	that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.

INTRODUCTION


	
	On 5 April 2012, on the application of the plaintiff, orders were made by McCallum J pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (“the Act”) against a number of persons. Those orders included:
	


(a) an order against the first defendant in the following terms:

Pursuant to s 39(1)(ca) of the Act, the first defendant is directed to give to the plaintiff, within 14 days of the date of service of these orders, a sworn statement setting out:

a. all of his interests in property within the meaning of the Act, worldwide, not including any asset or interest in property with a value of less than AUD $5000 as at the date of these orders; and

b. all of his liabilities, worldwide, not including any liability with a value of less than AUD $5000 as at the date of these orders.

(b) an order against the second defendant in the following terms:

Pursuant s 39(1)(ca) of the Act, the second defendant is directed to give to the plaintiff, within 14 days of the date of service of these orders, a sworn statement setting out:

a. all of his interests in property within the meaning of the Act, worldwide, not including any asset or interest in property with a value of less than AUD $5000 as at the date of these orders; and

b. all of his liabilities, worldwide, not including any liability with a value of less than AUD $5000 as at the date of these orders.

(c) an order against the fourth defendant in the following terms:

Pursuant s 39(1)(d) of the Act, the fourth defendant is directed to give to the plaintiff, within 14 days of the date of service of these orders, a sworn statement setting out all of her dealings with item of property specified at Item 10a of Schedule 1.

(d) an order against the ninth defendant in the following terms:

17 Pursuant s 39(1)(d) of the Act, the ninth defendant is directed to give to the plaintiff within 14 days of the date of service of these orders a sworn statement setting out all of her dealings with items of property specified at Items 8a, 9a, 10, 11 and 12 of Schedule 2.


	
	Before the court are notices of motion filed on behalf of each of the first, second, fourth and ninth defendants. Although each motion sets out a number of prayers for relief, the orders sought at the present time are confined to the following:
	


(i)   in respect of the first defendant:

i.   a revocation of the order:

ii.   in the alternative, a stay of the order until:

a.   the prosecution brief of evidence in relation to alleged offences has been served on the first defendant; and

b.   any prospective trial of those offences or relative offences has been heard.

(ii)   in respect of the second defendant:

i.   a revocation of the order;

ii.   in the alternative, a stay of the order until:

a.   the prosecution brief of evidence in relation to alleged offences has been served on the first defendant; and

b.   any prospective trial of those offences or relative offences has been heard.

(iii)   in respect of the fourth defendant:

i.   a revocation of the order;

ii.   in the alternative, a stay of the order until the prosecution brief of evidence in relation to the alleged offences against the first and second defendants has been served on the fourth defendant.

(iv)   in respect of the ninth defendant:

i.   a revocation of the order;

ii.   in the alternative, a stay of the order until the prosecution brief of evidence in relation to the alleged offences against the first and second defendants has been served on the ninth defendant.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	The first and fourth defendants are husband and wife respectively, as are the second and ninth defendants. Pursuant to a summons filed on 5 April 2012, a number of orders (including those which are the subject of the present applications) were made ex parte in favour of the plaintiff by McCallum J. The evidence which was before her Honour included an affidavit from an authorised officer who deposed to a suspicion that each of the first and second defendants had committed serious offences within the meaning of the Act.
	
	
	Following the making of the orders, each of the first and second defendants was charged by the plaintiff with offences pursuant to the Criminal Code (Cth) (“the Code”) alleging that:
	



	
	in contravention of s 135.4(3) of the Code, they each conspired to dishonestly cause a loss to the Australian Taxation Office (“the tax fraud offence”); and
	
	
	in contravention of ss 11.5 and 400.3(1) of the Code, they each conspired to deal with the proceeds of the tax fraud offence (“the money laundering offence”).
	



	
	The plaintiff’s allegations in respect of those charges may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	During the financial years from 2007 to 2009 each of the first and second defendants was a director of a company called Neumedix Health Australasia Pty Limited (“Neumedix”). In taxation returns lodged with the Australian Taxation Office for each of the financial years within that period, Neumedix fraudulently claimed losses in excess of $275 million in respect of the depreciation of intellectual property rights. Such rights had allegedly been previously purchased by Neumedix from various offshore companies.
	
	
	Through a complex trust arrangement, Neumedix subsequently donated those depreciation losses to other entities, and in return received what have been described as “incentive payments” in excess of $63 million. Such monies were then channelled through a series of offshore bank accounts back to Australia, where they were used for the acquisition of assets for the benefit of the first and second defendants. Importantly for present purposes, it is alleged that some of the assets so acquired are owned nominally by the fourth and ninth defendants, but are subject to the effective control of the first and second defendants respectively.
	
	
	The estimated value of the assets restrained to date is approximately $53 million and the estimated value of the funds which have been traced is approximately $34 million. There is, therefore, a substantial shortfall between the sum of $63 million allegedly obtained by the first and second defendants by reason of the commission of the tax fraud offence, and the estimated value of the assets which are presently restrained.
	


THE EVIDENCE IN THE PRESENT APPLICATIONS


	
	The first and fourth defendants relied upon an affidavit of Mark Geoffrey O’Brien sworn 18 May 2012 which was admitted without objection. Annexed to that affidavit was a copy of a statement of facts prepared on behalf of the plaintiff outlining the allegations giving rise to the charges which have now been laid.
	
	
	The second and ninth defendants relied upon the affidavit of Peter Joseph Shields sworn 8 May 2012. Objection was taken by Mr Sullivan QC to paragraphs (16) and (17) of that affidavit, and those paragraphs were not pressed.
	
	
	The plaintiff relied upon affidavits of Adam Thomas Sandon sworn 4 April 2012, and Rosanna Celona sworn 7 June 2012. The affidavit of Mr Sandon contained the evidence upon which the plaintiff originally relied before McCallum J in support of the making of the orders.
	
	
	Ms Celona is a forensic accountant and a special member of the Australian Federal Police. Since early 2007 she has been a member of the Criminal Assets Confiscation Task Force, a division which is involved in identifying, restraining and confiscating property pursuant to the Act. In that capacity, she has been directly involved in the investigation of the alleged activities of the first and second defendants.
	
	
	Ms Celona was cross-examined by Mr Wigney SC who appeared for the first and fourth defendants. The following passages from that cross examination are relevant in light of Mr Wigney’s submissions:
	


Q. May we take it that if it is the case that the first defendant, to give one example, is required to swear a statement setting out his interests in property, you are likely to be at least one of the persons who will access and consider the contents of that statement relating to his properties?

A. At this stage I would expect that, yes.

Q. And is it the case that if property is disclosed in such a sworn statement made by, for example, the first defendant that you, by which I mean the AFP, is not already aware of, that that would set in train, wouldn't it, a course of investigation to ascertain such matters as when that property was acquired, how it was acquired, and the like?

A. That is correct, I would then do a further analysis on that particular asset.

Q. You would endeavour to trace the acquisition of the interest in any such property disclosed in the statement back to the Neumedix account which received, as you believe it, the $63 million which was the product of the alleged tax fraud if I can put it in simple terms?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it also the case that since early June of 2011 you have been assisting in the investigation of the alleged offences by Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis?

A. Only on a part time basis.

Q. The case officer, that is the officer with the primary conduct of the criminal investigation, is Federal Agent Ben Wheels-Johnson (sic), is that right?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you have been assisting him as and when required, as you put it on a part time basis, in relation to the investigation of the offences alleged against Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis?

A. It is not so much in that it's more in relation to tracing of and doing the flow analysis, that part of the investigation only.

Q. But you have been assisting Federal Agent Ben Wheels-Johnson, the case officer, in relation to that aspect?

A. Yes.

Q. That is, I think you suggested, in part forensic accountancy support in relation to the criminal investigation, is that right?

A. That is correct.

Q. You have also at various stages liaised with members or officers of the Australian Tax Office in relation to the investigation have you not?

A. I have in the earlier part of late last year, or middle of last year, but I haven't in recent months.

Q. But you have also been involved in, have you not, or at least assisted in the execution of a number of search warrants relating to the criminal investigation?

A. A couple, yes.

Q. Would it be fair to say, Ms Celona, and I am not being critical of this one way or another, that you have been involved in both assisting the criminal investigation side of the matter and also the proceeds of crime aspect of the matter?

A. In relation to the tracing of the moneys, yes.

The relevant legislative provisions


	
	There are a number of provisions of the Act to which I was referred in submissions, and which bear upon the matters I am required to determine.
	
	
	The principal objects of the Act are set out in s. 5 as follows:
	


5 Principal objects

The principal objects of this Act are:

(a)    to deprive persons of the proceeds of offences, the instruments of offences, and benefits derived from offences, against the laws of the Commonwealth or the non-governing Territories; and

(b)    to deprive persons of literary proceeds derived from the commercial exploitation of their notoriety from having committed offences; and

(ba)    to deprive persons of unexplained wealth amounts that the person cannot satisfy a court were not derived from certain offences; and

(c)    to punish and deter persons from breaching laws of the Commonwealth or the non-governing Territories; and

(d)    to prevent the reinvestment of proceeds, instruments, benefits, literary proceeds and unexplained wealth amounts in further criminal activities; and

(e)    to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to trace proceeds, instruments, benefits, literary proceeds and unexplained wealth amounts; and

(f)    to give effect to Australia’s obligations under the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, and other international agreements relating to proceeds of crime; and

(g)    to provide for confiscation orders and restraining orders made in respect of offences against the laws of the States or the self-governing Territories to be enforced in the other Territories.


	
	The general structure of the Act is set out in s. 6:
	


6 General 

This Act establishes a scheme to confiscate the proceeds of crime.

It does this by:

(a)  setting out in Chapter 2 processes by which confiscation can occur; and

(b)  setting out in Chapter 3 ways in which Commonwealth law enforcement agencies can obtain information relevant to these processes; and

(c)  setting out in Chapter 4 related administrative matters.

It concludes with miscellaneous provisions and with definitions and other interpretive material.


	
	Section 7 makes specific provision for the confiscation scheme:
	


7 The confiscation scheme (Chapter 2) 

Chapter 2 sets out a number of processes relating to confiscation:

(aa)  freezing orders limiting withdrawals from accounts with financial institutions before courts decide applications for restraining orders to cover the accounts (see Part 2-1A); and

(a)  restraining orders prohibiting disposal of or dealing with property (see Part 2-1); and

(b)  forfeiture orders under which property is forfeited to the Commonwealth (see Part 2-2); and

(c)  forfeiture of property to the Commonwealth on conviction of a serious offence (see Part 2-3); and

(d)  pecuniary penalty orders requiring payment of amounts based on benefits derived from committing offences (see Part 2-4); and

(e)  literary proceeds orders requiring payment of amounts based on literary proceeds relating to offences (see Part 2-5); and

(f)  unexplained wealth orders requiring payment of unexplained wealth amounts (see Part 2-6).


	
	Section 18 makes provision for the making of restraining orders against persons, such as the first and second defendants, who are suspected of committing serious offences:
	


18 Restraining orders--people suspected of committing serious offences 

When a restraining order must be made 

(1)  A court with proceeds jurisdiction must order that:

(a)  property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person; or

(b)  property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in the order; if:

(c)  a proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

(d)  there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has committed a serious offence; and

(e)  any affidavit requirements in subsection (3) for the application have been met; and

(f)  the court is satisfied that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion or suspicions stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.

Note: A court can refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses to give an undertaking: see section 21.

Property that a restraining order may cover

(2)  …

(3)  The application for the order must be supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating:

(a)  that the authorised officer suspects that the suspect committed the offence; and

(b)  if the application is to restrain property of a person other than the suspect but not to restrain bankruptcy property of the suspect--that the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)  the property is subject to the effective control of the suspect; or

(ii)  in any case--the property is proceeds of the offence; or

(iii)  if the offence to which the order relates is a serious offence--the property is an instrument of the offence.

The affidavit must include the grounds on which the authorised officer holds those suspicions.

(4) …

(5) …

(6) …


	
	Section 39 of the Act provides (inter alia) as follows:
	


39 Ancillary Orders 

39 (1)  The court that made a restraining order, or any other court that could have made the restraining order, may make any ancillary orders that the court considers appropriate and, without limiting the generality of this, the court may make any one or more of the following orders:

…

(ca)  an order directing the suspect in relation to the restraining order to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out all of his or her interests in property, and his or her liabilities;

(d)  an order directing the owner or a previous owner of the property (including, if the owner or previous owner is a body corporate, a specified director of the body corporate) to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out particulars of, or dealings with, the property;

(da)  if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person (other than the owner or a previous owner) has information relevant to identifying, locating or quantifying the property--an order directing the person to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out particulars of, or dealings with, the property;

…


	
	In the present case, the orders against the first and second defendants were made pursuant to s. 39(1)(ca) and the orders were made against the fourth and ninth defendants pursuant to s. 39(1)(d).
	
	
	Section 39A is in the following terms:
	


39A Privilege against self-incrimination etc. does not apply 

(1)  A person is not excused from giving a sworn statement under paragraph 39(1)(ca), (d) or (da) on the grounds that to do so would tend to incriminate the person or expose the person to a penalty.

(2)  However, in the case of a natural person, a sworn statement is not admissible in civil or criminal proceedings against the person who made the statement except:

(a)  in criminal proceedings for giving false or misleading information; or

(b)  in proceedings on an application under this Act; or

(c)  in proceedings ancillary to an application under this Act; or

(d)  in proceedings for enforcement of a * confiscation order.


	
	Section 39B is in the following terms:
	


Application to revoke ancillary order

(1)  A person may apply to the court that made an ancillary order under section 39 to revoke the order if:

the person is affected by the order; and

the application for the ancillary order was heard without notice having been given under subsection 39(3) following a request under subsection 39(3A).

(2)  The application must be made within 14 days after the person was notified of the ancillary order.

(3)  The applicant must give written notice of the application, and the grounds on which the revocation is sought, to any person who was entitled to make the application for the ancillary order (see subsection 39(2)).

(4)  The effect of the ancillary order is stayed until the court determines the application.

(5)  The court may revoke the ancillary order on application under subsection (1) if it considers it appropriate to do so.

(6)  The court may have regard to any matter it considers appropriate in determining the application.

(7)  If:

(a)  the ancillary order directed a person to do a thing within a particular period; and

(b)  an application is made to revoke the order under this section;

the court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, vary the order to extend that period by a specified period.


	
	The present applications for revocation of the orders are made pursuant to s. 39A(5). Alternatively, they are made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court. However, counsel made it clear that although the application was made on these alternative bases, reliance was placed upon the same submissions. Moreover, it was not suggested that there was any difference in the relevant principles to be applied.
	
	
	Section 266A of the Act is in the following terms:
	


266A Disclosure 

(1) This section applies if a person obtains information:

APPLICATIONS BY THE FIRST AND SECOND DEFENDANTS

Initial submissions of the parties


	
	Mr Wigney SC, who appeared for the first defendant, relied upon a number of fundamental principles which he summarised as follows:
	


(i)    common law privilege against self incrimination applies equally to the requirement to produce a written statement or affidavit as it does to examinations or other oral evidence, and extends to the derivative use of such material;

(ii) I   nteracting with that common law privilege is the right of an accused person to a fair trial;

(iii)    it is inconsistent with the right of an accused person to a fair trial to be compelled to answer questions, or to be required to disclose information in a written form, if it would tend to incriminate him, or otherwise prejudice his defence or the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial. Any such requirement would constitute an improper interference with the due administration of justice in criminal proceedings, and would amount to a contempt of court;

(iv)    although privilege against self incrimination can be abrogated by Parliament, a statute will not ordinarily be construed so to authorise action that would otherwise amount to a contempt of court, i.e. that would otherwise give rise to a significant risk of interference in a criminal proceeding;

(v)    the requirement of an accused person to produce information in a written form relevant to the charges against him can be stayed, even where the statute prevents the information from being used until the trial against the accused takes place, and even when there are other safeguards, if there is nonetheless a risk, notwithstanding those safeguards, of a tendency to interfere with the course of justice in a criminal trial; and

(vi)    such a stay can be granted even though other matters of public interest are at stake.


	
	By reference to these principles, Mr Wigney submitted that if the right of a person accused of committing a criminal offence was sought to be interfered with by seeking to compel the person, under threat of criminal penalty, to give up his right to silence, such an attempt would prejudice that person’s defence to the criminal charges and would amount to an improper interference with the due administration of justice in the criminal proceedings. In support of that submission he relied upon the decision in Hammond v Commonwealth (1982) 152 CLR 188 at 198 where Gibbs CJ observed:
	


“Once it is accepted that the plaintiff will be bound, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged, it seems to me inescapably to follow, in the circumstances of this case, that there is a real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with. It is true that the examination will take place in private, and that the answers may not be used at the criminal trial. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff has been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence”.


	
	Mr Wigney submitted that the principles articulated by Gibbs CJ were not restricted to the giving of evidence, but extended to the provision of a written statement which could be used derivatively by someone else (see Reid v Howard (1995) 184 CLR at 6 –7 per Deane J).
	
	
	Mr Wigney further submitted that the orders against the first defendant gave rise to a real risk of interference with both the administration of justice, and the right of the first defendant to a fair trial. Whilst he accepted that any statement provided pursuant to the order made against the first defendant could not be directly used against him in any prosecution, he cited the potential derivative use of the statement as the source of the risk to which he referred. He submitted that in light of the plaintiff’s allegations, the disclosure by the first defendant of interests in property could result in particulars of those interests being included in the particulars of the money laundering charge. He argued that in these circumstances, the present order had the effect of compelling the first defendant to give up his right to silence by requiring him to provide a statement which included information relevant, or potentially relevant, to the charges. This, he submitted, amounted to an improper interference with the due administration of justice. He also submitted that the provision of any such statement would require the first defendant to address the central allegations made in respect of the money laundering offence or, more specifically, the allegations in relation to the interest held by the first defendant in property allegedly acquired with monies derived from the tax fraud offence. This, he submitted, would be directly relevant to the charges laid against him.
	
	
	Mr Wigney accepted that the terms of the order do not require the first defendant to deal with, or disclose, the circumstances of his acquisition of any interest in property. However he submitted that inevitably, and particularly in light of the evidence of Ms Celona, the derivative use of any statement provided pursuant to the order would necessarily set those inquiries in train.
	
	
	Mr Wigney acknowledged that the statutory scheme created by the Act was directed to the public interest in restraining property suspected of being the proceeds of crime. He also acknowledged that I was required to have regard to that scheme in the exercise of any discretion. However, he submitted that neither the statutory scheme, nor its underlying intent, should be interpreted as excusing, justifying or permitting an interference with the criminal justice system of the kind to which he had referred.
	
	
	Ms Bashir who appeared for the second defendant adopted the submissions of Mr Wigney. In addition, she took me to the decision in Environmental Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co. Pty Limited (1992) 178 CLR 477 in support of the proposition that it any abrogation of the privilege against self incrimination would require clear language on the part of the Parliament.
	
	
	Mr Sullivan QC, who appeared with Ms Cheeseman for the plaintiff, took no issue with the general principles cited by Mr Wigney. However, he submitted that it was clearly open to the Parliament to modify or abrogate common law rights, and that in the present case the Parliament had seen fit to do so by the enactment of s. 39A of the Act. He submitted that the real question for determination in the present case was whether the orders against the first and second defendant gave rise to a real risk, as opposed to a theoretical possibility, of interference of the kind asserted beyond the extent to which the Parliament had intended the balance be struck. He submitted that no real risk had been demonstrated.
	
	
	By reference to the various provisions of the Act which I have outlined, Mr Sullivan submitted that the scheme of asset confiscation created by the Act was both unique and rigorous, and was reflective of a deliberate legislative intention to ensure that wrong doers would be deprived of the fruits of their wrong doing. He submitted that the scheme was a matter to which, in the exercise of my discretion, I should have pre-eminent regard.
	
	
	In circumstances where the additional provisions which came into force by virtue of the first and second amending Acts have thus far not been the subject of any judicial consideration, Mr Sullivan took me to extrinsic materials, including relevant Explanatory Memoranda, in support of his submissions as to the underlying legislative intention. He submitted that s. 39A of the Act abrogated the right to silence by the clearest of language and thus removed any right to rely upon self incrimination in order to be excused from providing a sworn statement under s. 39(1)(ca), (d) or (da). He also submitted that the Parliament, having considered the issue, specifically excluded, by the introduction of s. 266A, any derivative use immunity in respect of such a statement.
	
	
	Mr Sullivan also relied upon the terms of the orders themselves in support of his submission that no real risk of interference had been demonstrated. He pointed out that the period of time specified in the orders did not correspond directly with the periods in which offences had allegedly been committed. He also pointed out that the terms of the orders were limited and, in particular, did not extend to imposing a requirement that either the first or the second defendant provide any information at all about (inter alia) the circumstances of the acquisition of any interest in property.
	


Supplementary submissions of the parties


	
	On 6 September 2012, during the period in which I had reserved judgment, the Court of Appeal handed down its decision in New South Wales Crime Commission v Jason Lee [2012] NSWCA 276. Those proceedings involved an appeal against a refusal to make orders, pursuant to s. 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (“the NSW Act”), for the examination of the respondents (along with a third person) concerning their affairs, at a time when the trial of one of the respondents in respect of money laundering charges was outstanding, and when both respondents had appeals pending against their convictions in respect of drug supply charges. In the course of submissions in the present matter Counsel had referred to the fact that the hearing of the appeal in Lee was to be considered by a five member bench of the Court of Appeal and that it involved issues which were not dissimilar to those in the present case. In these circumstances, I invited the parties to make such further submissions if they wished to do so in the light of the Court of Appeal’s decision.
	
	
	On behalf of the first and second defendants, it was submitted that the decision in Lee was neither binding nor determinative in relation to the applications in the present proceedings, because it involved the consideration of a different statutory regime. Accordingly, it was submitted that the decision did not compel me to refuse to exercise my discretion in favour of the revocation of the orders. It was submitted, in particular, that it remained open to me to exercise the discretion contained in s. 39B(5) in favour of the first and second defendants in circumstances where the statements which would be provided pursuant to the orders might impinge on future criminal proceedings, or where the degree of the potential interference in the system of justice was unacceptably or unreasonably high. It was submitted that nothing said by the court in Lee was to the contrary.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that unlike the position in Lee, the interference with the proceedings currently pending against the defendants was not speculative because of the overlap between the matters to be addressed in the statements which were ordered to be provided, and the allegations made by the plaintiff.
	
	
	On behalf of the plaintiff it was conceded that the decision in Lee was not directly binding upon me because it concerned the provisions of the NSW Act. However, counsel submitted that the decision was nevertheless highly relevant to the determination of the present applications. In particular, it was submitted that the decision confirmed the general approach that should be taken in exercising a discretion such as that contained in s. 39B(5), in circumstances where the legislature had weighed competing public interests and had seen fit to abrogate established common law rights.
	
	
	It was further submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that although the manner in which the issue had arisen in Lee was different in terms of procedure, there was no relevant difference in terms of the principles which should be applied, and that the Court in Lee had made it clear that when exercising a discretion of a kind contained in s. 39B I should have pre-eminent regard to the statutory expression of public purpose, and to the express interference, by the Parliament, with common law rights.
	


Consideration of the authorities


	
	As previously noted, reliance was placed by counsel for the first and second defendants on the decision of the High Court in Hammond v Commonwealth of Australia. That decision was referred to in a subsequent judgment of the High Court in Hamilton v Oades (1989) 166 CLR 486, a judgment to which I was not referred in the course of argument. In that case, the respondent had been charged with various offences arising out of his dealings with a particular company and an order was made pursuant to s. 541 of the Companies (NSW) Code requiring him to attend for examination by a Registrar of the Supreme Court of NSW. Section 541 provided (inter alia) that a person was not excused from answering a question put to him at such examination on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him. However, the section further provided that where privilege was claimed before answering the question, the answer would not be admissible in any criminal proceedings brought against the examinee, other than in respect of the falsity of the answer. Mason CJ relevantly observed (at 494):
	


“It is plain that an examination under s. 541 while charges are pending may expose the witness to the risks mentioned. To the extent only that under the section rights of an accused person are denied and protections removed, an examination may even amount to an interference with the administration of criminal justice. But is well established that Parliament is able to “interfere” with established common law protections, including the right to refuse to answer questions, the answers to which may tend to incriminate the person asked”.


	
	His Honour went on to observe (at 496):
	


“Of course the section gives no protection to the witness against the use in criminal proceedings of derivative evidence, i.e., evidence which is obtained from other sources in consequence of answers given by the witness in his examination. It would be difficult for Parliament to provide for specific protection against derivative use of such answers given by a witness. Immunity from derivative use tends to be ineffectve by reason of the problem of proving that other evidence is derivative. But in any case, by enacting s 541 without providing such specific protection, Parliament has made its legislative judgment and such action is not required and has limited specific protection to the possible consequences of direct use in evidence of the answers of the witness, thereby guarding against the possibility that the witness will convict himself out of his own mouth – the principal matter to which the privilege is directed. Thus the legislative resolution of the competition between public and private interest is to provide for a compulsory examination and to give specific protection in relation to the principal matter covered by the privilege but not otherwise, except in so far as a judge, in the exercise of a wide statutory discretion, may see fit in the particular circumstances of a case to give directions as to the matters to be inquired into.”


	
	His Honour also referred to the judgment of Windeyer J in Rees v Kratzmann (1965) 114 CLR 63 at 80:
	


“The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern today. If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law’s traditional consideration for the individual, then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy”.


	
	In Hamilton v Oades  Dawson J, having referred to both Rees v Kratzmann and Mortimer v Brown and Beames (1970) 122 CLR 493, made specific reference to the passage in Hammond to which I was taken in the course of argument (at [28] above) and observed (at 509):
	


“But that passage is preceded by the observation that the urgency of the matter then before the Court required an immediate decision and that cases such as Rees v Kratzmann, Mortimer v Brown and Mitcham v O’Toole were not discussed. Moreover, the legislation in question in Hammond v The Commonwealth was of a different kind, being concerned in general terms with executive inquiry by means of a Royal Commission or Board of Enquiry without reference to subject-matter or purpose. And the privilege against self incrimination is not under our system of law inviolable, however clearly the legislature will need to express itself before the courts will discern an intention to abrogate or even weaken such an ingrained principle of the common law. In the case of s. 541, as I have pointed out, the legislature could hardly have expressed itself more clearly”.


	
	In New South Wales Crime Commission v Hung Sun Choi [2012] NSWSC 658 (a decision handed down only a matter of days before I heard argument in the present matter) McCallum J considered an application, pursuant to the provisions of s. 31D of the NSW Act, for an order that the defendant be examined and that he provide a verified statement of property. Her Honour declined to follow the primary Judge in Lee and, having considered the decisions in Hamilton v Oades, Rees v Kratzmann and Mortimer v Brown and Beames observed (at [47]):
	


“In Mortimer the High Court held that an examinee under s. 250 of the Companies Act may not decline to answer a question on the ground that the answer may tend to incriminate him. The judgments in that case give sober recognition to the obligation of the court to construe a statute so as to give effect to the clear intention of the legislature and without sentimental regard for any incursion upon centuries of closely guarded notions of criminal justice”.


	
	Her Honour also observed (at [51] – [53]):
	


“The Criminal Assets Recovery Act is replete with unambiguous indications that Parliament intended the Commission to be able to pursue confiscation orders notwithstanding the existence of pending criminal proceedings and with the aid of powers that would infringe upon a defendant’s right to remain silent.

[52] As already noted, the objects of the Act expressly contemplate the pursuit of confiscation orders without requiring a conviction. Section 13A (set out above) clearly contemplates the conduct of an examination in circumstances in which self-incrimination may occur. There is no need to draw any inference as to Parliament's intention in that respect, as the High Court was prepared to do in Mortimer. The Act expressly abrogates the privilege and provides compensatory protection against direct use of the answers given. Whether to extend that protection to derivative use was a matter for Parliament, which it also addressed (s 13A(3)). Examination orders under s 31D are governed by those provisions (s 31D(3)) and so must also be taken to have been intended to be available in the face of pending criminal proceedings. It is also significant that the existence of criminal proceedings is not a ground on which this Court may stay proceedings under the Act: s 62.

[53] The risk of interference with the administration of justice must be assessed in that statutory context.”


	
	Her Honour went on to observe (at [54] – [55]):
	


“However, as was acknowledged by the High Court in Hamilton v Oades, the legislature can authorise the compulsory interrogation of a person facing a criminal charge about matters relevant to that charge. As unpalatable as it may be to a common lawyer, the right to resist such interrogation invoking the privilege against self-incrimination is precisely what Parliament has abrogated by the legislation. It is the duty of the court to give effect to such legislation, which informs the assessment as to what the interests of the administration of justice demand.

[55] That is not to say that the court must always accede to an application by the Commission for ancillary relief. The making of orders under s 31D is discretionary, but the discretion must be exercised having regard to the objects of the Act”.


	
	Her Honour concluded (at [57]):
	


“I have concluded, however, that it would not be appropriate to refuse to make the orders sought only on the basis that the examination would compel the defendant to answer questions relevant to the criminal proceedings against him. To do so would frustrate the clear purpose of the legislation.”


	
	The proceedings in Lee similarly involved an application pursuant to s. 31D of the NSW Act for an order that the respondents be examined. Basten JA (at [24]) identified the principle that under the general law, a court will grant an injunction to restrain an inquiry undertaken in the exercise of executive power if it carries with it a real risk that the conduct of the inquiry will interfere with the administration of justice in criminal proceedings. He observed that such interference would constitute contempt of court and, accordingly, an injunction may lie to prevent a threatened contempt. His Honour went on to observe (at [34]):
	


“Once it is accepted that the legislature may authorise a scheme of investigation and inquiry which has the potential to diminish common law protections for an accused in criminal proceedings, the question becomes one of of statutory construction: does the relevant legislation authorise such conduct and, if so, to what extent? Some assistance may be obtained in answering such questions from answers given in relation to other legislation having similar provisions, purposes or effects; however, the focus of the analysis must be the particular legislation in question ...”


	
	His Honour then proceeded to consider the provisions of s. 13A of the NSW Act, which applied to any examination so ordered, and which provided that:
	


(i)    a person being examined was not excused from answering any question or producing any document on the ground that the answer or production might incriminate, or tend to incriminate, the person;

(ii)    any answer given, or document produced, was not admissible in criminal proceedings, other than proceedings for an offence under the NSW Act or regulations; and

(iii)    further information obtained as a result of answer being given or the production of a document was not inadmissible in criminal proceedings, on (inter alia) the ground that the answer given or document produced might tend to incriminate the person.


	
	Having set out the provisions in full, his Honour observed (at [43] and [44]):
	


“Three aspects of this provision are significant. First, it expressly removes the operation of the general law principle that a person cannot be compelled to answer a question on the ground that the answer might incriminate, or tend to incriminate, the person. Secondly, it provides what is commonly described as ‘use immunity’ for the answer, so long as objection was taken at the time of answering on the ground of self-incrimination. Thirdly, there is an express rejection of what is commonly described as derivative use immunity. The legislature evidently gave consideration to the consequences of removing the immunity from self-incrimination. There was no attempt to condition the removal of the immunity upon the existence or otherwise of outstanding criminal charges. No doubt that was because the confiscation of assets did not depend on a criminal conviction and, even if charges have not been laid, they might be laid in the future. The possibility, at least, of criminal charges was recognised by the conferral of use immunity in sub-s(2).

[44] In respect of the third point, what is significant is not merely the rejection of such an immunity, but the fact that it was expressly addressed. The legislature evidently appreciated that answers given under compulsion might ""set in train a process which may lead to incrimination or may lead to the discovery of real evidence of an incriminating character"": Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centre [1982] AC 380 at 443 (Lord Wilberforce). The decision not to preclude the use of such information may have followed the reasoning of Mason CJ in Hamilton v Oades at 496 …”


	
	His Honour then concluded (at [49]):
	


“The appropriate conclusion is that the statutory purposes revealed by the Criminal Assets Recovery Act were intended to be available and proceedings to give effect to them were intended to be maintained despite the possibility of adverse consequences for criminal proceedings otherwise on foot”.


	
	In the same case Meaghar JA (at [94]) said:
	


“Where the Parliament, in furtherance of a particular public interest, has abrogated the privilege against self-incrimination, effect must be given to the statutory provisions which do so: Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49; 114 CLR 63 at 80; Mortimer v Brown [1970] HCA 4; 122 CLR 493 at 495, 499; Hamilton v Oades at 494-495, 507”.


	
	His Honour went on to say (at [99]):
	


“The position under the Act is in many respects similar to the legislative regime considered in Hamilton v Oades. Section 13A gives no specific protection to the examinee against the use in criminal proceedings of further information obtained as a result of answers given or documents produced. However, by not providing specific protection against that use (and by providing expressly that such information is ""not inadmissible""), the Parliament has made its legislative judgment that specific protection against the risk of that use is not required.”


	
	Finally his Honour observed (at [101]):
	


“The exercise of the discretion arises in a context where the Act provides for an examination to take place notwithstanding that there remain risks of adverse consequences in relation to criminal proceedings which have been commenced but not completed”.

The present case


	
	For the same reasons as those outlined by Basten JA in Lee (at [34]) the present matter necessarily involves a question of statutory construction. In Australian Crime Commission v OK (2010) 185 FCR 258 Emmett and Jacobsen JJ (at [102]) observed (by reference to the decision of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] –[ 71]:
	


“The primary object of construction of a legislative instrument is to ensure that each relevant provision will be given a meaning and effect that is consistent with the language and the purpose of all of the provisions of the instrument. That is to say, each provision must be construed by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole, on the assumption that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals. A statutory instrument should be construed in such a way as will ensure, as far as possible, that all of its provisions are useful and pertinent, none of its provisions is superfluous, void or insignificant. If there is conflict between the language of different provisions, the conflict is to be alleviated, so far as is possible, by adjusting the meaning of the competing provisions to achieve a result that will give effect to the purpose and language of the provisions, but at the same time maintain the unity or harmony of the instrument as a whole. That will sometimes require a determination of what are the leading provisions and what are subordinate provisions, such that one must give way to the other. By determining the hierarchy of the provisions, it will often be possible to give each provision a meaning that best gives effect to its purpose and language, while maintaining the unity and harmony of the scheme of the instrument”.


	
	The present orders were made against the first and second defendants, and the applications for their revocation are brought, in the context of a legislative scheme directed towards the confiscation and forfeiture of proceeds of crime. The strict nature of that scheme has been observed on more than one occasion (see for example Lee v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (2009) 70 NSWLR 581 at [16], [17] and [21]). One of its primary objects is to deprive those who offend against the laws of the Commonwealth of the proceeds of their offending. In pursuit of that object, the Parliament has specifically authorised the making of the present orders.
	
	
	The enactment of additional provisions by the first and second amending Acts has had the effect of further strengthening what was an already rigid scheme. In particular, s. 39A expresses what is, in my view, a clear and unequivocal abrogation by the Parliament of the privilege against self incrimination in respect of orders made pursuant to s. 39(1)(ca), (d) and (da). It is trite to observe that the privilege against self incrimination is a well entrenched principle of the criminal law. However what is also clear, is that such privilege can be abrogated by statute (see Environmental Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Ltd (supra) at 503). In my view, the abrogation of the privilege as it applies to a statement ordered to be provided under s. 39(1)(ca), was made clear by the enactment of s. 39A.
	
	
	Similarly, the introduction of s. 266A(7) is, in my view, a clear reflection of the fact that the Parliament specifically considered the question of the disclosure of statements provided pursuant to ss. 39(1)(ca), (d) or (da). The Parliament concluded (inter alia) that information obtained as a direct result of being given such a statement could be disclosed in certain circumstances and that further, the admissibility of any such information obtained as an indirect consequence of such disclosure would not affect its admissibility in evidence.
	
	
	Section 39B(5) of the Act gives the court power to revoke orders made under s. 39(1)(ca) if it considers it appropriate to do so. Section 39B(6) further provides that in determining any such application, the court may have regard to any matter it considers appropriate. The discretion is therefore a wide one. However, having regard to the various authorities to which I have referred, it is one which must be exercised having regard to the objects of the Act, and the scheme of asset confiscation which it creates.
	
	
	It is not enough for the first and second defendants, in support of the revocation of the orders made against them, to rely upon the fact that criminal proceedings are pending against them. To permit such reliance would fail to have regard to the provisions of s. 319. This was acknowledged by counsel for each of the first and second defendants.
	
	
	Further, the fact that derivative use can be made of a statement provided pursuant to the orders does not, of itself, justify the exercise of the discretion in favour of revocation. Such use is expressly authorised by the Act. If an applicant for revocation needed only to point to that fact in order to justify a basis for revocation of an order made under s. 39(1)(ca), one of the purposes of the Act would be frustrated and rendered largely unworkable.
	
	
	In my view, the critical question in the present case is whether, in circumstances where the Parliament has expressly authorised the making of orders which impinge upon common law rights, and has enacted particular provisions governing the disclosure of information which is provided, it has been demonstrated that if the orders are not revoked there is a real risk, as opposed to a theoretical possibility, of interference with the system of criminal justice and the rights of the first and second defendants.
	
	
	In circumstances where the Parliament, in conferring power to make the present orders, has specifically legislated to abrogate the privilege against self incrimination in a particular and relevant respect, I do not accept the submission advanced on behalf of the first and second defendants that any attempt to interfere with the rights of an accused person by seeking to compel that person to give up his or her right of silence will amount to an improper interference in the administration of justice in the criminal proceedings. That submission adopts, in a general sense, the language used in Hammond. Quite apart from the fact that there has been, as I have outlined, subsequent consideration of the decision in Hammond, the present case must be considered in the context of statutory provisions which were not applicable in Hammond, and which:
	


(a)   specifically abrogate the privilege against self incrimination in respect of the provision of the statements under s. 39(1)(ca);

(b)   permit, in certain circumstances, the disclosure of such statements;

(c)   make it clear that the admissibility in evidence of information obtained as an indirect consequence of such disclosure is not affected; and

(d)   are part of a statutory scheme which is specifically directed to an important matter of public interest, namely the confiscation of assets acquired from criminal activity.


	
	Further, I do not accept the submission that orders against the first and second defendants give rise to a real risk that by providing the statements they would be required to address the central allegations made against either of them. The terms of the orders do not extend beyond requiring each of the first and second defendants to provide a statement setting out their interests in property, and their liabilities. In particular, the orders do not require either defendant to disclose matters such as:
	


(i)   the circumstances in which any particular asset or interest was acquired;

(ii)   when it was acquired;

(iii)   how it was acquired;

(iv)   why it was acquired; or

(v)   with what proceeds it was acquired.


	
	It is, of course, the case that derivative use will be made of the statements in the manner alluded to by Ms Celona in the course of her evidence, which will set further enquiries in train. However, that issue was specifically considered by the Parliament, and s. 266A was enacted permitting that course.
	
	
	Further, I do not accept that there is a real risk of interference with the rights of the first and second defendants on the basis that material contained in the statements to be provided pursuant to the orders would be directly relevant to the charges, and would therefore be able to be used against them in a way which was prejudicial. The nature and extent of what might be disclosed is similarly not known.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, it is my view that the orders against the first and second defendants should not be revoked.
	


APPLICATIONS BY THE FOURTH AND NINTH DEFENDANTS

Submissions of the parties


	
	The principal submission made by Mr Wigney on behalf of the fourth defendant was that in light of the limited evidence concerning any dealings by her with the relevant property, the public interest in not compelling her to make a sworn statement which may be used to incriminate her spouse (the first defendant) outweighed any demonstrated reason for the order against her to remain operative. In developing that submission, Mr Wigney referred me, in particular, to the judgment of Heydon J in Australian Crime Commission v Stoddart (2012) 282 ALR 620 especially at [154]-[164].
	
	
	In that case, the spouse of a suspect had attended before an examiner of the Australian Crime Commission in response to a summons. In the course of answering questions put to her about her husband’s business activities, she claimed to be entitled to the “privilege of spousal incrimination”, which, she argued, amounted to a right not to give evidence that might incriminate her husband. The relevant legislation made no provision for any such privilege.
	
	
	Heydon J concluded (at [152]) that the common law has, for some time, recognised that a person has a privilege not to answer questions where such answers may tend to incriminate his or her spouse. However, his Honour was in dissent. French CJ and Gummow J (at [41]) concluded that it could not be said that the common law in Australia recognised the privilege which had been asserted. Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ concluded (at [233]) that the spouse was a competent witness to be examined under the legislation, was compelled by its provisions to do so, and that no privilege of the kind claimed could be raised in answer to that obligation.
	
	
	Mr Wigney also submitted that in the exercise of my discretion, I should have particular regard to what he described as the “the natural repugnance of the public at the prospect of a wife giving evidence against her husband” (see Hoskyn v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1979] AC 474, referred to by Heydon J in Stoddart at [159]). He submitted, in particular, that this consideration should be weighed against what he argued was the paucity of the evidence which was available to support the making of the order.
	
	
	In making these submissions, Mr Wigney acknowledged that the various statements made by Heydon J were made other than in the context of the scheme of the Act. He also accepted that the nature and purpose of the Act would be a relevant factor in the exercise of my discretion.
	
	
	Ms Bashir, who appeared for the ninth defendant, adopted the submissions of Mr Wigney.
	
	
	In response, Mr Sullivan firstly pointed out that the proceedings brought by the plaintiff were civil proceedings and that accordingly, a spouse was compellable having regard to s. 12 of the Evidence Act. He argued that although, in light of the provisions of s. 18 of that Act, it was open to a spouse to elect to exercise a right of silence in a criminal proceeding, such an election was not available in civil proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Sullivan submitted, in particular, that it was important for the plaintiff to be able to identify the net asset position of the first and second defendants in respect of properties which may be controlled by one of them, and to know their worth. He also submitted that when it came to seeking a forfeiture order, the Act required the plaintiff to adduce evidence over and above a reasonable belief or suspicion, and to establish that the first or second defendant effectively had control over the relevant property. He submitted that in order to be able to do that, it was both appropriate and proper that the plaintiff have, in respect of each of the fourth and ninth defendants, some detail of relevant dealings to see whether or not it was possible to make a more effective case so as to convert the reasonable suspicion into evidence of control. In advancing that submission, Mr Sullivan again relied on the scheme of asset confiscation created by the Act.
	


Consideration of the issues


	
	There are a number of important distinctions between the position of the first and second defendants on the one hand, and that of the fourth and ninth defendants on the other.
	
	
	Firstly, neither the fourth nor the ninth defendant is accused of committing any offence. As a consequence, the issue of the privilege against self incrimination, being one of the fundamental bases of the applications brought by the first and second defendants, is not applicable.
	
	
	Secondly, having regard to the views of the majority in Australian Crime Commission v Stoddart there is no common law spousal privilege which is available to be claimed by either the fourth or ninth defendant.
	
	
	Thirdly, having regard to the provisions of s. 12 of the Evidence Act a spouse is compellable in civil proceedings. That section is in the following terms:
	


Competence and compellability 

Except as otherwise provided by this Act:

(a) every person is competent to give evidence, and

(b) a person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is compellable to give that evidence.


	
	The fact that there may be limited evidence of dealings, by the fourth and/or ninth defendants, with the relevant property during the period in which criminal offences were allegedly committed does not, in my view, outweigh the public interest which underlies the Act. It was not submitted that the making of the orders was not supported by the evidence. Moreover, one of the fundamental purposes of the making of the orders against the fourth and ninth defendants is to assist in determining whether particular items of property are subject to the effective control of a person charged with criminal offences. It is not difficult to envisage a situation in which a dealing with a particular property may be relevant, notwithstanding that it occurred outside the period of alleged criminal activity.
	
	
	It was accepted by counsel for each of the fourth and ninth defendants that the nature and purpose of the Act were necessarily relevant factors to be taken into account in considering the exercise of the discretion contained in s. 39B(5). I have already made a number of observations regarding the fundamental objects of the Act and the scheme of asset confiscation which it creates. In an effort to achieve those objects, the Parliament has seen fit to enact a number of particular provisions to enable the relevant authorities to investigate whether or not persons suspected of having committed criminal offences have entered into arrangements which have the effect of concealing their ownership of property. These provisions include empowering the court to make orders requiring persons other than the owner of property to provide information. Such provisions exhibit, in my view, a clear legislative intention that enquiries and investigations into the acquisition of property not be limited to enquiries and investigations of the suspects themselves.
	
	
	In my view, for these reasons, the public interest in achieving the objects of the Act clearly outweighs what was submitted to be the “natural repugnance” at the prospect of a wife giving evidence against her husband. This is particularly so in circumstances where, having regard to s. 12 of the Evidence Act, each of the fourth and ninth defendants would be compellable to give evidence against their respective spouses in any event.
	


ORDERS


	
	I make the following orders:
	


(i)   I dismiss paragraphs (2) and (3) of the Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the first defendant.

(ii)   I dismiss paragraphs (5) and (6) of the Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the second defendant.

(iii)   I dismiss paragraph (2) of the Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the fourth defendant

(iv)   I dismiss paragraphs (2) and (3) of the Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the ninth defendant.

(v)   I order that the first, second, fourth and ninth defendants pay the plaintiff’s costs.

2770883,Li v R [2014] NSWCCA 341,"JUDGMENT

The Application


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Barr AJ
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Barr AJ
	
	
	BARR AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court. The applicant, Patrick Li, pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, 3 4 - Methylenedioxy-phenyyl -2-propanone, known as MDP2P, in an amount of 2,217.612kg, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug. Woodburne SC DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment and set a non-parole period of 12 years 3 months and a balance of term of 7 years 3 months. At the time of sentence the applicant was serving a sentence imposed in the County Court of Victoria for trafficking in a drug of dependence in a quantity not less than the commercial quantity. Her Honour set the applicant's sentence to commence on a day 2 years 3 months after the commencement of the Victorian sentence. The resulting aggregate sentence was of 21 years 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 14 years 6 months and a balance of term of 7 years 3 months.
	
	
	A co-offender, Keng Chuan Koh, was charged with the same offence. He pleaded guilty and on 10 June 2011 her Honour sentenced him to imprisonment. Her Honour set a non-parole period of 11 years 10 months and a balance of term of 4 years 8 months. Like this applicant, Koh had been convicted in Victoria of trafficking in a drug of dependence in a quantity not less than the commercial quantity and was already serving a sentence imposed in the County Court of Victoria. Her Honour ordered his sentence to commence on a day 2 years after the commencement of the Victorian sentence. As a result, Koh's aggregate sentence comprised a non-parole period of 13 years 10 months and a balance of term of 4 years 8 months. Koh applied for an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal to this Court against her Honour's sentence. If permitted, he would have relied on these grounds, namely -
	



	
	Her Honour erred in the way the applicable standard non-parole period was taken into account;
	
	
	It was not open to her Honour to assess the offence as ""slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness; and
	
	
	The sentence is manifestly excessive.
	



	
	On 14 October 2013 this Court refused Koh's application. In doing so it recorded its opinion that the grounds of appeal lacked merit.
	


The Facts


	
	The facts were agreed. They may be summarised thus -
	


On 18 December 2006 the applicant and Koh were seen by police standing next to a van which was stationary in a street in Geelong. Koh was the driver of the van and the applicant was using a sedan which was parked not far away. As the police approached them, the applicant walked away towards his car. The police spoke to Koh. The applicant made to drive away but the police directed him to stop and he did so. The applicant denied knowledge of Koh and the van. The van contained 385Kg of MDP2P. The applicant and Koh were arrested. They were in possession of mobile telephones. In the applicant's car police found a key, two further mobile telephones and a rental agreement. The applicant was interviewed. He told police where he lived and answered general questions about himself. He said that his car was rented. He could not explain how the two telephones came to be in the car. He declined to answer questions about his involvement with Koh, what he was doing or where he was going.


	
	In due course the applicant was sentenced in the County Court of Victoria to imprisonment for 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. Koh was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	In the meantime, police made investigations in Sydney. They searched the applicant's house at Padstow and found taxi driver authority cards in his name. They searched a factory unit at Castle Hill. There they found almost 400 containers, each containing about 5 litres of liquid. The containers were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic tubs. The liquid in the containers was shown by analysis to be pure MDP2P. MDP2P is not itself generally used as a drug, but is used to make MDMA, a highly marketable drug of addiction.
	
	
	The police received assistance from the manager of the factory unit. He described visits by two men. He identified papers which referred to Koh and a business name, Glory Trading. The papers bore a telephone number that matched one of the telephones found in the applicant's car at Geelong. It was agreed at the hearing that the applicant and Koh were the men who had visited the manager of the factory units.
	
	
	Police established that a shipping container had been brought to the factory unit on about 18 December 2006 and that three Asian men had unloaded cardboard boxes and put them in the unit.
	
	
	On 11 December 2006 a business name, Glory Trading, was registered at the offices of the Department of Fair Trading. The applicant and Koh were recorded on closed circuit television at that department's premises. In that way the applicant was identified retrieving the registration form. He could be seen watching Koh. The applicant paid the registration fee. The person lodging the applicant was stated in the form to be Koh. The address given was false but the telephone number matched a telephone found in the applicant's car at Geelong.
	
	
	The van impounded in Geelong was rented from a hire company by Koh in his correct name. His date of birth and Singapore passport number were correctly recorded on the rental agreement. The car used by the applicant was rented from the same company. The applicant was recorded by name as the hirer and his date of birth was correctly recorded. A telephone number recorded on the papers matched a telephone found in the applicant's possession at Geelong.
	
	
	Examination of mobile telephone records showed that the telephones possessed by the applicant and Koh were used between 15 and 18 December 2006 in the part of Castle Hill where the factory unit was situated, at the Department of Fair Trading where the business name application was lodged and at Padstow. In the same way police were able to establish that the users of the telephones travelled to Melbourne on 18 December 2006. The key found in the applicant's possession at Geelong opened the factory unit lock.
	
	
	In due course the applicant and Koh were transferred from Victoria to continue serving their sentences in New South Wales. On 27 January 2010 they were charged with the offence now under consideration.
	
	
	In dealing with the objective seriousness of the applicant's offence, her Honour began by drawing attention to the amount of MDP2P involved, 2.2 tonnes, a quantity 4,000 times the prescribed large commercial quantity for the drug. Her Honour described the amount as ""staggering"" but correctly observed that the amount itself was not determinative of the sentence to be imposed. Comparing the two cases, her Honour said at RS 22-26 -
	


On behalf of the offender it was submitted that Mr Li was nothing but the local contact for fulfilling the role as translator and transporter for Mr Koh who was, it was submitted, flown to Australia as the syndicate delegate. In support of the contention that Mr Koh should properly be regarded as the syndicate

delegate and more involved than Mr Li, whom it was said could not be shown to have any contact with the principal, Mr Price tendered the record of interview made by Mr Koh to New South Wales Police on 27 January 2010. I have read the whole of that interview. It is correct to say that Mr Koh said he had contact with a man in Malaysia whom he had first met years before when they were in a gang in Singapore. It is also correct to say that Mr Koh said that that man in Malaysia asked him to come to Australia because he trusted him. It is also correct to say that Mr Koh said in his interview the man in Malaysia told him to register the company, rent the warehouse and rent the van. However much of what Mr Koh said to police in that interview does not bear out the contention that Mr Li was merely acting as a translator and driver to Mr Koh. It was submitted also that the fact that it was Mr Koh who had the drugs in the van he was driving (the Victorian offence) was consistent with him exercising control over the drugs as the syndicate delegate.

On behalf of the Crown it was submitted that Mr Li's involvement was greater than Mr Koh, that Mr Li was higher in the hierarchy. The Crown pointed to several matters including: the actual acts performed by Mr Li; his possession of the key to E15; his activation of the 988 phone four days prior to the arrival of Koh in Australia; his possession of three mobile phones including one which was made (sic) some thirty-nine attempts to call overseas on the evening before setting off to Victoria; and the fact that Mr Li distanced himself from both the registration of the business name and the driving of the van containing the drugs such that of the two Mr Koh was exposed to the greater risk of identification and arrest.

Apart from Mr Li's evidence that he had accumulated a gambling debt of some $10,000 no detail has been revealed as to the particulars of Mr Li's involvement with what has been described in the agreed facts as ""the syndicate"". In order to assess the offender's role and his level of participation, I regard it as appropriate then to consider what it is that can be proved Mr Li I

actually did. The evidence establishes the following:

· Mr Li was in possession of the mobile phone (the 988 service) that had been activated on 7 December 2006, that is four days before Mr Koh's arrival in Australia; ""

· On the afternoon of 11 December 2006 Mr Li went to the Department of Fair Trading at Hurstville in the company of Mr Li (sic) where they jointly filled out a business registration form in the name of Glory Trading Company. Mr Li can be seen on the CCTV footage retrieving the registration form. The application was made in Koh's name and signed by him as director of the Glory Trading Company. Incorrect addresses were supplied. A mobile number was supplied. A phone utilising that number was located in the

Camry in which Mr Li had driven to Victoria. It was Mr Li, not Mr Koh, who paid the $137 registration fee. It can be inferred that the purpose of the registration of the business name was to feign legitimacy to the lessor of the factory premises which were intended to be used to store the prohibited drugs;

· On 12 December 2006 the offender Li, together with Koh, organised and provided the factory unit in which the drugs were subsequently stored. In that regard it was Mr Li who rang Mr Hoyle and inquired about the size and cost of the factory units. Shortly after the offender and Mr Li attended the factory unit at E15 when Mr Li spoke with Mr Hoyle about the rental of the 9.1 metre wide and twelve metre deep factory unit. It was Mr Li who paid

Mr Hoyle $2,100 in cash for the rental.

· On 15 December 2006 the key for the unit was collected by Mr Li. When Mr Li handed over to Mr Hoyle a piece of paper containing the business name Glory Training Company, it contained the name James Ho and the mobile phone number which was the same number that had been placed on the business registration form and which was the number of a phone found in the Camry which Mr Li was driving on 18 December 2006. There

is no evidence that Mr Koh was present on the occasion of the 15th.

· The key was not only collected by Mr Li in time for the delivery of the shipping container to E15 (which must have occurred around the 15th to 17 December 2006) the key was retained by him, it having been found in his possession on 18 December 2006.

It is apparent from the acts performed by Mr Li that he played a greater role in the obtaining of the premises for the purpose of the storage of the drugs. It was he who paid the money for the registration of the business and the rental of the premises. It was he who dealt with Mr Hoyle and attended upon him to collect the key. His possession of the key for E15 can be regarded as an indicator of his superior position, relative to Koh, particularly

when regard is had to the fact that it was Mr Koh who was exposed to the great risk of detection by reason of his name being placed on the business registration form, and particularly having regard to the fact that it was he who drove the van to Victoria, whilst Mr Li was in another vehicle which would have provided him with the opportunity to avoid detection had he not stopped to

assist when the van broke down.

Whilst there is a basis then to conclude that Mr Li was in a slightly more superior position to Mr Koh in the hierarchy of this criminal drug organisation, it is apparent that they acted jointly in organising and providing the factory unit. They each played an integral part in the scheme. On the established facts, the offenders' involvement was limited to several days over December 2006. There is no evidence to establish that Mr Li had any greater role than that established by the facts already set out. Indeed, as the agreed facts state, the Crown concedes that it cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that Messrs Li and Koh were the only participants in the criminal enterprise, or that they were themselves going to supply the drug to any person, although they did arrange for the premises knowing that it was to be used to store the drug that would be supplied by members of the syndicate. Mr Li, together with Mr Koh, played a

vital role in what was clearly a large commercial enterprise involving an enormous quantity of drugs, and potentially involving enormous profit for those members of the syndicate who were to supply the drugs.

and at RS 29 -

I have already indicated that I do not accept that Mr Li's role was limited to driving Mr Koh around. On the objective facts already set out, it is clear that Mr Li participated knowingly in this offence by playing a vital role in organising and providing the factory premises in the knowledge that it was to be used to store a substantial quantity of drug that was to be supplied by members of the syndicate.


	
	Having weighed the relative objective seriousness of the criminality of the applicant and Koh, her Honour brought subjective features into the balance. Her Honour continued at RS 34 -
	


In the determination of an appropriate sentence I have taken into account the circumstances of the offence, those matters related to its commission and the circumstances of the offender in light of the purposes of sentencing.


	
	Her Honour discussed general deterrence and continued at RS 34-35 -
	


I have had regard to the sentence imposed upon the co-offender Mr Koh, in light of the parity principle. I have already recorded that each played an integral role in the offence, albeit that Mr Li's role and level of participation was greater than that of Mr Koh, although not substantially so.


	
	Her Honour referred to the sentence previously imposed on Koh and continued at RS36 -
	


Mindful of the sentence imposed upon Mr Koh and having weighed the similarities and differences in the respective cases I have determined that the appropriate starting point for the sentence to be imposed on Mr Li is the same as that adopted for Mr Koh.

The Grounds of Appeal


	
	It is convenient to deal with the first two grounds of appeal together. They are -
	


1. The Sentencing Judge erred in failing to determine the objective seriousness of the offence.

2. The Sentencing Judge erred in applying the parity principle.


	
	Mr Odgers, SC, for the applicant, submitted in this Court that after noting the parties' respective positions. Her Honour erred in going on to identify what the applicant did rather than where in the hierarchy his role lay. Attention was drawn first to certain passages in the Remarks on Sentence extracted above. It was submitted that her Honour's reasons were not entirely clear, but should be understood to be -
	



	
	the sentencing judge was not satisfied that (as counsel for the applicant submitted) the applicant's role was substantially that of ""translator"" and ""transporter"" not that he had a ""lesser role"" than that of Mr Koh for the purposes of applying parity principles;
	
	
	the sentencing judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in a superior position to Mr Koh in the hierarchy of the criminal drug organisation;
	
	
	the sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant ""played a greater role in the obtaining of the premises for the purpose of the storage of drugs"", in that he performed more acts in that regard than Koh, although this did not mean that he had a ""substantially"" greater role and level of participation than Mr Koh;
	


The culpability of the applicant was ""greater"" than Koh but his subjective circumstances were ""more favourable"", with the consequence that the applicant's starting point sentence should be the same as that of Koh.


	
	The quoted words were extracted from the remarks on sentence. It was submitted that this reasoning involved error. First, her Honour failed to determine the objective seriousness of the applicant's offence. Secondly, her Honour elided the application of the principle that a sentence should be determined by an instinctive synthesis of all relevant factors with the application of the parity principle. Thirdly, her Honour's reasoning was inconsistent and illogical in that, having found that the applicant's role and level of participation were not substantially greater than those of Koh, her Honour concluded that the appropriate starting point of the applicant's sentence should be the same as that for Koh, even though the applicant's favourable subjective circumstances were much more strongly in his favour than Koh's were in his.
	
	
	Mr Odgers began by citing Director of Public Prosecutions (C'wealth) v Gregory [2011] VSCA 145; (2011) 211 A Crim R 147 and the error exposed there. That was a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The respondent's offence was a criminal conspiracy. A co-conspirator, one Wheatley, had already been sentenced and it became relevant for the sentencing judge to compare his and the respondent's respective parts in the conspiracy. The method adopted by the sentencing judge was to use Wheatley's sentence as a starting point and to add to or subtract from it factors which aggravated or mitigated the respondent's criminality. The instances of the process are set forth in the Judgment at [30]. The sentencing judge concluded thus -
	


When one considers these competing considerations, it seems to me that the sentence imposed upon you must be greater than the 18 month ""but for"" sentence imposed upon Mr Wheatley. In substance, I have reached this conclusion for two reasons. First, Mr Wheatley pleaded guilty and must have received a reduction in his sentence for that. Secondly, your use of your position as a solicitor in the relevant offending conduct means that your offence is, in my view, more serious than his, notwithstanding that his financial benefit was greater. In all the circumstances, it seems to me that the appropriate sentence is two [years'] imprisonment.


	
	The members of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Court of Appeal) disapproved of that approach. Their Honours said this at [36] -
	


The approach adopted by his Honour was a form of the two stage sentencing but one that lacked even the benefit of an initial assessment of the objective criminality of the offence. By adopting Mr Whealey's ""but for "" sentence as his starting point, or first stage, and then considering the various differential factors as between Mr Wheatley and the respondent in the second stage of his reasoning, his Honour erred in principle. If the sentence imposed upon Mr Wheatley was disproportionate to the objective criminality of the offence, his Honour would also have been operating from the outset on an unsound base.


	
	Mr Odgers submitted that her Honour erred in precisely the way the sentencing judge had erred in Director of Public Prosecutions (C'wealth) v Gregory. That was because her Honour had essentially begun with the sentence previously imposed on Koh and had compared similarities and differences before concluding that the applicant's sentence should have the same starting point as Koh's. Mr Odgers submitted that her Honour never determined the degree of objective seriousness of the applicant's criminality. Whereas her Honour had to work out the applicant's position in the hierarchy relative to Koh's, her Honour merely focussed on what the applicant did. There was no finding as to his position in the hierarchy.
	
	
	Mr Odgers referred the Court to the judgement of Simpson J in Tyler and Chalmers v R [2007] NSWCCA 247; (2007) 173 A Crim R 458). Her Honour said this at [78] - [81] -
	


It has long been the case that a relevant consideration in sentencing for conspiracy is the ""role"" played by the offender being sentenced: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; 108 A Crim R 464; Sawas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1; 78 A Crim R 538; R v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340; 108 A Crim R 531.

But this, to my understanding, has generally been intended, and read, as a reference to the position or seniority in the organisation of the offender whose sentence is under consideration. Those low in the hierarchy, such as couriers, are usually to be sentenced less harshly, because, although they are of fundamental importance in the execution of the object of the conspiracy - in a drug importation conspiracy, without couriers, no drug could or would be imported - they have no managerial or decision making function; and,experience shows, usually derive the least monetary reward.

By contrast, those who have managerial or decision making functions are seen to occupy a more senior position, and, accordingly, to be more culpable. A relevant factor here is the level of profit to be derived.

That is not the same as saying, as was here said, that a participant in a conspiracy is to be sentenced (solely) for what he or she does. In this case, that was applied to mean that Chalmers was to be sentenced only for his physical (or overt) acts undertaken in pursuance of the conspiracy.


	
	Having referred to other authority, her Honour continued at [83] -
	


Identifying the ""role"" of a participant by reference to his position in the organisational hierarchy is a very different proposition from isolating the precise physical acts that can be attributed to the particular offender, and selecting the punishment by reference solely to those isolated acts. It would be quite artificial, and contrary to the very concept of a conspiracy, to dissect with precision the physical acts of each of the conspirators, and to sentence that conspirator for those acts alone. That would be a negation of the complex inter-connection between the various participants, and the organisational nature of a conspiracy. It would represent too literal an application of the decisions that identify the ""role"" of any participant as a relevant factor in the sentencing exercise. It would be to ignore the essential feature of the offence of conspiracy - the agreement to participate in an organised criminal activity.

Consideration


	
	I do not agree with the applicant's characterisation of her Honour's enquiry and conclusion. Having summarised the positions taken first by the applicant, that he was just an interpreter and a mover of goods, and by the Crown, that his involvement was greater than Koh's and that he was higher in the hierarchy, her Honour considered what the applicant did as compared with what Koh did. Her Honour pointed out things done by the applicant and not by Koh and referred to the greater role the applicant had played in obtaining premises, paying rent and the like, and avoiding the risk of detection while exposing Koh to the same risk. Her Honour concluded that there was a basis for concluding that the applicant was in a slightly superior position in the hierarchy.
	
	
	What her Honour was doing is clear from her stated intention to assess his role and level from what the applicant did. It was on those findings that her Honour concluded, in the passage I have extracted above, that there was a basis to conclude that the applicant's position was slightly superior to Koh's.
	
	
	That last finding was, in my opinion, the very one Mr Odgers submitted had not been made. Her Honour could not have come to the conclusion that the applicant occupied a superior position without finding what he had done. Moreover the evidence would not have enabled her Honour to find out more about his position in the hierarchy than that it was above Koh's.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would not accept Mr Odgers' submission that her Honour failed to determine the applicant's role, that is to say, his position in the hierarchy.
	
	
	I return to Mr Odgers' last submission under these grounds. Essentially it amounted to this, that the applicant's subjective case was so much better than Koh's and the finding as to the objective seriousness of the applicant's case, as gauged by his position in the hierarchy, was so little worse than Koh's that her Honour could not, taking them both into account for each offender, properly have come to the conclusion that the starting point of the sentences for both men should be the same.
	
	
	Mr Odgers pointed to these favourable features and submitted that the comparison between them and Koh's subjective circumstances was stark -
	



	
	Motivation. The applicant's motive ""was a financial one, brought about by his perceived need on his account to deal with his gambling debts"". In contrast, Koh's motive was simply ""financial"" who simply expected to be ""paid a sum of money"".
	
	
	Prior good character. While the applicant was of prior good character, Koh 'became involved in anti-social groups and activities from a young age, leading to his imprisonment as a teenager and young man"".
	
	
	Prospects of rehabilitation. The applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend while ""Koh's prospects of rehabilitation are guarded""
	


Age. The applicant was aged 50 at the date of the commission of the offence and 56 years old at the date of sentencing while Mr Koh was ""a good deal younger"", aged 27 at the time of the offence and 31 at the date of sentence

Health. There was evidence that the applicant was in poor health while Mr Koh was in good health

Concerns over family. The applicant will find his continuing imprisonment difficult by reason of his concerns for his mother, wife and children while Mr Koh had no such family concerns.


	
	Her Honour was obliged to impose a sentence commensurate with the objective seriousness of the applicant's crime. While the amount of the drug could not determine the sentence, it was a matter her Honour had to take into account. It was accepted that the Crown could not prove that the applicant knew the quantity of the drug with which he was concerned, but he could not have failed to realise that the amount was enormous. That was bound to be of considerable weight in the determination of the sentence. Her Honour had to give appropriate weight to subjective features as well, but not so as to produce a sentence that failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The result criticised by Mr Odgers shows that her Honour gave more weight to the applicant's subjective features than to Koh's. In the applicant's favour were findings as to his prior good character, his good prospects of rehabilitation, his age (56 years as against Koh's 31 years), his poor health and concerns about his family.
	
	
	In Koh's favour were lack of intelligence and education and a consequent vulnerability to criminal exploitation. Koh had not seen any of his family since his arrest in 2006. His mother and paternal grandparents had died while he was in custody. His wife had divorced him. He had no family or friends in Australia. He had not been visited in prison.
	
	
	Both offenders were motivated by financial gain. Mr Odgers submitted that the applicant had a better case for leniency because his motivation for participating in the crime was to pay off a gambling debt of $10,000. Although her Honour recited the fact and extracted portion of a psychological report dealing with the applicant's addiction to gambling and his anxiety about it, I think that her Honour did so only as a recitation of the underlying facts. While her Honour accepted the applicant's proffered reason for his desire to raise money, she did not treat that expressly as a mitigating feature. Nor, in my opinion, was her Honour obliged to do so. Her Honour referred to the applicant's need to overcome his addiction and the desirability of assistance from others to do so in support of his eventual reintegration into the community.
	
	
	My impression is that on balance, the applicant had a better subjective case for leniency than Koh, but I would not describe the difference between the cases as stark.
	
	
	In my opinion her Honour's conclusion that the different objective cases and the different subjective cases warranted the same starting point lay within the proper limits of her Honour's discretion. I do not think that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by reference to the sentence imposed upon Koh.
	
	
	In my opinion these grounds of appeal have not been made good.
	
	
	The third ground of appeal asserts that her Honour erred in applying the totality principle.
	
	
	As I observed earlier in these reasons, her Honour fixed the commencement of the applicant's sentence to effect a partial accumulation of two years 3 months upon the Victorian sentence. In Koh's case her Honour accumulated the sentence by two years. The reason for the difference was that the period of accumulation was in each case equivalent to 50% of the non-parole period fixed by the County Court of Victoria.
	
	
	It was submitted in this Court that the degree of accumulation was impermissibly high and that, if that were not so, the period of accumulation of the applicant's sentence ought not have exceeded that of Koh's.
	
	
	It was common ground in the District Court that the drugs in the van came from stock in the premises at Castle Hill. Mr Odgers submitted that in driving the drugs to Victoria, all the applicant and Koh had done was move 12% of the total stock from one place to another. If all they had done had been to move 12% of the stock from one factory to another in Sydney, he submitted, it would be hard to imagine that any significantly longer sentence would have been imposed. Mr Odgers referred to remarks in the Judgement of Howie J, with which Adams and Price JJ agreed, in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 (2007) 168 A Crim R 41. At [27] his Honour said:
	


[T]here is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentence will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two sentence. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.


	
	Mr Odgers submitted that the circumstances comprehended by the New South Wales and Victorian offences amounted to a single course of criminal conduct in relation to the total amount of the drug. He drew attention to the effect of the accumulation, which was to increase a sentence of 19 years 6 months to an aggregate sentence of 21 years 9 months. He submitted that a sentence of 19 years 6 months would have been sufficient to reflect the whole of the applicant's criminality.
	
	
	In effect, Mr Odgers' final submission was that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance by comparing the partial accumulation of 2 years 3 months in his sentence with the accumulation of only 2 years for Koh's sentence.
	


Consideration


	
	I note that counsel for the applicant who appeared before her Honour asked her Honour to ""accumulate or run the sentences as concurrently (as) possible"". It would not be correct, I think, to characterise the events in Geelong as tantamount to a local movement of part of the drug stock from one premises to another. The events could be understood, I think, as no less than a significant step in the distribution of the drug interstate. The applicant's knowingly taking part in the supply of the drug at Castle Hill could not comprehend and reflect the criminality involved in the events that took place in Victoria. I do not think that the principle explained in Cahyadi assists the applicant.
	
	
	Mr Odgers' second submission really amounted to an argument that her Honour's sentence was excessive, given the totality of the criminality comprehended by the two offences. In my opinion it fell well within the limits of her Honour's sentencing discretion.
	
	
	In accumulating the applicant's sentence by 2 years 3 months and Koh's by 2 years, her Honour's intention was to allow the distinction the Victorian Court had drawn to continue to have some effect. In my opinion her Honour was entitled to do so. In the result her Honour discriminated in a way that did justice to both offenders.
	
	
	In my opinion the third ground of appeal has not been made good.
	
	
	I propose the following orders -
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.

2770884,R v Peifeng Yu [2016] NSWDC 257,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The offender is before me for sentence following his pleas of guilty in the Local Court to offences of domestic violence, all occurring in Auburn on 25 January 2015, specifically they are the following:
	


1. Sequence 4. A charge of intimidating Nifei He with the intention of causing her to fear physical or mental harm. That is an offence contrary to s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.

2. Sequence 5. A charge of assaulting Ms He and causing her actual bodily harm.

3. Sequence 7. A further charge of assaulting Ms He and causing her actual bodily harm.


	
	Each of these two offences is contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.
	
	
	All of these first three offences are capable of being dealt with in the Local Court.
	


4. Sequence 6. A charge of intentionally choking Ms He with recklessness. That is an offence contrary to s 37(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.


	
	The offender asks when sentencing him for this offence I take into account a further charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which occurred on the same day.
	
	
	After sentencing him, or as will be clear at the same time of sentencing him for these matters, I am also required to sentence him for a related offence referred to this Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That is an offence of contravening a restriction in an apprehended domestic violence order between 1 February and 25 April 2015 at Silverwater.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for that offence is 2 years imprisonment.
	
	
	There are agreed facts before the Court. The relevant facts are that the offender and Ms He had been in a de facto relationship since they met in China in 2006. They are both from China and met there as teenagers. They moved to Australia together in 2007 and continued to live together. They had two children, both boys, one now aged seven and the other four. The family was living in premises at Auburn at the time of the offences. The two children had bunk beds in the same room as the offender and Ms He.
	
	
	About 1am on Sunday 25 January 2015, Ms He was in the bedroom on her mobile phone, apparently engaged on a social media app chatting with another person. This was a male friend. Both children were in the room. They were also apparently awake at 1am playing on their iPads. The offender came into the room and asked to borrow her phone. She declined. He took the phone out of her hands and walked out of the room. She followed him downstairs to the living room. He asked where his iPad was and she told him that one of the boys had it upstairs. He went upstairs and took the iPad from his son. She followed him. She asked for her phone back so she could put it on the charger. He gave it to her and they both lay down on the bed. Her phone then vibrated indicating that a message had come in. The offender wanted to know who had sent the message and asked for the phone. I accept that this was because he was jealous of the person who he thought she was in contact with. She refused and he snatched the phone out of her hand and tried to unlock it. He asked for the pin but she declined. He threatened her and said “Don’t make me upset. If you make me upset I’m going to hurt you. Please unlock the phone, I’m not going to do anything”. The victim declined.
	
	
	He then went to slap her on the left side of her face but she put her hand up so he slapped the back of her hand twice in a quick hard motion. The children were present and could see what was happening and started to cry. One of them yelled out for them to stop fighting. The victim started crying and the offender sat on the bed next to her. He held the mobile phone in front of her face with his left hand and said “Unlock the phone”. He grabbed her left upper thigh with his right hand and squeezed her leg extremely hard causing her pain. She started to scream for him to stop. After about 10 seconds he let go of her left thigh and grabbed her right thigh and squeezed it really tightly causing pain. She also screamed out for him to stop. These are the facts for the Form 1 offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which I must take into account when sentencing for the choking offence. She suffered bruises to both of her thighs as a result of these assaults. This is a relatively serious offence, not a minimal version of this offence, and must be taken into account in a meaningful way when sentencing for the choking offence.
	
	
	The offender then said “Okay if you don’t want to give me the pin I will find out the pin”. He walked out of the bedroom and then returned a few seconds later. He took off his belt and said “I’m so angry. I hurt you but it’s not my fault you made me upset”. He then whipped her across the lower back twice with the belt. She curled up in a ball to try to protect herself. He asked for the pin again and threatened to break the phone if she did not give it to him. She unlocked the phone and he took it and read the messages between her and her friend. He became extremely angry because he did not like that male friend and had forbidden the victim to speak with him. He then left the room and swore at her and then walked back in again. He picked up another black belt from the floor which had a silver buckle. The victim curled up again to protect herself. He then whipped her across the arms and lower back leaving buckle indentations across her back and arms. He then left the bedroom and was yelling as he walked down to the lower level of the unit. The children witnessed all of this and were upset. The victim checked on them and then went downstairs to get her phone back. These are the facts involving his use of the belts and are the first in time of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offences.
	
	
	This is a serious offence. He used a belt to beat her, in fact two belts, and did so in front of their children. It was a humiliating and degrading assault, treating her like some people might mistreat a domestic animal. She was defenceless and the only reason he did this is because he had some misplaced jealousy about a person she was talking to on the phone. It is clearly another offence committed in a domestic situation. She suffered more than minimal injuries, including welt marks across her back extending across her shoulders and bruising down her back with belt buckle marks on her skin. These were thus quite heavy blows. This offence is at least at the mid-range in terms of objective seriousness.
	
	
	After these events the victim went downstairs and asked for her phone back. The offender refused. He walked into the living area where there was a portable hot plate on which there was a container of boiling water. He said, “If you don’t go back to the bedroom I will pour boiling water on you”. He grabbed the pot of water off the stove and she thought he was going to pour it on her so she lowered her head. He walked towards the victim. There was some dispute about this but I have already made a ruling in relation to these facts. I accept that whilst holding onto the pot with one hand he grabbed her left hand with his other hand and forced it into the boiling water. He left her hand in place for one to two seconds before releasing it. She screamed out in pain because it felt like her hand was on fire. He said “Shut up or you’ll make the neighbours wake and the police will come”. She continued to scream in pain and then he grabbed her right hand and forced it into the same pot of boiling water. He left it there for between five and six seconds. She screamed again. He then put the pot of water down and covered her mouth so that she could not be heard. She started to feel dizzy from the pain and sat down on the sofa. She complained to him about the pain.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards he went to the fridge and retrieved some ice in a bowl. He put her hand inside the ice which caused more pain. She started to cry again. He covered her mouth with his hands and asked her to stop crying or the police would come. He ultimately gave her some pain relief medication which she took and went to bed.
	
	
	These are the facts relevant to the second assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence. It is not only equally serious but more so given the nature of the assaults and the level of pain that she suffered. It is something almost akin to a form of torture. The victim suffered burns to both her hands particularly her right hand, with blistering. She suffered extreme pain when these assaults occurred. Fortunately she has had no permanent disability as a result of the injuries, having been left now with just some discolouration which is fading but no other physical disability. Again this offence was committed in a domestic situation and whilst not in the immediate presence of the children, on the facts, in a room just downstairs from where they were and could no doubt hear their mother screaming in pain. This is again at least in the mid-range in terms of objective seriousness if not more so.
	
	
	The victim woke up at 6am that morning because of the pain in her hands. She went downstairs and asked for her phone back. He gave it to her and she went upstairs so she could call a girlfriend to cancel arrangements she had that day. The offender then came into the bedroom and took the phone from her again and there was another argument. He slapped her in the back of the head with his hand. She yelled out for help to try and attract the neighbours. He then grabbed her face, placed one had around her mouth and the other around the front of her neck and applied pressure to her throat. He squeezed her neck hard. She felt she could not breathe. She closed her eyes and let her body drop so that he would let go. He did release his hold but said “You can die, but not now, the police will catch me”. He also said “Did you hear about that lady killed in the car park at Auburn? You know why, because she is a bitch that went off with another man. Today I had control, I just hurt you bad but if I don’t have control I will use a knife and kill you”. He then left and went back downstairs.
	
	
	These are the facts for the remaining two offences of choking and intimidation. They are clearly enough very serious offences. The choking is aggravated also by the fact that it was committed in a domestic situation and also occurred in the same premises where there were young children who on the facts were probably still in their beds in the same room at the time the offence occurred. The offence however occurred for a very short period of time. There was no loss of consciousness, but recklessness on his part in the strangulation. The intimidation is serious because it occurred at the same time as the actual choking but again these two offences are of fairly short duration. They are below the mid-range in terms of seriousness, but nonetheless extremely serious offences.
	
	
	The victim was able to find another phone and call 000. Police arrived and could see her injuries. They arrested the offender and took him into custody. The offender made some admissions to police, but not as to the full extent of the assaults and it seems clear from the psychologist’s report that even today, despite the fact that he has pleaded guilty to all of the offences, he does not in fact accept his guilt in relation to some of them.
	
	
	The police photographed the victim’s injuries and those photographs are tendered. They support the victim’s version of the assaults on her by the offender. Fortunately, the victim has recovered physically from these injuries. I accept from her victim impact statement however that she continues to be fearful when meeting new people and has difficulty in trusting people. Whilst there are no physical consequences of these offences on her, they have had very large social consequences. She has had to return to work full-time to support her two children, as she is now a single mother. She is also concerned about the effect on her children, not only of the offences, but also because they are now without a father, and is frightened that she will become the subject of gossip within her community if the facts of these offences become known. As will also become clear, when I deal with the related matter, she has also had some pressure put on her by others to withdraw the charges against the offender and calls too from the offender from gaol, apparently to apologise for committing the offences, but on numerous occasions, which almost certainly have increased the level of pressure she feels in the circumstances. These are all serious consequences to her and her children as a result of these offences.
	
	
	As I have said, these are all very serious offences. In fact, it seems to me that they are much more serious than the maximum penalty of five years would indicate, as to the two assault occasioning actual bodily harm offences. They are committed in a domestic situation. The burning offence in particular involves quite brutal violence and in any event one involves whipping with belts and the other, as I have said, forcing her hands into boiling water.
	
	
	The first group of offences was committed in front of the children and there can be no doubt that the children were able to hear their mother’s screaming when her hands were forced into boiling water. They were committed purely and simply it seems to me because of some jealousy that the offender felt because his partner was talking to someone on the phone. There must be a very significant element of general deterrence reflected in these sentences.
	
	
	There is an obscenely high level of domestic violence in our community at present. The statistics indicate that one woman a week dies and many more are injured as a result of episodes of domestic violence. Added to this are the countless children who become secondary victims of this violence, when they become witness to episodes of violence which, as is well known to this Court, can have lifelong adverse impacts on them. There is no excuse for violence between domestic partners. There is no excuse for violence by men against women. Sentences have to convey the message that such serious violence as occurred here will lead to significant gaol terms.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest so for almost a year. He pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity in the Local Court and is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of that plea. It is a significant utilitarian value, very much so because the victim is not being required to come to court to give evidence in trial proceedings and the need for a trial has been avoided.
	
	
	He is now 24 and will turn 25 in April this year. As I said he came to live in Australia with the victim in 2007 and their two children have been born here. They came apparently to study but he was not a good student and does not have proficient English. He worked in the construction industry for some time, although there is no evidence that he was in fact working at the time of these offences. The victim had been a good student and was able to start the HSC here. She was apparently working at the time of the offence. It seems that neither of them has any other family in Australia although the offender has a supportive relationship with his mother who remains living in China.
	
	
	There is a psychological report before the Court tendered by the offender. In his meetings with the psychiatrist, he asserted that he committed these offences in circumstances where he had started to become jealous of the victim from early 2014. He admits that he had started to check her phone for texts and messages and had installed an app on her phone to track her movements. I accept more probably than not that he started to use the drug known as ice for a few months before the offences, but apart from the history given by him to the psychiatrist, there is no other evidence in relation to his drug use. He told the psychiatrist that before he hit the victim with the belts, that is the subject matter of the first assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the victim had said some negative things to him and in his own words, “she said words that did not show respect, the minimum respect for any decent person, so anyone who hears this how could they keep calm”. He said he felt very angry. He claims that he then went downstairs and used ice because he had used ice in the past to calm himself down.
	
	
	Whilst I accept that he was using ice at around the time of the offence I do not accept that there is any evidence as such from which I could accept that during the course of these offences he used ice because of the consciousness that he was losing control and a desire to calm himself down. There is just no evidence to support that assertion, merely an assertion made to a psychologist and there is nothing in the agreed facts to support that assertion.
	
	
	Furthermore, there are assertions by him in the psychologist’s report that are inconsistent with the pleas of guilty including his denial to the psychiatrist that he ever tried to choke the victim. Clearly he admits to doing so by his pleas of guilty entered in this Court. In those circumstances, those assertions to the psychiatrist do not amount to evidence. In any event, by the time these later events occurred, he had already lost control, had slapped her hand, pinched her thighs and whipped her with a belt. His anger was already escalating and leading to increased violence. His behaviour, in my view, is consistent with a build-up of anger throughout the night, culminating in the choking.
	
	
	However, whilst his behaviour was escalating in seriousness, he was not acting like a person who had completely lost control. In fact he told the victim that he was in control but that she should be fearful of a future occasion because if he did not have control of himself then he would use a knife and kill her. That is the subject matter of the intimidation charge. The fact that he may have been under the influence of ice at the time is not a matter I am entitled to take into account any way as mitigating the seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	The offender has expressed remorse and contrition to the psychiatrist. It seems to me that this is limited. He has only limited insight into the seriousness of his offending behaviour. That much is clear from the fact that he tried to contact her, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, more than 60 times from gaol over the next three months. He appears to assume, from the content of the psychiatrist’s report, that their relationship will simply recommence on his release from custody, without any thought being given to her wishes. There is no evidence before me that the victim wishes to resume their relationship, although I accept that she is concerned about the impact on her sons of limited or no contact with their father.
	
	
	His prospects of rehabilitation are difficult to assess for a number of reasons. One is the limited insight to which I have referred. The other is that his future is unknown in terms of resumption of the relationship or even whether he will be permitted to remain in Australia. He no longer uses drugs I accept so that improves his prospects of rehabilitation. However, he has admitted to having anger problems over a long period. He will need some time on parole to address these issues to ensure that his rehabilitation is addressed. If Ms He does not want the relationship to resume he will find that difficult to accept and will require close supervision and referral to appropriate authorities to ensure that he does not revert to drug use and violence.
	
	
	He will, in any event, almost certainly seek and have the right to ongoing contact with his children, which is a matter which will require some supervision in order to ensure he does not re-offend.
	
	
	He comes to court with no prior convictions and he is entitled to have that taken into account in his favour. He would appear to have some work available to him in the community and there is a positive reference from that person, which I take into account.
	
	
	I will now deal with the facts in relation to the related offence of breaching the ADVO. Once he was charged with the offences before me, police applied for an ADVO which was granted. There were numerous interim orders in place. One of those interim orders was enforceable until 15 July 2015. Amongst the conditions of that order was that the offender must not approach or contact the victim by any means whatsoever, except through his legal representatives or as agreed in writing or as permitted by an order or direction under the Family Law Act 1975 as to counselling, conciliation or mediation.
	
	
	As I said, he went into custody on 25 January 2015. Between 1 and 7 February the victim received a phone call on her mobile from an unknown number. That was a woman who claimed to be the sister of a fellow inmate of the offender who said “Your husband said to go visit him in gaol”. Again between 15 and 18 February she received a call from an unknown number. It was an elderly lady claiming to be from the church in Lidcombe saying that she visited him in gaol and asked her to give him another chance. She received a further call from that lady a few days after the call but told her she was unable to talk and ended the call. Again between 16 and 25 February she received a phone call on her mobile phone from a woman who said she was the girlfriend of an inmate and that “Your husband has asked when you will visit again”. She received further calls from the same number between 16 and 25 February but either ignored or rejected the calls. She then received a text on 25 February 2015 written in Chinese which was from the same number saying your husband needs you to go and see him quickly, he has some urgent matters to search for you. She also received a number of video calls from a Chinese social media chat app from the offender’s mother and sister over a number of days asking her to visit in gaol and to withdraw the charges before the Court.
	
	
	All calls made by inmates in New South Wales prisons are logged and the Court is aware that prisoners have a series of numbers they are entitled to contact. Between 25 February and 25 April 2015 the accused made a total of 63 calls to the victim’s phone number, 33 were not connected and 30 were. He made no threats to her nor requests to withdraw charges and I accept from a statement made by the victim that when he contacted her the content of the conversation was how sorry he felt.
	
	
	He has also sent a letter to her through his lawyers. In my view, whilst this might not have been strictly outside the conditions of the ADVO, it was extremely inappropriate for his lawyers to have sent a letter directly to the victim from him in gaol, no matter the content. It is a course which in my view should never happen again. Such letters routinely are provided to the DPP to be passed onto victims and ought not be sent by lawyers directly to victims in cases such as this.
	
	
	In any event, there were 30 phone calls made from within the gaol. It seems to me entirely inappropriate that Corrective Services New South Wales permit prisoners to telephone the victims of their crime from gaol in any event, but certainly when there is in place an ADVO preventing contact. It is most unfortunate that this occurred. It continues to occur in New South Wales prisons. This is not the first time I have seen this happen in matters before me. It is about time Corrective Services corrected this situation. They in fact permitted this prisoner, on 63 occasions, to breach an ADVO. That is simply not acceptable and not good enough.
	
	
	It is a serious breach of the ADVO, but fortunately on none of the occasions on which he contacted her, did he actually threaten her, but on 30 occasions over a three month period, he spoke to her. That can only have increased the pressure she felt, added to the other calls made which at least she regarded as having been made on his behalf and in which, from time to time, she was being asked to contact him and on other occasions she was being asked to withdraw the charges against him.
	
	
	Only a term of imprisonment would deal with the seriousness of this breach ADVO in the circumstances. Clearly enough only terms of imprisonment would deal with the seriousness of the substantive offences before me. The most serious of the offences is the choking charge because of the maximum penalty but in fact it seems to me the facts of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offences, particularly that involved in the burns to her hands, are more serious. Each of the offences must have a separate sentence, but there must be in my view considerable concurrency to reflect total criminality. Whilst they are discreet offences, they occurred more or less at the same time. Whilst complete concurrency would not be appropriate, there should be considerable partial accumulation.
	
	
	For the reckless choking there is a Form 1 offence to take into account. It is, as I have said, not an insignificant incident of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It should be taken into account in a meaningful way. I have concluded for that offence taking into account the Form 1 matter there should be an overall term of imprisonment of two years.
	
	
	For the intimidation offence it should have been overall 12 months but reduced to nine months in the circumstances. It should be totally concurrent with the choking offence because of the way in which each of them was committed more or less at the same time.
	
	
	For the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offences it seems to me, taking into account the pleas of guilty, that terms of imprisonment of 12 months for each are appropriate. If these offences were totally accumulated that would be four years overall which is excessive in the circumstances. In my view, the total criminality should give rise to a sentence of three years. There are special circumstances namely that it is his first time in gaol and the fact that he will undertake his prison term a little more harshly because of his language difficulties. The non-parole period overall in this case in my view should be two years.
	
	
	For the breach ADVO, in the circumstances, it seems to me that a fixed term of imprisonment of three months is called for. I will sentence that matter first in time, backdating the term of imprisonment to the date he went into custody. There will be a small partial accumulation of that sentence with the other sentences. Those sentences will start two months into that fixed term.
	
	
	For those reasons then I make the following formal orders:
	
	
	For the s 166 matter related offence, breach ADVO, he is convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months commencing 25 January 2015 expiring 24 April 2015.
	
	
	For sequence 5, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 25 March 2015, expiring 24 March 2016.
	
	
	For sequence 7, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 25 September 2015, expiring 24 September 2016.
	
	
	For the choking offence, sequence 6, he is sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months, commencing 25 March 2016, expiring 24 March 2017 with parole thereafter of 12 months, commencing 25 March 2017, expiring 24 March 2018, giving rise to an overall term of imprisonment of two years commencing 25 March 2016, expiring 24 March 2018. I direct that he be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	I indicate for that offence I have taken into account the Form 1 offence.
	
	
	For the intimidate offence, sequence 4, he is sentenced to fixed term of imprisonment of nine months commencing 25 March 2016, expiring 24 March December 2016.
	
	
	I decline to fix non-parole periods for the fixed terms as they will be part of an overall non-parole period. Can someone just check those dates please.
	


“TEMBE: They look correct from my perspective your Honour.

HER HONOUR: I note there is an ADVO protecting the victim in place from the Local Court until October 2017.

		20 October 2016",2016-01-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2770891,R v Chambour; R v Khallouf (No 1) [2016] NSWDC 244,"Ruling on tendency evidence


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is the first of a number of pre‑trial decisions which I am called upon to make. I shall therefore spend some little time describing the nature of the proceedings for the purposes of each of the rulings which I must make.
	
	
	On 21 September 2016 the Crown presented an indictment containing seven counts. The first count concerned the accused George Chambour; the second count concerned the accused Youssef Khallouf and each of the remaining five counts made the same allegation against each of the accused. The first count is an allegation that on 8 September 2013 at Sydney George Chambour did use unlawful violence towards another by conduct such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. That pleading is apt for the crime known as affray, an offence contrary to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Mr Chambour pleaded guilty to that count. In essence there are two affrays that were committed on 8 September 2013 relevant to these proceedings. The first affray occurred in the Opera Bar at the Sydney Opera House. The second affray occurred in the car park of the Sydney Opera House. As I understand it Mr Chambour pleaded guilty to the affray in the Opera Bar. The second count is that on 8 September 2013 at Sydney Youssef Khallouf was armed with a weapon, namely a knife, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely assault. To that offence Mr Khallouf pleaded that he is not guilty.
	
	
	To each of the following five offences each of the accused pleaded not guilty. The third count is that on 8 September 2013 each accused did use unlawful violence towards another by conduct such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. That, of course, is an allegation of affray and that represents the affray in the Opera House car park. The fourth count is that on 8 September 2013 at Sydney each of the accused whilst in company did recklessly wound Chris Pattison. The fifth count is that on the same date and at the same place whilst in company each of the accused did recklessly wound Kurtis Pattison. The sixth count is that on the same date and at the same place whilst in company each of the accused did assault Isaac Parry thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to him. The final count in the indictment is that on the same date and at the same place whilst in company each of the accused did recklessly wound Patrick White. In respect of counts 3 to 7 the Crown case is that one in particular of each of the accused wounded the alleged victim, or, in the alternative, was party to a joint criminal enterprise to either assault or recklessly wound the alleged victim.
	
	
	8 September 2013 was a Sunday. On Saturday 7 September 2013 a group of people, to which I shall refer hereafter as the first group, gathered together at the Opera Bar at the Sydney Opera House to celebrate the 24th birthday of Kurtis Pattison. Mr Pattison’s 24th birthday in fact occurred on 1 September. The other members of the first group were: Peggy Lee Greenwood, Mr Kurtis Pattison’s partner; Mr Patrick White, Kurtis Pattison’s cousin; Rebecca Greenwood, the sister of Peggy Lee Greenwood; Robert Rajonese, the boyfriend of Rebecca Greenwood; Michael Higgins, the brother of both Peggy Lee Greenwood and Rebecca Greenwood; Emily Barns, the girlfriend of Michael Higgins; Mr Almiro Rodrigues, a friend of Kurtis Pattison; males identified merely as Louis and Daniel, who were friends of Kurtis Pattison; a lady, Katrina, a friend of Kurtis Pattison; Chris Pattison, the brother of Kurtis Pattison; Christian Hazell, a friend of Chris Pattison; Isaac Parry, a friend of Chris Pattison; Thomas Crossling, a friend of Kurtis Pattison; and Durrant Brown, a friend of Chris Pattison. If my mathematics be correct, which is always problematical, there were 16 persons in the first group.
	
	
	The exact number of persons in a second group is currently unknown to me. However the evidence identifies six individuals who were members of the second group. Those six are: Mr Ahmed Barakat; Mr Mahmoud Barakat, his cousin; Mr Ali Selman; Mr Abraham Kbayli; the accused Youssef Khallouf; and the accused George Chambour. It is, I think, common ground that the second group also included a number of ladies.
	
	
	The first part of the first group to arrive at the Opera Bar arrived there around 7.30pm. The second part, Chris Pattison and his friends, arrived about 8.30pm. It appears to be common ground that a number of members of each group was taking alcohol. For example, exhibit 14-14, a statement of Kurtis Pattison, tells me that he estimated that he had “about six to seven Vodka Red Bull drinks” prior to the action which gives rise to the current proceedings. Mr Robert Rajonese in his statement said that he was drinking beer and then a cocktail of Malibu and pineapple and he had at least six drinks during the evening. Mr Patrick White had a Crown lager when he arrived at the Opera Bar and then started drinking Corona beers. He estimated that by midnight he had consumed about seven beers and had not eaten any proper meal and was “moderately affected by alcohol”.
	
	
	There are before me three Crown Case Statements. Exhibit 1-1 is the original Crown case statement. Exhibit 2-2 is the current Crown Case Statement. Exhibit 3-3 was the Crown Case Statement that was applicable up until Monday 19 September 2016 when an accommodation was reached between the Crown and Abraham Kbayli and pleas were subsequently entered by Abraham Kbayli. The current proceedings originally were against each of Kbayli and the two current accused.
	
	
	Exhibit 1-1 tells me that “during the evening, Ahmed Barakat and a number of his friends (George Chambour, Abraham Kbayli, Ali Selman, Youssef Khallouf) and Ahmed’s cousin (Mahmoud Barakat) were also at the Opera Bar enjoying the evening with male and female friends”. It appears that a “leader” of the second group was Mr Ahmed Barakat.
	
	
	Paragraph 5 of the statement of Mr William Collins, a bartender at the Opera Bar at the time, says this, and in it he is referring to Ahmed Barakat:
	


“During the night I noticed a male who was a regular at the bar. He was a big guy, very muscly and was of Middle Eastern background. He had a shaved head, a large nose and he was [wearing] white coloured T-shirt, a polo top, it was very tight on him. He was wearing khaki coloured pants, like trouser pants. I can’t remember what type of shoes he was wearing. He comes here at least once a month and usually brings friends. Sometimes the group of friends can change to be different people. He generally brings friends of a Middle Eastern background. He always buys drinks from the inside bar because there is a specific type of vodka he likes and cocktails. We have a limited variety of drinks on the Terrace Bar and no cocktails, so I didn’t serve him on this particular night. When I have served him before, he was always polite and always paid cash. He always knew what he wanted. I have noticed that he always carries lots of cash”.

Mr Ahmed Barakat can be identified in a photograph, exhibit 7-7, taken, according to the time imprinted on it, at 22 minutes and 13 seconds after midnight. Mr Ahmed Barakat is the person in the foreground, wearing a white sleeved shirt, with his back to the photographer and is clearly bald headed. Immediately to his right, wearing a striped shirt, is the accused Youssef Khallouf. On the left of the photograph, also wearing a striped shirt, is Mahmoud Barakat.


	
	At about 12.20am on the Sunday morning, Chris Pattison and his four friends commenced to leave the Opera Bar. As they walked through the Opera Bar, Christian Hazell bumped into Ahmed Barakat and a lady who was walking with him. Ahmad Barakat pushed Chris Hazel aside. Ahmed Barakat and the woman continued to walk toward the bar service area in the Opera Bar. Mr Hazell continued to walk in the direction in which he had been walking prior to colliding with Ahmed Barakat and the lady, but then turned to his left and said some words back in the direction of Mr Barakat. Mr Barakat did not respond. However, Abraham Kbayli walked towards Mr Hazell and then Ahmed Barakat followed Mr Kbayli. Mr Hazell stopped and stood looking at Mr Kbayli. The men walking with Mr Hazell also stopped and turned to confront those who were approaching them from behind.
	
	
	Kbayli walked straight up to Hazell and threw a right-hand punch at Hazell which struck him in the face. Hazell stumbled backwards. One of the men in the Pattison group, Durrant Brown, punched Kbayli in the head knocking him to the ground. That punch resulted in Kbayli developing a large, red swelling near his left eye. Other men from each of the groups rushed from various parts of the Opera Bar towards where this fight had commenced. All became involved. There was clearly an affray.
	
	
	Security employees arrived and intervened and separated the two groups of men. The fighting stopped. However, a few seconds later Mr Ahmed Barakat ran back at the first group and threw a punch at Chris Pattison. The fight re‑erupted. The accused, George Chambour, picked up a chair and threw it into the melee. It struck a security guard, Mr Steven Yarza, on the head causing a laceration. That was the allegation contained in count 1 of the indictment to which Mr Chambour has pleaded guilty. After that occurred, Mr Chambour was restrained by the bartender, Mr William Collins. Exhibit 12-12 are a number of still photographs taken from camera 352. The first photograph taken at 22 minutes and 22 seconds after midnight clearly shows the bartender, William Collins, restraining Mr Chambour on the left‑hand side of the photograph. The same is shown in the second photograph, timed at 00-22-22. Mr Chambour’s face is clearly seen in the photograph timed 00:22:24 which shows the bartender holding Mr Chambour in a headlock. The second photograph bearing the same time shows the same thing.
	
	
	Paragraph 12 of the current Crown Case Statement, exhibit 2-2, says this:
	


“During the fight Youssef Kallouf, was one of the men in the [second] group that evening, stood to the side of the fight and produced a knife, from his pocket, which he held by his side (count 2 Kallouf). The CCTV footage from the Opera Bar depicts a knife in Mr Kallouf’s hand and shows Mr Kallouf folding the knife away and placing it in his pocket after a period of time”.

The Crown Prosecutor has taken me to still photographs in exhibit 12‑12 which she submits show what is contained in paragraph 12 which I have just quoted. Whether Mr Kallouf had in his possession a knife on the evening is hotly in dispute.


	
	The next paragraph in the current Crown Case Statement tells me that security employees then ushered the first group out of the bar while other security employees stood in front of the second group attempting to stop them from following the first group. The first group left the bar and walked towards the car park. Mahmoud Barakat, Kbayli and the accused Khallouf then moved past the security employees and followed the first group towards the car park.
	
	
	The Crown Case Statement continues thus:
	


“15. At some point in time between the Opera Bar and the car park, Mr Kbayli said, ‘Give me the shiv’ and took the knife from Mr Khallouf. He was seen taking the knife from his pocket and folding it open and then moving towards the other group. One of the males said, ‘Shank him. Shiv him.’

16. William Collins yelled out, ‘Purple shirt [Kbayli] has a knife’. Other witnesses yelled out, ‘He’s got a knife’.

17. In the vicinity of the car park elevators [sic], Mr Kbayli advanced towards and shoved Michael Higgins with his left hand, whilst holding the knife in his right hand. Then he advanced towards Kurtis Pattison and shoved Kurtis Pattison. Mr Kbayli then walked towards Chris Pattison.

18. Mr Chambour arrived in the area and punched Michael Higgins. This assault is not disputed by the accused Mr Chambour.

19. A male yelled out, ‘Get the knife, Youssef’ and ‘Give me the knife, Youssef.’”

It is the Crown case that the reference to Youssef is a reference to the accused Youssef Khallouf. I return to the Crown Case Summary:

“20. Mr Khallouf ran up to Mr Kbayli and said loudly, ‘Give me the knife, give me the knife’. After a short period Mr Kbayli gave Mr Khallouf the knife, and Mr Kbayli ran towards the other group who were standing near the metal barriers separating the pedestrian walkway from the car park. Mr Khallouf was holding the knife in his right hand making slashing motions.

21. The CCTV depicts the fight between the two groups moving out of sight to the right.”

I should indicate at this time that by “the metal barriers”, the Crown case statement is referring to a number of bollards that have been inserted to prevent cars driving on to the area designed for pedestrian use outside the entrance to the lifts which take patrons from various parts of the Opera House building to at least one level of the car park. To the right, as indicated in the Crown case statement, there is a ramp downwards, whilst to the left is a ramp upwards, the ramp being for vehicular traffic.


	
	Whatever happened down the ramp is not portrayed on any CCTV footage. The footage then depicts Mr Chris Pattison running backwards from the right, up the ramp, facing in the direction of those who were in pursuit of him. It is the Crown case that those in pursuit of him were Kbayli and the accused Khallouf. The Crown submits, and it is part of the Crown case, that at least Khallouf, if not Kbayli, at this time was brandishing a knife. The CCTV footage shows Mr Chris Pattison going out of view as he ran backwards up the ramp, being followed by Khallouf and Kbayli, who also go out of view. The Crown alleges that a number of stabbings occurred whilst the persons involved were going up the ramp.
	
	
	The following is the Crown’s reconstruction of events contained in the Crown Case Statement:
	


“23. Chris Pattison falls over bonnet of a vehicle and is attacked by Mr Khallouf, who was punching him with his left hand and using a stabbing motion with his right hand in which he held a knife. Chris Pattison receives wounds to his hands as a result (count 4).

24. Kurtis Pattison ran towards Mr Khallouf and kicked him in the chin, causing him to fall to the ground. Kurtis Pattison then attempted to get Mr Kbayli away from Chris Pattison. He was then stabbed in the right upper inner thigh by Mr Khallouf from his position on the ground (count 5...).

25. Isaac Parry ran at Mr Kabeli to try and get him off Chris Patterson. Mr Kabeli swung around with the knife and cut Mr Parry on the right wrist with his left middle and pinky [sic] fingers (count 6...).

“26. George Chambour was armed with a knife and was punching Patrick White. Patrick White sustained wounds to his left buttock as a result. Robert Rajonese ran out to George Chambour who turned to face him. At which point Robert Rajonese saw a knife in George Chambour’s right hand (count 7...)”

The Crown Case Statement goes on to say that count 3 arises out of the allegations stated between paragraphs 14 and 25. The rest of the Crown Case Statement tells me something of the aftermath. That commences with the fact that the police arrived about 3 minutes after the two groups of people had entered the car park area. The Crown Case Statement has been supported in these preliminary applications by the statements of the relevant witnesses.


	
	As I understand it, a real issue in dispute is whether the actions attributed to Mr Khallouf were in fact committed by Mahmoud Barakat, each of the two men wearing a striped “shirt”. The first few images in exhibit 13, still photographs obtained from camera 3, the camera in the car park area, show Khallouf and Mahmoud Barakat side by side. Mr Khallouf’s shirt has horizontal stripes which appear to me to be of equal width and doing the best I can on the photographic evidence the stripes are either white and dark blue or grey and dark blue. The arms of that shirt appear to be short. The shirt worn by Mahmoud Barakat has much wider, lighter stripes than the darker stripes but they, like those on the shirt worn by Mr Khallouf, are horizontal stripes. Again, doing the best I can on the photographic evidence, the shirt worn by Mahmoud Barakat contains large white stripes and narrower blue stripes, but if those stripes be blue they are a lighter blue than those of the shirt worn by Mr Khallouf. If Mr Khallouf’s shirt be blue and white striped, rather than black and white striped the blue could be described as navy blue and the blue of Mr Khallouf’s shirt could be described as royal blue.
	
	
	The first ruling that I l must make concerns an application by the Crown to adduce tendency evidence against Mr Chambour. The tendency notice is exhibit T3. The tendency sought to be proved by the Crown is the tendency of Mr Chambour to “participate in physical violence using a knife with co-offenders”. The Crown seeks to adduce into evidence a set of facts agreed between the Crown and George Chambour arising from offences committed at Granville late in the night of Friday 21 September 2012, a time almost a year prior to the offences with which I am concerned. Those agreed fats are exhibit T4.
	
	
	On Friday 21 September 2012 a pre-wedding party was being held at the Grand Royale Function Centre in South Street, Granville. That party was attended by a Mr George Chambour and his wife Alaine Chambour. It was also attended by Elie Akkawi. According to paragraph 1 of exhibit T4.
	


“During the course of the party alcohol was consumed by many of the guests. It was freely available on the guest’s [sic] tables as well as at the bar. During the course of the evening a witness observed males at the table, at which Chambour and Akkawi was [sic] seated, to be loud and rowdy.”

Guests began to leave at approximately 11.45pm. Some milled around outside the function centre whilst others left without lingering behind. At about 11.59pm Elie Akkawi left the function centre and crossed to the opposite side of the street and walked down the street. He walked to his parents’ car which was parked between 50 and 60 metres away from the function centre and he stood near that car, smoking a cigarette.


	
	Mr Chambour and his wife were amongst the people milling around outside the function centre. It is to be noted that Mr Akkawi was not one of those who lingered outside the function centre. Amongst those who did, however, were three brothers, Tallal Sabbagh, Fadi Sabbagh and Amid Sabbagh and their wives and also a friend of theirs, Mr Nicholas Bechara and his wife. The agreed facts, exhibit T4 go on to state this,
	


“At one point, Alaine Chambour approached Tallal and asked him for a cigarette lighter. Tallal handed over his lighter and she lit a cigarette. At this point, Chambour turned around to Tallal and said, ‘Are you trying to pick up my wife?’ Tallal said he wasn’t. A short conversation followed in which Tallal said, ‘Congratulations, when did you get married?’ Tallal put his hand out to shake Chambour’s hand. Chambour and Tallal gripped each other’s hands tightly. Tallal said, ‘Relax, are you all right?’ Chambour said, ‘What are you looking at?’ Tallal said, ‘I don’t know what I am looking at?’ Chambour said, ‘Do you think my wife is good looking?’ Tallal said, ‘Yes’.

Chambour then threw three upper cut punches at Tallal’s face. The impact caused one of Tallal’s teeth to break...”


	
	There was then a physical response by Tallal Sabbagh to Chambour’s assault. Amid Sabbagh joined in the fight. The fight moved away from the function centre south along the eastern footpath of South Street. As the fight progressed Fadi Sabbagh was trying to pull Chambour away from Tallal Sabbagh. Amid could not get close to Tallal Sabbagh because there were too many arms and bodies in the way. The agreed facts continue thus:
	


“(8) At one point Tallal had Chambour in a headlock and was throwing punches at Chambour. At this time Chambour continued to punch Tallal. After Tallal let Chambour go, Chambour threw a few more punches before walking away.

Chambour walked toward Amid, Amid punched Chambour many times in the face with closed right and left fists. Chambour lost his balance. At this point, Alaine came over and hit Ahmed on the back of his head with her purse. She continued to swing the purse at Ahmed. Ahmed then swung his hand and hit her in the face. Ahmed then chased Chambour. The fight lasted 37 seconds before the persons involved separated.”


	
	The next two paragraphs of T4 relate to the actions of Akkawi. His attention was drawn back to the function centre when he heard a woman scream. Akkawi approached the group that included Mr Chambour and the three Sabbagh brothers. He became involved and in the process his shirt was torn. Mr Akkawi maintained that he was assaulted and the Crown was not able to disprove that allegation by him. After he had been in the fight for about 30 seconds Akkawi retreated backwards from Amid Sabbagh. By that time his shirt had been torn. He did not have anything in his hands. Amid ran after Akkawi and kicked a metal sign towards him. The sign had been on the pavement on the footpath outside the function centre. Akkawi moved quickly onto the medium strip of South Street directly opposite the entrance to the function centre.
	
	
	Some ten seconds after that Mr Chambour walked through the crowd in a northerly direction past the entrance to the Function Centre before walking between two parked motor vehicles onto South Street. At that stage he had nothing in his hands. Whilst Chambour was walking down the street Mr Akkawi walked along the medium strip parallel to Chambour. Mr Akkawi was being followed by an unidentified male holding, of all things, a bright orange witch’s hat. Chambour and Akkawi met. Chambour was then approached by another male whose name is not known and that male handed Chambour a knife. Armed with the knife, Chambour ran back to the footpath where the Sabbagh brothers and their wives were standing. Amid Sabbagh saw Chambour approaching and pointed out that the group should protect themselves because Chambour had a knife, although the agreed facts used the plural noun, quite inappropriately.
	
	
	A number of those outside the function centre attempted to prevent Mr Chambour approaching the Sabbagh brothers. The agreed facts continue thus:
	


“Chambour avoided them and ran directly towards Fadi with a knife in his hand. He made six swinging motions towards Fadi with his right hand. One hit Fadi on the head. Fadi fell to the ground during the course of that attack. Chambour continued to attack Fadi while he was on the ground. Pascale Sabbagh (Amid’s wife) and Bechara eventually pulled Chambour away from Fadi, allowing Fadi to get up.”

The next paragraph of exhibit T4 tells me that whilst Chambour was interacting with Fadi Sabbagh, Akkawi obtained a knife but whence he obtained the knife is not stated. Whether it was given to him or, for example, he retrieved it from the glovebox of his parent’s car is unknown. Eventually Akkawi approached Amid Sabbagh and stabbed him twice in the posterior thoracic area. That caused Akkawi to be charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Akkawi then turned and ran down the street in a northerly direction and out of sight. Amid start to give chase to Akkawi but desisted.


	
	In the meantime Fadi Sabbagh had arisen from the ground to where he had been knocked by Chambour, but Chambour was restrained by Bechara. Chambour asked Bechara to let him go, and he then chased Fadi and made another stabbing motion towards his back which led to Chambour’s being charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Mr Bechara followed Chambour and attempted to stop him chasing Fadi. There was scuffle during which Mr Chambour punched him in the shoulder with the hand in which he held the knife that led to Chambour being charged with recklessly wounding Bechara. The next paragraph of exhibit T4 is this:
	


“Chambour got free of Bechara and walked down the street after Fadi. Three unidentified men tried to hold him back. Chambour threw the knife in Fadi’s direction. As Chambour walked back to the function centre he yelled, ‘I’m going to fuckin’ kill you.’”

Chambour then met up with Akkawi and they both walked back towards the function centre. Eventually, they walked south and away from those gathered out the front of the function centre and they left the area. At 8.30am on Monday 24 September 2012, Mr Chambour attended Parramatta Police Station where he was arrested and then processed by the police.


	
	The Crown provided me with these decisions and directed my attention to the dicta I mention:
	


Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136 at [78],

Sokolowskyj v R NSWCCA 55 at [40],

IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14 at [46].


	
	I glean from these authorities and my understanding of s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 the following principles:
	



	
	the greater the specificity of the tendency alleged, the more likely is it that evidence will be admitted to prove such tendency e.g. evidence of a general sexual interest in younger persons of either sex compared with the facts in the Queen v RHB:
	


“As the judge held, it is a remarkable thing for a man to commit sexual acts against his female lineal descendants. It is still more remarkable when, in each case, the nature of the acts is similar, of not identical, even if they are commonplace sexual acts. It is even more remarkable that in each case the acts were committed in the home whilst the victim was in the applicant’s care, while other adults were close by and the risk of detection was significant” (at [18]);


	
	the greater the number of occasions the alleged tendency has been displayed, the more likely is it that the tendency will be proved, and therefore have significant probative value: The Queen v RHB at [20]: “not just one occasion when the applicant offended, but three”;
	
	
	the greater the similarities between the facts in issue and the tendency evidence sought to be adduced the more likely it is that the tendency evidence has probative value, and significant probative value, to demonstrate the tendency alleged: CGL v DPP at [40].
	



	
	There are a large number of dissimilarities between the actions of Mr Chambour detailed in exhibit T4 and the actions alleged by the Crown that he took in the early hours of Sunday 8 September 2013 at Granville. At Granville Mr Chambour was the original aggressor, however, his aggression appears to have been motivated by a perception that Tallal Sabbagh had taken an interest in his wife. One can speculate that his suspicion might have been induced by excitement due to alcohol ingestion. However, it is not uncommon for men who perceive that their “partners”, be those partners their wives or girlfriends, to become inflamed if they perceive that another male is taking an interest in the partner. There was then a fist fight in which the three Sabbagh brothers became involved and it appears that Mr Chambour may have come out “second best.” It required his wife to intervene to assist him, but she then was assaulted by Amid Sabbagh. Chambour was then provided with a knife by a person who cannot be identified. He was not supplied with the knife by Mr Akkawi. Mr Chambour then went back to seek vengeance on the Sabbagh brothers.
	
	
	Whilst he was doing that, Mr Akkawi obtained a knife from somewhere and went back to seek vengeance perhaps for what had happened to him, when he had earlier tried to become involved in the fist fight between Mr Chambour and the Sabbagh brothers. Whilst both Akkawi and Chambour used a knife at Granville, it was not the same knife and although they were known to each other, and an inference can be drawn that they were friends, there is no evidence to suggest that they acted in concert or in company. Akkawi appears to have been motivated to seek revenge for the damage done to his shirt when he became involved in the scuffle and was assaulted as recorded in [10] of exhibit T4. The retaliation carried out by Mr Chambour could have been motivated not merely because of his initial perception of Tallal Sabbagh’s being interested in his wife but also by his coming “second best” in his fight with the Sabbagh brothers and, perhaps, by his knowledge of the assault perpetrated by his wife by Amid Sabbagh.
	
	
	The Crown in its tendency notice relies upon Chambour’s participating in physical violence using a knife “with co-offenders.” Initially, the only co-offender that the Crown identified in exhibit T4 was the unidentified person who supplied Mr Chambour with the knife as set out in [13] of exhibit T4. The supply of a knife to Chambour may make the person who supplied the knife an accessory before the fact but it hardly makes him a co-offender in the perpetration of acts of violence whilst wielding the knife. Akkawi appears to have acted independently of Chambour. I cannot categorise, on the facts before me Akkawi and Chambour as co-offenders. They were not charged with complicity or conspiracy or being members of a joint criminal enterprise. Mr Chambour was not charged in those proceedings in the way that he is charged in these proceedings.
	
	
	In the matter at Granville it appears that Chambour was motivated by what he perceived as being a personal insult, insult of another man’s being interested in his wife and then the insult to his person when he came “second best” in his fight with the Sabbagh brothers. It is also clear that he could have been “hot under the collar” because of the assault committed on his wife. In the current matter Chambour had no role to play in the initiation of the original affray, the starting off the process. He had no part to play in the initiation of the second affray which commenced when the second group of persons at the Opera Bar decided to give chase to the first group of people who were leaving the Opera Bar for the car park.
	
	
	It is clear from Mr Collins’ statement, exhibit T7 and also exhibit 5-5, that he was restrained by Mr Collins until after both groups had, in essence, left the Opera Bar. At [13] of Mr Collins’ statement the following commenced:
	


“13. The fight had started to calm down, there was still a bit of pushing and shoving and there were still words being exchanged. There were lots of swear words and yelling, but I didn’t pick up on anything that was really being said. The man on the ground with me hadn’t said a word to me at this stage. I picked him up with my arm still around his neck. The group of people fighting had started to move towards the ATM and a pedestrian down ramp into the car park. We started to walk after the group so I could get a better view of what the situation was. I still had a hold of him at this stage.

14. The man in the grey jumper that I had on the ground was talking to me. He said ‘Let me go, let me go, they’re my friends, I need to help them.’ I looked away and ignored him, I wanted to look distracted. He was very calm, he wasn’t yelling at me. He didn’t try to budge, he wasn’t resisting or anything.

15. As we arrived just before the ATM, I let him go because he didn’t seem like a threat to me. He was calm and collected and I thought that he wasn’t going to do anything.”

In other words, as far as Mr Collins was concerned, at that stage Mr Chambour was not “hot under the collar” or agitated or perceiving himself in any way to have been slighted. He may have wanted to render assistance to his friends, but that could have been to provide assistance in the form of first aid, or, perhaps merely by pulling assailants apart. The picture of Mr Chambour painted by Mr Collins at the time Mr Collins, let him go, is, in my view, to be contrasted with the activity of Mr Chambour at Granville a year earlier, when everything points to his being motivated by jealousy and/or revenge and/or perceived personal slight when one would expect him to be acting “hot under the collar”.


	
	The motive that the Crown must be alleging in the current proceedings is that Mr Chambour wished to participate in the acts of violence, not to redress any insult or slight to himself, but to redress insult or slight to some of his friends. In my view the only similarity between what occurred at Granville in 2012 and what is alleged to have occurred at the Sydney Opera House in 2013 was the use of a knife. The use of a knife is, the Crown concedes, insufficient of itself to prove a tendency. Likewise the use of fists is of itself insufficient to prove a tendency. Likewise the fact of being in company is of itself insufficient to prove a tendency. However, although it is alleged in these proceedings that Chambour acted in company, I am not persuaded on the evidence that the Crown seeks to adduce as tendency evidence that it establishes that the offender acted using a knife in company. Likewise the use of personal violence of personal violence by itself is insufficient to establish any tendency.
	
	
	In my view there is not sufficient similarity to warrant the admission of the evidence of what occurred at Granville as tendency evidence for what occurred at the Sydney Opera House almost a year later. The facts are very different and, as I said it, merely suggests a propensity to use a knife, which the Crown admits is insufficient to establish any tendency.
	
	
	Furthermore, even if the evidence had any probative value it is not in my view significant probative value and this is yet another case where the evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce ought be excluded pursuant to s 101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995. In essence that subsection provides that tendency evidence about a defendant is not to be adduced by the prosecution against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. Where the evidence about identification is in conflict, and where it is clear that somebody has been stabbed, it would be very easy for a jury to argue impermissibly that since the accused Chambour had previously used a knife in a fight that he must have been a wielding a knife in the Sydney Opera House car park on 8 September 2013. The prejudice that may occur in my view outweighs any probative value that the evidence has, and, furthermore, although a tribunal of fact, whether it be a jury or a judge sitting alone, would have to be warned strenuously about not misusing the tendency evidence inappropriately, there is always the possibility that it could be used impermissibly by the tribunal of fact.
	
	
	In those circumstances I reject the tender of the alleged tendency evidence.

2770892,R v Chambour; R v Khallouf (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 245,"ruling on application for trial by judge alone


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an application for leave under s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to make an application out of time for trial of the current proceedings by judge alone. I have permitted the application for leave to run in tandem with the substantive application under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	This is the second interlocutory ruling that I must make in these proceedings. I spent some time yesterday on the first interlocutory ruling, setting out the background of the matter. Two things have changed in substance since that time. This morning the Crown sought leave and was granted leave to file a fresh indictment. That indictment contains only six counts, whereas the previous indictment contained seven counts.
	
	
	The indictment dated this day has had removed from it what was previously count 1 which was a charge of affray, to which the accused George Chambour pleaded guilty. The fresh indictment dated this day contains those charges to which pleas of not guilty have been entered. The only other difference is that the pleading of various counts under s 35(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 has been expanded such that, for example, the current count 3, previously count 4, is now worded in this fashion:
	


""On the 8th day of January 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, while in company, did wound Chris Pattison and was reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to Chris Pattison or any other person.""


	
	The Crown has also announced this morning that it is not relying upon the extended definition of ""recklessness"" contained in s 4A of the Crimes Act 1900, and does not seek to establish proof of any count alleging recklessness by proving a requisite intention.
	
	
	The Crown case is now narrowed in that the Crown alleges in respect of current counts 3 and 4 that Mr Khallouf wounded Chris Pattison and Kurtis Pattison and was reckless as to causing each of them actual bodily harm. The Crown does not seek to allege that Mr Khallouf intentionally wounded either Chris Pattison or Kurtis Pattison. Likewise, the Crown does not seek to prove that the accused, George Chambour, intentionally wounded Patrick White, but it is the Crown case that George Chambour wounded Patrick White and was reckless as to causing him actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In the alternative to each of those counts, the Crown still alleges that each of the accused was part of an extended joint criminal enterprise to inflict actual bodily harm.
	
	
	I should at the outset say something about the history of these proceedings as that history has been described to me by counsel. Paragraph 2 of the written submissions of Mr Vasic, on behalf of Mr Chambour (MFI 4), contained this matter:
	


""The trial of Mr Chambour, Kbayli and Khallouf was set down to commence on 19 September 2016. Five weeks earlier, on 15 August 2016, the Crown served its Crown Case Statement [exhibit 1-1]. Such Statement did not state that it was the Crown case that Mr Chambour stabbed Patrick White [nor did that statement state that it was the Crown case that Mr Khallouf stabbed Chris Pattison and Kurtis Pattison.] It was also unclear as to precisely what evidence was relied on to support an allegation that Mr Chambour entered into an agreement and participated in any joint criminal enterprise to recklessly wound the three victims. During the week commencing 5 September 2016 the writer had some discussion with the allocated Crown Prosecutor. On 12 September 2016 a no bill application was served on behalf of Mr Chambour. While that no bill application was being considered, on 13 September 2016 the DPP served a Tendency Notice. On 15 September 2016 we [Mr Chambour's legal representatives] were notified that the no bill application was rejected. On Friday 16 September 2016 a request for further and better particulars of the Crown case was served on the DPP [exhibit 16-16]. An amended Crown case was then served on all three accused [exhibit 3-3]. In discussion between each counsel, it was agreed that a Judge Alone application would be made. The Crown were [sic] put on notice and the consent of the Crown was sought. The three accused were informed that instructions were required to be obtained before consent could be given. On 18 September 2016, written submissions prepared by Ms Francis on behalf of all accused were served on the DPP in support of this Application.

On Monday 19 September 2016, Mr Chambour signed the Judge Alone application. It could not be signed earlier as Mr Chambour was in transit, being in custody for other matters.

On Tuesday 20 September 2016, the Crown informed the defence that instructions in relation to consent were obtained and the application would not be consented to.""


	
	The matter was then allocated to me and came before me on Wednesday, 21 September 2016. By that stage the former accused, Abraham Kbayli, had reached an accommodation with the Crown and had entered certain pleas which are unknown to me. However, rather than being three accused on 21 September 2016, there were only the current two accused and the Crown served a further Crown Case Summary which is exhibit 2-2.
	
	
	The written submissions of counsel for the accused Khallouf, Ms Francis, have been marked 1 for identification. After stating the requisite statutory requirements, Ms Francis stated this:
	


""The critical facts in issue concern:

• what inferences can properly be drawn from the conduct of the accused Khallouf as captured on CCTV footage - Opera Bar;

• what inferences can properly be drawn from the conduct of each of the accused as captured on CCTV footage - elevator car park area and;

• what acts can be reliably attributed to the accused - by circumstantial reasoning from the various inconsistent descriptions of civilian witnesses (largely of the clothes) worn by different persons in the melee in the car park area and;

• to the extent that this is possible, what inferences can be drawn from the same.""

The reference in the first paragraph of that quotation concerning the conduct of the accused Khallouf is equally applicable to the accused George Chambour.


	
	It is to be noted immediately, however, that although these issues would appear to be complex, they are all issues of fact, and issues of fact which are commonly dealt with by a jury. I have been addressed at some length about the superior ability of judges to make findings of fact because those findings of fact must disclose a reasoning process. However, judges can get facts wrong, especially when the facts depend upon the accuracy and reliability of eyesight and often 12 heads are better than one in drawing an appropriate inference from what is displayed on film or the like.
	
	
	The next sentence in Ms Francis' submissions point out that neither of the accused is identified by any of the civilian eyewitnesses. That is because the identity of each of the accused would have been unknown to the members of the first group. There is no suggestion that any member of the first group of people that I identified yesterday knew any member of the group of second people that I identified yesterday. It is clear that there are inconsistent descriptions from lay witnesses. It is perhaps appropriate for me to demonstrate that by referring to the case that the Crown sought to make against Abraham Kbayli.
	
	
	Mr Kbayli was wearing, at the time of his arrest, the attire shown in exhibit 21-21. That shows him with dark coloured hair and wearing a shirt that to me is the colour of the jacaranda flower which I would describe as lilac. That shirt has been variously described as purple or purplish, as maroon, as dark, and by one witness, at least, as bone. It also shows him wearing very dark coloured trousers which appear to me to be navy blue but they could be black. The activity of Abraham Kbayli is, of the three of Kbayli, Chambour and Khallouf, most easy to work out from the CCTV footage, exposed in both the Opera Bar and on the pedestrian ramp of the carpark and probably because it can be so readily identified that Kbayli reached an accommodation with the Crown.
	
	
	However, all of these things are questions of fact, questions of fact which are commonly dealt with by a jury. For example, another issue turns around the fact that two relevant actors at the Opera Bar are the accused Youssef Khallouf and Mahmoud Barakat and I described at some length yesterday how each was dressed in a striped shirt, pointing out the differences that can be gleaned from certain of the exhibits before me, namely exhibits 6-6 and 7-7. However, a jury is just as well equipped to work out who is who and who may have done what from the CCTV footage as any judge.
	
	
	Mr Vasic's written submissions, which have been marked MFI 4, raise a number of grounds in addition to the complexity of the factual issues.
	
	
	The first is the likely length and complexity of the trial. Initially I was told that the case would take four weeks, that was the estimate with the matter to be tried by a jury. Both Ms Francis and Mr Vasic tell me that in a trial by judge alone the matter would take but a few days. I have some doubts about such a short estimate for the hearing of the matter. Exhibit 25-25 is the Crown's witness list. Assuming that it be not necessary to call any police witnesses, perhaps other than the officer in charge, and assuming that it is not necessary to call the DNA expert and that there is no issue about whether the physical damage done to the complainants amounted to a wound and therefore that it is not necessary to call any doctor, the Crown still intends to call 18 witnesses. No doubt the witnesses, as I have been told by the learned Crown Prosecutor, will be asked to identify themselves on the CCTV footage and asked to explain which direction at any one time they were facing and what they could observe. The evidence, even on a trial by judge alone, would take a number of weeks. Mr Vasic raised the likely length and complexity of the trial, but those pragmatic considerations do not appear to me to be as favourable as counsel for the accused would ask me to believe.
	
	
	Mr Vasic also emphasised in his written submissions, and even more forcefully orally, that because of the way the Crown case was constructed this was a case which required a reasoned judgment. On p 5 of his written submissions he said this:
	


""The directions required to be given to a jury would include an explanation of the concepts of 'joint criminal enterprise' as well as 'extended joint criminal enterprise' and how such concepts are to be applied to the facts of this case. The distinction between the two concepts is confusing to lawyers at times, let alone to a jury. In the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book it is noted that the standard direction to a jury in relation to 'joint criminal enterprise' and 'extended joint criminal enterprise' 'are merged because the distinction may be confusing to a jury' (at [2-740]). The proper application of legal principles to the facts of this matter is critical. The provision of a written judgment affords to both the accused and to the public an explanation of the steps and the reasoning process of the decision maker. It serves to enhance the interests of justice"".

I should point out that the directions that are referred to by Mr Vasic in that extract from his written submissions are directions given to juries each week in the criminal courts of this State.


	
	The next issue concerns identification evidence. It is trite law that judges know that identification evidence may be unreliable. Indeed when directing juries on identification evidence, judges tell the juries exactly that and try to point out to juries the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in the past because of close relatives misidentifying people and of people being misidentified and spending lengthy periods in gaol when they were in fact not guilty. However, because identification is a difficult issue the more reason to give such a warning to the jury, and in the event a judge sitting alone would have to give himself the same warning. Juries are commonly required to identify an offender from things such as CCTV footage, stills taken from it and the descriptions of witnesses, doing the best they can, which often depends upon their state of sobriety. These are essentially questions of fact.
	
	
	Mr Vasic also asked me to take into account the subjective views of each of the accused and his belief that a jury trial may not be fair and that therefore a jury should be dispensed with. Clearly the case law requires me to take that into account. Traditionally a jury was used to prevent the agents of the Crown, judges and magistrates, dealing harshly with the subject. These days some members of the public believe that a jury may be more harsh yet fair to the subject than a judge might be, but subjective to views do not necessarily end up providing objective justice.
	
	
	The thrust of both the case argued by Ms Francis and the case argued by Mr Vasic is that this is a difficult factual case and would be better served by a judge giving reasons, which might obviate any possible appeal from the jury's decision. The only case which each of the accused and the Crown referred me to is the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; (2012) 217 A Crim R 1. Commencing at [54] McClellan CJ at CL said this:
	


""54. McKechnie J considered the content of the phrase 'interests of justice'. His Honour concluded that the interests of justice are not 'coterminous' with the interests of the accused (R v Cox [1960] VR 665).

And said (at [31]):

To the undue account to the subjective views of an accused person, as suggested in Arthurs at [79], [80] may have the result that a decision is really being made for the interests of an accused, not the interests of justice.

55. His Honour expressed his confidence in the jury system of trial, saying (at [32]):

'There is a public interest in the administration of justice carried out in public and in serious cases by the representatives of the public sitting as jurors. The fact that a judge must deliver written reasons where a jury gives a general verdict, is of no consequence. That is the difference between the two modes of trial provided for by law. The inscrutability of a verdict of 12 is tempered by unanimity. The verdict of one is tempered by the exposure of reasons. The interests of justice cannot then be affected by the mode of trial, each being valid"".

His Honour began his consideration of s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 at [89]. In particular I have closely perused what follows thereafter. I have directed myself in accordance with [96] to [101] of that decision which I shall not cite because of its length.


	
	At [110] his Honour turned to the question of efficiencies available in a judge alone trial. The Chief Judge at Common Law accepted that a consideration of efficiencies was part of the mix of issues that must be considered on an application under s 132 and those efficiencies included the likely length of a trial in any particular case, the difference of course being the length of a trial by jury and the length of a trial by judge alone. Commencing at [112] his Honour went on to say this:
	


""As the reasons of Martin CJ in Arthurs make plain, the Chief Justice considered the requirement for a judge to give reasons to be a significant factor when considering where the interests of justice lie. To my mind the opportunity which a reasoned judgment affords to the accused and to the public to understand the steps in the reasoning process of the decision-maker compared with the inscrutability of the jury's decision, will depending upon all of the circumstances, be a factor which is relevant to the decision as to whether to order a judge-alone trial. However, it is but one factor and the weight to be given to it would depend upon the nature of the issues to be determined in the trial. If the trial will involve complex engineering, scientific or medical issues it may be more readily concluded that a verdict accompanied by the reasons of the trial judge would enhance the interests of justice both in relation to the accused and the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system. It would inevitably facilitate an appeal if the trial judge had erred"".

This is hardly a case involving complex engineering, scientific or medical issues. The issues to be tried are issues dealt with every week by juries in the State and have been for nearly 200 years.


	
	In the same case Hidden J said this commencing at [119]:
	


""119 On the issue of reasons for a verdict as a factor bearing upon the choice of the mode of trial, I share the view of McKechnie J in TVM v Western Australia (2007) 180 A Crim R 183 expressed in the passage from his judgment quoted at [55] of the reasons of the Chief Judge. The fact that there is now provision in New South Wales for majority verdicts (allowing for only one dissenting juror) does not reduce the force of his Honour's observations.

120. The perceived desirability of reasons for a verdict and the efficiency of the conduct of a criminal trial may well be matters of policy which the Legislature would consider if it were examining whether jury trials should be abolished or modified. However, as the law stands, I can see little or no place for either consideration in determining the appropriate mode of trial, but I would prefer to express no concluded view about the matter"".

The mere fact that a judge gives reasons and the mere fact that reasons are desirable if only to assist in appellate review are insufficient reasons of themselves to decide the appropriate mode of trial. The issues in this case, despite their claimed complexity, are issues normally determined by a jury which brings into the decision making process the life experiences of 12 members of the community.


	
	There are a number of crimes which cause grave public disquiet. Public violence is such a case. It is important that the public interest in the administration of justice carried out in public be done by the representatives of the public sitting as jurors, as observed by McKechnie J in the Western Australian case referred to by both McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J.
	
	
	One alleged complication has been removed. I yesterday ruled against the admission of alleged tendency evidence. That is one a matter which will not complicate any jury trial or for that matter any judge alone trial. However, the more I consider the arguments advanced the more those arguments boil down to the allegation that the facts are complex and therefore that there should be reasons given by the tribunal of fact. The facts are ones which can be determined by a jury, and normally are, and the fact that a judge sitting alone gives reasons is in itself an inadequate justification for determining that the matter be tried by a judge alone.
	
	
	For those reasons I grant to each of the accused leave under s 132A to make an application for trial by a judge alone but pursuant to s 132 I dismiss those applications.

		18 October 2016",2016-09-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2770898,Dimian v R [2016] NSWCCA 223,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	HALL J:   I agree with the reasons of Davies J and the orders he has proposed.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant pleaded guilty on 26 March 2015 at the Parramatta District Court to two counts as follows:
	


1.   Detain for advantage and cause substantial injury. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment; and

2.   Aggravated sexual assault, the aggravation being malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment.

The Applicant asked the Court to take into account in relation to the second offence a further offence of aggravated sexual assault. I shall refer to these three offences as the index offences.


	
	The Applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge M Williams SC on 17 April 2015 to an aggregate sentence with a non-parole period of six years commencing 17 February 2014 and expiring 16 February 2020 with an additional term of three years expiring 16 February 2023. The Sentencing Judge specified the indicative sentences as being two years for the first offence and five years and six months for the second offence taking into account the Form 1.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. Before setting out the grounds of appeal it is necessary to detail the facts of the index offences and to identify other offending by the Applicant.
	


The offences charged


	
	The offences were committed on 3 April 1993. The identity of the Applicant as the offender was only established in 2013 when a “cold case” notification was received that the DNA profile taken from the Applicant matched vaginal and vulval samples taken from the victim. At that time, and for many years preceding that time, the Applicant was in custody serving other sentences for similar offences all of which were committed after the present offences. The present offences were the first offences of a sexual nature known to be committed by the Applicant.
	
	
	Just before midnight on Friday the 2nd of April 1993, RA (""the victim"") went to the Crescent Hotel in Fairfield to meet friends. She was 31 years of age at the time. She found her friend Pam upstairs, and joined her at the bar.
	
	
	The Applicant approached the victim at the bar and introduced himself. He struck up a conversation with the victim, who told him she was having one drink and would then go home. The Applicant offered to drive the victim home, but she declined the offer. He then said to her, ""You can trust me. I'll drop you home. I'm a Cop.""
	
	
	The victim laughed, so the Applicant repeated himself two to three times. The victim then agreed the Applicant could drive her home as she believed he was a police officer. They walked out of the club to where the Applicant had parked his car. The victim believed the car was a red Holden Commodore. The victim told the Applicant she lived along The Horsley Drive. She got into the Applicant's car in the front passenger seat and he started driving.
	
	
	When they approached a round-about, the Applicant drove straight through instead of turning left, and the victim realised they were going the wrong way. She asked the Applicant where he was going and he replied, ""Hang on, I've just got to go and do something."" As they were driving, he was making conversation with the victim about where she worked and other matters.
	
	
	The Applicant turned off Smithfield Road into parkland attached to the Fairfield Showground. The victim asked, ""Where the hell do you think you're going?"" The Applicant didn't respond. He drove along a dirt road and then stopped the car. The victim said, “I want you to take me back"". The Applicant replied, ""No, get used to it, you're not going anywhere."" The victim became scared and thought that if she got out of the car, she may be able to walk away. She picked up her handbag from the foot well and opened the passenger door. The Applicant grabbed her hair and pulled her towards him. She turned around and scratched his left cheek with her fingernails. She could see at least three scratch marks on his face. The Applicant punched the victim in the face and said, ""You're a fucking bitch for scratching me."" He said something to the victim about being married and his wife seeing the scratch marks. The victim started crying. The Applicant said, ""Stop carrying on like a fucking idiot. You're not going anywhere until I fuck you."" The victim told the Applicant she needed to go to the toilet, thinking this would be a way she could run away. They both got out of the car.
	
	
	The victim started running but the Applicant caught up to her. He grabbed the victim by the hair and threw her to the ground. He slapped her face and said, ""You made me hurt you."" The victim was crying, kicking out with her legs and swinging her arms trying to get away. The Applicant knelt on the ground next to the victim. She asked him if this was the only way he could get women, and he said it wasn't as he had a wife. The victim said, ""Well, let me go then"", and the Applicant replied, ""You're not going anywhere."" The Applicant was detaining the victim with the intent to hold her for sexual gratification.
	
	
	The Applicant grabbed the victim's handbag from her and started looking through its contents. He found something that had the victim's name and address on it and said, ""[R], [xx] Horsley Drive. I know where you live so don't try and get me into any trouble."" The Applicant moved away from the victim and she got up and started running towards some street lights. The Applicant chased after her and grabbed her by the hair and the back of her shirt. He threw her to the ground and kicked her to the left shoulder with force and said 'You're a fucking slut."" The victim screamed out and started to get up. The Applicant said, ""Look you fucking idiot, you left your handbag"", and hit the victim in the head with her bag. This knocked her to the ground again. He said ""Look do you want me to keep hurting ya."" He told the victim to go back to the car, but she refused.
	
	
	The Applicant grabbed the victim by the hair and the waist, and tried to carry her back to his car. She grabbed onto a tree and started kicking out at the Applicant. He grabbed her by the throat with one hand telling her if she walked back to his car, he would drive her back to the club in Fairfield. She refused and started punching out and kicking at him. The Applicant threw the victim to the ground and said, ""I'll just do it here then."" He asked ""Are you going to give me any more trouble. Do you want me to hurt you again?"" The victim said no.
	
	
	Whilst being knocked to the ground and dragged, slapped and kicked the victim sustained abrasions and scratches to her chest, arms, legs and feet.
	
	
	The victim was laying on her back on the ground. She was wearing a white cheese-cloth skirt with a petticoat underneath and a black top with short sleeves. The Applicant said, ""Take off your pants and put your legs up."" The victim took her underpants off, but refused to put her legs up. The Applicant grabbed the victim by the hair and said, ""Say it, you are a slut."" The Applicant knelt down between the victim's legs and undid the fly of his jeans. The victim shut her eyes. The Applicant grabbed the back of her head and pulled it towards his penis. He said, ""Suck this, and if you bite it I'll kill you."" The victim who was shaking and crying said, “I can't, I'll be sick."" The Applicant again demanded the victim suck his penis, but she turned her head to the side and started retching. She then laid back on the ground. The Applicant said, “I want you to give me a head job"". The victim who was crying replied, “I can't, you'll have to kill me.""
	
	
	The Applicant stood up and pushed his jeans and underpants down to his ankles. He then knelt down near the victim. He shoved two fingers inside her vagina with force, and she screamed out in pain. The Applicant removed his two fingers, but then inserted three fingers inside the victim's vagina with force. He moved his fingers around inside the victim's vagina, which caused her pain. She yelled, ""Stop, it's hurting!"" The victim felt as if the Applicant pushed his three fingers into her vagina as far as they could go. She could hear the Applicant making moaning noises as if he were masturbating at the same time. At the time of, or immediately before or after the sexual assault the Applicant inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim.
	
	
	As a result of having three fingers forcibly shoved into her vagina the victim sustained a 0.5cm linear graze to the left of the posterior fouchette (frenulum of labia minora) and a 0.3cm red linear graze to the left of the urethral orifice.
	
	
	After a period of time the Applicant said to the victim, ""Open your legs up further."" She moved them a little bit as she didn't want him to hurt her. He pushed her shoulder and said, ""Open your legs or I'll roll you over and fuck you up the arse."" The victim, who was crying, moved her legs apart in compliance with the demand. The Applicant laid down on top of the victim and inserted his penis into her vagina. He held her down with his arm across her neck so that she could not move. As a result the victim sustained bruising to her neck. He thrust his penis in and out of the victim's vagina for about five minutes. The victim continued to cry. At one stage the Applicant said, ""You asked for this.""
	
	
	The Applicant withdrew his penis and stood up. The victim opened her eyes and saw the Applicant pulling up his jeans. She sat up and pulled her skirt down. The Applicant picked up the victim's handbag and looked through its contents again. He then threw the bag at the victim.
	
	
	The Applicant said to the victim he would take her home. She didn't want to get back into his car, so she told him she had a friend who lived nearby. He tried to pull her by the arm, but she resisted. She then turned around, ran to a nearby road and tried to wave down passing cars. The Applicant did not follow her.
	
	
	The victim felt ejaculate coming out of her vagina and realised she wasn't wearing underpants. She continued to walk along Smithfield Road until a taxi stopped and the driver asked if she was all right. She said, “I’ve been raped and I don't know where I am."" She got into the taxi and was driven to the Wetherill Park police station.
	
	
	A short time later, police drove the victim along Smithfield Road, and she was able to show them where the assault had occurred near the Fairfield Showground.
	
	
	At 8:00am that day, Saturday the 3rd of April 1993, police took the victim to Liverpool Hospital where a sexual assault investigation was undertaken. She gave a detailed account of the assault to the doctor and a counsellor, and reported that the accused asked her to suck his penis, and had digital and penile penetration of her vagina. The doctor observed 32 recent bruises, abrasions and scratches on the victim's neck, chest, arms, hands, legs, feet, buttocks and back. These included two 2.5cm long scratches over her right buttocks cheek that were bleeding. The genital examination revealed, as noted earlier, injuries to the posterior fourchette and the urethral orifice. Vulval, upper and lower vaginal swabs and smears, blood and scrapings from under her right fingernails were taken for forensic investigation. The victim's skirt, bra, t-shirt and slip were also seized by Police. Semen was detected on the high vaginal, low vaginal and vulval smears, the skirt and the slip.
	
	
	As mentioned, in 2013 a 'cold case' notification matched the DNA profile taken from the Applicant with the vaginal and vulval samples taken from the victim. The Applicant’s DNA profile from the sample obtained in September 2013 was compared against the sperm fraction of the DNA recovered from the combined vaginal and vulval swabs taken from the victim during the SAIK in 1993. The DNA recovered has the same profile as the Applicant, and is expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 billion individuals in the population.
	


Subsequent offending


	
	The Applicant committed offences of aggravated sexual assault and aggravated indecent assault against a 14 year old girl (MG) on 26 June 1993. His conviction for those offences was quashed on appeal and a retrial was ordered. He subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault and was sentenced by Judge O’Reilly on 23 March 1998 to imprisonment for four years and ten months concluding 22 December 2003 with a non-parole period of two years and four months commencing 23 March 1998 and concluding 22 July 2000.
	
	
	In July 1996 the Applicant committed a further offence of sexual intercourse with a child aged ten to 16 years (RS) for which he was sentenced by Judge Sides QC on 28 November 2013. I will return to that sentence later in the chronology.
	
	
	Prior to being apprehended for that offence he committed an offence of sexual intercourse without consent against another woman (XW) on 6 October 2002. He was sentenced for that offence on 27 September 2004 by Judge Marien SC to a non-parole period of six years commencing 18 February 2003 and expiring 17 February 2009 with an additional term of three years expiring 17 February 2012.
	
	
	Before he was apprehended for the offence committed 6 October 2002 he committed a further offence of sexual intercourse without consent against another woman (ST) on 14 October 2002. He was sentenced for that offence on 4 August 2005 by Judge Marien to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of six years partly accumulated on the earlier sentence imposed by Judge Marien. The non-parole period commenced 18 February 2008 and expired 17 February 2014 with an additional period of three years expiring 17 February 2017.
	
	
	On 28 November 2013 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Sides for the offence committed in July 1996. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years commencing 18 February 2012 and concluding 17 February 2015 with an additional term of three years concluding 17 February 2018.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The Notice of Appeal filed 18 April 2016 pleaded two grounds as follows:
	


1.   The sentencing judge erred by imposing an aggregate sentence that exceeded the sum of the indicative sentences that he would have imposed for each offence had he not sentenced the Applicant to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment.

2.   The sentencing Judge failed to reflect the principle of totality in the aggregate sentence he imposed.


	
	On 22 August 2016 the Applicant filed Amended Grounds of Appeal on which he sought leave to rely at the hearing adding these grounds:
	


(3)(a)   The sentencing judge erred by failing to consider the overall appropriate sentence to be served by the Applicant having regard to the Applicant's history of incarceration.

(3)(b)   The sentencing judge erred by imposing a sentence upon the Applicant which, when accumulated upon the Applicant's existing sentencing of imprisonment, resulted in a ratio of the effective non-parole period to the overall term of 85%.

(4)   The sentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate weight to the circumstance of delay.

Subjective matters


	
	These matters may be relatively briefly stated since, apart from the Applicant’s progress in addressing his sexual offending, they were not matters put forward as having any particular relevance to the sentencing issues this Court needs to determine.
	
	
	The Applicant was the second eldest in a family of four children of Egyptian parents. The family moved to Australia in about 1969. After the Applicant completed his Higher School Certificate he went into the retail industry and worked in a number of department stores working his way up to the position of store manager at a Norman Ross store. He attended Sydney University part time and completed a degree in Marketing whilst continuing to work fulltime. He worked in marketing for Rothmans, then Repco, then WD and HO Wills prior to his arrest in 1993 for the offence in respect of which he was sentenced by Judge O’Reilly. He was then aged 31 years.
	
	
	He married at the age of 19 and divorced in 1996 although the dynamics of the marriage changed in 1991 when his wife started living more independently and that led to the deterioration in their relationship. They separated in 1993 when the Applicant was charged with the offence committed in that year for which he was sentenced by Judge O’Reilly.
	
	
	There were three children born to the marriage but one died very young from cot death. His daughters are now adults.
	
	
	The Applicant has been assessed by a number of psychologists over the years with particular attention being given to his sexual offending. The most recent report which was before the Sentencing Judge was that of Mr Yat Sang Cheung dated 12 April 2015.
	


Mr Cheung considered that the Applicant suffered from major depression accompanied by clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Mr Cheung also assessed him using the Static-99R instrument which indicated that he belonged to a moderate to high risk category of sexual reoffending. He also assessed the Applicant using the Risk for Sexual Violence Protocol which assesses dynamic and static risk factors. On that Protocol he was assessed as being in the moderate to high range of risk of reoffending. By the time Mr Cheung saw the Applicant he had completed the intensive CUBIT program for sex offenders in 2013.


	
	The Sentencing Judge also had a report from the Acting Therapeutic Manager of the CUBIT program and a psychologist who worked in that program in relation to the Applicant’s participation within treatment and his behaviour within that program. This report was dated 20 June 2013. The offences with which the report was principally concerned were the two offences committed in October 2002. However, the report took into account the earlier sexual offending but not the index offences nor the offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Sides on 28 November 2013.
	
	
	The report said that the Applicant had a tendency to blame others and, with his limited insight into that behaviour, demonstrated some difficulty accepting responsibility for his behaviour in general. The report identified two pathways to offending being hostility towards women and a sense of entitlement. In the assessment of dynamic factors the report considered that the Applicant appeared to hold distorted attitudes towards women and had a history of poor cooperation with supervision. The report considered that he appeared to have a good understanding of longer term strategies by which to work towards goals. However, he tended to struggle with intervening in his behaviours during times of intense discomfort. The report concluded that taking into account both static and dynamic risk factors his risk rating was moderate to high.
	
	
	The Applicant relied also on references from two clergymen who have been ministering to the Applicant. One was Father Tadros El-Bakhoumi who has been visiting the Applicant in prison for more than 12 years. Father Tadros said that in April 2015 the Applicant was a totally different person, very mature in understanding and who was very remorseful. His life had changed from the person he was. Father Tadros offered for the Applicant to live with him and others at a monastery under his supervision at Tarago near Goulburn. The other reference was from the Anglican chaplain at Long Bay Correctional Centre, the Reverend Colin Sheehan.
	


The course of the appeal


	
	The Crown had addressed in her written submissions what was asserted to be the error referred to in ground 1 of the appeal, namely, that the Sentencing Judge had imposed an aggregate sentence that exceeded the sum of the indicative sentences. The Crown submitted that if the Sentencing Judge intended the indicative sentences to represent head sentences for each of the offences then error was conceded. However, the Crown submitted that there was no statutory requirement that indicative sentences represent a head sentence relying in that regard on what was said by Basten JA in McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184 at [139]. The Crown submitted, essentially, that it was a matter of construction of the Sentencing Judge’s Reasons whether he was intending that the indicative sentences were head sentences or non-parole periods.
	
	
	The Crown submitted there were three reasons to suggest that his Honour was referring to the non-parole period. First, the Sentencing Judge set the aggregate sentence, both the head sentence and the non-parole period, and then immediately indicated the indicative sentences. The Crown submitted that it could not be supposed that the Sentencing Judge would have intended the head sentence to exceed the sum of the head indicative sentences for each offence.
	
	
	Secondly, the non-parole period of the aggregate sentence of six years was only six months higher than the indicative sentence for the offence of aggravated sexual assault. Partial accumulation of six months for the offence of detain for advantage was consistent with the Sentencing Judge having appropriately permitted a large degree of concurrency in the sentences for the two offences in view of the overlap in criminality between that offence and the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse.
	
	
	Thirdly, viewing the indicative sentences as non-parole periods was consistent with the Sentencing Judge having formed the view that the offence of aggravated sexual assault was in the upper end of the range of objective seriousness for such offences and deserving of severe punishment. A head sentence of five years and six months for that offence would not accord with that assessment of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Court indicated at the outset of the appeal that, having considered the Crown’s submissions, it was of the view that there was a clear error on the face of the Sentencing Judge’s reasons. The Court’s reasons for that approach are these.
	
	
	Section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) enables the Court to impose an aggregate sentence with respect to all or any two or more offences. Sub-section (2) says that the Court must indicate “the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence”. On any proper construction of s 53A seen in the context of the whole of the Sentencing Act, the sentence that would have been imposed (called the indicative sentence) must be a reference to the overall sentence. The Sentencing Act does not contemplate two sentences for any one offence. It contemplates a sentence and in many cases a non-parole period and a balance of the term.
	
	
	In JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297; (2014) 246 A Crim R 528 R A Hulme J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreeing) set out at [39] a number of propositions emerging from the legislative provisions and the cases in relation to aggregate sentencing. Any suggestion that an indicative sentence is the non-parole period is inconsistent with those propositions. In particular, the requirement in s 54B(4) to indicate the non-parole period for an indicative sentence where the penalty for the offence carries a standard non-parole period, and the absence of a requirement to state a non-parole period in s 53A, is the strongest indication that an indicative sentence is the head sentence that would have been imposed. Nothing said by Basten JA in McIntosh suggests otherwise. The only circumstance where an indicative sentence might be thought to equate with a non-parole period would be where the Sentencing Judge expressly said that the indicative sentence was to be treated as a fixed term which, as Basten JA notes in McIntosh at [139] is to be equated with a non-parole period.
	
	
	There is nothing in the Remarks of the Sentencing Judge in the present case to suggest that the indicative sentences were to be fixed terms which, as Basten JA points out in McIntosh at [140] is not a term that appears in the Sentencing Procedure Act. It is the term employed when a judge does not set a non-parole period pursuant to s 45 of the Act.
	
	
	Accordingly, the indicative sentences referred to by the Sentencing Judge must be regarded as the head sentences for each of the offences. Inasmuch as the total of them was less than the aggregate sentence imposed, error has been demonstrated.
	
	
	That conclusion meant that the other grounds, including the grounds in the Amended Grounds of Appeal, did not need to be pursued although the issues they raised were relevant on the re-sentencing that needed to be carried out by reason of what was said in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601.
	


Submissions on re-sentence


	
	The Applicant submitted that there were three matters to which close attention needed to be given. The first was the appropriate proportion between the total effective non-parole period and the overall term to be served by the Applicant. The second matter involved the proper application of the principle of totality which goes beyond seeking an appropriate ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence. The third matter was the matter of delay which the Applicant submitted was a significant and relevant factor in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	In dealing with the first and second of those matters the Applicant submitted that it would be appropriate to apply a 75% ratio to produce a total effective non-parole period of 15 years. That would involve a reduction in the non-parole period of two years while leaving the head sentence at nine years. The Applicant submitted that the same result could be achieved by backdating the sentence to a greater extent than the Sentencing Judge had done. The Applicant drew attention to matters concerning totality discussed in R v MAK, R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159. The Applicant drew attention to the danger of institutionalisation given the length of the sentences already served by him.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the evidence concerning his rehabilitation was such that a longer of period of parole was required to assist in that process. The Applicant pointed to the CUBIT report which indicated the therapeutic gains that could be made under appropriate supervision.
	
	
	On the issue of delay the Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge had focused on two of the three relevant considerations only, being prospects of rehabilitation and having the offence hanging over the offender’s head. The third consideration that was not dealt with was the fact that the offences could properly be regarded as stale offences. The Applicant submitted they were stale offences because they occurred some decades ago, he had been severely and excessively punished in the interim period, the interim offending had been like offending and the offending was for offences that post-dated the present offences.
	
	
	The Applicant said that these three principal matters (ratio, totality and delay) should result in an adjustment to the sentence which might involve the overall sentence but should certainly result in an adjustment of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the offence involved serious violent conduct of sexual assault against a young woman and included impersonating a police officer to enable the Applicant to take advantage of the victim. The criminality needed to be separately recognised from the other offending and needed to be the subject of specific denunciation. The Crown accepted that adjustments needed to be made to the level of accumulation on the existing sentences. There was not any need to look at the overall sentences to ensure that the statutory ratio was complied with but there may need to be an adjustment between the non-parole and the parole periods. The Crown submitted that adjusting the accumulation with nothing more was not going to bring about any adjustment between the non-parole period and the overall sentence. The Crown submitted that rather than modifying the head sentence and making a significant adjustment to accumulation the better course would be to adjust the statutory ratio for the present offences to a greater extent than had been done.
	


Determination


	
	The overall effect of the sentences identified earlier was that the Applicant had been in consistent custody since 18 February 2003. With the sentence under appeal unadjusted the Applicant will remain in custody at least until 16 February 2020, a period of 17 years. The balance of term is three years producing an overall ratio of 85%.
	
	
	It should be observed that these offences were serious offences and that the Sentencing Judge’s assessment of the offending as falling at the upper end of the range of objective seriousness and of deserving severe punishment should be accepted. Where the maximum penalty for each of the offences charged and, for that matter, the offence on the Form 1, was 20 years imprisonment, there can be no criticism of the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge when seen independently of the earlier sentences.
	
	
	In Humphries v R; Ponfield v R [2016] NSWCCA 86 the issue of sentencing offenders where a prior sentence was being served was discussed in the joint judgment of Davies and Beech-Jones JJ (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL agreed) as follows:
	


[49]   In Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 66-67 the joint judgment said:

In our opinion, the proper approach which his Honour should have taken was to ask what would be likely to have been the effective head sentence imposed if the applicant had committed all three offences of armed robbery in one jurisdiction and had been sentenced at one time. It is most unlikely that the applicant would have been sentenced to eight years on the first count, eight years with six years of it concurrent on the second count, and eight years cumulative on the third count, making an aggregate head sentence of eighteen years. Yet that, it seems to us, is the practical effect of the sentence imposed by his Honour. On the other hand, the notional exercise which we have just described tends towards a conclusion that a sentencing court dealing with all three offences at the same time would have dealt with the third offence in a similar manner to that adopted when dealing with the second, namely, by imposing a sentence of eight years with five or six years of it concurrent with the earlier sentences. The aggregate head sentence in that event would have been either twelve or thirteen years. An appropriate non-parole period may well not have been much more than the eight years actually imposed by the Victorian court. But, of course, it is not possible for a second sentencing court to impose a concurrent sentence of the kind we have contemplated in the absence of statutory provisions enabling the backdating of the new sentence (cf. Reg. v. Gilbert (1975) 1 WLR 1012; (1975) 1 All ER 742 and Reg. v. Garrett (1978) 18 SASR 308). Section 20 of The Criminal Code (Q.) does not allow such a course to be taken. Without statutory authority, the only course open to the second sentencing court is to adopt a lower head sentence that reflects the long deferment that has taken place during which the offender has been in custody. It is true that the lower head sentence will fail to reflect adequately the seriousness of the crime in respect of which it is imposed. That is unfortunate. However, it is to be preferred to the injustice involved in the imposition of a longer head sentence because of the inadequacy of the law to cope satisfactorily with the intervention of State boundaries.

[50]   In Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said:

[45] To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59

[51]   This passage in Pearce describes the approach most commonly adopted when addressing questions of accumulation and totality namely, first identifying the appropriate sentence for the subject offence(s) and then considering questions of accumulation, concurrency as well as totality (the “Pearce approach”) often by reference to the commencement date of the sentence. The passage from Mill set out in [49] addressed the circumstance in which a sentencing Court is required to address questions of totality in the circumstance where another court has already imposed a sentence on the offender and the sentencing court is precluded from backdating the sentence. Hence the High Court referred to the sentencing court imposing a lower head sentence and aggregating it even though the sentence imposed may “fail to reflect adequately the seriousness of the crime” (the “Mill approach”).

[52]   In Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at [26] the High Court confirmed that, depending on the legislative context, both approaches were open to sentencing judges and, in particular, the adoption of the Mill approach is not confined to circumstances where the offender had already been sentenced by another court and the sentence to be imposed cannot be backdated:

“The first matter to be noticed in this regard is that the joint judgment in Pearce recognizes the currency of Mill by referring to the principle of totality which it reiterates …. The joint judgment in Mill expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency. Pearce does not decree that a sentencing judge may never lower each sentence and then aggregate them for determining the time to be served. To do that, is not to do what the joint judgment in Pearce holds to be undesirable, that is, to have regard only to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender. The preferable course will usually be the one which both cases commend but neither absolutely commands.”


	
	Nothing in s 44 of the Sentencing Act nor in the authorities suggests the need for any consideration of the ratio of the non-parole period to the whole sentence independently of principles of totality.
	
	
	The first question that must be asked, following Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59, is what would be the appropriate head sentence if the Applicant had been sentenced for all of the offences for which he has been incarcerated since 18 February 2003? In this case, would a sentence of 20 years imprisonment be the appropriate sentence? The Applicant submitted that such a sentence with a total non-parole period of 17 years is well beyond what would have been imposed because it is the sort of sentence that would have been imposed for murder.
	
	
	A further consideration is that of institutionalisation for someone who has been serving a sentence now for 13 and a half years. That is a consideration of some significance for a repeat sex offender who at some stage, even allowing for the making of a continuing detention order under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), will have to be returned to the community at some stage. Two of the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Sentencing Act are the promotion of the rehabilitation of the offender and the protection of the community from the offender. Although keeping an offender in custody obviously protects the community in the short term it may not do so in the long term if adequate rehabilitation is not achieved particularly for a repeat sex offender. Avoiding an offender becoming institutionalised can only assist rehabilitation and, in the case of a repeat sex offender, the community is also protected by an adequate period on parole to further the rehabilitation that has taken place in custody.
	
	
	In my opinion those purposes of sentencing as well as all of the others are best achieved in the present case by leaving the head sentence at nine years but adjusting the non-parole period relative to that head sentence and by commencing the sentence at an earlier time than was done by the Sentencing Judge.
	
	
	Although the submissions dealing with delay had been directed to establishing error on the part of the Sentencing Judge, it is necessary for this Court when resentencing to consider the issue of delay.
	
	
	In R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 Street CJ identified three matters relevant to delay; the first concerned the progress of the offender’s rehabilitation during the term of an earlier sentence; the second concerned the offender’s being left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion; the third concerned the need for understanding and flexibility of approach when sentencing for a stale crime.
	
	
	In the present case, whilst it can be said on the evidence from the psychologist and those administering the CUBIT program that some progress to rehabilitation has been made, it is clear that it has some distance to go. Secondly, there is no evidence from the Applicant suggesting any state of uncertain suspense arising from the impending sentence after he was charged with these crimes committed a considerable period of time earlier. Thirdly, it is difficult, as Hall J remarked during argument, to consider that such a grave offence as that committed by the Applicant against the present victim can be said to be stale and treated in a low grade manner.
	
	
	I have some difficulty accepting, in a circumstance where the Applicant had the opportunity of admitting to these crimes since the time they were committed by him, that the delay since they were committed should result in a sentence less than appropriate for the objective seriousness of the crime, absent some unsatisfactory delay by prosecuting authorities or some compelling evidence of remorse and rehabilitation with no further offending in the meantime. In the present case the opposite is demonstrated by the continued offending in a precisely similar way on a number of occasions. There is no evidence of any unsatisfactory delay by the police or the prosecution. I consider that there is little to be said for delay being a mitigating factor on the facts of this case.
	
	
	In my opinion the Applicant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing 17 February 2013 and expiring 16 August 2017 with an additional term of four years and six months expiring 16 February 2022. The need for the lower non-parole period and the increased concurrency with the prior sentence arises only because of a proper application of the principle of totality. As noted earlier, the sentence imposed was, without considerations of totality, an entirely appropriate one for what was very serious offending. The reduced sentence should not be seen otherwise as an adequate sentence for the offences committed. It results in a ratio of a little over 76%, when the whole of the sentences are considered, and provides a reasonable period on parole to assist in rehabilitation and enabling the Applicant to learn to live again in the community.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	Appeal allowed;
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 17 April 2015. In lieu, sentence the appellant to an aggregate sentence of four years and six months commencing 17 February 2013 and expiring 16 August 2017 with an additional term of four years and six months expiring 16 February 2022.

2770899,Walker v R [2016] NSWCCA 224,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J and the orders which he proposes.
	
	
	HALL J:   I agree with the reasons of Davies J and the orders his Honour proposes.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 12 February 2014 the Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of attempted robbery armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of possession of a prohibited weapon being a Taser contrary to s 7 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW). An offence of break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act was to be dealt with on a Form 1 in relation to the count of attempted armed robbery. The Applicant was committed to the District Court for sentence on that day.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for attempted armed robbery is 20 years’ imprisonment. The maximum penalty for possessing a prohibited weapon is 14 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years. The maximum penalty for break, enter and steal is 14 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 24 July 2014 by Judge M Williams SC. On the count of attempted armed robbery and taking into account the matter on the Form 1 the Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of ten months commencing 13 November 2013 and expiring 29 September 2014 with an additional term of one year 11 months expiring 29 August 2016. In relation to the count of possessing a prohibited weapon the Applicant was sentenced to a 12 month s 9 bond.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed for the attempted armed robbery count on three grounds as follows:
	


(1)   His Honour erred in taking into account as an aggravating feature the threat of violence, it being an element of the offence of armed robbery.

(2)   His Honour erred in taking into account as an aggravating feature the use of a weapon, it being an element of the offence of armed robbery.

(3)   The Judge imposed a sentence that was unreasonable or plainly unjust in the circumstances of the Applicant's rehabilitation and is a productive (sic) of discretionary error.


	
	The Crown conceded that grounds 1 and 2 were established. In the light of that concession, which was properly made, the only issue for the Court is the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the Applicant in the re-sentencing process. Inherent in that exercise is whether any lesser sentence is warranted.
	


The facts


	
	At about 12:37am on Thursday 1 August 2013 the Applicant attended the BP Service Station located at 156 Prospect Highway, Seven Hills. The Applicant approached the night pay window where he spoke with the victim, console operator Ajit Gill. The Applicant made enquiries about purchasing a mobile phone and was shown a number of phones and was advised of the price for each. A short time later the Applicant left the premises without making any purchase, advising the victim that he was going to get money. The actions of the Applicant were captured on CCTV.
	
	
	At about 2:38am the Applicant returned to the service station. However, he went to the side of the building where he broke the lock to a side access window. The Applicant used a wooden fence paling to prop the window open before climbing through the window into the administration office of the building. The victim was standing in the adjoining console area when he was aware of a cold draught and a noise in the office. The victim activated the duress alarm and went into the office where he saw the Applicant in the office. The Applicant shouted, ""Give me money, give me money!"" The Applicant was armed with a hunting knife which had a 10cm long silver coloured serrated blade. The victim recognised the person in the office as being the same one who had earlier made enquiries about the purchase of a mobile phone.
	
	
	The victim stepped back out of the office and pulled the connecting door between the service area and the office closed. He held the door closed as the Applicant attempted to pull it open from inside the office. The victim was unable to reach the duress alarm to engage it again whilst holding the door closed. However, he used his mobile phone to contact 000. The Applicant ransacked the office and continued to yell out, ""Give me money, give me money."" The Applicant took a number of mobile telephones from the office and left through the window.
	
	
	Police attended and obtained a statement from the victim. Crime scene officers attended and located a number of fingerprints in and around the office and on the outside of the window. These were sent off for analysis. The police also obtained copies of the CCTV footage relevant to the incident.
	
	
	A media release depicting an image of the Applicant was published and as a result of information received police applied for, and were granted, a search warrant. At 7am on 7 August 2013, police attended the residence at XX Marks Avenue, Seven Hills and executed the search warrant in the presence of the Applicant who was the sole occupant of the premises. During the search police located various items of interest including: 1 x Samsung mobile phone; 1 x handwritten receipt for the sale of a hunting knife dated 2 August 2013 and signed by the offender; cardboard packaging for a Samsung Galaxy Pocket mobile phone with serial number 353629054659171.
	
	
	The Samsung phone was one of the phones stolen from the service station. The knife for which police located the handwritten receipt is similar in appearance to the knife wielded by the Applicant during the commission of the offence. The cardboard packaging for the Samsung mobile phone was for one of the other phones stolen from the service station.
	
	
	During the execution of the search warrant police also located a hand-held Taser. The device appeared to be home made and was attached to a length of electrical cord. It was capable of emitting an electrical current of 10 amps. A device that emits a current of 0.1 to 0.2 amps can kill a person.
	
	
	In relation to the offences the Applicant stated that due to his drug consumption on that date he could not recall his whereabouts or possible involvement in the commission of the offence. The Applicant stated to police that he is a regular user of methamphetamine and marijuana. The Applicant was unable to provide police with any explanation as to how he came into possession of the stolen property located during the search warrant.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Sentencing Judge had a report from the psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst dated 17 May 2014 and reports from the project administrator and a psychologist at the Australian Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence at the Canton Beach Family Addictions Recovery Centre. In addition, the Applicant gave evidence before the Sentencing Judge. The material disclosed the following.
	
	
	The Applicant was the middle of three children with an older and a younger sister. He was born in April 1984 and was 30 years of age at the time of sentencing.
	
	
	He went to a total of 16 schools and struggled with learning difficulties. His parents separated when he was 13 years of age. He started living on the streets at the age of 16 and commenced using cannabis at that time. He continued to smoke cannabis until his father’s unexpected death from heart failure in 2008. His father’s death caused him to feel suicidal and he was admitted to the psychiatric unit at Blacktown Hospital for management of his grief. He was prescribed Seroquel and Valium which he used for two to three years. Subsequently he has used Xanax.
	
	
	He continued to smoke cannabis after the death of his father and did so heavily in his mid-twenties using approximately three grams every two days. He used amphetamines from 2009 or 2010 consuming approximately 0.3 grams every second day. Between 2010 and 2012 he used amphetamines and cannabis regularly with occasional ecstasy use. He commenced using methamphetamine in 2013 and started injecting it a few months before the offences in question. He was using about one gram every two days and then used Xanax to help him come down.
	
	
	After his arrest he stopped using all drugs and undertook residential rehabilitation at the Canton Beach Centre. The reports of the Canton Beach Centre from the project administrator and the psychologist were positive about his rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Applicant completed three years of an electrical apprenticeship at TAFE from 2002 to 2005. He studied IT in 2010 over a 12 month period working in some pick and pack jobs between 2008 and 2012 and having some periods of unemployment.
	
	
	At the time he saw Dr Furst he told him that he could not stand drugs because they had ruined 14 years of his life. He said he could learn from what he had gone through and that he now had God on his side.
	
	
	While undergoing the rehabilitation at Canton Beach he commenced working part time for a Mr and Mrs Gauchi at a stonemason’s operation at Wyong. He then graduated to working fulltime with them. They were strongly supportive of the Applicant and said that they would re-employ him even if he was sentenced to fulltime custody.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge had a letter written by the Applicant to the Court expressing his remorse. He gave evidence to that effect also.
	
	
	Dr Furst said that the Applicant met criteria for the diagnosis of:
	


substance use disorder (amphetamine and cannabis dependence); and

Social anxiety disorder.

Dr Furst noted that the Applicant claimed amnesia for the offences in question which made it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about his mental state and/or motivations at the time. Dr Furst said, however, that his offences were probably driven by his addiction to drugs and probably acute intoxication with methamphetamine, cannabis and Xanax.

Remarks on sentence


	
	Although error is conceded and established the Sentencing Judge’s remarks are relevant to an understanding of the sentence imposed with a view to considering if any lesser sentence is warranted. The Sentencing Judge noted that the subjective case for the Applicant was a very compelling one. His Honour noted no offences of dishonesty on his record and some minor drug and traffic offences in 2003 and 2007.
	
	
	He had served 84 days in custody before being admitted to bail. It was agreed by counsel and his Honour that 75% of the 152 days spent in residential rehabilitation should be counted in any period of custody to which he was sentenced. The sentence was therefore to be backdated by 236 days.
	
	
	His Honour accorded him a 25% discount for the early plea.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge accepted the Applicant’s evidence that he wanted to live a clean life and start a family and noted that he had taken up with a new partner over the previous couple of months. His Honour said that he took into account the Applicant’s successful rehabilitation.
	
	
	His Honour made no finding of objective seriousness of the offending. He said that he took into account the purposes and principles of sentencing as required by s 3A of the Act and he had taken into account aggravating and mitigating factors as required by s 21A.
	
	
	His Honour then went on to say:
	


The principal aggravating factors in this case are the actual threat and use of violence, the actual threat and use of a weapon and the vulnerability of the victim as a service station attendant.

 

The powerful mitigating factors of course are those which have largely been adumbrated in various other areas by Mr Vertigan [for the Applicant], but they include that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. The offender is unlikely to reoffend, he has good prospects of rehabilitation and he has certainly shown remorse and he has pleaded guilty.

 

Against the subjective case which as I have said is a very compelling and powerful one, I must take into account the need for general deterrence and community abhorrence of crime such as this whether committed under the influence of drugs, alcohol or otherwise. I have come to the view that a period of fulltime custody is the only appropriate penalty in these circumstances.

 


	
	When imposing the non-parole period his Honour said that he found special circumstances on the basis that it was the Applicant’s first time in custody and for the prospects of rehabilitation and the need for supervision and rehabilitation.
	


The appeal


	
	Both the Applicant’s and the Crown’s submissions dealt with ground 3 asserting manifest excess. In the light of the Crown’s concession as to error identified in grounds 1 and 2 these submissions, as modified at the hearing of the appeal, were addressed to the re-sentencing exercise required of this Court by Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge had placed too much weight on general deterrence in light of the rehabilitation achieved by the Applicant prior to sentence. The Applicant submitted that the statistics indicated that 34% of all offenders sentenced for attempted armed robbery received a sentence other than full-time imprisonment. Those statistics include all offenders whether they had pleaded guilty or not and whether they had rehabilitated themselves or not.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust when the Applicant, after serving 236 days, would be required to return to custody for 62 days having successfully rehabilitated prior to sentence. In that regard the Applicant submitted that neither the protection of the community nor his rehabilitation warranted a return to custody.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no lesser sentence than was imposed by the Sentencing Judge was warranted. The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed was a lenient one in all the circumstances and that, in applying the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 it could be said that the Applicant satisfied or exceeded each of the matters stated in the Henry guideline. In particular the Applicant’s conduct was more serious in that he had broken into the premises. The Crown submitted also that simply because the charge was one of attempted armed robbery, that offence could not be considered separately from the Form 1 offence of break, enter and steal.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the 75% allocation of rehabilitation time to pre-sentence custody following Brown v R [2013] NSWCCA 44; (2013) 228 A Crim R 298 was at the upper end of the range. The Crown submitted that the heart of the Applicant’s complaint in respect of the sentence focused on his prospects of rehabilitation and the utility of requiring him to serve the remaining 67 days of custody in respect of these offences. In that regard, the Judge’s reduction of the statutory ratio to 30% was significant.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to two drug offences for which the Applicant was subsequently convicted as being relevant matters to be taken into account on any re-sentencing process.
	


Determination


	
	When considering the objective seriousness of the offending and how the considerations in Henry are applicable in the present case it is necessary to consider the attempted armed robbery together with the break, enter and steal. The two matters formed part of the same offending. Even if, as was suggested, the facts might not have constituted the offence of armed robbery because the console operator had retreated to the office and the property stolen from the outside area may not have been regarded as being in his possession (a matter which I doubt), it cannot be ignored that the only reason the Applicant was enabled to steal the property was that he threatened the console operator with the knife whilst demanding money, causing the operator to retreat to the relative safety of the service area.
	
	
	Since, in any event, it is necessary to take into account the Form 1 offence when fixing the appropriate sentence for the count charged, what happened in the present case should not be regarded as of any lesser seriousness than what happened in Henry simply because the charge and the conviction were for attempted armed robbery.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, there was leniency in three aspects of the sentence imposed. First, despite the Applicant’s conduct being more serious than that set out in the Henry guideline, the head sentence imposed was significantly lower than the range set out in Henry. Second, there was leniency in the Sentencing Judge varying the ratio of the non-parole period to 30% of the head sentence. Thirdly, according 75% of the time the Applicant spent in rehabilitation as pre-sentence custody was generous: Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48 at [38]; (2008) 185 A Crim R 155, and see also R v Anderson [2012] NSWCCA 175 at [41] – [43]. In fact, the Applicant at the date of sentence had only served 84 days in fulltime custody and on the basis of the sentence imposed was due to serve only a further 67 days.
	
	
	It may be accepted that in particular or exceptional cases a sentence that might otherwise be regarded as manifestly inadequate might be able to be justified in terms of rehabilitation achieved and to be achieved with respect to an offender: Anderson at [4] and [52]-[56].
	
	
	Even if the leniency of the sentence imposed can be justified by the Applicant’s rehabilitation at the time of sentence the position has changed to the detriment of the Applicant. Whilst on the continuing bail he was granted to prosecute this appeal, and notwithstanding the delays in doing so, he has twice been convicted of possessing drugs in circumstances where he admitted to using those drugs or intending to do so. Given the material that was put to the Sentencing Judge by the Applicant and others on his behalf to show that his involvement with drugs was at an end, that he had turned his life around in that regard, and that his rehabilitation had been successful, these recent offences demonstrate that the leniency extended to him because of the rehabilitation is now not appropriate, at least to the same extent. It can certainly be accepted that he is in further need of rehabilitation but that matter alone could not justify a sentence which involved only 84 days in fulltime custody nor that attributed to pre-sentence custody of 236 days.
	
	
	What has complicated the matter considerably is the release to bail of the Applicant at the time of sentence leaving him to serve 67 more days of fulltime custody unless the present sentence is varied. No doubt this was done by the Sentencing Judge considering that any appeal would not be heard until after the Applicant had served the whole of the custodial part of the sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant’s counsel submitted that it would be plainly unjust, unreasonable, counter-productive and likely to impede his ongoing rehabilitation to return the Applicant to custody especially when such a long time has elapsed since sentence was imposed. Three things should be said about that. First, it was the Applicant who had sought bail in order to appeal. Secondly, the appeal was not pursued with any vigour. Thirdly, whilst on that bail the Applicant committed two further drug offences.
	
	
	As to the first of those matters, all that needs to be said is that, in applying for bail, the Applicant must have known that if any appeal was unsuccessful he would have to be returned to gaol to complete his sentence.
	
	
	As to the second matter, the Applicant lodged a Notice of Intention to Appeal on 24 July 2014. The expiry date of 24 January 2015 was extended to 24 May 2015. Legal Aid made a number of attempts to contact the Applicant at the address where he had been bailed to live at Warnervale and on the mobile telephone number recorded in the Applicant’s Legal Aid application. Legal Aid also contacted Mrs Gauci who had employed the Applicant but she said in April 2015 that she had not seen the Applicant for six to seven weeks. Legal Aid ascertained that the Applicant had changed reporting police stations from Wyong to Mt Druitt but Legal Aid was advised by someone from Mt Druitt police station that the Applicant had not been reporting there and had been unable to be contacted. When all of those avenues were exhausted the Legal Aid appeal file was closed in September 2015.
	
	
	The Applicant gave evidence in an affidavit that in March 2015 he notified the Local Court at Mt Druitt of a change of address to The Entrance and in May 2015 he notified the Court of a change of address to Doonside. He did not specifically notify Legal Aid because he said he believed that he had notified all agencies when he changed his address at the Court. He said he had been told that appeals would take a long time. He did not at any stage contact Legal Aid to find out what was happening with regard to his appeal.
	
	
	For reasons that were not explained, the solicitor for Legal Aid said in an affidavit he was contacted in February 2016 by the Legal Aid solicitor who had appeared for the Applicant before the Sentencing Judge. As a result of what he was told the solicitor lodged a Notice of Application for Extension of the NIA period. On 22 February 2016 the Registrar extended that period until 30 May 2016. The Grounds of Appeal were then lodged on 13 April 2016.
	
	
	The Applicant also gave evidence in an affidavit of emotional, employment and psychiatric issues that developed during 2015. He also said that it was at that time he relapsed into using marijuana for a short period.
	
	
	Since the Registrar extended time there is no issue as to the competency of the appeal by reason of the delay. Rather, the relevance of the delay goes to the submission of the Applicant’s counsel that he should not be put back into custody to serve the remainder of his sentence because of the time that has elapsed since he was sentenced, and in that regard a lesser sentence was warranted.
	
	
	Although there is some explanation for the time that has elapsed, the explanation is not a satisfactory one. It was not clear why notifying the Court of a change of address for bail and/or reporting reasons would result in Legal Aid finding out about the change of address. Further, at no stage did the Applicant himself attempt to contact Legal Aid to find out the status and progress of the appeal. It may be accepted that since the state of sentence the Applicant has not engaged in further violent crime and to that extent his rehabilitation has been partly successful. On no other basis, however, can the delay be considered to be a mitigating feature.
	
	
	As to the third matter, on 31 August 2015 the Applicant was charged with possessing two grams of cannabis. He was convicted and fined $500. On 27 December 2015 he was charged with possessing 0.5 grams of cannabis and an instrument known as a bong used for smoking marijuana. For those offences he was convicted and fined $600 and $500 respectively. It is an aggravating matter that those offences were committed whilst on bail pending the hearing of this present appeal. Notwithstanding the commission of those offences, counsel for the Applicant pointed to what Simpson J had discussed in R v Henry where she said at [351]-[355] that although general deterrence, specific deterrence and punishment were significant factors in the sentencing process where an offender demonstrates a background to drug addiction that may explain the offender’s decision to use drugs and diminish his or her moral culpability for that decision, and a demonstrated progress towards rehabilitation, general deterrence and other sentencing objectives such as retribution may yield to rehabilitation. Without wishing to diminish the significance of Simpson J’s views in that regard, views with which I agree, I simply note that she was alone of the five Judges in Henry in expressing those views. The Applicant’s counsel submitted that the evidence showed that the Applicant had demonstrated progress towards rehabilitation in that there had been no further violent offending and that the background to his addiction was documented in the psychiatric material.
	
	
	In the unusual circumstances of this case I consider that a lesser sentence than that imposed by the Sentencing Judge is warranted. I consider that the Applicant should be assessed for an Intensive Correction Order for a period of 16 months. My reasons are these.
	
	
	First, although it would not be unjust or even counterproductive to return the Applicant to custody for 62 days it would be pointless or almost pointless to do so. Whilst it might punish the Applicant for his offending it would not adequately punish him (s 3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) and it would not fulfil any of the other purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	Secondly, although because of the time served and deemed time served by the Applicant s 5 of the Sentencing Act is not directly on point its purpose is relevant to resentencing an offender who would, in a practical sense, be given a sentence of imprisonment well under six months. Section 5 requires an additional consideration where a sentence of six months or less is to be imposed that no penalty other than a period of imprisonment is appropriate: Fedele v R [2015] NSWCCA 286 at [40]-[41].
	
	
	Thirdly, in many respects, simply to find that no lesser sentence than that imposed by the Sentencing Judge was warranted would not adequately punish the Applicant nor make the offender accountable nor promote his rehabilitation (s 3A (a), (d) and (e)). A further sentence of 62 days in custody together with a period on parole for one year and 11 months is less likely to achieve those purposes of sentencing than an Intensive Correction Order which will be more restrictive of the Applicant but at the same time by reason of the close restriction, further his rehabilitation whilst protecting the community.
	
	
	The sentence proposed will take account of the fact that the Applicant has served in custody or deemed custody some 236 days. Because of the unusual circumstances of this case the imposition of an Intensive Correction Order for what must be regarded as a serious crime of violence should not be seen as a precedent for future guidance to sentencing judges.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose that, taking into account time already served, the Applicant should be sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 16 months and that the sentence should be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order if the Applicant is assessed as suitable for such an order. In the event he is not assessed as suitable for such an order I would consider that no lesser sentence than that imposed by the Sentencing Judge was warranted.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


 


	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 24 July 2014.
	
	
	Refer the applicant for assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction in the community, pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Adjourn the proceedings for that purpose.

		18 October 2016",2016-10-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2770901,Plassas v Person [2016] NSWSC 1445,"Judgment


	
	By an amended summons filed on 8 March 2016, Con Plassas (“the plaintiff”) seeks orders in the following terms:
	



	
	to the extent that leave is required, an order that leave be granted to appeal against the decision of Magistrate Andrews of 4 December 2015, permitting the defendant to carry out a forensic procedure, namely a buccal swab, on the plaintiff;
	
	
	an order that the decision of Magistrate Andrews of 4 December 2015 be quashed;
	
	
	an order dismissing the defendant’s application for a forensic procedure; and
	
	
	an order that any forensic material obtained in consequence of the order of Magistrate Andrews on 4 December 2015 be destroyed.
	



	
	In the event that the relief sought is granted, the plaintiff also seeks an order for costs of the proceedings.
	
	
	The orders sought by the plaintiff are opposed by the defendant.
	
	
	The summons was supported an affidavit of Omar Juweinat, solicitor of 29 July 2016, which was read without objection.
	


THE factual background 


	
	On 22 October 2015 the defendant, who is a police officer, made an application to the Local Court for an order under s. 24 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (NSW) (“the Act”) in the following terms:
	


A final order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure(s) on (the plaintiff) pursuant to s. 24 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000.

The type of forensic procedure sought in relation to this application is as follows:

1.   the taking of a sample of (the plaintiff’s) DNA (a self-administered Buccal Swab), being a non- intimate procedure.


	
	The grounds for the application were expressed in the following terms:
	


1.   The applicant is an authorised applicant within the meaning of s. 3 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000.

2.   The respondent is a suspect within the meaning of s. 3 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000.

3.   The further grounds for the application are set out in the attached affidavit, pursuant to s. 26(2)(b) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000.


	
	In the affidavit which was filed in support of the application, the defendant expressed a suspicion that the plaintiff had committed an offence of supplying a prohibited drug in an amount greater than the commercial quantity contrary to s. 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (“the offence”). Having set out the grounds for that suspicion, the defendant stated that it was sought to have the plaintiff undergo a non-intimate forensic procedure, namely a self-administered DNA buccal swab. The affidavit also set out the grounds which led the defendant to believe that such forensic procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the plaintiff had committed the offence.
	


THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE


	
	The application came before Magistrate Andrews in the Local Court on 4 December 2015, at which time the defendant gave evidence. In answer to questions put by the prosecutor (commencing at T2 L20) the defendant confirmed that tests had been carried out on a number of items seized in connection with the plaintiff’s alleged commission of the offence, and that such tests were conducted by reference to a DNA sample which had been obtained from the plaintiff in 2002 (“the 2002 sample”) following his arrest in respect of another matter.
	
	
	When cross-examined by counsel for the plaintiff, the defendant agreed (T3 L15-18) that there was DNA evidence linking the plaintiff with a particular item recovered from the scene of the alleged offence. He also agreed (T3 L24-26) that depending upon the circumstances, there can be considerable delay in obtaining the results of DNA analysis. However, he maintained that any analysis of a fresh DNA sample provided by the plaintiff would be able to be undertaken before his trial for the offence. In this regard, it should be noted that the trial is presently listed to take place in the District Court in late November of this year. I was informed that in the event that the present proceedings were dismissed, it would take approximately two weeks for any buccal swab provided by the plaintiff to be tested and analysed.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the evidence before the Magistrate, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the order sought should not be made because:
	



	
	the 2002 sample was already in the defendant’s possession and that accordingly, the provision of a further sample was not justified in all of the circumstances;
	
	
	a period of 8 months had elapsed between the plaintiff’s arrest and the bringing of the defendant’s application, and that such delay was entirely unexplained;
	
	
	the making of the order sought would result in an undue waste of resources, in circumstances where the 2002 sample was already in existence;
	
	
	the public interest was met by the existence of the 2002 sample; and
	
	
	the Act was to be assessed in the context of “values of traditional civil liberties”.
	



	
	The prosecutor submitted that in the absence of a fresh DNA sample being provided, there was an obvious risk that a jury may become aware of the existence of the 2002 sample, speculate as to the circumstances in which it had been provided, and draw an inference which was adverse to the plaintiff. The prosecutor also relied on the fact that there was presently no evidence as to who, or in what circumstances, the 2002 sample had been obtained, such that in the absence of a fresh sample being provided, the Crown may have difficulty in proving this aspect of its case at trial.
	
	
	Finally, the prosecutor submitted that the question of whether or not an order should be made involved a balancing of interests, in circumstances where there was nothing in the Act which precluded an order for the provision of a fresh sample, even though the 2002 sample was in existence.
	


THE MAGISTRATE’S REASONS


	
	The Magistrate delivered ex tempore reasons which should be set out in full:
	


“Mr Laing (sic) argues that as the evidence indicates that the prosecution already have a DNA match there is no need for a further order. The prosecution say that there is prejudice likely to flow to the defence if a new sample is not taken as the jury would be informed of the age of the former sample. Mr Laing (sic) says that that is not necessarily so. I am of the view that it is appropriate that the Court makes an order, given that I am satisfied from the affidavit of Officer Person that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent has committed an offence, and further, as per the legislation there are reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence as referred to.

When I carry out the exercise of balancing the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect has committed the offence I have to balance against that the public interest in upholding the suspect’s physical integrity. When I carry out that exercise and (sic) I have to have regard to various factors under (a) through to (i) in relation to (a), (b) and (c) being factors, and a (sic) little argument was put contrary to this that when I have regard to the gravity of the alleged offence, the seriousness of the circumstances in which it is alleged that it has been committed, and the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence, each of those factors in my view, which (sic) warrant the making of the order.

And I look to the other matters which are relevant, (f) other practical ways of obtaining evidence as to whether the suspect committed the alleged offence are less intrusive, and I look at the nature of the buccal swab it could not be regarded in my view as being overly intrusive, perhaps one of the least intrusive means available to obtain forensic material, it obviously being a non-intimate procedure. In relation (g), whilst the submission has been put that a sample already exists I note the legislation gives a right to obtain such a sample, and I am satisfied and I have regard to (h) in relation to any issue in relation to delay, that the evidence Officer Person indicates that in his opinion no delay to the trial date of 11 April 2016 is likely to flow if the order is made today, and that the procedures will be carried out for the results to be available for the trial.

When I asked the parties in relation to give reasons as to why the existing sample may not be available as evidence or not able to be proven if the 2002 is put in issue, they remain potential and no real indications were forthcoming in my view. It is a matter that if there is some issue put in relation to (the) 2002 sample, then and when I combine that reason, being one of potential difficulty in relation to the trial proceeding, when I compare that to the nature of the proceeding I am of the view that it is justified in all the circumstances after I do balance that public interest against the need to uphold the respondent’s physical integrity, and I dare say having regard to the nature of the order that is sought and any potential issues that might flow in relation to the potential prejudice, although I note Mr Laing (sic) said that it was not necessarily made known as to the history of a matter, in my view any such issues should not be left in any doubt and that is appropriate in my view to make the order.”

THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION


	
	Section 24 of the Act is in the following terms:
	


(1) A Magistrate may order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if satisfied on the balance of probabilities:

(a) that the circumstances referred to in subsection (2) or (3) exist, and

(b) that the carrying out of such a procedure is justified in all the circumstances.

(2) In the case of an intimate forensic procedure:

(a) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed a prescribed offence, and

(b) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a).

(3) In the case of a non-intimate forensic procedure:

(a) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence, and

(b) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a).

(4) In determining whether or not the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances, the Magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect’s physical integrity, having regard to the following:

(a) the gravity of the alleged offence,

(b) the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed,

(c) the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence,

(d) the age, cultural background and physical and mental health of the suspect, to the extent to which they are known,

(e) in the case of a suspect who is a child or an incapable person, the best interests of the child or person,

(f) such other practicable ways of obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence as are less intrusive,

(g) such reasons as the suspect may have given for refusing to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure concerned,

(h) in the case of a suspect who is in custody, the period for which the suspect has been in custody and the reasons for any delay in the making of an application for an order under this section,

(i) such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant to the balancing of those interests.

PRINCIPLES RELATING TO APPELLATE REVIEW


	
	The principles relating to appellate review of this kind were helpfully set out in the written submissions filed on behalf of the defendant. Such principles may be conveniently summarised as follows.
	
	
	An appeal against the making of the order by the Magistrate may be made to this court pursuant to Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Review Act”). Importantly:
	



	
	pursuant to s. 52 of the Review Act, an appeal brought against the making of a forensic procedure order on the basis of a question of law alone may be brought as of right (Review Act s. 52);
	
	
	leave must be sought to bring an appeal on the basis of a question of fact, or a question of mixed law and fact (Review Act s. 53).
	



	
	An appeal brought pursuant to the Review Act does not constitute a re-hearing, or a general review, of the Magistrate’s decision. Whether or not an appellate court would have determined the issues differently is not the question: Saad v Jeffcoat [2013] NSWSC 1585 at [65]. Where an appellant relies on a question of law alone, it is necessary to isolate the question or legal principle adopted or assumed by the Magistrate, demonstrate that it was wrong, and demonstrate that it was material to the outcome of the case: Bimson, Roads Maritime Services v Damorange Pty Limited [2014] NSWSC 734 at [39]-[53].
	
	
	The proposition that a Magistrate has misdirected himself or herself as to the application of correct legal principle raises a question of law alone: Brough v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWSC 1396 at [49].
	
	
	If a Magistrate correctly states the applicable principles but incorrectly applies them, this will raise a question of mixed fact and law as opposed to a question of law: R v PL (2009) 199 A Crim R 1999; [2009] NSWCCA 256 at [26] cited in Brough (supra) at [49]. An argument that is directed to the question of the sufficiency of evidence involves a question of mixed fact and law and requires leave: KC v Sanger [2012] NSWSC 98 at [83].
	


THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

GROUND 1 – His Honour erred in finding that the factors set out in s. 24(4)(a), (b) and (c) of the Act weighed in favour of making the order

Submissions of the plaintiff


	
	Counsel for the plaintiff argued that this ground raised a question of law and that accordingly leave to appeal was not required. In the alternative, he submitted that the matter raised a question of mixed law and fact, and that a grant of leave was appropriate.
	
	
	Fundamental to this ground was the plaintiff’s submission that the word “evidence” as it appears in s. 24(4) of the Act is to be construed as being restricted to the result of any comparison undertaken as a consequence of the forensic procedure (in this case, the buccal swab) being carried out. Counsel submitted that having regard to the use of the 2002 sample, the “evidence” was already in existence, there was no further evidence to obtain, and that accordingly, there was no relevant public interest for the purposes of s. 24(4).
	
	
	Counsel submitted that in these circumstances the Magistrate had erred in considering any of the factors set out in s. 24(4), particularly those in s. 24(4)(a)-(c). In short, it was submitted that if it was accepted that there was no public interest in obtaining the evidence, it followed that there was no weight to be given to such factors, and that the Magistrate erred in doing so. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the Magistrate had failed to have regard to the context in which the factors in subs. 24(4) appeared in the Act. Counsel submitted that the Magistrate had erred by assessing those factors effectively in isolation, rather than considering how they bore upon the balancing exercise generally, and upon the public interest in obtaining the evidence in particular.
	


Submissions of the defendant


	
	Counsel for the defendant took issue with the fact that ground 1 raised a question of law in the sense suggested by counsel for the plaintiff. However, he accepted, as I understood it, that this ground raised a question of mixed law and fact, and that in those circumstances he would not oppose a grant of leave.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that on its proper construction, the meaning of the term “evidence” as it appears in s. 24(4) should not be restricted in the manner submitted by counsel for the plaintiff. It was submitted that the plaintiff’s contended construction was not consistent with the ordinary and grammatical sense in which the word was used, having regard to its context, and to the underlying legislative purpose.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant further submitted that the Magistrate had, on more than one occasion, expressly referred to the balancing exercise that he was required to carry out, and had clearly considered the factors in subs. 24(4) in their proper context. It was submitted that there was nothing to indicate that the Magistrate had given any undue weight to the matters in s. 24(4)(a)-(c) relative to the other specified considerations in subs. (4). It was further submitted that in any event, it was a matter for the Magistrate to determine the weight to be given to such matters.
	


Consideration


	
	I am satisfied, given the way in which this ground was approached, that it raises at least an issue of mixed law and fact and I consider that it is appropriate to grant leave.
	
	
	In the context of the present case, s. 24 of the Act conferred a discretionary power on the Magistrate to order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if the Magistrate was satisfied that:
	



	
	there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had committed a prescribed offence;
	
	
	there were reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the plaintiff had committed such offence; and
	
	
	the carrying out of the procedure was justified in all of the circumstances.
	



	
	Before the Magistrate, there was no issue about the matters in (i) and (ii). The question for the Magistrate was whether the carrying out of the forensic procedure was justified in all of the circumstances. In determining that question, the Magistrate was required to balance the public interest “in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the plaintiff committed the alleged offence” against the public interest “in upholding the plaintiff’s physical integrity”. That balancing exercise fell to be carried out having regard to the matters set out in s. 24(4)(a)-(i).
	
	
	The task of statutory construction begins and ends with a consideration of the text. Understanding the context in which a word or phrase is used in a statute has utility if, and in so far as, it assists in fixing the meaning of the statutory text. Context also includes the general purpose and policy of a provision: Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Media Holdings Limited (2012) 250 CLR 503; [2012] HCA 55 at [39]; Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Limited v Commissioner of Territory Revenue (2009) 239 CLR 27; [2009] HCA 41 at [47]. Applying these principles I am unable to accept the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff for a number of reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, there is nothing in the text of s. 24(4) which supports the restricted interpretation which was advanced by counsel for the plaintiff. Evidence of whether the plaintiff committed the offence can obviously include the results of analysis of the buccal swab provided pursuant to an order made under s. 24(4).
	
	
	Secondly, the restricted interpretation advanced by counsel for the plaintiff would be at odds with the provisions of s. 24(3) of the Act, which makes reference to the forensic procedure producing “evidence tending to confirm or disprove” the commission of the offence.
	
	
	Thirdly, the construction advanced by the plaintiff is inconsistent with the relevant context, as well as the object and purpose of the Act. Clearly, one of the objects of the Act is to facilitate, in the interests of the community, the investigation of crime and the administration of justice, in securing the conviction of the guilty and the non-prosecution or acquittal of those who are not guilty: Orban v Bayliss [2004] NSWSC 428 at [30]. The restrictive interpretation advanced on behalf of the plaintiff is, in my view, inconsistent with those objects.
	
	
	Further, I should also say that in my view there is nothing within the Magistrate’s reasons which indicates that his approach to the exercise that he was required to undertake was in any way erroneous. It is clear that his Honour was mindful of the balancing exercise that he was required to undertake, and the factors that he was required to take into account in doing so. Further, and although the Magistrate made extensive references to the factors set out in s. 24(4)(a)-(c), any suggestion that he considered those factors in isolation, or considered them without reference to other relevant factors, is untenable in light of the fact that he expressly referred to other provisions in his judgment.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, ground 1 is not made out.
	


GROUND 2 – His Honour erred in finding that there “was a potential difficulty in relation to the trial proceedings” in the absence of any evidence

GROUND 4 – His Honour erred by not applying the appropriate standard and burden of proof required by s. 24(1) of the Act, when concluding that any such issues should not be left in any doubt.


	
	It was agreed by the parties that these grounds could appropriately be dealt with together. Importantly, it was also conceded by counsel for the plaintiff that his submissions as to the proper construction of s. 24(4) were fundamental to each ground of appeal. For the reasons I have expressed I am unable to accept those submissions. As a consequence, the remaining grounds must also fail. However, to the extent that other submissions were made in support of those grounds I should address them.
	


Submissions of the plaintiff


	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the Magistrate’s conclusion that there was “prejudice likely to flow …. if a new sample is not taken as the jury would be informed of the age of the former sample” was unsupported by the evidence.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that the Magistrate’s concluding observation that “such issues should not be left in any doubt” amounted to a reversal of the onus of proof.
	


Submissions of the defendant


	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that it was open to the Magistrate, pursuant to s. 24(4)(i) to take into account “such other matters” as he considered relevant in the balancing exercise. This, he submitted, allowed the Magistrate to have regard to any prejudice which was likely to flow in the absence of a fresh sample being provided.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant further submitted that on a fair reading of the Magistrate’s reasons, there was no reversal of the onus, and that the passage relied upon by the plaintiff as constituting error was nothing more than a reference to an earlier submission which had been advanced on the plaintiff’s behalf.
	


Consideration


	
	Before this court, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that questions surrounding the admissibility of the evidence of the 2002 sample would be a factor falling within s. 24(4)(i). In referring to the potential prejudice, the Magistrate obviously had in mind the possibility that leading evidence, at trial, of the taking of the 2002 sample had the capacity to be prejudicial to the plaintiff. That was an inference which was clearly open on the evidence before him.
	
	
	Further, it is inappropriate to take an overly critical approach to reasons contained in ex tempore judgments which are made immediately following a hearing. When viewed as a whole, the Magistrate’s reasons do not exhibit any reversal of the onus of proof. On the contrary, the Magistrate’s express reference to being “satisfied from the affidavit of Officer Person” that an order should be made makes it clear that he was cognisant of the fact that an applicant for an order under s. 24 bears the onus.
	
	
	For these additional reasons, grounds 2 and 3 are not made out.
	


GROUND 4 – His Honour erred in concluding that the carrying out of the forensic procedure was justified in all the circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had available to him the evidence, which might otherwise be obtained than by the obtaining of the forensic sample

Submissions of the plaintiff


	
	In oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff described ground 4 as “in one sense” an amplification of ground 1 (which, for the reasons I have given, has not been made out).
	
	
	In pressing ground 4, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there was no evidence which supported a conclusion that there was any public interest in obtaining the evidence. That, in effect, was a repeat of the submission advanced in support of ground 1. Counsel submitted that such a submission was supported by the provisions of s. 27 of the Act.
	


Submissions of the defendant


	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that s. 27 did not preclude subsequent applications being made under s. 24 of the Act. He further submitted that the making of the order was a matter which called for the exercise of the Magistrate’s discretion, and that nothing in the Act precluded the Magistrate from coming to the conclusion that he did.
	


Consideration


	
	Having regard to the conclusion I have reached in respect of ground 1, ground 4 must also fail.
	
	
	In addition however, it should be observed that no submission was ever put to the Magistrate in relation to the operation of s. 27 of the Act. The attempt to do so before this court contravened the general principle that a party should be bound by the manner in which proceedings have been conducted at first instance.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the foregoing reasons I make the following orders:
	



	
	The proceedings are dismissed.
	
	
	The parties should provide any submissions as to costs within (7) days, such submissions not to exceed one page in length.

		17 October 2016",2016-10-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2770902,Hashemi v R [2016] NSWCCA 229,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The applicant, Mr Hashemi, pleaded guilty before a magistrate to one count of discharge a firearm at a dwelling house contrary to s 93GA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	He was sentenced upon that plea of guilty in the District Court of New South Wales on 1 May 2013 to a term of imprisonment of 21 months suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	In sentencing Mr Hashemi, his Honour took into account two matters on a Form 1: possession of ammunition (one cartridge) and possession of four tablets of MDMA (ecstasy).
	
	
	The sentencing judge accepted that the plea was entered by Mr Hashemi on the basis that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise. He did not actually discharge the shots in question.
	
	
	By notice filed 29 January 2016, Mr Hashemi seeks to appeal against his conviction on the ground that there was no evidence from which it could be found that he had the requisite intent to be convicted of the subject offence.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that ground of appeal. Although it submitted that there was arguably evidence of the requisite intent, in the form of the plea of guilty which represented an admission to the essential elements of the offence (R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 at [51]), the Crown accepted that the circumstances suggested that the plea of guilty was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt as it was based on incorrect legal advice and that a miscarriage of justice may therefore have resulted.
	
	
	In particular, the Crown accepted that the agreed facts, which were summarised in the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence, themselves raised a suggestion that liability was framed on unsound basis, namely that:
	


HASHEMI admits to being the driver of the car leading up to the shooting and taking NIAZY, BENAVA and KHORRAMI to 18-24 Oxford Street, Merrylands. When HASHEMI became fully aware of the shooting he continued to participate and drove all involved away from the police and evaded police apprehension.


	
	The Crown accepts that the second sentence in the passage extracted above from the agreed facts would suggest that liability was contemplated as accessory after the fact, which would have carried a lesser and different penalty. The Crown had accepted at the sentencing hearing that Mr Hashemi did not have the requisite mens rea and did not have the knowledge of what was happening.
	
	
	The Crown also accepts that it is apparent from the transcript of the proceedings that Mr Hashemi’s legal representative was labouring under the misapprehension that liability for the principal offence would be founded on the basis that Mr Hashemi was an accessory after the fact.
	
	
	The Crown notes that the appellant was ultimately sentenced on the basis that he was not aware what was going to occur when he embarked upon the journey to the premises. Accordingly, the Crown concedes that the evidence did not establish the offences particularised in the Court Attendance Notice and that the plea to the charge on the Court Attendance Notice should not have been accepted.
	
	
	This Court, having reviewed the appeal papers, considered that the Crown’s concession was well-founded and made orders remitting the matter to the District Court. These are the Court’s reasons for so doing.
	
	
	In the circumstances referred to above, the question arose as to what orders the Court should make.
	
	
	Mr Hashemi conceded before this Court that he should probably have been convicted of being an accessory after the fact. However, s 347 of the Crimes Act, which would thus have been applicable, is not a statutory alternative count to s 93GA(1) and the offence could not therefore be substituted by this Court for the s 93GA(1) offence to which Mr Hashemi had pleaded guilty (Tweeddale v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 99 at [24]). Section 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) does not apply in the present case as Mr Hashemi pleaded guilty rather than having been convicted (R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 383).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the proper approach in the circumstances was for the Court to make an order, under s 8A of the Criminal Appeal Act, that the proceedings before the magistrate before whom the appellant pleaded guilty be continued. That was the course taken in Wilkes, where the Crown sought leave to amend the Court Attendance Notice.
	
	
	This Court, however, took the view that it was preferable for the matter to be remitted, pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, to the District Court for a hearing de novo in light of the acknowledgment by Mr Hashemi that he was an accessory after the fact. Although the only initiating process in existence is the Court Attendance Notice, it was accepted by Counsel for Mr Hashemi that the Court Attendance Notice could be withdrawn and the matter proceed on an ex officio filing in the District Court for the charge of being an accessory after the fact.
	
	
	Having regard to the fact that the matter would in any event have to be dealt with in the District Court for the further plea, the Court took the view that it was preferable to remit the matter pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to the District Court on that basis. The order was made accordingly.

2770919,Nicolson v Florida [2016] NSWDC 260,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff, by Notice of Motion filed on 16 September 2016, seeks an order pursuant to s 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) for an extension of the limitation period to commence proceedings for defamation under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The matters complained of are four oral publications made over a period commencing in March 2014; the final publication was made on a date between April and September 2014.
	
	
	The plaintiff relies upon the factual matters set out in his affidavit of 29 July 2016, the contents of which are set out below.
	
	
	The defendant, who is legally represented and has been served with the notice of motion and supporting affidavit, takes the position that he neither consents to nor opposes the relief sought.
	


The circumstances in which the matters complained of came to the plaintiff’s attention


	
	Mr Nicolson, the plaintiff, sets out in his affidavit that defendant is his relative by marriage and, like him, is an electrician by trade. They both belonged to the same church. After some work-related disputes, the plaintiff decided, in early 2013, that his company would no longer retain the defendant as a sub-contractor or refer work to him.
	
	
	In May 2015 the plaintiff was invited to nominate himself as a board member of a school. However, after he did so, he received a telephone call from the Chairman of the Board, requesting him to withdraw his nomination. The basis of his request was that the Chairman was aware of allegations that the plaintiff was alleged to have engaged in certain inappropriate behaviour (“the allegations”). The Chairman said that the source of these allegations was a person within the church the plaintiff attended, but gave no further particulars.
	
	
	The plaintiff, who was stunned by these revelations, immediately asked the Pastor of the church to undertake an investigation into both himself and the allegations. He was informed, on 22 September 2015, that this investigation would proceed no further, because the reports obtained indicated that the allegations were groundless. He was never informed of the nature or content of these reports, or of the source of the allegations.
	
	
	This lack of information caused the plaintiff to make his own inquiries, but he had great difficulty finding out who had made these allegations, he says, because the Church was very active in the “small community” (paragraph 17 of his affidavit) in which he lived.
	
	
	In about March 2016 a person he contacted suggested he meet with a Mr Mark Chircop, on the basis that Mr Chircop had told that person about these allegations. The plaintiff met with Mr Chircop on 21 March 2016. Mr Chircop identified the defendant as the persons who had made the allegations about the plaintiff, saying the statements were made in about March 2014. This was the first direct information the plaintiff had of what had been said, when and by whom.
	
	
	The plaintiff needed further information, and made further inquiries. On 19 May 2016 he met a Mr Andrew Dixon. Mr Dixon told him that he had also had conversations with the defendant in 2014, during which the defendant made the same allegations.
	
	
	Prior to these persons telling the plaintiff that the defendant had made these statements, he had had no information that the defendant had made these allegations. He did not have any suspicion or belief either (paragraph 19).
	
	
	After the plaintiff obtained this second source of information as to who had made the allegations about him, he made further inquiries and identified a total of four publications, all made between March and September 2014. He then sought legal advice. He consulted Mr Goldsmith, who filed the statement of claim initiating these proceedings on his behalf, on 29 July 2016.
	


The legislation and relevant principles


	
	Section 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) provides:
	


“56A Extension of limitation period by court

(1) A person claiming to have a cause of action for defamation may apply to the court for an order extending the limitation period for the cause of action.

(2) A court must, if satisfied that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within 1 year from the date of the publication, extend the limitation period mentioned in section 14B to a period of up to 3 years running from the date of the publication.

(3) A court may not order the extension of the limitation period for a cause of action for defamation other than in the circumstances specified in subsection (2).”


	
	The “not reasonable in the circumstances” test in s 56A has been described by Malcolm CJ in Rayney v State of Western Australia (No 3) [2010] WASC 83 as “a difficult hurdle for a plaintiff to overcome unless there are some unusual circumstances” (at [41]).
	
	
	There is, however, one exception which is generally accepted to amount to “unusual circumstances”, and that is where the plaintiff is unaware of the publication until after the expiry of the one-year limitation period. Simpson J, in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676 at [52], specifically notes that circumstances where the plaintiff is “unaware of the publication” may be an example of a factual situation satisfying this test.
	
	
	In Sun v Hojunara International Group (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1050, Campbell J summarised Hislop J’s principles concerning the criteria for s 56A as being the following six factors:
	



	
	The burden that must be discharged is to establish that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within one year from the date of the publication;
	
	
	The onus rests with the plaintiff;
	
	
	The test is objective;
	
	
	It is a difficult hurdle for a plaintiff to overcome unless there are some unusual circumstances;
	
	
	If the plaintiff proves the fact then the court is obliged to extend time. Extension in these circumstances is mandatory; and
	
	
	Section 56A limits the period of extension to an extension “of up to three years running from the date of publication”. This has been described as involving the exercise of discretion in the sense of involving a normative judgment.
	



	
	Campbell J goes on to note that, while the test is an objective one, a consideration of the circumstances required by s 56A includes an inquiry into the plaintiff’s reasons for not commencing proceedings within the limitation period, which may involve consideration of some subjective aspects of the case.
	
	
	In Cassar v Network Ten Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 680, Hislop J stated that once the plaintiff can satisfy the relevant criteria, the grant of an extension is not a matter for the discretion of the court but is mandatory. It is obvious that it would not be “reasonable” in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to a publication he knew nothing about and in those circumstances the criteria are satisfied.
	
	
	I also note that, while the principles expressed in s 56A mean that an extension of time is mandatory, the facts must be proved to the satisfaction of the court in the same type of evaluative exercise required for the decision of any contested issue of fact. In cases such as the present, however, there are effectively no facts in dispute, in that there is no challenge to the plaintiff’s claim of lack of knowledge until May 2016 of the publications.
	
	
	In the circumstances set out above, the test under s 56A is satisfied, and the plaintiff’s application for an extension of time is granted.
	
	
	The parties agreed that costs would be costs in the cause. The defendant has raised issues in relation to the imputations and I have made orders as sought by both parties to enable amendment of the statement of claim and a date for argument if necessary.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant s 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), extend time for the commencement of these proceedings to 29 July 2016.
	
	
	Costs to be costs in the cause.
	
	
	Plaintiff’s proposed amended statement of claim to be served on the defendant within 7 days.
	
	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on 3 November 2016 for further directions and/or argument if necessary.

		21 October 2016",2016-10-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2770923,Jones v R [2016] NSWCCA 230,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Hidden AJ.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Hidden AJ.
	
	
	HIDDEN AJ: The applicant, Peter Reginald Jones, was committed for sentence in the District Court after pleading guilty in the Local Court to the following charges:
	



	
	supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, pseudoephedrine, an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years;
	
	
	knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime, an offence under s 193B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment; and
	
	
	possessing a prohibited weapon, an offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	



	
	Two related charges of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime and supplying a quantity of methylamphetamine were to be taken into account on the sentence in respect of the first count.
	
	
	He was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. The indicative sentences were as follows:
	



	
	supplying the large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, taking into account the Form 1 offences: 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 10 months;
	
	
	knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime: 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 7 months; and
	
	
	possess prohibited weapon: 12 months with a non-parole period of 8 months.
	



	
	He seeks leave to appeal against that aggregate sentence on the ground that it is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The focus of the application is a narrow one, and it is sufficient to summarise the facts and the subjective material briefly. In March 2014, the applicant was involved with an accomplice in the transport of a quantity of pseudoephedrine by train from Perth to Sydney. The consignment consisted of two cardboard boxes in which there were a number of plastic tubs. Labels on those tubs conveyed that they contained various items of an innocent nature, but in fact they contained a little over 27 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. The value of the drug was in excess of $3,200,000. The matter had come to the attention of police, who intercepted the consignment upon its arrival in Sydney, removed the drug and replaced it with an inert substance, and allowed it to proceed to its intended destination, an address at North Ryde.
	
	
	Upon its arrival in North Ryde, the accomplice picked up the consignment and conveyed it to a motel in West Ryde. There, the applicant picked it up and drove it to a garage at Kogarah. He was arrested at the garage. In the garage a quantity of methylamphetamine was found, and $885 was found in his wallet. That drug and that money were the subject of the Form 1 charges.
	
	
	On the following day police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s home. In the main bedroom were found quantities of cash totalling an amount in excess of $160,000. This was the subject of the second count, knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. Also found in a hallway cupboard was a homemade set of knuckledusters, the subject of the third count, possession of a prohibited weapon.
	
	
	The sentencing judge made a number of factual findings, which need not be recited. It is sufficient to say that they led him to the conclusion that, although he could not characterise the precise role of the applicant in the enterprise, he was satisfied that it was associated with his being a drug dealer and that his involvement was for financial gain.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s subjective case, he was 44 years old at the time of the offences and is now 46. He had a minor criminal history, which his Honour did not see as disqualifying him from the leniency normally extended to first offenders. He had a difficult upbringing, marred by the experience of sexual abuse by an associate of his uncle and his own abuse of drugs from his early teenage years. His Honour found in the material some evidence of remorse, and allowed a 25% reduction of sentence in recognition of the early pleas of guilty. Here also, no issue was taken with his Honour’s consideration of the subjective material and the weight he afforded it.
	


The application


	
	The argument that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive centred upon the indicative sentence for the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon, imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 8 months. There was no complaint about the indicative sentences for the other offences. Counsel for the applicant, Mr Michael Smith, submitted that that offence did not call for a custodial sentence at all. He referred us to Judicial Commission statistics of sentences in the Local Court and the District Court for the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon, which disclose that in the Local Court the great majority of offenders were dealt with otherwise than by terms of imprisonment and in the District Court less than half of the offenders received prison terms.
	
	
	It is appropriate to set out what the sentencing judge had to say about this offence in his remarks:
	


“The photograph at tab 5 on the Crown’s sentencing bundle shows that the set of knuckledusters was made of solid metal with many jagged edges designed to cause serious injuries. This weapon can cause more serious injuries than a set of normal knuckledusters and so, it is more objectively serious. It is inherently a very dangerous weapon capable of causing serious but not necessarily life threatening injuries.

The range of “weapons” that can fall within this classification is extremely board and this item must be assessed within that context. There is no evidence it was used by the offender in the past or that it was in a position where others may have had access to it.

There is no evidence that he possessed it for the purpose of protecting the illegal drugs in his possession. There is no evidence the offender intended to use, sell or supply it.”


	
	In JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297, RA Hume J set out the principles relating to aggregate sentences, with reference to authority, at [39-[40]. Relevantly for present purposes, his Honour observed that indicative sentences are not themselves amenable to appeal, although they may be a guide to whether error is established in relation to the aggregate sentence; even if the indicative sentences are assessed as being excessive, that does not necessarily mean that the aggregate sentence itself is excessive; and a principal focus of the determination of manifest inadequacy or excess is whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved: [40.11-13].
	
	
	Mr Smith’s submission in the present case was that, in the light of the mitigating features referred to by his Honour in the quoted passage from his remarks and the applicant’s generally favourable subjective case, a custodial sentence for the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon would not have been called for. Accordingly, the indicative sentence for that offence was in error and that error infected the aggregate sentence as a whole. Mr Smith attempted – in my view, unsuccessfully – to calculate the extent to which that indicative sentence had contributed to the assessment of the aggregate sentence. As RA Hume J also observed in JM, this Court is not in a position to analyse issues of concurrence and accumulation in the same way that it can analyse traditional sentencing structures: [40.13].
	
	
	Mr Smith frankly acknowledged that if this Court were of the view that a custodial term was open in respect of the prohibited weapon charge, the appeal must fail. I am of that view. It is well established that sentencing statistics, absent any information as to the bases upon which the sentences were arrived at, are of limited use in determining the appropriate sentence in a particular case: Hili and Jones v The Queen 242 CLR 520 at [48] (535), [2010] HCA 45. As I have noted, the offence carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years. While his Honour did identify some mitigating features in his remarks, those features must be balanced against his description of the set of knuckledusters in question and their capacity to cause serious injury.
	
	
	Accordingly, I find no error in the indicative sentence for the prohibited weapon charge and I am satisfied that the aggregate sentence is an appropriate reflection of the totality of the criminality involved. I would grant leave for appeal but dismiss the appeal.

		21 October 2016",2016-10-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2770924,R v Moyano (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1485,"Judgment


	
	The accused, Charles Robert Moyano, is charged under s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) with having murdered Keith Lee on 5 December 2014 at Wetherill Park, where they both lived. Mr Lee died that day as the result of the multiple stab wounds which Mr Moyano inflicted, with a large kitchen knife.
	
	
	On 28 September 2015, Mathews AJ found under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), that Mr Moyano, suffers from a serious mental illness and was unfit to be tried (see R v Charles Robert Moyano [2015] NSWSC 1444). He was then remanded in custody and the matter referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 14 of the Forensic Provisions Act, for determination under s 16.
	
	
	The Tribunal adjourned Mr Moyano’s fitness hearing in December 2015 and March 2016, to allow for improvement as the result of treatment and medication which he was then receiving in detention. In July 2016 it determined under s 16 of the Forensic Provisions Act that he was still unfit to be tried and that he would not be fit to be tried for the offence charged within 12 months. Under ss 46 and 47, the Tribunal also determined that he should be detained at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre for care and treatment.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions later notified the Court under s 16(4) of the Forensic Provisions Act of his intention to proceed with the charge and sought that a special hearing be fixed for that purpose. That special hearing was conducted before me as a judge sitting alone, Mr Moyano not having made an election pursuant to s 21A of that Act, to have the hearing conducted before a jury.
	
	
	Under s 19(2) of the Forensic Provisions Act the purpose of such a special hearing is specified to be:
	


“… ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged”


	
	Under s 21(3) of the Forensic Provisions Act, an accused is taken to have pleaded not guilty to the offence charged and is entitled to raise any defence that could be properly raised, if the special hearing were an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings. As discussed by Spigelman CJ in R v Zvonaric (2001) 54 NSWLR 1; [2001] NSWCCA 505 at [3], [34], s 21(1) of the Act requires that the special hearing be conducted as “nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings”.
	
	
	The verdicts available at a special hearing are those provided by s 22(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act, namely:
	


""(a)    not guilty of the offence charged,

(b)    not guilty on the ground of mental illness,

(c)    that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged,

(d)    that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.""


	
	Section 21(4) requires that “the legal and practical consequences of those verdicts” must be considered by the Court.
	
	
	Section 38 of the Forensic Provisions Act requires, however, that if it appears on the evidence that an accused “was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made”, then a special verdict must be returned “that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness”.
	
	
	If such a verdict is returned, under s 39(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act the Court may order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as it sees fit, until he or she is released by due process of law. Section 39(2) provides that the Court is not to make an order for the release of such a person from custody “unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release”.
	
	
	On a charge of murder it is for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death, but whether the accused had the requisite intention need only be determined, if the defence of mental illness is not established (see Hawkins v R (1994) 179 CLR 500’ [1994] HCA 28 (at 510, 512-514, 517) discussed in R v Minani (2005) 63 NSWLR 490; [2005] NSWCCA 226 at [32])
	
	
	“Mental illness” is not defined in the Forensic Provisions Act. The onus falls on the accused, however, to establish that defence on the balance of probabilities (see Mizzi v R (1960) 105 CLR 659; [1960] HCA 77). What the accused must prove to establish a defence of mental illness is that he was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, that he did not know the quality and nature of the physical acts which he was doing, or alternatively, that if he did know, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong (see R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718; [1843 – 60] All ER 229; R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182; [1933] HCA 1).
	
	
	In Porter it was said by Dixon J at 189-90:
	


""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.""

The issues


	
	When the hearing commenced the Crown anticipated that there would be two possible verdicts open on the evidence to be led, either that specified by ss 22(1)(b) or (d) of the Forensic Provisions Act.
	
	
	There were, however, no issue between the parties as to the relevant facts and, as it emerged, no disagreement between the psychiatrists who had examined Mr Moyano in 2015, Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Adam Martin, that he was suffering a serious mental illness; his condition at the time that he killed Mr Lee; and his response to the treatment he had received in custody.
	
	
	There was thus finally no issue between the parties that the appropriate verdict on the evidence was a verdict of not guilty of murder by reason of Mr Moyano’s mental illness and that an order that Mr Moyano should be detained in a correctional facility, or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until released by due process of law, should also be made.
	


The defence of mental illness is established


	
	I am satisfied that the evidence I will discuss proves, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Moyano killed Mr Lee when he stabbed him repeatedly with his knife.
	
	
	It also establishes on the balance of probabilities that Mr Moyano has established a defence of mental illness, because at the time that he killed Mr Lee, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong, in the sense discussed in Porter, as the result of the mental illness that he was then suffering. A special verdict in accordance with s 38 must, accordingly, be entered.
	


What the evidence established


	
	Oral evidence was called from a number of witnesses who had heard an argument break out between Mr Moyano and Mr Lee on the afternoon of 5 December 2014 and who had then seen Mr Moyano stab Mr Lee, as well as from the arresting police officer. Evidence of what other witnesses had said in statements made to police shortly after Mr Moyano’s attack on Mr Lee, as to what they had seen, was received without objection. Mr Moyano himself had made a recorded statement to police (an ERISP), some hours after his arrest, shortly after he killed Mr Lee. The ERISP was tendered and a transcript of the interview provided as an aide memoir. The summary of the conclusions reached on Mr Lee’s autopsy as to the cause of his death was also received without objection.
	
	
	Oral evidence was also called from Dr Nielssen and Dr Martin. Their 2015 reports were also tendered.
	
	
	The evidence established, in short, that on 5 December, Mr Moyano and Mr Lee occupied separate rooms at a boarding house at Wetherill Park. Mr Moyano had thrown some chairs and a lounge usually kept on the front veranda of the house, into the neighbour’s yard. When he arrived home the neighbour asked Mr Lee, who was working on his car at the front of the boarding house, if they could be removed. Mr Lee approached Mr Moyano, who was in his room. They had an argument, which other occupants of the house heard. Mr Moyano took a knife and followed Mr Lee into the front yard, where he attacked Mr Lee with the knife, stabbing him repeatedly to various parts of his body, thereby causing his death. Mr Moyano then walked away up the road, where he was arrested soon afterwards, with the knife still in his possession.
	
	
	In his ERISP, while Mr Moyano provided rational answers to some questions he was asked, his irrational and disordered state of mind was then very apparent, both from what he said and how he acted.
	
	
	Mr Moyano then gave an account of having “poked’ Mr Lee repeatedly with his knife, after an argument. He gave an incoherent account of problems that he had earlier encountered, including with other residents, as well as a contradictory account of what had happened on 5 December with Mr Lee. At one point he said he had acted in self-defence, the person he attacked having come towards him while holding something, at another he described arming himself with a knife and following that person outside, where he “poked” him repeatedly. At another point Mr Moyano threatened that he would “poke” other occupants with whom he had various grievances. He also gave an account of having armed himself with a hammer to attack another occupant, who had come to his door, which had not eventuated, he said, because that person did not enter his room. He also expressed considerable concern at having cut himself and having been infected by AIDS, from the blood in which he explained he had earlier been covered.
	
	
	From what Mr Moyano there said, it appears that he understood the potential consequences of killing a person, including, he believed, imprisonment or a death sentence. He was also aware that he had injured Mr Lee, who he knew had been taken to hospital, but he appeared surprised to learn that Mr Lee had died, which he professed not to believe.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen’s June 2015 report recorded Mr Moyano’s history of suffering a chronic form of schizophrenia, as well as his abnormal demeanour on interview in 2015 and the bizarre and irrelevant answers he gave. Mr Moyano then told Dr Nielssen that he intended to plead not guilty on the grounds of self-defence; that he was not claiming mental health; and that Mr Lee’s death had nothing to do with that. Mr Moyano also said that he had not had previous disputes with Mr Lee. When taken to his ERISP, he said amongst other things that Mr Lee “should not have been near me with a knife in my hand. It was a simple thing I asked”.
	
	
	At the time of Mr Lee’s death Mr Moyano was receiving a disability support pension and was being treated, he told Dr Nielssen, for depression and stress, but he said that he rarely drank alcohol. While he had a prior history of heroin abuse and methadone treatment, he also said that he had ceased all drugs. He was then on medication used to treat schizophrenia.
	
	
	Mr Moyano had a history of treatment for mental health issues, including admissions to Liverpool Hospital. He had a history of having experienced hallucinations, including in 2003 when he had an apparent fit at the wheel of his car, and a history on admission of suffering auditory hallucinations and delusions of persecution. He was detained under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) from August to September 2003, with a diagnosis of drug induced psychosis. In 2005 he was brought to hospital after complaining to police about hearing voices. He was referred for community care, but in June to August was again admitted to hospital, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
	
	
	In 2006 and 2007 Justice Health records indicated that he was diagnosed to be suffering chronic schizophrenia and a substance use disorder. In November 2009 to January 2010 there was a further admission after Mr Moyano expressed persecutory beliefs regarding neighbours, when he was diagnosed to be suffering schizo-affective disorder and referred to the community mental health team on discharge. Dr Nielssen noted that it was not clear that this referral was taken up.
	
	
	In custody in 2014 Mr Moyano was observed to be responding to hallucinations of voices, for which he received treatment. Dr Nielssen noted that Dr Martin had concluded that Mr Moyano had a major mental illness, most likely schizo-affective disorder, which had features of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and that he would have a defence of mental illness.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen described Mr Moyano’s condition on interview to have included answers irrelevant to questions put to him; the belief that Mr Lee had threatened him, which seemed delusional; and that he was preoccupied with grievances with other residents.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen considered Mr Moyano’s disorganised answers in the ERISP to have been consistent with the presence of untreated schizophrenia. Mr Moyano then appeared to believe that he was undercover and in protection to help police; that he was in danger and lucky to have got out of the situation; that he needed rehabilitation and time in prison; that he had been threatened and attacked; and that he would have to “poke” all the other residents. Mr Moyano still held some of these beliefs on interview, in ways that to Dr Nielssen appeared delusional. His thinking was disorganised and illogical, his registration of information impaired, speaking incessantly, without addressing questions put to him, and having difficulty with spontaneous and orderly retrieval of information. Mr Moyano had some knowledge of recent events, although events described were eccentric and without detail. His intelligence was, however, estimated to be within normal range.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr Moyano to be suffering chronic schizophrenia, a recognised disease of the mind in law, which Dr Nielssen explained produces a pattern of abnormality of mind, consistent with Mr Moyano’s history of typical symptoms; his pattern of treatment and presentation on interview; and his history of auditory hallucinations and persecutory beliefs, including in prison. Declining social performance and Mr Moyano’s three involuntary admissions since 2003 were also consistent with the diagnosis. Dr Nielssen considered that even if Mr Moyano had been reliably taking prescribed medication, it was probably not sufficient to control his symptoms.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen concluded that at the time of his offending Mr Moyano was probably aware of the physical nature of his actions in stabbing Mr Lee, but he was deprived of the ability to recognise that his actions were morally wrong, as his perception of events was from the standpoint of his underlying delusional beliefs, that he had been wronged and was in danger. Mr Moyano’s grossly disorganised thinking also deprived him of the ability to reason with any measure of sense or composure about the wrongfulness of his action or of the alternatives open to him.
	
	
	In his oral evidence Dr Nielssen said that it was difficult to know exactly what Mr Moyano was thinking when he killed Mr Lee, but given what he had said in the ERISP, when considered with his actions after he attacked Mr Lee, even if he did have a genuine reason to believe that Mr Lee was angry at him and perhaps threatened him, Mr Moyano’s response was nowhere in proportion to those beliefs. Mr Moyano was then acutely mentally ill and his thinking was grossly disorganised and whatever the extent of the threat he had perceived, his ability to consider the threat and the alternative causes of action open to him logically and whether the course he pursued was wrong, were grossly impaired.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen also explained that schizophrenia involved holding both realistic and bizarre thinking, side by side, for example, knowing that a long sentence for murder would be imposed, but also believing that the person killed was an alien.
	
	
	When asked about the distinction between understanding that something is legally wrong, as opposed to knowledge that it is morally wrong, the example Dr Nielssen gave was a person who believed they were in mortal danger on delusional grounds, which justified killing someone, but who understood that killing a person was illegal and believed that such an offence should carry a sentence of 25 years, or life imprisonment.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen’s view of the defence of substantial impairment, he explained, was that it would be a bad outcome for a person who needs life long treatment and supervision for a severe form of mental illness, who had available the defence of not guilty on account of mental illness.
	
	
	Dr Martin had also examined Mr Moyano in April 2015 and was present when Dr Nielssen gave his oral evidence. In his oral evidence Dr Martin explained that he agreed with the views which Dr Nielssen had expressed, including in relation to the distinction between understanding moral wrongfulness and an awareness of legal consequences.
	
	
	In his report Dr Martin had noted that Mr Moyano was extremely talkative and quickly changed topics, without logical reasons. On interview, Mr Moyano had volunteered an account as to what had happened before his arrest, which included people seeing through brick walls; entering his room; moving and taking his belongings; camping outside his room and leaving a mess; the argument over cleaning up outside his window; and acting in self-defence after he was attacked. Mr Moyano was, however, unable to give Dr Martin a coherent history of his mental health issues or treatments, or his diagnosis, but gave a history of former drug abuse and recent abstention. It was unclear to Dr Martin whether at the time of the offence Mr Moyano had recently taken medication, other substances, or alcohol.
	
	
	Mr Moyano was also able to tell Dr Martin that he had been charged with murder and that his defence was self-defence, because of death threats of “how he came at me”. Dr Martin considered that Mr Moyano had had a disturbed mental state during the ERISP, which was revealed by his lengthy, spontaneous responses in which he appeared to change topic illogically and in a manner suggestive of thought disorder.
	
	
	Dr Martin diagnosed Mr Moyano to be suffering a major mental illness, possibly schizo-affective disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, which had not responded to treatment. On interview, he was still presenting with an elevated effect, irritable, pressured in speech and thought disordered, overwhelmingly preoccupied with having been wronged. He was also experiencing manic and psychotic symptoms and while he understood what he had been charged with, he was thought disordered and unable to understand the legal process.
	
	
	Dr Martin also concluded that at the time of offending Mr Moyano was grossly mentally ill, so as to cause him difficulty in behaving reasonably or rationally; detrimentally affecting his ability to exert control; and impairing his judgment of his behaviour. His state made him likely to over react to perceived threats and potentially to feel provoked, when there was no threat. He was then paranoid and continued to be highly paranoid and psychotic. In the result Dr Martin also considered that Mr Moyano had a defence of mental illness, as well as a partial defence of substantial impairment, given the gross abnormality of his mind.
	
	
	In his oral evidence, Dr Martin also explained that at the time he stabbed Mr Lee, Mr Moyano was likely to have been aware that he was involved in an altercation and was carrying a knife, but his ability to recognise that his actions were morally wrong was significantly compromised by his mental illness. In cross-examination he explained that while Mr Moyano may have believed he was acting in self-defence, his beliefs then were delusional, informed by the underlying symptoms of his illness. He was angry and paranoid and hyper-aroused as a result, experiencing thought disordered delusions, which probably led to the arguments and behaviour which was out of proportion to any anger or threat which Mr Lee may have expressed or posed, Mr Moyano’s ability to behave reasonably and rationally having been impaired by his illness.
	
	
	Dr Martin also agreed that during police interview some seven hours later, it was possible for Mr Moyano to have held knowledge of the legal wrongfulness of acts which would result in his imprisonment, but with the consequences of his mental illness being moral justification for acting as he had.
	


An order must be made under s 39(1)


	
	On the evidence, it is apparent that despite treatment he received in custody, Mr Moyano continued to suffer the mental illness on which his defence was made out.
	
	
	I accept the common view of the psychiatric experts as to the serious nature of that ongoing illness, now chronic schizophrenia. As a result of that illness, Mr Moyano would unquestionably pose considerable risks to members of the community with whom he would come into contact, if not kept in custody. In the result, an order as to his release cannot be made under s 39, because it is not open to conclude on the evidence that the safety of members of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release. To the contrary, that danger is well established by the evidence I have discussed, which means that an order under s 39(1) must be made.
	
	
	The consequences of these conclusions must be considered. The practical consequences of an order under s 39(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act may be shortly stated. Mr Moyano will thereupon become a “forensic patient” under s 42 of the Forensic Provisions Act and will remain in custody until a decision is made by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, a body established under the Mental Health Act, to release him.
	
	
	That Tribunal must review his case, as soon as practicable after the s 39 order is made (Forensic Provisions Act, s 44). It may then make orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment, or as to his release.
	
	
	The Tribunal may not make an order for Mr Moyano's release unless satisfied, amongst other things, that his safety or that of any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release (Forensic Provisions Act, s 43). If an order for his release is not made, Mr Moyano will remain in detention, receiving care and treatment, in a place and manner which the Tribunal specifies. After the Tribunal's initial review, it must, at least once every six months, again review his case and must then make further orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place, or as to his release (Forensic Provisions Act, s 46).
	
	
	If the Tribunal makes an order that Mr Moyano be released, that order may be made on conditions, or his release may be ordered unconditionally (Forensic Provisions Act, s 47). If Mr Moyano breaches any condition imposed by the Tribunal or if his mental condition deteriorates after conditional release, so that he may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the Tribunal for his apprehension, care and detention (Forensic Provisions Act, s 68).
	
	
	The conditions of release which could be prescribed by the Tribunal include matters such as living in a particular place; taking particular medication; keeping appointments with health care professionals; and enrolment in educational and therapeutic programmes, to ensure that Mr Moyano is properly cared for (Forensic Provisions Act, s 75).
	
	
	Other than under any such future release order, the result of the order I propose to make under s 39 is that Mr Moyano will remain in strict custody. He may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release by the Tribunal, or where released on conditions and those conditions expire over time (Forensic Provisions Act, s 51).
	
	
	However, as I have explained, under this legislative scheme, Mr Moyano will only ever be released if the Tribunal is satisfied on evidence available to it in future, that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered.
	


Verdict


	
	Accordingly, under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, I enter a special verdict that Charles Robert Moyano is not guilty on the ground of mental illness.
	


Orders


	
	Under s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, I order that Mr Moyano is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.
	
	
	I also direct that as soon as practicable the Registrar:
	



	
	notify:
	



	
	the Minister of Health of the order; and
	
	
	the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the verdict and of this order, and
	



	
	provide the Tribunal with a copy of:
	



	
	these reasons;
	
	
	the transcript of the special hearing; and
	
	
	the exhibits tendered during the special hearing.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

On 1 October 2014 the applicants, MG and AE, pleaded not guilty to the murder of ED (the deceased). The trial before Hall J was heard with that of SB. The jury retired to consider its verdicts on 12 November 2014. On 21 November SB and AE were convicted of murder.


	
	His Honour gave a Black direction in relation to MG shortly after midday on 21 November. On 25 November 2014 the jury indicated in a note that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. His Honour directed the jury in accordance with s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 that they might return a majority verdict. On 26 November 2014 MG was found guilty by majority verdict of murder pursuant to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	MG was sentenced on 1 May 2015 to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years commencing 25 November 2014 and expiring 24 November 2022 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 24 November 2026.
	
	
	On the same day his Honour sentenced AE to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years commencing 20 November 2014 and expiring 19 November 2022 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 19 November 2026.
	
	
	Three co-offenders – JP, JH and AN – were convicted of manslaughter in respect of ED. JP and JH were convicted following separate trials. AN was charged with murder but the Crown accepted his guilty plea to manslaughter.
	
	
	MG and AE have appealed against their conviction for murder pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	MG relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1 – The verdict of guilty was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence.

Ground 2 – His Honour erred in directing the jury in relation to extended joint criminal enterprise for murder.

Ground 3 – In his directions on circumstantial evidence his Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that it was indispensable to a conclusion of guilt that:

(a)   The applicant wore the Lonsdale jumper at the time of the attack on ED; and

(b)   The applicant knew that JP had in his possession and intended to use the green bottle to assault ED.


	
	AE relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1 – The jury’s verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

Ground 2 – His Honour erred in not giving appropriate directions to the jury concerning evidence of the identification of AE.

Ground 3 – His Honour erred in not giving appropriate directions to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise.

OVERVIEW OF CROWN CASE


	
	The Crown case was that a group of six young men, being the applicants, JP, JH, AN and SB, attacked ED at a Halloween party at Bossley Park on 30 October 2010, at some time between 8.18pm and 8.40pm.
	
	
	The group, which called itself the “Wakeley Boys” arrived uninvited to look for the “Campbelltown Boys” but were unable to find them. The deceased was at the front of the house when at least one member of the group recognised him and called out to him. At some time between 8.23pm and 8.40pm the deceased approached the group and JP removed the deceased’s hat. At that moment one member of the group punched the deceased in the face and the deceased fell to the ground. The group of boys then proceeded to assault him and very early on in the attack, JP smashed a glass bottle over the deceased’s head. The attack by the group happened very quickly – in the order of about 5 - 10 seconds.
	
	
	The deceased managed to get up and run away. SB and AE gave chase but the deceased outran them. The group then got into a red car and drove off before returning to the party later that night to look for a knife. The deceased was found unconscious one and a half hours after the attack, lying at the side of the house. He remained in a coma until he died on 5 November 2010.
	
	
	The group of boys returned to the party approximately one hour later. Two of them, AE and JH, can be seen at the party in a photograph taken when they returned (Exhibit S).
	
	
	The Crown case was that the fatal blow was caused by JP smashing a bottle over the deceased’s head. According to the pathologist, Dr Wills, who performed a post mortem examination, the deceased died as a result of a head injury. Dr Wills said:
	


“Several sites of impact were present within the head and neck, one of which on the top of the head showed incised and bruised components.”


	
	His opinion was that the deceased’s injuries were indicative of an “assault involving several points of blunt impact to the head and face and additional sharp force injury”. He said that the wound on top of the deceased’s scalp could have been caused by a bottle being struck over his head. The deceased also sustained bruising to other parts of his body. The bruising to his lower limbs may have related to direct impacts and/or contacts with objects, including while stumbling and falling.
	
	
	The Crown relied on the concepts of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise. The Crown contended that an agreement to assault or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased could be inferred from the group’s behaviour. The Crown case was that the way in which the group surrounded the victim, outnumbered him and wielded weapons demonstrated a shared understanding that they would attack him.
	
	
	The Crown case was that JH thought that the deceased was a “snitch”. The deceased had previously given evidence to the police about an incident in which he was robbed and bashed by a group of men, one of whom was JH. JE, who knew both the deceased and JH at the time, gave evidence that the deceased had been labelled a “snitch” as a result of giving evidence to the police.
	
	
	The Crown case was that witnesses saw MG and AE at the party. Furthermore, although no witness identified him as participating in the attack, there was forensic evidence linking MG to the attack. There was eyewitness identification linking AE to the attack.
	


EVIDENCE AT TRIAL


	
	All the evidence at trial was called by the Crown. Neither MG nor AE gave evidence.
	
	
	There was uncontroversial evidence that the deceased had on a prior occasion given evidence to police in relation to an incident where he was robbed and assaulted by a group of males, one of whom was JH. The assault and robbery occurred in February 2010. There was evidence that in August 2010 JH had said “I still haven’t got him. I’m still going to get him back.” This was a reference to the deceased. It was the Crown case that JH held the opinion that the deceased was a “snitch”.
	


Before the assault


	
	A young woman, BT, hosted the Halloween party at Restwell Road, Bossley Park on 30 October 2010. She received notification on Facebook that someone purporting to be from the “Campbelltown Boys” wrote on her event page that they were going to bring drugs to her party. She did not want this to happen and spoke to a friend who said that he would deal with it. It transpired that the friend spoke to the “Wakeley Boys” who attended the party to deal with the “Campbelltown Boys”.
	
	
	BT gave evidence that 10 – 12 boys arrived at the party uninvited. When she asked if they were the “Wakeley Boys”, they replied “Yes”. BT told them that she did not want any trouble and that the “Campbelltown Boys” were not coming to the party. She said that most of the group were wearing Nike hats and bum bags, white shirts and white tracksuit pants, although one of them stood out because he was wearing a red shirt. After she spoke to them, BT said that she did not see them again that night.
	
	
	MH, another young woman, saw a group of 15 boys of Middle Eastern appearance arrive at the party. They were swearing and generally being loud and rowdy. She recognised JH and told him not to come to the party and “disrespect the house”. JH told her to “Shut the fuck up”. She later saw BT talk to the boys and tell them not to fight there but to take the fight somewhere else.
	
	
	LM was standing at the top of the driveway when he saw a group of 7 – 10 boys of Arabic background at the front of the house. He heard them ask for the “Campbelltown Boys”. He observed that one of them was holding a metal pole which he described as a dumbbell/barbell without the weights. (There was frequent reference to a “pole” in the evidence. That would appear to be a reference to a metal bar having the approximate dimensions described by LM.)
	
	
	KC went to the Halloween party in a gladiator costume. He was in the kitchen when he saw a group of six boys enter the house. They were acting in an aggressive manner and one of them was holding a pole. They asked him whether he was from Campbelltown. He saw them go into the backyard and ask other males at the party if they were from Campbelltown. He described the group as being of Middle Eastern and Assyrian background, dressed in jeans, sneakers and jumpers.
	
	
	JE arrived at the party with the deceased. He saw a group of more than five boys at the front door looking for people from Campbelltown. He recognised JH as a member of this group since JH was a friend of his. The group was behaving in an aggressive manner. They were of Middle Eastern appearance, of average height and were wearing athletic clothing. He said that the colour blue was stuck in his mind with regard to their clothing generally. He watched as the group made their way around the backyard asking about people from Campbelltown.
	
	
	JT was in the backyard when a group of five to seven males arrived at the party. The group was standing at the back door and were being loud and disruptive. He recognised one of the males, JH, because he knew him from school in the year above him. The group were all wearing similar clothing, specifically Adidas hoodies. The boys were of Assyrian background. He knew this because he had socialised with Assyrian people. He heard one of them say that he was looking to hit Assyrian Arabs and also heard them ask people if they were from Campbelltown.
	
	
	AM saw a group of about ten males of Assyrian background. One of the group called out “Who’s Campbelltown?” and the rest looked like they were going to start trouble.
	
	
	LDM saw a group of six to eight Assyrian males arrive at the party. He recognised JP because they were acquaintances. JP and the rest of the group were wearing dark clothing. JP was wearing a dark jumper and also carried a bum bag.
	
	
	GE was inside the house when he saw a group of five males of Middle Eastern appearance enter the house. They were all wearing similar clothing – hoodies and dark coloured clothing. Two of the males approached him and one of them asked if he was from Campbelltown. One of them held a knife pointed towards him. The person holding the knife was wearing dark clothing, possibly black, with a hood and tracksuit pants. The knife was about 20cm long. (A knife matching this description was subsequently located by police in the backyard of the house.) GE was with KC when he saw the knife. He also saw someone carrying a pole which was about 70cm long. The person carrying it was holding it next to his leg trying to conceal it.
	
	
	HAH saw a group of eight to ten males in the backyard asking if anyone was from Campbelltown. They were all dressed in similar clothing, i.e. tracksuit pants and jumpers. They were aggressive. The group then went to the front of the house. Subsequently one of them, JP, whom HAH knew from primary school, came back, grabbed an empty green wine bottle from the backyard and took it with him to the front of the house. JP tried to conceal the bottle by carrying it under his right arm, down by his leg. HAH saw BT when she went to speak to the group. He also saw that one of the boys in the group had a pole in the left pocket of his tracksuit pants. It was the size of a 30cm ruler, if not larger. It was silver or silver white. He was trying to conceal it with his hands.
	
	
	JD saw five young males get out of an old green car. She knew two of them – JH and JP. JP was wearing a black hoodie and was carrying a black bum bag over his shoulder. JH was wearing a white Adidas jacket and three quarter pants. He was also holding a brown wooden stick. As he walked into the house JH said “Let’s go have some fun boys”. She did not recognise the other three males but said that one of them was wearing a white t-shirt with no writing on it and shorts. Another was wearing a blue t-shirt and carrying a black jumper. These three were each carrying a pole.
	
	
	PP was at the front of the house when he saw a group of nine or ten Middle Eastern boys barge through the door. They were loud and were banging on the front door. He only saw one weapon which he described as “one piece of a car steering lock” about 60 cm long, black or silver in colour. He thought the group was looking for trouble and that one of them was asking if there were any Campbelltown boys at the party.
	
	
	BT was in the backyard when he noticed a group of over five boys arrive. One of them asked him if he was from Campbelltown and he saw that other members of the group were asking the same question of other people in the backyard. They were wearing a similar type of clothing – sloppy joes and Nike shoes. One of them was wearing a white sloppy joe with writing on the front.
	
	
	Two of the young women present at the party, CO and JD, took photographs during the night. These photographs formed part of Exhibit R.
	


The assault


	
	At the time of the assault on the deceased, a number of the party goers were at the front of the house. The evidence relating to the number of people in front of the house ranged from 20 to 50. The assault itself took place over a short period of time – between five and ten seconds.
	
	
	LM gave evidence that he was standing with some friends on the footpath out the front when he heard someone from the group of young Middle Eastern men say ""He's the one with the piercings, with all the piercings on his face"". About a minute later he heard one of the group call out ""Come here, you fat cunt"". At the time, he was facing the road and did not see to whom the comment was directed. About a minute later, while he was still facing the road LM heard what sounded like a slap.
	
	
	After hearing the slap, LM turned around and saw that the group had “circled” the deceased who was on one knee. There were six or seven people surrounding the deceased. They were the same people he had seen arrive at the party earlier. He saw one of the group hit the deceased over the head with a bottle, and saw it shatter. LM did not see any other weapon used in the assault. He then saw about seven of the group punch and kick the deceased. The assault lasted between five and ten seconds. The deceased got up and ran down the street. LM was standing about one - two metres from the group while the assault was happening.
	
	
	LM saw one of the group pursue the deceased and continue to assault him for a short period of time. He described this person as stocky/large, with black hair and wearing a black shirt and shorts. This person was not armed. He saw the majority of those involved in the assault, five or six of them, run to an old, red station wagon and get in. The car then took off in the same direction as the deceased. LM and a couple of his friends went to look for the deceased, but could not find him. LM was not able to say whether every member of the group was directly involved in the assault because he only saw what was happening after he turned around following the initial slap sound.
	
	
	TM was standing out the front talking to LDM when he heard a bottle smash. He turned around to see a group of men kicking and stomping the deceased. There were about ten or fifteen males in the group and they were standing in a “circular formation” around the deceased. The kicks and stomps were aimed at the deceased's torso and legs. The assault lasted about five to ten seconds. One of the males in the group was fat and was wearing a red t-shirt, and another was wearing a black jacket.
	
	
	TM saw the deceased eventually get up and run down the road. He was chased by a male wearing a hoodie who hit him twice in the back of the head with a pole. He described the male as having short black hair and short facial hair. He was skinny and about 185cm tall. The pole was silver, made of metal and about a metre long. After striking the deceased, the male turned back and ran towards Boronia Road. The other members of the group followed him into the road. TM said that he had seen four of the persons who were in a circular formation around the deceased, at the back of the house earlier in the night. He recognised JP as one of the males.
	
	
	BJ was also at the front of the house with LDM when he heard someone call out ""Come over here, you fat cunt"". He heard a bottle smash and then looked over to see a fight happening. The attackers were standing “all around” the deceased on the footpath. One of the attackers was holding a metal pole which was about 30cm long. It looked like a dumbbell without the weights. He did not see anyone use the pole.
	
	
	BJ saw persons punching and kicking the deceased who was on the ground. They were bending down and crouching over him. He was unsure how many people were involved in the assault but estimated around eight or 10 persons. He saw the deceased get up and run up the hill and the other males scatter in different directions. He did not see the deceased being chased but saw some people from the party run after him. When asked in cross-examination whether some of those persons present were not physically involved in the assault, he said that he was not sure ""but from what I seen there was a lot of people laying into him and kicking him"" (T 396.17). He described the attackers as wearing dark Nike brand clothing and some of them were wearing caps.
	
	
	CO gave evidence that she was about to leave the party at 8:30 or 9:00pm when she heard ""a few guys screaming"" just behind her. She turned around and saw a male with a bottle and he was ""throwing it down … in a downwards direction, I don't know if he actually let go of it or not"". She did not see the bottle strike anyone but heard it smash (T 428.22). She saw the deceased crouching on the ground with his hands over his head, and the attackers leaning over him. She recalled about seven or eight people, but only three or four of them were involved in the violence.
	
	
	CO only had a clear view of the male with the bottle but thought that the other attackers were kicking and punching the deceased. Before he was hit with the bottle, she saw the deceased being assaulted by three or four people. The main aggressors were the male holding the bottle and the two males on either side of him. Some of the males in the group looked like they were trying to help the deceased, and were pushing the other males away. She described the male with the bottle as wearing a white shirt, or light blue or light green shirt with dark pants.
	
	
	CO saw the deceased being chased by a few guys, but only two of them looked like they wanted to hurt him. One of the guys chasing the deceased was wearing a white hoodie. She saw him go up the road after the deceased, then cross the road and run the other way. She believed that he was the one she had earlier seen with the bottle. The other guy was wearing a dark blue or black shirt and was holding a metal pole. KC and AS were two of the males she saw trying to help the deceased.
	
	
	LDM heard arguing and then turned around to see who it was. He was standing about one and a half metres from a group which was standing near a truck. He then heard a smash and turned around again to see a group of six or eight males in a “circle formation” around the deceased who was on the ground. The males were punching and kicking the deceased. One of the males had a pole (which he described as a shopping trolley handle) and was raising it and then lowering it towards the deceased. He did not see whether the deceased was struck by the pole. The deceased managed to get up and run towards the park. The person with the pole chased him. He was not able to say that all the people standing around the deceased were punching and kicking him.
	
	
	JE gave evidence that he was standing on the footpath at the front of the house with ELD. The group of boys he had seen earlier were also at the front. When the deceased came out, he warned him that JH’s group was at the front and that he should go back inside. When the deceased was walking back to the house, one of the group called out ""hey fatty"". The deceased then walked to the group and one of them asked him about his hat to distract him from the others who were crowding around him in a semi-circle formation. At that point someone else struck a big blow to the right side of the deceased's head. Following that first blow, JE saw ""a barrage of hits and kicks and punches"" (T 643), and heard a bottle smashing, although he did not see the bottle come down on the deceased. At the time, the deceased's head was down but he managed to get up and run away. JE saw the deceased run towards Cowpasture Road, and he was followed by three people. One of the three was wearing a blue shirt but he did not see that person do anything violent towards the deceased. He agreed that it was pretty dark when he made his observations.
	
	
	JE said that about 20 people were standing in front of the house at the time of the assault, and that not all of those standing in the immediate vicinity of the assault were taking part. He saw only four of the males actually assault the deceased, but did not see their faces. He stated that JH was not one of the four. He described the violence as “very fierce” and having occurred “very quickly” - about 10 seconds.
	
	
	Immediately after the assault JE observed the group searching for a knife. He then saw them walk towards a red car parked across the road. JE tried to contact the deceased by sending him a text message asking what had happened and to call back. In cross-examination, JE agreed that he had lied to the police about certain matters in his first statement, not in attempt to hinder police in their investigation, but because he was concerned for his safety. He gave a further statement because he saw a photograph of himself in the newspaper with the caption “Does anyone know who these people may be?”. He also admitted lying in his second statement (T 709). He reiterated that his reason for lying was that he was afraid for his safety and that he did not want to be labelled a “snitch”. He felt guilty for standing by while the deceased was assaulted.
	
	
	ELD gave evidence that he was in the front yard with JE when he saw a group of four or five of the boys that he had seen earlier in the back yard. He heard one of the group say ""Oh that's the guy that snitched"", followed by ""Eden"" (the deceased’s first name). ELD told the deceased not to approach the group, but the deceased did so. ELD identified the person who was holding a pole as SB. He also identified JP who was holding a champagne bottle. ELD saw SB hit the deceased on the head with the pole, and then saw JP smash the bottle across his head. He saw another male punch the deceased. The deceased fell to the ground, got up and ran towards Cowpasture Road. A couple of minutes later, ELD saw a red car speed off.
	
	
	ELD saw only three of the persons in the group take part in the assault on the deceased. He did not see anyone running after the deceased, nor did he see anyone in a gladiator costume. He thought there were about 40 people in front of the house when he heard the group call out to the deceased. People were on the driveway, on the top section where he was standing next to JE (about 5 to 7 metres from the group), on the lawn area, the footpath and sitting on the retaining walls. He said that there were other people standing near the group who did not take part in the assault.
	
	
	JZ was standing on the driveway when he heard one of the group call out ""Hey Eden"". JZ went to move down the driveway towards the deceased, but was grabbed by someone who held him back and told him not to get involved. He saw one of the group take the deceased's hat off his head. At this point another came from behind a truck and hit the deceased in the face. JZ saw the deceased fall ""to the ground and I can't remember exactly but I remember two chubbier guys on his left and then they all ambushed him and they were all hitting him"" (T 842). JZ said that only the two chubby guys were involved in stomping or kicking the deceased. The deceased managed to run away and one of the guys followed him and grabbed onto his jacket, and threw a few punches which connected with the back of the deceased's head. The rest of the group ran off once the deceased had run away.
	
	
	The person who removed the deceased's hat was wearing a white hooded jacket and long pants. JZ said that there were 30 or more people at the front of the house at the time of the assault. He saw four or more males surround the deceased but agreed that in his statement he described only four as participating in the assault. He described the clothing of two of the people who assaulted the deceased - one was wearing a red top, and the other a yellow top. In addition to the four people, JZ said there was a fifth person and this was the person who chased the deceased. He described this person as wearing a white hooded jumper, he had dark skin and was of possible Arab background. JZ went to look for the deceased to see if he was okay but was not able to find him.
	
	
	KC was standing in the middle of the driveway when he saw a group of six males exit the house and come out the front. He heard someone say the deceased's name and then saw the deceased and the group walking towards each other. There were about 15 to 20 people in the front yard before the assault commenced.
	
	
	The first thing KC saw was a pole being swung like a baseball bat, but he did not see whether it hit the deceased. He described two separate altercations. The first took place at the bottom of the stairs and involved six to seven males punching and kicking the deceased. KC was standing about 10 metres away at the time. KC then moved from his position behind a car towards the deceased and his assailants. He saw the deceased break away from the group. Two of the males ran across the road. The deceased fell at the bottom of the driveway at which point the second altercation began which involved four or five males kicking and punching him.
	
	
	The deceased got up again and started running but was pursued by two of the group, one of whom had a pole and was trying to hit him, while the other was trying to push him from behind. This second person was wearing a blue shirt.
	
	
	KC gave evidence that he intervened and shoved the person with the pole as he was trying to hit the deceased with it, while the person in the blue shirt continued to try to push the deceased to the ground from behind. The only weapons KC saw were the bottle and the pole. He did not see whether the bottle hit the deceased.
	
	
	In cross-examination, KC accepted that in the committal proceedings he stated that there were close to 20 people in the area during the assault, but maintained his evidence at trial that there were about 14. He agreed that he had told police that it could have been only three or four boys that were stomping on the deceased. He was not concentrating on the faces of the males who were assaulting the deceased. He agreed that his observations were limited - he was standing ten metres away and there were shrubs and trees within his line of sight. He also agreed that at the time of the assault there were a lot of things going on (T 1059 – 1061).
	
	
	LDM gave evidence that he was standing about two metres away from where the assault took place. He heard arguing and turned to see what was happening when he heard a bottle smash. He saw a group of six to eight males in a circle formation, with the deceased on the ground. They were punching and kicking the deceased. He then saw KC and someone else run in and tell them to stop. The deceased got up and ran towards the park. LDM saw a male with a pole chase the deceased, as well as KC and others who ran after him to see if he was okay. He then saw the person with the pole run back down the opposite side of the road and turn into a street.
	
	
	JT did not witness the assault but heard the sound of what he believed to be a bottle smashing, as well as a male and a girl scream. He then saw three people running - two towards Cowpasture Road, and one towards the Marconi Club in the opposite direction. This person was wearing white tracksuit pants. He could not tell who the people were because it was dark. Of the two people running towards Cowpasture Road, the person in front was about 170cm tall and wearing black, and the second one was skinny and was wearing a green hoodie. JT then saw the male in the green hoodie run back the other way in the direction of the person in the white tracksuit pants. He was unable to say if the second person was a member of the group he had seen earlier in the backyard, or whether either person was holding a weapon. JT saw a “reddish” station wagon drive fast in the same direction as the two males running towards Cowpasture Road.
	


After the assault


	
	A number of witnesses saw the group return after the assault. Numbers ranged from between 5 and 15 persons.
	
	
	AC was standing on the veranda at the front of the house when the assault took place. She had heard a bottle smash and saw people running. She subsequently heard from someone that the deceased had been “bottled”. She called the deceased to ask what had happened. She spoke to him and his voice sounded out of breath, like he was running. The deceased told her that he could not talk and he would call back. She tried calling him back but was unsuccessful. AC went to the backyard where she saw JE and ED. She told them what she had heard and asked them whether they had seen the deceased, to which they replied “no”. When AC communicated with JE on Facebook the following week, he did not tell her that he had witnessed the assault, nor did ED in subsequent conversations.
	
	
	After the assault AP saw a large group of boys standing on a paved area next to the sliding door in the backyard. From that group she recognised JP, AE and MG. She was able to do so because she went to the same school. She had not seen any of them earlier that night. She said that MG had a plaited pony tail with a shaved head.
	
	
	SA was inside the house after the assault and saw the applicants AE and MG. She also saw JP and AN. It was about 9:30pm. She recognised them from school. She saw them dancing in a group of about 10 boys.
	
	
	After the assault, KC changed out of his gladiator costume. He did that when the group returned to the party. Some of the group were asking for the person in the gladiator outfit.
	
	
	GE gave evidence that when the group returned they were asking ""Where's the gladiator fuckwit?""
	
	
	LDM saw the same group of males about half an hour after the assault. JP approached him and asked for water as his hand was bleeding.
	
	
	TM saw JP after the assault with a cut on his hand which was bleeding. He also saw the person who had chased the deceased and hit him with the pole. He was no longer wearing a hoodie and was wearing a white t-shirt with writing on it and black tracksuit pants. He was still carrying the pole.
	
	
	JE gave evidence that when the group of boys returned to the party he socialised with JH. When the police arrived, he left the party with ED via a back alleyway.
	
	
	JD saw the same group of young men who got out of the old green car, come back to the party after the assault. She said that the person who was originally wearing a blue shirt had changed into a green shirt, but was still carrying the black jumper. This person was identified as MG’s brother. When the group came back to the party there were more than had originally arrived in the green car. One of them she identified as “AS” who was shown in the left corner of Exhibit AX. The other male in the right hand corner of the same photograph was AE.
	


IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE ASSAULT


	
	The persons involved in the assault were identified by a number of the partygoers as the applicant AE, JP, JH, AN and SB. The appellant MG was not identified by any of the eyewitnesses as having participated in the assault.
	
	
	During the course of the investigation, a number of witnesses were shown a photograph from Facebook. The photograph became Exhibit S and was referred to as the “lady in the silver dress” photograph. This photograph was taken at 9:14pm after the assault had taken place. It depicted the appellant AE wearing a blue Champion brand t-shirt, JH, AS and JE. Upon his arrest, AE signed a copy of the photograph to acknowledge that he was depicted in it (T 1197).
	
	
	KC first came across the photograph marked Exhibit S a week after the party and spoke to BT about it. He then took steps to find out the names of the people in the photograph including the applicant AE (T 1065, T 1071).
	


(a)   The applicant AE


	
	JE was shown Exhibit S by police on 9 February 2011, and did not at the time identify AE as one of the persons involved in the assault. However, when he was shown that photograph at trial, he said that the person in the blue shirt was one of the four involved in the attack and who then chased the deceased “I just remember him assaulting the deceased and chasing him afterwards"" (T 651-652.1). He maintained that evidence under cross-examination.
	
	
	JE also identified AE from photograph 8 in the third array shown to him on 5 May 2011 (Exhibit BJ). With regard to that photograph, JE said that he looked “sort of familiar” and he was “ pretty sure” that he saw the person at the party with the group of Middle Eastern boys (Exhibit BL at pp 4-5, T 659; T 723, T  725).
	
	
	JE was questioned about the influence that Facebook had on his version of events. He stated that it only had the “slightest” influence and that it solidified the facts in his mind after hearing them from “a lot of different areas”. The inquiries he made through Facebook did “not entirely” influence his evidence (T 721).
	
	
	KC gave evidence that one of the males who chased the deceased and tried to push him was wearing a blue “Champion” brand t-shirt (T 984, T 986, T 994). The shirt had black and white writing on it. KC described the male as “a bit chubby”. He also identified the male in the “lady in the silver dress” photograph (Exhibit S, Exhibit DU, photograph 23 in Exhibit R), and stated that he was one of the attackers who did the punching, kicking and stomping.
	
	
	In cross-examination, KC agreed that in his first and second statements to police on 31 October 2010 and 14 March 2011, he described the “tubby” person as wearing a blue shirt with black detailing on the front. He did not describe it has having the “Champion” brand on it. At the committal hearing on 2 October 2012, he gave evidence that the writing on the shirt could have been black or white - he knew the shirt was blue but was not sure if it had any pattern on it. He denied making up the further description of the shirt, and stated that he did not know why he had not given police the full description.
	
	
	KC participated in a photographic array procedure on 1 May 2011. He paused at a photograph of the applicant AE and said that he was not sure whether he was one of the group, but that he looked similar to one of them (T 1010). At the time he did not identify AE as having been a participant in the assault. In cross-examination he stated that he was confident that it was AE (T 1061, T 1064).
	
	
	SA identified AE in photograph 12 of the fourth photographic array shown to her on 6 September 2011. She remembered seeing him at the party dancing in the group with JP (T 535, Exhibit AT). She also identified him in Exhibit AU as the boy wearing the blue Champion t-shirt.
	
	
	AP identified AE in photograph 15 of the fourth photographic array shown to her on 6 September 2011. She stated that he was at the party with JP’s group.
	
	
	JZ identified AE from the photographic array shown to him on 30 April 2011. He said ""I paused on him because he's chubby like the guy and the one that I could see, he was closer to me that was stomping on him and, I don't know, the one next to him looked similar, but not the same. Do you know what I mean?""(T 860 - 861).
	


(b) The applicant MG


	
	MG was not identified as one of the persons who participated in the assault by the eyewitnesses but he was positively identified as being at the party that night.
	
	
	PP gave evidence that he saw MG with the group of Lebanese boys after the fight had occurred. He identified MG in a line-up on 20 May 2011. PP did not have any interaction with MG, and was not able to describe what he was wearing that night. He did not see the assault, and in cross-examination stated that he was 70 percent certain of his identification of MG.
	
	
	JT identified MG in photograph 6 in the second photographic array shown to him on 4 May 2011. He said to police that he was 75 percent sure that the person in the photograph was the person that he had seen in the group as he looked “very similar”. He stated that he had seen that person with JH around the area before and after the party. However, in cross-examination he stated that he could not be sure if MG was the person he had seen at the party, or only before and after the party. JT did not see the assault and could not recall what the person he thought might be MG was wearing.
	
	
	LDM recognised MG in photograph 6 in the first photographic array shown to him on 19 May 2011 (Exhibit AL). He was not sure whether MG was a person he had seen at the party. He recalled that a person at the party had a rat’s tail, but was not sure whether the person at the party was MG or his brother who also had a rat’s tail. His evidence was that the person with the rat’s tail was with the group of young Middle Eastern men at the party, but he did not know where this person was during the assault. LDM was unable to say what this person was wearing.
	
	
	SA did not recognise any of the boys who were involved in the fight, or who were running away from it because she was talking to a girlfriend at the time, and did not realise what was happening. She had previously been in a relationship with JP and knew MG. She knew him because she had seen him around at school. SA gave evidence of having seen MG at the party at about 9:30pm when the group of boys returned. She saw him standing near a wall and taking turns dancing with the other boys in the group. She identified MG in photograph 19 in the fifth photographic array shown to her on 6 September 2011 (Exhibit AT, T 533-535). She did not know that MG had a brother, and said that she did not see anyone at the party that looked similar to MG and who might have been his brother.
	
	
	AP gave evidence that MG was one of the males she saw amongst the group after the fight. She went to the same school as MG, who was in the year above her. She recalled that he had a shaved head with a small plaited ponytail at the back. She identified MG from photograph 2 in the fifth photographic array shown to her on 6 September 2011 (Exhibit BF). She was not aware that MG had a brother, and did not recall seeing anyone at the party who looked similar to MG. She was unable to say what MG was wearing at the party and did not know where he was at the time of the assault.
	


MG’s brother


	
	MG’s brother was present at the party. He is depicted in photograph 57 in Exhibit R. Both he and MG had rats’ tails at the time. The investigating police officer gave evidence that his photograph was not included in the identification procedures shown to witnesses.
	
	
	BT gave evidence that one of the people who arrived at the party, looking for the “Campbelltown boys”, had dark brown shaved hair and a thick rat’s tail and a stocky build. On 3 November 2011 he was shown a photograph from Facebook by police and recognised one of the people as the person he had seen with the long rat’s tail at the party. The rat’s tail was about 5cm thick and about 20 – 30cm long. This person was MG’s brother. BT did not think that the person with the rat’s tail was with the boys who returned to the red car.
	
	
	JD identified MG’s brother from Exhibit BB and photograph 57 in Exhibit R as one of the boys who came back to the party after the assault. She said that he was one of the people who jumped over the back fence when police arrived. In cross-examination she agreed that he was one of the people who arrived at the party with the original group and was wearing a blue shirt at the time. When he returned to the party after the assault, he was wearing a green shirt.

The arrival of police, ambulance and the medical treatment.


	
	Police attended the party at Restwell Road, Bossley Park at approximately 9.44pm and found the deceased lying on his back with his head resting on a gate which was closed. He was unconscious and struggling to breathe. Ambulance personnel arrived at approximately 10.46pm. The deceased was unconscious and having difficulty breathing. The airways in his nose were clotted with blood. He also appeared to be fitting or convulsing which was indicative of a head injury. The deceased was transported to Liverpool Hospital.
	
	
	The deceased arrived at Liverpool Hospital at 11.30pm. On presentation he had a very low level of consciousness – no eye opening to any form of stimulus, no verbal response and no motor response. A CT scan revealed a subdural haematoma on the left side of the brain, between the scalp and the skull. The injury could have been caused by a blow from a hard blunt object, or fist, or foot to the head. The deceased never regained consciousness and was confirmed brain dead on 5 November 2011.
	


DNA Evidence


	
	A document entitled “DNA Evidence” was tendered and marked Exhibit H. The document outlined the findings relating to a number of items that became of interest in the investigation.
	


(a)    Grey Lonsdale jacket


	
	A grey Lonsdale zip-up jacket was discovered on the driver's seat of the red car (photographs 17, 20, 43, 45, 47 & 20 in Exhibit D). The jacket was found to have two blood stains: the first on the front of the jacket, and the second on the waistband. The DNA recovered from both blood stains was the same profile as the deceased (T 185-186, Exhibit H).
	
	
	DNA was recovered from the inside left wrist cuff and it had the same profile as the applicant MG. Traces of DNA from another individual were also recovered but at levels too low to determine a profile (T185 - 186, Exhibit H).
	
	
	The forensic pathologist, Ms Collins, opined that the DNA matching MG on the grey Lonsdale jacket was more likely to have been directly transferred from him touching or wearing the jacket, rather than by secondary transfer. This occurs where another person or item has contact with the applicant’s DNA and then transfers it onto the jacket.
	
	
	The particular question and answer was:
	


“Q   … Given what was obtained from that trace or traces of DNA, are you able to give an opinion of the likelihood of it being a secondary transfer by reason of that result?

A. Depending on the type of transfer that might be suggested, for example, there’s several different types of secondary transfer, for example a wet blood stain is quite easily transferred. If I stick my finger in a wet blood stain and touch another item and the stain is wet then secondary transfer is very easy to do. Even it’s a dry blood stain, the transfer is harder because of the nature of the stain itself, there’s going to be less transfer and that’s a blood stain which is a very rich source of DNA. If you’re talking about trace DNA, or DNA from shed skin cells, that’s a much poorer source of DNA so there’s less DNA in that – I’ll call it a stain, it’s not really a stain, so the chances of actually transferring from an item a very small amount of DNA to another item, it gets harder the less DNA we’re starting with.

In this case the profile that we have recovered off the wrist cuff is mostly a single source profile so the transfer – there is one area of all of the ten areas that we looked at where there is one type which could be from another person so when we’re talking about traces it is a very low level of traces.

So the fact that it’s a single source profile and the level of DNA that we have recovered is a pretty reasonable level of DNA, I would suggest it’s more likely to be direct transfer from someone touching or wearing that area than would be from a second person having contact with DNA and then transferring it to that item. It’s more likely to be the primary transfer but I certainly can’t rule out the possibility, depending on the source, that that DNA turns out to be.” (T 199.32 – 200.7)

Ms Collins agreed that it was impossible to say how long the DNA had been present on the grey Lonsdale jacket.

(b)    Black cap


	
	A black cap was found in the boot of the red car (photographs 29, 30, 38 and 39 in Exhibit D). Forensic examination revealed a DNA mixture originating from two main individuals. The DNA was recovered from the sweatband of the cap. The major component of the DNA had the same profile as the deceased, and JP could not be excluded as a contributor to the mixture. Traces of DNA from another individual were recovered but at levels too low to interpret. A blood stain on the front of the cap matched the DNA profile of JP.
	


The red car


	
	Around the time of the assault on the deceased, or a short time after, a number of people saw a red car. These included LM (T 238, T 242); JT (T  320); CA (T 921); ED (T 762); JE (T 648); and BT (T 412).
	
	
	BT (a male), who had been at the Halloween party, lived three or four houses away. After police arrived and blocked off the street, he saw the same group of boys he had seen earlier that night hanging around what he thought was a red Toyota Camry, and then run off shortly after. He believed that they ran away when police blocked off the road. The person he had seen earlier in the white sloppy joe was with the group.
	
	
	While at the crime scene, one of the investigating police officers was approached by a male. He was taken to Boronia Road where a red Toyota Camry station wagon was pointed out to him. The vehicle was photographed and seized by police. The police officer placed his hand near the front grill and felt heat emanating from it.    RTA records showed that the red car was registered to Rayhana Hurmiz, who is the grandmother of the applicant MG. Police located two halves of a steering lock in the red car. One piece was in the front passenger's footwell, and the second was in the rear passenger's footwell.
	
	
	When police spoke to Rayhana Hurmiz and Eddie Saffar (her son and the father of MG) about the car, they were told that Eddie Saffar had sold it to SH for $200 on 28 October 2010. On 18 November 2010, SH collected the car from police. He was in the company of SB and another male.
	
	
	CCTV footage was obtained from KFC at Stocklands Mall, Wetherill Park, which showed the applicant MG, SH, JP and PB at the shop on 31 October 2010 at about 3:30pm (T 1407.39).
	


Fingerprint evidence


	
	A number of fingerprints were identified on the outside and inside of the red car, including those of the two applicants. The right palm print of AE was found on the outside of the car, on the pillar between the front offside window and windscreen. His left middle fingerprint was found on the outside on the front offside guard. His right palm print was found outside on the front bonnet edge. His right index fingerprint was found outside on the front bonnet edge. His left palm print was found outside on the front nearside window. Two right ring fingerprints and the left thumb print were found outside on the rear nearside window. The right thumb print was found outside on the rear nearside window. The right palm print was found outside on the rear nearside window. The right index middle fingerprint and left palm print were found outside on the rear offside window. The left thumb print was found on the rear vision mirror. The right palm print was found inside on the rear offside door frame area. A left thumb print was found inside on the rear nearside window. Two right thumb prints were found inside on the rear nearside window.
	
	
	In relation to MG, the right middle fingerprint and right little fingerprint were found outside on the rear offside door. The left middle and left ring fingerprints were found outside on the rear offside door.
	
	
	There were fingerprints of SB and AN found both outside and inside the motor vehicle.

The third recorded conversation - 3 March 2011


	
	Present during the third recorded conversation with MG was his father. During that conversation MG maintained that he had not gone out that night. When asked about JH, he stated that he would probably know him if he saw his face.
	


The fourth recorded conversation - 14 March 2011


	
	Present during the fourth conversation with MG was his father and his brothers. The following occurred:
	


(a)   With reference to being questioned on previous occasions about JH, MG was shown a copy of Exhibit S (photograph of the lady in the silver dress), and was asked if he recognised anyone in that photo. He said that he was unable to see it properly.

(b)   One of his brothers spoke out and said, “Yeah, but you can't see his face. I can't even see his face. He doesn't recognise it mate”.

(c)    MG then said that he did not recognise JH.

Telephone intercept evidence


	
	The Crown relied on the telephone records of the applicants AE and MG, as well as JH, JP, AN and SB to show that there were no calls between any of them between 7:50pm and 9:27pm on 30 October 2010. The telephone records showed that there was a continued association between those six persons, particularly in the period after the Halloween party and around the time that police were speaking to each of them.
	


(a)   Call charge records - AE


	
	The appellant AE's mobile telephone records were tendered and marked Exhibit DC. The records showed that:
	



	
	there were no telephone calls recorded from his phone to his mother's phone on 30 October 2010;
	
	
	there were no calls recorded from his phone between 6:05pm and 10:59pm; and
	
	
	there were two calls from his mother's phone to his phone at 9:36pm and 11:24pm.
	



	
	The Crown case was that the effect of this evidence was that AE could not have called his mother to come to pick him up after the assault and that the later calls from his mother suggested that he was not at home.
	


(b)   Call charge records - MG


	
	The applicant MG’s call charge records for 30 October 2010, were tendered and marked Exhibit DD. The records showed the following:
	



	
	There were calls to MG from JH, AE and AP (the mother of JP).
	
	
	There were no calls made or received by MG between 7:53pm and 8:40pm.
	
	
	At 8:52pm, JH attempted to call the MG three times.
	



	
	The Crown case was that the effect of this evidence was that JH and AE were both known to MG and showed an association between them.
	


(c)   Call charge records – the deceased


	
	The deceased's telephone records were included in Exhibit DF to establish that the assault took place sometime between 8:23pm and 8:43pm.
	


(d)   Telephone intercepts


	
	During the trial, the jury listened to a number of intercepted telephone conversations between those persons whom the Crown said had been involved in the assault on the deceased. The transcript and the audio of the conversations were tendered and marked Exhibits DH and DJ respectively.
	
	
	On 28 November 2010, there was a call between MG and JP at 7.04pm. The call was initiated by JP.
	
	
	When MG indicated that he would not be going to school until Tuesday, the following exchange took place:
	


“JP: Fuck bro I need to talk to you about something.

MG: About what?

JP: About the thing …”


	
	On 1 December 2010, there was a call between JP and MG at 10:11pm. By this stage, police had attended MG’s home, but had not spoken to him about the assault, nor had they spoken to JP about it. The call was initiated by JP and the following exchange took place:
	


“MG: Yeah, what are you doing?

JP: Nothing. Listen, are you going to give me a big hug tomorrow or what?;

MG: Why?

FP: Brother, you know all that thing, about that thing?

MG: About what?

IP: About the thing.

MG: Yeah?

JP: Everything's cleared off.”


	
	On 6 January 2011, a call was intercepted at 2:38pm between MG and JP, followed by a call between the two applicants at 2:44pm: The 2.38pm call was initiated by JP. The following exchange took place:
	


“MG: All these cunts are asking if I'm ‘little A’.

JP: All right, listen, ah look thing, grab all the boys AE and AN, we need to talk about the thing bro.

MG: All right, they're all coming here. Ah, where are you?

JP: I'm home, I'll be there in like ten minutes, let me get ready and shit.”


	
	The 2:44pm call was initiated by AE. The following exchange took place:
	


“AE: Where are youse.

MG: I'm at little A's.

AE: Walk Cubby.

MG: (Unintelligible) fuckin' come here, come here.

AE: Well what for?

MG: What do you mean what for? Come here bro. Yallah, bye.”


	
	On 7 January 2011, a number of calls were intercepted by police. At 12:39pm a call initiated by JP to MG took place. The following exchange occurred:
	


JP: How fast can you get to my house?

MG: Huh?

JP: How fast can you get to my house?

MG: Why?

JP: We need to talk.

MG: Um, not, not now, bro. My mum's upstairs (unintelligible).

JP: All right, listen, fucking...

MG: Message me.

JP: No, no, no, I can't. 'Cause it's about the thing.

MG: I'll talk to you today.”


	
	At 2:15pm a call initiated by AN was made to MG. The effect of the call was that MG was going to go to AN’s place that day.
	
	
	At 3:11pm a call initiated by AE to MG was made. In that call MG indicated that he was at AN’s place to which AE responded that he would be there in five minutes.
	
	
	At 5.42pm a call initiated by JP was made to MG. The content of the call was a suggestion by JP that MG go to a certain location.
	
	
	At 5.56pm a call initiated by AE was made to MG. MG agreed to meet AE at a specified location.
	
	
	A few days before 13 February 2011, one of the investigating police had attended AE’s home and spoke to his brother who advised that AE was at camp. On 13 February 2011 at 7:24pm there was a call initiated by AE to MG. The call concerned the visit by the police. Relevantly, the following was said:
	


“MG: Everything all right?

AE: Yeah. When they came I wasn't home, well I was at a camp.

MG: Yeah, I know. What happened, what did they want, what happened?

AE: I don't know, they just came and wanted to talk.

MG: Did they come back?

AE: No, they haven't come back yet.

MG: Does your mum know?

AE: Yeah.

MG: What did she say?

AE: Nothing.

MG: She doesn't...

AE: What could she say?

MG: She doesn't care, hey, 'cause she was all right, she was like, ""Oh, do you want me to drop you home"", and shit, I thought she didn't know about it.

AE: No. She knew.

MG: What did they want?

AE: I don't know, bro, they just wanted to ask me some questions.

MG: About what?

AE: About the thing. … That thing.

MG: Oh.

AE: Yeah.

MG: About, about that thing, oh, they even asked me too, cuz.

AE: Are you serious?

MG: About the party bullshit?

AE: Yeah.

MG: Yeah, they, remember when I told you they came to my house?

AE: Yeah.”


	
	It was the Crown case that the discussions about “the thing” were a reference to the assault, thus linking the persons who were involved in the assault to each other.
	


Taxi records


	
	Taxi records were tendered. These showed that at 11.19pm on 30 October 2010 a person calling himself JH booked a taxi from Gallipoli Street, Bossley Park for two people to be taken to Hoxton Park. The person who called the taxi was dropped off in the vicinity of Dalbertis Street, Abbotsbury, which is the home address of MG. It was the Crown case that one of the occupants of the taxi was JH.
	


Post mortem


	
	Dr Stephen Wills conducted a post-mortem examination of the deceased. He determined the cause of death to be from a head injury. There were a number of impact sites on the deceased's head and neck, the most prominent being on top of the head, which showed incised and bruised compartments. Dr Wills opined that the overall pattern and nature of the injuries could not be accounted for simply by a fall with impact to the ground. His opinion was that the injuries were indicative of an assault involving several points of blunt impact to the head and face, and additional sharp force injury.
	
	
	Dr Wills said that the incised wounds to the top of the head and to the left palm indicated the use of a sharp object such as a bottle. Incised wounds were generally caused by sharp objects, and the injury to the top of the deceased’s head was consistent with being hit over the head with a bottle.
	
	
	With regard to the head injury, Dr Wills stated that a subdural haemorrhage was present in the brain and that would have caused the brain to leak blood and build up pressure inside the skull, hampering the blood supply to the brain, and consequently preventing oxygen flow.
	
	
	Dr Wills gave evidence that following the infliction of the head injury, the deceased would still have been able to run, hide and make a telephone call before losing consciousness because the bleeding within the skull around the brain would take time to accumulate and put pressure on the brain.
	


Police investigation


	
	On 7 March 2011, police executed a search warrant at AE's home and took a blue Champion t-shirt which was on the line in the backyard. JP was arrested on 21 July 2011 and MG, AE, AN and SB were arrested on 19 October 2011.
	


CONVICTION APPEAL BY AE

Ground 1 – The jury’s verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	The applicant submitted that the Crown case was made up of circumstantial evidence and evidence of identification by JE and KC. The applicant submitted that there were a number of unsatisfactory aspects of that evidence so that this Court could not be satisfied that the evidence was honest and reliable.
	
	
	The matters relied upon on this issue by the applicant were:
	



	
	The conditions in which each eye witness’s observations of the relevant events were made.
	
	
	The number of people who comprised the group of uninvited males.
	
	
	The number of males actually involved in the assault on the deceased.
	
	
	The number of males who pursued the deceased on Restwell Road and the description of these males.
	
	
	The presence of at least two other young people in blue t-shirts at the party, including MG’s brother and the evidence of JD as to her observations that MG’s brother changed the colour of his shirt following the assault from blue to green.
	
	
	The absence of any identification of the applicant by those who were familiar with him at the time of the assault.
	
	
	The absence of any subsequent identification of the applicant on the night of the assault by those who were familiar with him or by other eye witnesses to the assault.
	
	
	The failure of all eye witnesses to the assault, including KC and JE, to identify the applicant during the photograph identification procedures.
	
	
	The circumstances surrounding the subsequent identification of the applicant from Exhibit S by KC on 1 May 2011 and then JE in his evidence at trial.
	



	
	The applicant submitted that there was no issue in the trial that it was dark when the assault took place, that the assault lasted about 10 seconds and that there was a large number of people standing around in the vicinity of the assault. At least five witnesses commented on how dark conditions were at the time. The estimates of the number of people in the vicinity of where the assault took place ranged between 30 and 50. The applicant submitted that the combined effect of this evidence would make it very difficult for anyone to make an accurate identification and that this evidence needed to be kept in mind when assessing the reliability of the evidence of KC and JE.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence of the number of people who comprised the group of uninvited males was not satisfactory. The numbers varied between four and fifteen. The applicant submitted that this variation in number was also a feature of the evidence in relation to how many people actually participated in the assault upon the deceased. The evidence on that issue provided a range of between four and ten persons. He submitted that this evidence was further complicated by the inconsistency in the evidence of how many people actually pursued the deceased following the assault upon him. The evidence varied from no persons pursuing him to three persons doing so.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that these inconsistencies had to be taken into account when assessing the evidence of JE and KC. JE said that he saw three people pursue the deceased and described one of them as being dressed in a blue shirt. He subsequently identified this person in court as the applicant AE. KC saw two people pursue the deceased and described one of these as being dressed in a blue shirt. He also subsequently identified that person as the applicant AE.
	
	
	On this issue the applicant relied upon KC’s initial description of the blue shirt as having a black design on the front. No mention was made in his first police statement, the day after the assault, of a Champion logo or white writing. The applicant noted that Exhibit BB was a photograph of MG’s brother from the party which depicted him dressed in a blue t-shirt with a black design on the front.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the fact that the photograph identification procedures undertaken by the police in April and May 2011 resulted in only two witnesses, AP and SA, identifying the applicant. Each did so not on the basis that he was involved in the assault upon the deceased, but because they each knew him before the party from school and recalled seeing him at the party. The applicant noted that they were both eyewitnesses to the assault upon the deceased, but did not at any time identify him as having been involved in the assault, despite seeing him at the party. The applicant noted that in April and May 2011, fourteen other witnesses participated in photographic identification procedures, yet none of them including KC and JE at that time, identified him as having participated in the assault.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his identification as a person who participated in the assault depended upon the identification of him by KC and JE from Exhibit S. He submitted that the circumstances surrounding each of those identifications made their reliability doubtful.
	
	
	In relation to JE, the first time he identified the applicant as one of the four persons who were actively involved in the assault on the deceased, was in his evidence at trial. When shown Exhibit S on 9 February 2011 he did not identify the applicant. When shown a photograph of the applicant in a photographic array on 5 May 2011 he did not identify him. The applicant referred to the admission by JE that in his first two interviews he had told a series of lies to the police. The applicant submitted that when all those matters were taken together, JE’s evidence was unsatisfactory and unreliable.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the identification of him by KC from Exhibit S was questionable. He submitted that given the conditions prevailing at the time, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for KC to identify him primarily from facial features which KC had the opportunity to observe. This was because the person in the blue shirt was running. That evidence of KC at trial, it was submitted, stood in stark contrast to the evidence which he gave at the committal proceedings to the effect that because it was dark, it was near impossible to be able to register the facial characteristics of the individuals involved in the assault. In further support of that submission, the applicant noted that KC had seen Exhibit S before he identified him on 1 May 2011. He had looked at it on Facebook. Despite this, he did not mention the photograph or its depiction of what he later claimed to be another of the deceased’s attackers in his second and third statements to the police before 1 May 2011.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that KC’s original description of the blue shirt was more consistent with that worn by MG’s brother, as depicted in Exhibit BB, than the one worn by the applicant in Exhibit S. The applicant submitted that KC’s evidence evolved into what was ultimately presented at trial so that his description of the blue shirt became more consistent with that worn by him in Exhibit S.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that this identification evidence from JE and KC was unsatisfactory and clearly unreliable. He submitted that the case against him was based almost entirely upon this identification evidence. He submitted that this Court should have a doubt as to the reliability of that evidence and that this doubt should have been one experienced by the jury.
	
	
	While the applicant accepted that the jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, he submitted that this advantage should not be overstated, particularly in the case of identification evidence. He submitted that the real danger with identification evidence was that mistaken witnesses could be very convincing. Accordingly, the benefit the jury had of hearing and seeing the witnesses was not as important when considering the reliability of identification evidence. The applicant submitted that this Court was in as good a position as the jury to make that assessment.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the benefit enjoyed by the jury essentially went to the question of the honesty of the witnesses, not their reliability. He submitted that reliability was a matter which this Court was better equipped to assess. He submitted that this Court was fully aware of the dangers associated with identification evidence and could compare the evidence of JE and KC against extrinsic evidence and the evidence of others who had a better opportunity and were better able to identify him as being amongst those who assaulted the deceased but were unable to do so. The applicant submitted that this was particularly so in this case where the identification was not spontaneous but occurred over a period of time with the inevitable risk of displacement and reconstruction because subsequent to the assault he was seen to be part of a group, some of whom were clearly involved in the assault.
	


Consideration


	
	The leading case in this area remains SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. There the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) said:
	


“11   It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12   This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13   The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses[5]. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

…

14   In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""”


	
	Subsequent to SKA, this Court has set out those principles in a number of cases. In Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83; 244 A Crim R 169 Bathurst CJ (with whom Price and McCallum JJ agreed) said:
	


“308   It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows that it was open to the jury to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113]. However, it is equally clear that it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. That was made clear in M, cited in SKA at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury as the fact finder, the court is left in reasonable doubt as to the verdict, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving that doubt, that the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [26] and [55]-[56]).”


	
	In Perish, Anthony v R; Perish, Andrew v R; Lawton, Matthew v R [2016] NSWCCA 89 the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J) said:
	


“350   The manner in which this Court should approach its task pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act was set out in M, MFA, R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 242 CLR 491 and SKA. When considering whether a verdict was unreasonable, the Court is to make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. The question for the Court is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, it would be dangerous in the circumstances to let the verdict of guilty stand. Put another way, the question is whether, upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.

351   In carrying out that task, the Court must not disregard or discount that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. As McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in MFA at [59] the determination by an appellate court as to the reasonableness of a jury’s verdict “involves a function to be performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of the accused in serious criminal trials”.”


	
	In Elwood v R [2016] NSWCCA 18 the Court (Meagher JA, McCallum and Button JJ) said:
	


“21   The question for this Court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt; in other words, “whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt”: Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Hayne J, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J relevantly agreeing), citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-493.

22   In answering that question the Court has to make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. In doing so, it is required to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses: M v The Queen at 493. Ordinarily a reasonable doubt entertained by this Court would be one which the jury also ought to have experienced, except where the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence could have resolved that doubt. The jury’s advantage is diminished but not removed where that evidence is or includes, as it does here, video recordings of police interviews given by the accused. However even where that is so, there remain the advantages identified by McCallum J in Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [480], which include, when evaluating all of the evidence, that of having seen other witnesses give any conflicting evidence.”


	
	While it was appropriate for the applicant to focus on the identification evidence in his submissions, this Court has to be mindful that particular pieces of evidence in the Crown case should not be considered in isolation but in the context of all of the evidence in the Crown case. This Court has to apply the principles set out above and reach its own conclusion based on the whole of that evidence.
	
	
	The advantage of the jury in assessing the evidence of JE and KC as to its reliability, has been somewhat understated by the applicant. There was a very substantial attack in cross-examination on the credibility of both JE and KC. This cross-examination covered all of the matters which have been raised in this appeal as indicative of the unreliability of the identification evidence. In the case of JE, stress was placed upon the lies which he told in his first two interviews with the police and his late identification of AE. The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing JE and KC when subjected to this vigorous examination. Accordingly, the jury was in a better position than this Court to assess not only what was said in response by those witnesses, but how they said it. As the statements of principle set out above make clear, on issues such as this appropriate weight has to be given to the primacy of the position of the jury as the finders of fact.
	
	
	It also needs to be remembered that unlike other observers of the assault, KC intervened, albeit towards the end of the assault. This gave him a better opportunity than anyone else to observe the two persons from the attacking group who chased the deceased. His evidence was:
	


“Q. And what happened?

A. The person in the blue shirt was trying to push him behind and the person with the pole was trying to line him up to hit him again. …

Q. What happened?

A. I kind of jumped in the way.

Q. You jumped in the way?

A. Yes, kind of pushing and shoving the guy with the pole.

Q. You rose to your feet at some point you said?

A. Yes once I heard the first altercation. Once I heard the first altercation.

Q. You stepped in why? Why did you do that?

A. Reaction.

Q. What did you do?

A. I shoved the person with the pole.” (T.984.6 - .36).

“Q. That left the blue shirt?

A. (No verbal reply).

Q. And what was blue shirt doing when you stepped in to stop the man with the pole?

A. Continuing to try and push Eden to the floor and attack him. …

Q. Did you do anything with the guy with the blue shirt?

A. No. He looked back and noticed his associates weren’t there with him so he went in between two cars and ran off after trying to push Eden.” (T.986.20 - .36)


	
	It is also important that when KC was shown the photo array, which included the applicant on 1 May 2011, he said:
	


“I recognised number 4 as looking similar to one of the members of the group of Assyrian males I described in paragraph 18 of my first statement. I’m not sure that he was one of them but he does look similar.” (Exhibit CT, T 1015.7)


	
	This was the occasion that KC told police that he had seen a Facebook photograph which depicted some of the persons involved in the assault on the deceased. It was on this occasion when shown the relevant photograph (Exhibit S) KC was able to identify the applicant.
	
	
	All of this material was before the jury, including an audio-visual record of KC examining the photographic arrays and identifying the Facebook photograph, Exhibit S. When that evidence, together with the cross-examination is taken into account, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that KC had reliably identified AE as being the person in the blue shirt who had been part of the group which assaulted the deceased.
	
	
	AE of course admitted that he was the person in the blue shirt in Exhibit S.
	
	
	It was never suggested that there was any collaboration between JE and KC. That being so, the evidence of each of them as to the identification of the applicant as forming part of the group who assaulted the deceased, supports that of the other.
	
	
	When the other matters which formed part of the Crown case against AE are added to the identification evidence, the Crown case against him was strong. There was the evidence of close association before, during and after the assault on the deceased with the other four people known (JH, JP, PB and AN) or said (MG) to have been involved in the assault. There is evidence that the applicant was at the party at the relevant time. The applicant’s fingerprints are on many locations on the inside and outside of the red station wagon, which is known to have been linked to the persons involved in the assault. There are the undoubted lies told to the police, which it was open to the jury to find, were told out of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	Although the only two witnesses to identify the applicant as involved in the assault on the deceased were JE and KC, there were other witnesses who identified him as being at the party at the relevant time (SA, AP and JZ). The Facebook photograph, Exhibit S, conclusively established that he was there at a time after the assault between 9.30pm and 10pm.
	
	
	The lies told by the applicant and the matters to which they relate are important. On two occasions the applicant told the police that he was not at the party after the assault. They were lies. He told the police that he had called his mother and arranged for her to collect him. That was a lie. He told the police that he had not seen any of his friends at the party. That was a lie. He told the police that he had never seen the red station wagon before. That was a lie. In the second ERISP, he said that he did not know anyone by the name of JH or AN, and denied having spoken to MG. They were lies.
	
	
	When the content of the telephone intercepts is taken into account, it was well open to the jury to accept that these lies were told out of a consciousness of guilt. The call on 6 January 2011 at 2.44pm was important because of the urgency with which MG wanted a meeting with the applicant. That was the day on which the police had spoken to SB. On the following day, there is further urgency in the conversation concerning another meeting between MG and the applicant. The call by the applicant to MG on 13 February 2011, where reference is made to the police asking questions “about the thing”, makes it clear that there was a continuing real concern on the part of the applicant about the death of the deceased. The level of concern evident from those three phone calls was much more than one would expect from someone who had a general interest in what had happened to the deceased because he was there.
	
	
	The position of the jury in this matter was not unlike that of the jury in Shamoun v R [2015] NSWCCA 246 where the chief Crown witness was a person of dubious character and antecedents, who had been shown to be dishonest on a number of earlier occasions. In that case, I said (Hall and McCallum JJ agreeing):
	


“91   The Crown case depended upon the jury’s acceptance of Saad. His credit was very much at issue and defence counsel at trial spent many days cross-examining him in order to discredit him. The jury were repeatedly warned of his potential unreliability and the summing up identified in detail the applicant’s criticisms of his evidence. There were, as the applicant has identified, inconsistencies in Saad’s evidence and in that regard the evidence of the Vespermans and the phone call of 12.05am were emphasised. Even so, it is not sufficient for the applicant to merely submit that as an acknowledged liar and perjurer, Saad’s evidence should not be accepted.

92   No Crown case is ever perfect and there are often unanswered questions. An important factor here is the amount of time which had elapsed between the murder and the trial. That of itself provides a reasonable explanation for why, not only in relation to Saad’s evidence but that of other witnesses, there were inconsistencies and differences between the evidence at trial and statements made many years earlier.

93   Most particularly, however, this was a case where the jury had a very significant advantage over this Court in assessing the credibility of Saad. This case provides a good example of the qualification expressed by the plurality in M that when considering a ground asserting the unreasonableness of a verdict, the Court “must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses”. (M at [7] and SKA at [15]). In this case, the assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence of Saad was quintessentially one for the jury to determine.”


	
	In the same case McCallum J said:
	


“290   … The case was opened and run on the basis that Saad was the central witness. The advantages enjoyed by the jury in assessing his evidence were significant. There were aspects of his evidence that were unsatisfactory but it does not follow that he could not be accepted on the critical issue whether the applicant was with him that night. …”


	
	Although we do not know what happened at the various meetings which were organised and referred to in the telephone intercepts, there was a clear inference available that the subject matter of these meetings was the death of the deceased and the police investigations which were being carried out into it.
	
	
	On the basis of the above evidence, I am not left with any reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the verdict. On the contrary, I have concluded that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


His Honour erred in not giving appropriate directions to the jury concerning evidence of the identification of the appellant?


	
	The applicant accepted that his Honour spent considerable time in his summing up explaining to the jury the difficulties associated with identification generally and making specific reference to the evidence. Nevertheless, the applicant submits that the directions did not go far enough.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the nature of the Crown case against him was such that a direction consistent with the decision in Domican v R [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 was required to be delivered to the jury in unequivocal terms.
	
	
	The applicant’s specific complaints were articulated as follows:
	


“126   The evidence of the identification of the appellant by KC and JE was not merely significant to the Crown’s case against the appellant but essential. In the circumstances of the appellant’s case, it was not sufficient for the trial judge to direct the jury in terms of the general need for caution.

127   What was required was for the trial judge to identify the various matters affecting the reliability of the identification of the appellant by KC and JE in the circumstances of this case and to advise the jury of the special need for caution by reference to those matters as well as the general need for caution. While the trial judge did recite the submissions of counsel setting out the circumstances leading to the special need for caution in this particular case, that is not sufficient. Repetition of counsel’s argument is not sufficient. The special need for caution by reference to the circumstances of this particular case must come with the imprimatur of the judge.

128   Further, even when the trial judge referenced the type of matter set out by counsel and referred to his warning, he stated “In line with what I earlier said are matters that can require special caution with identification evidence. They apply in this case and they are drawn to your attention so that you will take those into account in your consideration of the facts in this case in making decisions about the issues that are relevant to determine the Crown case against AE and those matters also of course apply to the two other accused”.

129   The difficulty with this passage is that it belies the danger. The judge should not tell the jury that these matters can require a special caution, it is not the matters referred to that require special caution, it is the acceptance of the identification evidence that requires special need for caution. The matters referred to, in conjunction with the general danger, are the reasons for that special need.

130   Further it is not that the matters “can” require special caution, that leaves it to the jury to decide whether or not to exercise special caution. The judge has an obligation to tell them there is a special need for caution and the reason for that need for caution, both general and specific.”


	
	In oral submissions, the argument was put in this way:
	


“The major issue that isn't met by the Crown setting out the entirety of what the judge said is set out in my submissions at paragraph 129 and in particular the fact that the judge talks about the matters that can require special identification evidence. What the judge doesn't do, it's the identification itself that requires the special caution. In my submission, the fact that the judge, on occasions, through the course of the passage - set out in full in the Crown's submissions - about some of the dangers, he doesn't state, as he should, in my submission, that is, the identification itself that requires special caution when one deals with it and the matters associated with that are the things that lead to the identification evidence itself requiring special caution.” (AT 10.1)

Consideration


	
	At SU 41 – 48 his Honour gave the jury general directions on identification evidence. In particular, his Honour said at (SU 45 – 47):
	


“Members of the jury, as I've earlier indicated, there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence. There may be a number of reasons for that caution. They concern the issue of reliability of such evidence, including reliability, in particular, in the circumstances established in this case.

There have been cases where innocent persons have been convicted on the basis of mistaken identity or identification. Honest witnesses may be certain as to identifying a person and yet be mistaken. Mistakes may be made even where there are multiple witnesses. A mistake may be made even by witnesses who knew an accused person before the occasion on which the offence was committed, and grave miscarriages of justice can occur if identification is mistaken.

In this case certain witnesses said they heard and/or saw persons and various events take place. Others said they did not see what other witnesses said they saw and heard. That, of course, is explained in many cases by reason of the fact that they were not in a position to see what happened. That may be because of the position they have taken up, or were occupying when this sudden attack occurred, or there may be obstruction of vision, for one reason or another, such as bushes or other persons standing in the line of sight.

Others were not looking in the direction of where the assault took place when it commenced. Some only turned to look upon the hearing of a glass or bottle smashing. You will need to bring into account the matters to which I have referred in evaluating the reliability of the identification evidence, and as I've indicated, there can be a number of factors or circumstances that may impact on the ability of a person to identify the accused in this case.

Mostly, and I'm sure it’s apparent to you, that would include the sudden violent nature and associated stress of the situation. They include the lighting conditions in the relevant area, or areas, having regard to the time at which the attack occurred, after sunset, and the relative darkness in that area, or areas, although you will have regard to the evidence that there was some lighting there.

The distance from which any of the eyewitnesses stood from the scene of the attack is another factor. The number of persons that formed the group of attackers is another. The fact that a number of months had passed since 31 October 2010, and the photo arrays that were taken, for example, in May 2011. Whether the witness saw a member or members of the group, or the accused in particular, at only one point in time during that evening, or whether he or she had the opportunity of seeing persons who are members of that group more than once during that evening, 31 October 2010.

Persons in the latter category, obviously, had a greater opportunity than those in the former. All of these sort of factors may have an important bearing and effect upon the reliability of identification evidence.

Accordingly, you are required to scrutinise the evidence, scrutinise the evidence of identification, in this case with special care, and to exercise particular caution before accepting it as reliable.

The reasons for that caution, which I've outlined - I don't mean to say that they're totally exclusive - but you've heard matters raised in the submissions of counsel as well for the accused. Those matters all are relevant to the identification of persons in what I've referred to as the pre-attack segment, in the attack segment, and in the pursuit or chase segment. They depend upon many variables which include, as I've said …”


	
	At the start of day 2 in the summing up (7 November 2011) counsel for the applicant asked his Honour to deal more fully with the defence case on identification. In addition to referring to counsel’s submissions in respect of JE’s evidence, his Honour went through the many reasons that counsel for the applicant had submitted to the jury gave rise to the danger of unreliability of KC’s evidence. His Honour did this at SU 219 – 223.
	
	
	The matters specifically identified by his Honour were:
	



	
	The brevity of the time in which the events occurred.
	
	
	Darkness.
	
	
	Shrubs in his line of sight.
	
	
	The period between the events and the process of identification.
	
	
	The change from uncertainty to certainty in KC’s version of the applicant’s involvement.
	
	
	The inability to recall facial features.
	
	
	The change in his description of the blue shirt.
	
	
	Error in describing the applicant as wearing jeans.
	
	
	Undertaking his own investigations.
	
	
	Never telling police that he had seen the applicant’s face when he turned round.
	
	
	Not mentioning having seen Exhibit S, (photo on Facebook), for some months.
	
	
	The suggested exaggeration in how he dealt with the person with the pole.
	



	
	On the morning of day 4 of the summing up (11 November 2014), the following exchange took place between his Honour and counsel for the applicant at SU 229:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Mr Conwell, I received your written suggested directions. I had myself last night gone through the evidence and I am satisfied, and I have made my own notes which record many of the matters you have raised, and I intend to, as I'm presently dealing with the evidence of KC and the issue of reliability arises, make reference to many of the matters that are dealt with in your memorandum of submissions.

MFI # 59 WRITTEN SUGGESTED DIRECTIONS OF MR CONWELL DATED 10.11.14

HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else you wish to say?

CONWELL: I rely on those written directions, but may I emphasise, your Honour, that the directions should come from the Court and not from me.”


	
	I have read MFI 59 and it would be fair to say that his Honour’s further directions as to identification contain almost word for word what is in MFI 59, except for the submissions of law. What his Honour said was:
	


“Members of the jury, I want to continue with the submissions made on behalf of AE by Mr Conwell. You may recall he had identified five factors which went to the observations that took place by KC and that part of his submissions were directed to the question of the reliability of his evidence. I will not repeat all of those matters but I will come back and deal with them in a moment. He, however, identified them as including matters of what he called the darkness factor, the period of time in which observations are made and the delay in the identification process and so on and I will deal with that in a moment in greater detail. So the submission is directed to the proposition that by reference to these matters, the reliability of KC is a significant matter.

I earlier gave you directions that identification evidence requires the exercise of special caution because even honest witnesses can be mistaken and it is therefore these matters that were relied upon as indicating the relevant matters which are said to go to the reliability of KC’s evidence.

KC, as you will recall, attended and gave his account of what he said he saw and heard and the matters that are relied upon on behalf of AE as going to the issue of reliability include the fact that KC did not previously know AE. In other words, there is no recognition involved here of someone whom he previously knew because he did not know him before this night and that is a reality and it is important to take it into account because identifying persons who have been previously known to another person can be wrong and, of course, identification of somebody who is a stranger also carries an obvious risk of that kind and that is to be factored in.

The amount of time that elapsed when the observations made by KC plainly is important. This episode, as it were, unfolded very quickly and you have heard evidence about that, varying from a period of five to ten seconds, or something of that order, when the attack itself was occurring, and that is a limited period of time in which to absorb, make observations and take in information. That is a factor obviously you would take into account. A lot was happening at that time so that can operate as a factor, as you would appreciate in ordinary life, which can distract and affect the accuracy of observations.

And then the issue of the lighting conditions, and you have heard evidence about it, I will not repeat it, but it obviously is relevant, you must take it into account in determining accuracy in observations. At the time of the attack on the deceased, as you have heard, it was not day-time but in the evening.

You have heard comments about - and I mentioned them yesterday - about KC's intervention. There is some dispute as to exactly what was the manner of his intervention, as I mentioned, but the question also to be taken into account is: Well, is he in a position to make observations of the person he sees in the blue shirt in the drama of the moment, firstly, because the drama of the moment can affect reliability of observations and, secondly, what is occurring, such as chasing somebody after such a dramatic incident itself can impair observations, it distracts perhaps because of the events. I mentioned yesterday that when you are looking through a line of sight you also have to bear in mind that if a line of sight is impaired by people standing in that line of vision, there are shrubs and so on, you take that into account.

Reliance is placed on the evidence of KC in this trial and he was particularly asked about how close his observations were and he, you might think, was quite candid with some of the answers he gave, and I will refer to some of those questions.

He was asked in cross-examination by Mr Conwell a number of questions

directed to exploring what opportunity, in terms of whether it was a limited

opportunity, he had to make observations, so that KC was asked:

""Q. You weren't in a position to make any close observations of these individuals' faces, correct?

A. No.

Q. You could not see colour of eyes or else make observations in relation to facial features up close, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. What about their faces, could you see them?

A. I wasn't really concentrating on their faces during the attack, just

watching what was going on essentially.""

And a question was raised as to whether he was focusing on the group particularly at the front at the time that was occurring. The evidence he gave indicated that there was no focus on the group out the front and you will recall the evidence as to when his attention was first directed to it and he gave evidence of what he said he saw.

Members of the jury, those matters are the sort of matters that, in line with what I earlier said, are matters that can require special caution with identification evidence, they apply in this case and they are drawn to your attention so that you will take those into account in your consideration of the facts in this case in making decisions about the issues that are relevant to determining the Crown case against AE, and those matters also of course apply to the two other accused.

A question was put to him, you may recall, that was put to him in the committal proceedings in October 2012. It was this question:

""Q. And as a result of it being dark, it was near impossible, I would

suggest, for you to be able to register at this time the facial

descriptions or the facial characteristics of these individuals,

correct?

A. I guess, yeah, correct.""

That is consistent with what I said a moment ago as to his response about

facial characteristics and the like.

There were a number of issues raised with him as to the process by which he was asked to identify, or try and identify, relevant persons and you recall that the initial statement he gave was on 31 October 2010 and then on 14 March 2011 he was asked to come back to deal with a statement by Detective Barnes and Detective Barnes' evidence on that is at transcript 1363, which I will remind you of briefly.

He explained why he called him back in, was to do with a statement that there had been an oversight and that that was required. It was a statement that should be included about whether the person had told the truth in the statement. He gave that explanation and he said he did not take the opportunity on that occasion to ask him if he wanted to change anything or add anything to the first statement.

So the submissions put were that there were changes in KC's evidence and you will recall the references were that he initially referred to the black writing, he did not refer initially to the Champion white writing, and it was put that he had no explanation for not telling the police on 31 October 2010 for not having done so.

The next step was, as I have just referred to, the statement of 14 March and, accordingly, it was not until 1 May 2011 for the first time KC raised this question of exhibit S, the girl in the silver dress photo. I went through the

evidence yesterday about how that came about, at the end of the photo array KC said he remembered something about having seen the photograph and so on. But the submission put was that there was a delay nonetheless between 31 October 2010, when he made his first statement, and 1 May 2011 and that you would have regard to the fact that that delay occurred before KC raised with police, having seen that photograph soon after the attack on his computer. And this is in effect the submission that there has been a progression in his evidence over time and that goes to the issue of his reliability.

Additionally, it was put that he never told police, ""That looks like the face that turned around and glanced at me when he was chasing [the deceased] up the street"". Mr Conwell says he did not say that.

It was put that he said in evidence that he commenced to make some investigations, he was a friend of [the deceased's], and he wanted to do all he could to assist police. It was in that context that this question of the 14 May and the 30 May meeting, to which I have just referred, was raised in the submission to you.

So the submission on this area was, according to Mr Conwell, the point he was seeking to make was that it cannot be the case that if KC was keeping it up his sleeve for a later arrangement, that is, a later arrangement, as I understand the submission to be, to then tell the police, because there had not been one. In other words, arrangement had been made as at 14 March for him to come in in May, that arrangement was made later, so it is not as if he was saving that up until that meeting. So the submission is you would have regard to that, as you would to the progression of the statement. The original statement was blue shirt, black writing, chubby, and then it changed to black and white or white at the committal, that sort of progression submission.

A submission was also made that the photograph, Exhibit SH, shows AE, and perhaps a third or a half of a full torso and that KC said at the time he was within the proximity when the photograph was taken, that he would have seen AE's full body and in the committal evidence in 2012 he said the boy in the blue shirt was wearing jeans, and we know that is not the case and I made mention of that yesterday.

A further issue raised was the one I have already touched upon, and that

is the issue of darkness, it being dark, and the evidence he gave on that

subject in the committal was:

""Q. As a result of it being dark it was near impossible, I would

suggest, for you to be able to register at this time the facial

descriptions or the facial characteristics of these individuals,

correct?

A. I guess, yeah, correct.""

And then the other matters which I have already raised this morning.

The submission was in May 2011 he said the picture of AE looked similar to someone in the group, that was in the photo identification process, and the submission was that it has now grown to: I can see the face of the boy in the blue shirt when he looked up. I recognised his face from later photos that were given to me to identify, and the submission was, well, that could not be and that is a matter for you to assess.

It was submitted that he could not give a reason why he did not tell police back in May 2011 during the walk-through as to why he did not then provide that information.

It was said that KC said that the boy in the blue shirt was in, what he termed, the arrival group. He said the boy in the blue shirt was in the group that assaulted [the deceased] and he said the boy in the blue was in the return group. It was put that that would be a very big stretch, that was the way it was put by counsel. When he was asked by Mr Conwell about the boy in the blue being in the return group, he agreed and then he has put the question:

""Q. It's an assumption that they were the same boys in the group, isn't it?

A. Most certainly they were, definitely. I guess an assumption, I guess to me it would be that. Yeah, they were there.""

The submission was with respect to KC he was assuming that the boy in the blue shirt was in the original group and he (Mr Conwell) made reference to the fact that AE had originally arrived at the party by being dropped off by his mother.

Now, the submission was developed further by referring to the evidence of other witnesses and in effect the submission was: Well, if you take into account what others say, what does that tell you about the reliability of KC. You were taken through the evidence of six other witnesses who were in the near area of the assault and Mr Conwell said, ""They all see something different"" and the submission to you on that was: ""That is one of the dangers of the mind, it's a danger of identification evidence, no one sees the same thing, and that would be clear.""

That was the submission.” (His Honour then summarised the evidence of those six persons.) (SU 231 – 238)


	
	As indicated by the underlining, his Honour was directing the jury that they had to take into account all of the matters referred to as requiring special caution. These directions had the authority of the court behind them. Significantly, no further direction or redirection was sought by counsel for the applicant.
	
	
	The directions given by his Honour were fully consistent with MFI 59 and covered the precise areas identified by counsel for the applicant. The authority of the court was given to the summing up by his Honour referring to the relevant submission but adding the injunction that “This was a matter which the jury had to take into account”.
	
	
	Given that his Honour had dealt with the question of identification at some length on three separate occasions, it could not be said that the jury were unaware of or misunderstood the dangers of accepting unqualified identification evidence. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – His Honour erred in not giving appropriate directions to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise.


	
	The applicant accepted that his Honour’s direction as to extended joint criminal enterprise was consistent with the High Court’s decisions in McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at [117] – [118] and Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 at [112]. The applicant submitted, however, that the decision in McAuliffe was inconsistent with that of the United Kingdom Supreme Court in R v Jogee; Ruddock v The Queen [2016] UKSC 8; 2 All ER 1. That issue was considered by the High Court in Miller v The Queen; Smith v The Queen; Presley v Director of Public Prosecutions (SA) [2016] HCA 30. The High Court upheld the test set out in McAuliffe and declined to follow the United Kingdom Supreme Court decision in Jogee. Accordingly, this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	In relation to the application by AE, the orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	


THE APPEAL BY APPLICANT MG

Ground 1 – The verdict of guilty was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	The applicant submitted that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he participated in the attack on the deceased, or that he was present, ready, willing and able to assist in that attack. In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon seven propositions.
	
	
	The first proposition was that there was no eyewitness who clearly and positively identified the applicant as present at the party at the time the deceased was attacked. The applicant accepted that there were eyewitnesses who positively identified him at the party but submitted that the evidence primarily related to a time after the deceased had been assaulted.
	
	
	PP saw the applicant at the party with some Lebanese boys after the assault. His evidence is summarised at [84] hereof. This evidence is qualified by the 70 percent estimate.
	
	
	JT gave evidence that he was about 75 percent sure that MG arrived with the group of young men of Middle Eastern appearance. His evidence is summarised at [85] hereof. The applicant submitted that the concessions in cross-examination seriously undermined the evidence in chief.
	
	
	LDM had some doubt in identifying MG as being at the party. He did recall that a person who looked like MG had a rat’s tail. His evidence is summarised at [86] hereof.
	
	
	SA identified MG at the party but she only saw him when the group of young men returned to the party at about 9.30pm after the attack on the deceased. Her evidence is summarised at [87] hereof. AP gave evidence to similar effect as SA. Her evidence is summarised at [88] hereof.
	
	
	The matter was further complicated by evidence that MG’s brother was also at the party. This was established by a photograph taken at the party. MG’s brother looked rather like him with a rat’s tail hairstyle. MG’s brother’s photograph was never put in an identification procedure for witnesses to look at.
	
	
	BT gave evidence that one of the persons in the group, who arrived looking for the “Campbelltown boys”, had a thick rat’s tail. The person he identified from one of the Facebook photographs was MG’s brother. He described the rat’s tail as about 5cm thick. BT’s evidence is summarised at [90] hereof.
	
	
	JD identified MG’s brother from Exhibit BB and photograph 57 in Exhibit R as one of the boys who came back to the party after the attack on the deceased. Her evidence is summarised at [91] hereof.
	
	
	JE could not recall seeing MG’s brother in the group who were attacking the deceased.
	
	
	The second proposition relied upon by MG was that there were no eyewitnesses who identified him as participating in the attack on the deceased, or even being in the vicinity of the deceased when he was attacked. There was no-one in the Crown case who gave evidence to that effect. In a negative sense, there was evidence identifying JP, AE, JH, AN and SB as part of the group that had participated in the attack on the deceased. No-one identified MG.
	
	
	The third proposition was that it was not open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that because MG was one of the “Wakeley boys” who attended the party, he must therefore have been part of the group who attacked the deceased, or was someone who was present, ready, willing and able to assist the attackers. The applicant submitted that the preponderance of evidence was that not all of the “Wakeley boys” were involved in the attack on the deceased.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that when one looked at the evidence of all of the eyewitnesses as to the number of “Wakeley boys” who initially arrived at the party and at the estimate of the numbers of persons actually involved in the attack, there was a significant difference. The preponderance of evidence indicated that there were more “Wakeley boys” who attended the party than were involved in the assault. The applicant relied upon evidence to the effect that there were only three or four persons who were active in assaulting the deceased and if that were so, by a process of elimination when one had regard to the persons who were actually identified as so involved, there was a strong likelihood that MG was not.
	
	
	On that latter issue, the applicant placed particular weight on the evidence of CO, who was close to what occurred and was definite in her assessment that only three or four persons at most were involved in the assault on the deceased and that some of the persons standing nearby were seeking to help him rather than harm him.
	
	
	The fourth proposition relied upon by the applicant concerned the limitations of the Crown’s reliance upon the grey Lonsdale jacket to link him to the assault on the deceased. The applicant submitted that no witness at the party saw him wearing the grey Lonsdale jacket, nor did any witness see anyone at the party wearing anything which looked like the grey Lonsdale jacket.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that although a number of witnesses gave evidence of what clothing the “Wakeley boys” and/or those who assaulted the deceased were wearing, not a single description matched the grey Lonsdale jacket. The applicant submitted that in those circumstances, it was not open for the jury to find that he was wearing the Lonsdale jacket when he was at the party or at the time of the attack on the deceased. On this issue, the applicant relied upon two alternative reasonable scenarios, which were consistent with his innocence, i.e.
	



	
	He wore that jacket at a time other than when he was at the party; or
	
	
	The deceased’s blood was transferred onto the jacket by one of the co-accused who returned to the red car after the attack on the deceased.
	



	
	The applicant submitted that the existence of such scenarios, consistent with innocence, was important because without the grey Lonsdale jacket the Crown could not link him to the offence. There was simply no evidence linking him to the assault on the deceased. The applicant submitted that the evidence of lies and the evidence of the telephone intercepts proved no more than that he was present at the party at some stage and had some knowledge of the assault, but did not prove that he was one of the persons who was a participant in the assault.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the difficulties associated with linking the grey Lonsdale jacket to him could be assessed on a different basis. There was no evidence that anyone wore the Lonsdale jacket that night. There is circumstantial evidence that the applicant did not wear it at the time that the deceased was assaulted. Finally the evidence is consistent with the deceased’s blood being transferred onto the jacket after the assault.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the only relevant way the Lonsdale jacket could connect him to the assault would be if he were standing close enough to the deceased at the time of the assault to receive some blood spatter. He submitted that it was no answer to that lack of evidence to say that it was dark, that the events happened quickly and that people were shocked. There had to be some positive evidence of a connection. The applicant submitted that contrary to that Crown submission, there was an abundance of evidence as to the sort of clothing worn and although some of it was conflicting, much of it was accurate. He submitted that although it was dark, a number of witnesses said that it did not prevent them from identifying persons and clothing.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that even if the grey Lonsdale jacket might have appeared to witnesses in the poor light as white, this did not solve the problem for the Crown. The evidence as to persons wearing a white top did not link those persons to the assault on the deceased and in a number of cases the further description of the garments, e.g. a white t-shirt, were clearly inconsistent with that item of clothing being the Lonsdale jacket. No-one described the clear writing on it or anything like that.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the only two persons who were described as wearing a white jumper, which is the only colour which could conceivably match the Lonsdale jacket, were JP and PB. The applicant submitted, looking at the totality of the evidence as to clothing, and even taking into account the limitations described by the Crown of it being dark, the incident being of short duration and people being in shock, that the evidence was positively inconsistent with him wearing the Lonsdale jacket at the time of the assault.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the DNA evidence relating to the Lonsdale jacket was equivocal. Although on balance it was consistent with him having worn the Lonsdale jacket at some time, because it was not possible to determine when his DNA came onto the jacket, it could not be established affirmatively that this occurred on the night of the party. On the contrary, the evidence of Ms Collins was that such DNA can last a long time. Moreover, there was another person’s DNA on the jacket which suggested that someone else, apart from the applicant, wore that jacket at some time.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence of the deceased’s blood on the jacket was also equivocal. This was because a wet blood stain could easily be transferred. Furthermore, the jacket was found in the red car which is where the assailants went soon after the attack and where they would have been in close proximity to each other. If the jacket were in the car and the assailants returned to the car, there was a real likelihood of a transfer of blood taking place at that point in time.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that these matters had nothing to do with any advantages which the jury might have. He submitted that they raised evidentiary matters which this Court is in as good a position as the jury to decide. They did not give rise to assessments of veracity or reliability. The applicant submitted that the Crown’s suggested scenario that the blood was transferred to the jacket because he was wearing it and he was involved in the assault, is simply one of a number of equally possible scenarios.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the situation was further complicated because some of the group of young Middle Eastern males changed their clothes before they returned to the party after the assault. This explained why some of them were dressed differently in the photographs. For example, JD observed that when JH returned to the party, he had changed from a white jacket to a black one with Adidas stripes. This is consistent with how he appeared in Exhibit S.
	
	
	She also recalled that when JP returned he had taken off his black hoodie and wore a white long sleeved t-shirt with a black t-shirt on top. Even so, no witness identified any of the group who came back to the party as wearing a grey top with writing on it, consistent with being the Lonsdale jacket.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there were at least three possible explanations for his DNA and the deceased’s blood being on the Lonsdale jacket consistent with his innocence.
	



	
	The jacket could have been worn by him at some stage before the party and left in the red car. It is then quite plausible that a person involved in the assault transferred the deceased’s blood from his body or clothing onto the Lonsdale jacket after getting into the car following the attack, or sitting on or handling the jumper. He submitted that the fact that AE’s left thumb print was found on the rear vision mirror of the car was consistent with him driving the car at some time. Similarly the fingerprint of AN and the left thumb print of AE found inside the rear nearside window was consistent with them both being in the driver’s seat at some time.
	
	
	Although no-one described any of the assailants as wearing a grey jacket, one of the assailants was nevertheless wearing it because the jacket had another identifiable person’s DNA.
	
	
	Even if the applicant was wearing the jacket at the party, the blood may have been transferred onto it through contact with one of the assailants after the assault.
	



	
	The applicant’s fifth proposition related to the association evidence, the ERISPs and the telephone intercept evidence relating to MG. The applicant accepted that eyewitness evidence at the party, the call charge records and the telephone intercept material linked him to JP, JH, AN, PB and AE on the night of the assault, as well as after. He noted that in relation to the intercept evidence, no calls were initiated by him. All were made to him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the call from AE to him on 13 February 2011 at 7.24pm, supported the proposition that he was not involved in the assault on the deceased. The applicant relied upon the following exchange:
	


“MG: About that thing, oh, they even asked me too, cuz.

AE: Are you serious?

MG: About the party bullshit?

AE: Yeah.”

The applicant submitted that this exchange was consistent with him being surprised that even he was being asked questions by the police about his involvement in the assault on the deceased. He submitted that this expression of surprise was not consistent with him being involved in the attack.


	
	The applicant submitted that at its highest, the telephone intercept material demonstrated that he talked to the “co-offenders” about the “thing” which the jury could infer was the assault on the deceased, but there was no admission by him that he was involved in it. The applicant submitted that there was no statement by the other persons in the telephone intercepts to that effect. The applicant submitted that it was plausible that his interest in discussing the “thing” with the others arose from his friendship with them and his presence at the party when the incident occurred.
	
	
	In relation to the ERISPs, the applicant accepted that he told lies. He accepted that he was at the party that night, although the period during which he was at the party was not clear. Such concessions were appropriate given the evidence of persons who were at the party and the telephone calls from his home to his mobile on the night of 30 October 2010. The applicant also accepted that he had lied about the extent to which he knew JH.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that these lies cannot by themselves or in combination with other evidence, establish that he participated in the assault on the deceased. He submitted that there were plausible reasons why the lies told by him were not made to conceal his guilt for the offence. He was a fifteen year old boy who knew that his brother had lied to police about his brother’s presence at the party. (He was present when his brother denied that he was at the party.) He therefore had an incentive to lie to support his brother’s statement that he was not at the party. He had a further incentive to lie in order to conceal his own knowledge of the involvement of his friends in the assault.
	
	
	Proposition six was that it was not open for the jury to find him guilty of murder on the basis of joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the applicant submitted that there was no evidence that he was a party to an agreement which had as its object the infliction of grievous bodily harm on the deceased or, was present, participating in the execution of the agreement at least by being ready, willing and able to assist.
	
	
	The applicant based this submission on the way in which the Crown put its case at trial. The Crown accepted that it was the blow to the head with a bottle which caused the deceased’s death. It was the Crown case that all the boys shared a motive to kill the deceased because he was a “snitch”. It was the Crown case that all the boys who surrounded the deceased were in a position to see the bottle and the pole and did in fact see those weapons. It was the Crown case that those persons surrounding the deceased knew that JP intended to assault the deceased with the bottle. The applicant submitted that the difficulty in the Crown making that case against him was that the Crown was unable to identify any act or words uttered by him which proved his intentional encouragement or assistance in the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm on the deceased. He submitted that the Crown’s argument was essentially circular in nature, i.e. that because he was present in the semi-circle around the deceased, he must have been present to offer assistance to JP in assaulting him. The applicant submitted that there was no evidence to that effect and that that was not an inevitable inference to be drawn from those facts by the jury.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in essence the Crown case was that being present at the scene of the assault was sufficient to attract liability for murder. The applicant submitted that this was an incorrect approach and that mere presence at the scene of a crime, even with the knowledge of the commission of the crime, but absent proof of intentional encouragement or assistance, was insufficient to establish liability as an aider and abettor to murder (R v Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29; 53 NSWLR 480).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the Crown could not make out its case against him given the absence of evidence as to where he was standing at the time of the assault, which direction he was facing at that time and where JP took the green bottle after he held it down next to his leg covering it with his hands. The applicant submitted that it was speculation to assert that he must have both seen the bottle and knew that it would be used to assault the deceased.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was no evidence (direct or indirect) that he:
	



	
	Had any prior animosity towards the deceased or knew that he was a “snitch”.
	
	
	Was present in the semi-circle when the deceased was called from the top area of the garden.
	
	
	Took any action towards the deceased immediately before or during the assault.
	
	
	Engaged in any violent or hostile conduct towards the deceased after the assault.
	
	
	Intentionally, or unintentionally, gave or made any “expression, gesture or action” that could be construed as signifying approval of the violence perpetrated by JP against the deceased.
	



	
	In the circumstances, the applicant submitted, it was unreasonable for the jury to find that he was either a party to an agreement which had as its object the infliction of grievous bodily harm on the deceased or that he was present, participating in the execution of the agreement, at least by being ready, willing and able to assist.
	
	
	The final proposition relied upon by the applicant in support of this ground of appeal was that it was not open to the jury to find that he had within his reasonable contemplation a substantial risk that one or more of the participants would assault the deceased with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm, i.e. was part of an extended joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that to find him guilty of murder on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise, the jury was required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he, as a 15 year old boy, actually turned his mind (“contemplated”) to the substantial risk that JP would cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The applicant submitted that some evidence to that effect was necessary and that it was not an inevitable inference to be drawn from the facts.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in addition it was necessary for the Crown to prove that he knew that JP had in his possession a bottle and that there was a substantial risk that he would use it on the deceased. The applicant submitted that for the reasons already given, that was not an inference which could be safely drawn in the absence of some direct evidence to that effect. The applicant submitted that when considering this proposition, the Court should have regard to the experience of this Court and other courts concerning the cognitive immaturity and impulsivity of teenagers and the difficulty they experience when considering or “contemplating” risks or consequences of their actions.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown case in respect of MG consisted of the following:
	



	
	Evidence of a close association before and after with the other five persons said to have been involved in the assault (JH, JP, AN, AE and PB).
	
	
	Evidence that the applicant was at the party at about the relevant time.
	
	
	The finding of a Lonsdale jacket on the driver’s seat of the red Toyota station wagon connected with the applicant and the assault which contained two of the deceased’s blood stains on its front and DNA matching the applicant’s profile on the inside of the left wristband.
	



	
	There was no issue about the close association between the applicant and the other five persons.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was evidence that the applicant at the party at about the time when the assault took place, although no-one identified him as one of the attackers. The Crown submitted that the circumstantial evidence allowed for him to have been one of them as he was sighted at the party immediately before and after the assault. (I have been unable to find the evidence to support that last submission by the Crown.)
	
	
	In relation to the Lonsdale jacket, the Crown submitted that this was an important piece of evidence which was available to connect the applicant to the assault in a manner which inculpated him in the charged offending. It was found in the car which took away from the place of the attack at speed the attackers. It had two spots of the deceased’s blood on its front and DNA matching the applicant on its left wrist cuff. Ms Collins opined that it was more likely to have come to be there by way of direct transfer than be secondary transfer.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the lies told by the applicant to the police as evidence to establish a consciousness of guilt. The Crown noted that the applicant had told the police on five separate occasions that he was not at the party. He denied on three occasions even knowing JH.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the knowing and concerned contact with other “offenders” in the post offence period. The Crown submitted that this was evidenced by the telephone intercepts. The Crown submitted that the telephone records showed that there was a continued association between the applicant and the other “offenders” over the period after the party and around the time that police were speaking to each of them.
	
	
	I have dealt with these matters in more detail in my consideration of this ground of appeal.
	


Consideration


	
	It is common ground that although the applicant was clearly at the party, particularly at a time after the assault, there is no clear evidence as to when he arrived. Given the close association between him and the “co-offenders”, there is an inference available that he probably arrived with them as part of the “Wakeley boys”. However, the only evidence to that effect is the somewhat qualified evidence of PP.
	
	
	It is also common ground that there was no eyewitness evidence which identified the applicant as participating in the assault on the deceased, or even being in the vicinity of the deceased when it occurred.
	
	
	Those matters, however, should not be considered in isolation. They need to be considered with the other evidence adduced by the Crown. This comprises the evidence of the close association, both before and after the assault, of the applicant with JH, JP, AN, AE and PB. It includes the lies told to the police on five separate occasions with respect to his presence at the party and on three separate occasions with respect to the fact that he knew one of the known attackers, JH. There was also the content of the telephone intercepts which is indicative of knowledge on the applicant’s part, not only of the fact of the assault on the deceased, but that at least some of his close friends were involved in that assault.
	
	
	Finally, there is the finding of the Lonsdale jacket in the red car, together with some fingerprints of his on that car.
	
	
	Given the applicant’s close association with the “co-offenders” and his obvious concern about the assault in the telephone intercepts, I have concluded that it was well open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was present at the party at the time the deceased was assaulted. Where I have difficulty is in accepting that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was wearing the Lonsdale jacket at the time of the assault and was part of the group that was present when the assault took place and from which some members participated in the assault. The connection with the applicant goes no further than the presence of his DNA on the inside left cuff and the fact that it was found in the red car, which was used by some of the assailants after the assault, and which had a connection with his family. This is in circumstances where Ms Collins said that there was no way of knowing how long his DNA had been on the jacket and the presence of someone else’s DNA also on the jacket. I am of the opinion that the scenarios put forward by the applicant, which are consistent with him not wearing the Lonsdale jacket at any time on the night of the assault, are just as reasonable as that put forward by the Crown, if not more so.
	
	
	What cannot be ignored is that the Lonsdale jacket is a distinctive garment with clear markings on its front. Despite all of the descriptions of clothing given by witnesses at the party, there is no description which gets even close to the Lonsdale jacket. More importantly, none of the descriptions of the clothing worn by any of the assailants is close to the Lonsdale jacket. Taken at its highest, the presence of the applicant’s DNA on the Lonsdale jacket means that he had once worn it. The presence of the blood does not mean that it was worn by anyone that night. The fact that it was found discarded on the front seat of the red car is just as consistent with one of the assailants coming in contact with it by sitting on it or otherwise touching it, following the assault. I do not see how the jury could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Lonsdale jacket with its two blood spots and the applicant’s DNA, when taken with the totality of the evidence, connected the applicant to the assault on the deceased.
	
	
	To use the Lonsdale jacket to connect the applicant to the offence requires a series of conjectures, none of which is established by the evidence. It is a matter of conjecture that if one of the assailants were wearing the Lonsdale jacket, that no-one saw it because it was dark, events happened quickly and the observers were in a state of shock. A difficulty with that scenario is that the observers were able to make a number of pertinent observations, despite those conditions, yet none of them identified the Lonsdale jacket. It is speculative to suggest that the blood stains came onto the Lonsdale jacket because the person wearing it was in close proximity to the victim at the time of the assault. It is speculative to assert that anyone was wearing the Lonsdale jacket on that night. Finally it is speculative to suggest that it was the applicant who wore the Lonsdale jacket on that night.
	
	
	Of more importance in the Crown case is the evidence of the close association between the applicant and the co-offenders, the lies which he told in interviews with the police and the fact that although he did not initiate any of the telephone calls with JP and AE, he was the person that they wanted to talk to and whom they wished to participate in meetings which they were organising. This evidence strongly suggests considerable knowledge on the part of the applicant of the assault and the involvement of his friends. What it does not do is establish that he was part of it or, at the very least, was with the group who had surrounded the deceased and had within his reasonable contemplation that there was a substantial risk that one or more of the group would assault the deceased with the intent of causing him grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	His willingness to meet with his friends to discuss this serious incident does not necessarily mean that he was involved in it. His lies in the ERISPs may well have been indicative of a consciousness of guilt but equally can be explained by a desire to protect his brother and his friends. They are also explained by a not unreasonable wish to distance himself from any suggestion that he was involved in the assault by saying that he was not at the party. This is in a context where the police were interviewing his friends, his brother and himself.
	
	
	Put at its highest, the close association, lies and telephone intercepts are indicative of a much greater knowledge of the assault than the applicant was prepared to concede and an interest in the progress of the police investigation. The evidence does not, when taken with other evidence in the trial, establish beyond reasonable doubt that he was part of the group which surrounded the deceased and that he had at the time the requisite intention so as to constitute the elements of the offence of murder.
	
	
	It follows from the above analysis and my assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence relating to the applicant’s participation in the offence, it would be dangerous in the circumstances to let the verdict of guilty stand. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion, I have taken into account that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt and that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. The case against the applicant, however, was a circumstantial case which only marginally involved an evaluation of the truth and reliability of the evidence called. The case essentially involved what inferences could be properly drawn from the evidence and whether on the totality of the evidence, a jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant’s guilt. I am not so satisfied and I have concluded that it was not open to the jury to be so satisfied.
	
	
	That is sufficient to dispose of the application. Because it entitles the applicant to an acquittal, it provides wider relief for him than if he had succeeded in making out either or both of Grounds 2 and 3(a).
	
	
	The orders which I propose in the application of MG are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal should be granted.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I have read the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL. I agree with his Honour’s reasons in relation to both applicants. However, because ground 1 of AE’s appeal asserts an unreasonable verdict I wish to add a few brief remarks of my own.
	
	
	The case against AE was a circumstantial case although it may be accepted that the matter of identification was a significant aspect of that case. In the same way as a jury ought not to examine each piece of circumstantial evidence in isolation to demonstrate particular weaknesses neither should this Court adopt that approach. Rather, all of the circumstances of the case must be weighed in judging whether there is evidence upon which the jury may reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of the crime charged: Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; 110 CLR 234 at 242; The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397.
	
	
	It may be accepted that when each of the witnesses who identified AE as being involved in the assault is concerned there were some difficulties and a lack of certainty about aspects of the identification. However, the close analysis put forward on behalf of AE of the evidence of each of the witnesses tended to overlook the other evidence implicating AE and failed to consider all of the evidence as a whole.
	
	
	That other evidence included the fingerprint evidence, the evidence of the close association of AE with other persons known to have been involved in the assault, the lies told by AE to the police and the telephone intercepts. When all of those matters are taken into account as a whole, it is my opinion that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant AE’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL and have conducted my own review of the evidence.  Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by his Honour, and the orders that he proposes.

		21 October 2016",2016-10-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2770928,Mooney v R [2016] NSWCCA 231,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft RS Hulme AJ’s reasons. I agree, for the reasons that his Honour gives, that grounds 2, 4 and 5 are not made out.
	
	
	As to ground 3, the correctness of what was said in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1; [2009] NSWCCA 102 as to the range of discounts for the utilitarian value of a guilty plea, to which RS Hulme AJ has referred at [29]-[31], was not in issue (nor was it argued) in the present proceedings. It is not necessary for the determination of this appeal to express a view on the observations made by RS Hulme AJ at [33]-[34] and [36] and I do not do so. Suffice it to say that quantification of the discount is ordinarily a matter for the sentencing judge and the choice of 15% was in my opinion open to her. No error in her Honour’s reasons has been disclosed. I am not persuaded that ground 3 has been made out.
	
	
	Finally, I agree with RS Hulme AJ that her Honour erred in not taking into account the assistance given by the applicant and thus that ground 1, if understood as a “manifest excess” complaint, is made out. I agree, for the reasons that RS Hulme AJ gives, that on the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion the applicant should be sentenced as his Honour proposes. I therefore agree with the proposed orders.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Ward JA and, with the qualifications expressed in her Honour’s judgment, with the judgment of RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: On 16 December 2013, this Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Payne DCJ in respect of two offences of having sexual intercourse without consent, knowing the victim was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time the victim had a serious physical disability. One offence was committed on 21 September 2012 and in respect of that offence, and taking into account two matters on a Form 1, her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 8 years including a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 2 February 2013.
	
	
	In respect of the second offence, committed on 31 October 2012, her Honour imposed a sentence of 8 years including a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 2 August 2016. The total effective sentence is thus one of 11½ years including a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	The offences arose pursuant to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which prescribes a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 10 years has also been prescribed.
	
	
	The circumstances of the first offence are as follows. The victim, to whom I shall refer as “victim 2”, was a resident of a nursing home. She was aged 82, had previously suffered a stroke, could not speak or communicate verbally, could not move well and could barely walk. The Applicant was a carer at the nursing home.
	
	
	At about 4am on the day of the offence, the Applicant turned the victim’s legs off the bed and assisted her into a position where her feet were on the ground and her stomach and chest on the mattress. He applied Sorbalene cream to her anus and then inserted his right index finger pushing it in and out. Another carer came into the room and observed the victim bent over the bed, the lights off and that the curtain was drawn.
	
	
	The circumstances of the second offence were that at about 4am on 31 October he placed victim 2 in a position where her bottom was level with the edge of the bed. He applied cream to her anus and vagina, removed his semi erect penis out through his fly and inserted it into the victim’s anus for a few seconds before leaving the room.
	
	
	The offences on the Form 1, both of which were taken into account in the sentencing for the first offence charged, were of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act. The second of these offences also occurred on 31 October 2012 some two hours earlier than the charged offence. At that time he placed victim 2 into a position where her bottom was level with the side of her bed, pulled down her underwear and began rubbing her anus. He had his fly down but said he had changed his mind about getting his penis out.
	
	
	Another carer Ms Watkins walked in at the time, observed that the curtains around the victim were closed and that the Applicant’s fly was undone. Later Ms Watkins and another discovered cream around the victim’s anus and vagina area. Another check by Ms Watkins, apparently after the second offence charged, found the victim lying with her bottom level with the edge of the bed and the sheets dishevelled. This was an unusual position, given the victim’s limitations of movement.
	
	
	The first offence on the Form 1 occurred on 31 October 2010 and involved another victim, “victim 1”. That victim was observed by another carer to be in a semi-foetal position with her bottom level with the edge of the bed. She was wearing only a blouse, her pad had been removed, the Applicant had both hands on the victim’s waist and his crutch was almost touching the victim’s bottom. The other carer observed that the Applicant’s pants zipper was down and there was a bulge in the front of his pants consistent with an erection.
	
	
	Victim 1 was 46 years old at the time, suffered from Huntington’s disease and as a result could not speak and had very limited control over her movements.
	
	
	On 31 October 2012, the police were notified and commenced an investigation. On 13 November 2012 the Applicant participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he denied any wrongdoing in relation to victim 2. On 18 November 2012 he walked into Lake Illawarra Police Station and asked to speak to police. On that occasion, he volunteered that he had sexually assaulted victim 2 at about 4am on 30 October 2012 and, in the course of being interviewed at the police station, made full admissions of all the offences against her. Although subsequent to the 31 October offences the complainant had been subjected to a sexual assault examination, the result of which was not obtained, the Crown conceded that without the Applicant’s admissions there would have been difficulty in proving the fact of any penetration. (Of course, 30 October is a date different from that specified as the date of two of the offences charged, but there is no suggestion that the Applicant was referring to different offences.)
	
	
	Turning to the subjective factors, the Applicant was born in January 1971. He and his siblings were taken into care while young but he was adopted at age three and thereafter lived in a stable family environment. However, he described being sexually abused by an older foster sister at age 12 or 13.
	
	
	His only prior recorded offence was of driving a vehicle whilst unlicensed and her Honour treated him as, prior to the subject offending, of good character. He was assessed by a psychologist as having an IQ in the lowest 1% of the population and suffering from a mild intellectual disability. The psychologist noted that nevertheless “in the practical domain his adaptive functioning appears to be reasonable in that he has been married and he has held down employment albeit with the assistance of his wife over the last several years.” In fact he seems to have been employed ever since he left school, had been married twice and had a daughter to his first wife. Subsequent to the offences, his second wife left him. He however retains the support of his adoptive mother, brother and sister.
	
	
	The psychologist also reported that depression and negative feelings of self-worth were prominent throughout his profile and he had a marked paranoid predisposition. She observed that his long term prognosis will largely depend on his response to treatment.
	
	
	Since being incarcerated, the Applicant has been in protective custody or circumstances of limited association.
	
	
	Despite his admissions, the Applicant did not plead guilty until he was arraigned in the District Court on 19 November 2013. The reasons for this are not apparent. He had been committed for trial on 8 May 2013 in respect of the three offences against victim 2. It was not until 2 October 2013 that he was committed for trial on the offence against victim 1. The Crown conceded that there had been some delay in the District Court in order that all matters could be dealt with together and acknowledged that prior to the Applicant pleading guilty there had been no preparation for trial.
	
	
	Her Honour allowed a discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of the Applicant’s plea, limiting her formal reasons on this topic to:-
	


In my view, an appropriate reduction for utilitarian considerations only is one of 15 percent.


	
	In the course of submissions, the following discussion occurred:-
	


Her Honour:   I see. So out of all of that do you say how many percent on arraignment? It was the day of the trial wasn’t it?

Keay:   No, it was never listed for trial.

Coulton:   No your Honour, it was never listed.

Her Honour:   It wasn’t ever listed for trial. I see, one of those, 15%?

Coulton:   Yes, and I do have some brief dot points which I’ll hand up later, but that’s certainly what I’ve indicated your Honour. It should just be the normal discount as per a plea in arraignment.


	
	Mr Keay appeared for the Applicant, Mr Coulton for the Crown.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that the Applicant was remorseful but in view of the contents of the psychological report, remarked that his prospect for rehabilitation was guarded. Although making no express reference to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), her Honour accepted that a matter of significance was that weight should be given to the Applicant’s attending the police station voluntarily and to his admissions of digital and penile penetration. What weight her Honour gave to this is not apparent although later her Honour observed that the Applicant’s acknowledgement of the wrongfulness of his actions and the vulnerability of the complainant were factors which contributed to a finding of remorse. Her Honour concluded that there were special circumstances.
	
	
	Her Honour regarded the Applicant’s offending against victim 2 as more serious because of her vulnerability and all offending as aggravated by what her Honour described as a gross breach of trust. Her Honour noted that the offending had occurred where both victims were residing.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	



	
	The sentence imposed by her Honour Judge Payne of the District Court on 16 December 2013 was too severe.
	
	
	Her Honour in sentencing the Offender erred in finding that the pleas, as a consequence of his full admissions to police on the 18 November 2012, were not effectively entered at the first available opportunity.
	
	
	Her Honour in sentencing the Offender erred in allowing only a 15% reduction in sentence for the utilitarian value of the early pleas.
	
	
	Her Honour erred in failing to take into account when sentencing the offender his being diagnosed as suffering a “mild intellectual disability”.
	
	
	Her Honour erred in calculating the appropriate accumulation of the Offender’s sentences.
	



	
	It is convenient to defer consideration of the first ground.
	


Ground 2


	
	The “first available opportunity” that the Applicant had to plead guilty was during the committal proceedings. He did not then do so. Accordingly the second ground is not made out.
	


Ground 3


	
	Although credit for pleas of guilty has long been a feature of sentencing, the origin of the current practice of quantified discounts is largely the product of the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309, where the Court laid down that discounts should generally lie in the range of 10-25%.
	
	
	The topic has been considered in many cases since. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to was said in R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1; [2009] NSWCCA 102. In that case an offender first pleaded guilty at arraignment, having participated in committal proceedings that were contested on at least one issue. The sentencing judge awarded a discount for the plea of 25%. Holding that the discount was erroneously high, Howie J, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J, observed at [27]:-
	


In Thomson, the Chief Justice, when discussing the extent of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, stated:

[154]   There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case:

(i)   The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial.

(ii)   The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea.


	
	Later, at [31]-[32], Howie J remarked:-
	


As a matter of general practice, the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should be awarded only to those accused persons who plead guilty in the Local Court and continue that plea of guilty in the District Court. There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case. The amount of the discount cannot depend upon the practice of the particular court based upon its administrative arrangements. It is difficult to see how, in the usual case, a plea of guilty on arraignment could justify a discount of more than about 15 per cent. There was nothing in the present case that justified a discount above that range.

It should not be necessary to do so, but, because there appears to be discrepancies in the application of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, it is apposite to set out in point form the principles laid down by this Court and to be applied by sentencing courts. Of course these are principles of general application and are subject to the scheme set out in Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 (NSW) and regulations made under that Act:

1.   The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount: Thomson at [154]; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [116].

…

12.   The amount of the discount does not depend upon the administrative arrangements or any practice in a particular court or by a particular judge for the management of trials or otherwise.

The last of these principles is derived from the present judgment and is included for completeness.


	
	There was no reasoning advanced in R v Thomson; R v Houlton for the proposition that “A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing …” and neither did Howie J advance any for his statement that “It is difficult to see how, in the usual case, a plea of guilty on arraignment could justify a discount of more than about 15 per cent.”.
	
	
	I have some difficulty with both of the statements. Prior to committal proceedings almost all investigative work will have been done, a brief containing virtually all of the material to be relied on by the Crown prepared and served and the matter reviewed by one or more officers of the DPP. Committal proceedings may be lengthy but are commonly very short, the matter being dealt with on the papers without any oral evidence. Assuming there is no change from a plea of “not guilty”, between committal and trial, a deal of work is required. There will be a further review of the Crown case by the DPP, perhaps revision of the charges and negotiation between the DPP and Defence, the taking of steps to ensure that any gaps in the Crown case are closed, and counsel who is to prosecute mastering his or her brief. There may be conferences with witnesses. The extent of this work clearly justifies the conclusion that a plea of guilty at committal has a utilitarian value exceeding that of a guilty plea made on the first day of trial.
	
	
	However my firm impression is that only a minority of this work occurs before what amounts to the first arraignment in the District or Supreme Court and which will often be only a limited time after committal and many months and perhaps years before trial. If, as is generally the case, a plea at committal inspires a 25% discount and one on the first day of trial a discount of only 10%, it seems to me that to allow only 15% for a plea at arraignment is to undervalue the utilitarian value of what occurs between arraignment and trial and to overvalue what occurs between committal and arraignment. Howie J was very experienced in criminal law and any views of his Honour in this area are entitled to respect but, particularly as he provided no reasons for the passage I have quoted, I feel entitled to disagree with it.
	
	
	I have set out above Payne DCJ’s reasons bearing on her selection of a 15% discount. There is no obvious error in what her Honour said in this regard during her formal remarks, but those made during the sentencing hearing give the impression that her Honour exercised no judgment but just followed a rule of thumb which was apparently known to Mr Coulton.
	
	
	It may be of course that her Honour was just following the remarks of Howie J to which I have referred above and if so, it is difficult to criticise her, but I am certainly left with considerable disquiet as to the approach her Honour took. However, given the conclusion at which I have arrived in respect of ground 1, I do not need to come to a final conclusion in respect of this ground.
	


Ground 4


	
	There was no evidence to connect any intellectual disability from which the Applicant suffered to his offending or to suggest it was likely to make his time in custody more difficult than usual. Given his clean record and history of employment there is nothing to suggest that disability was of significance to the sentencing exercise. Her Honour referred to the psychological report which amounted to the evidence of the Applicant’s intellectual disability and I am not persuaded that her Honour was not fully conscious of its contents insofar as they are relevant to this ground.
	
	
	The ground is not made out.
	


Ground 5


	
	As has been said, the sentences imposed were of 8 years including a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 years including a non-parole period of 4 years. Her Honour made the non-parole periods concurrent to the extent of 18 months, resulting in an effective non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	Although both offences involved the same victim, they were committed a month apart and involved their own distinct criminality. As with many other aspects of sentencing, the extent to which offences should be accumulated or made concurrent is very much a matter of discretion.
	
	
	This Court has pointed out on a number of occasions that the severity of a sentence increases disproportionately with length and the increases of 2½ years in the effective non-parole period and 3½ years in the effective total sentence are heavy. However, I am not persuaded that, against the background of the offending and the length of the individual sentences her Honour imposed, the increases were outside the legitimate exercise of her sentencing discretion.
	
	
	This ground also fails.
	


Ground 1


	
	That a sentence is “too severe” does not constitute a ground for this Court interfering. The Crown assumed that ground was intending to allege “manifest excess” and I shall so treat it.
	
	
	One matter that merits specific mention in the context of this ground and which her Honour and both parties accepted was entitled to weight was the Applicant’s voluntary attendance at a police station and there admitting the digital and penile penetration. Counsel for the Applicant relied on this factor as one entitling the Applicant to a greater discount than he received for his plea. As the discount for a plea is for its utilitarian value, the submission must be rejected, but the Court raised with the Crown that the Applicant’s conduct was a matter that her Honour should have taken into account under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 23 and did not. So far as is presently relevant that section and a further relevant section provide:-
	


23   (1)   A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2)   In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(a)   (Repealed)

(b)   the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c)   the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d)   the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e)   the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f)   any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g)   whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h)   any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i)   whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

(3)   A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4)   A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a)   indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b)   state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c)   where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5)   Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6)   The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.

…

101A   A failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence.


	
	Counsel appearing for the Crown accepted that her Honour had not mentioned the provision and thus may have erred but submitted that even if s 23 was taken into account this Court would not interfere with the sentence imposed.
	
	
	Whatever may have been the understanding earlier, it is now clear that the assistance the Applicant provided by confessing to the offences, including penetration of victim 2, constitutes assistance within the section – CMB v Attorney General (New South Wales) (2015) 243 A Crim R 282; [2015] HCA 9 at [41], [71]; Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85 at [33]-[34]. Demonstrably that assistance went further than being relevant merely to the issue of remorse as her Honour seems to have limited its significance.
	
	
	I have also said enough to demonstrate that the assistance given by the Applicant was significant enough to entitle him to a discount under the section. It is not apparent from her Honour’s reasons that her Honour took this section into account, which leads to the conclusion that her Honour erred in this regard and accordingly this Court is required to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh – Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37.
	
	
	The nature, circumstances and consequences of the Applicant’s assistance are such that paragraphs (f) to (h) of s 23(2) have no relevance but the others do. Furthermore, in assessing the significance of the assistance, it is relevant to bear in mind that, without the Applicant’s admissions, the Crown may still have been able to prove penetration and in any event would seem to have had some prospect of obtaining a conviction for aggravated sexual assault in respect of the two incidents the subject of the sexual intercourse charges. Of course, the penalty for aggravated sexual assault of 7 years’ imprisonment is much less than the 20 years’ imprisonment to which the Applicant was liable for the sexual intercourse offences.
	
	
	The general practice for years when discounts are given for a plea and assistance has been to combine the discounts. Sub-section 23(4) makes that practically impossible.
	
	
	In sentencing the Applicant for the first offence charged, the Form 1 matters have to be taken into account. In sentencing the Applicant for the second offence charged, recognition should be given to the fact that the intercourse on that occasion was penile whereas that the subject of the first charge was digital. In the circumstances, and taking account of all of the matters to which I have referred, I would commence my determination of the appropriate sentences with a starting point for each of 9 years. I would apply a discount of 20% for the Applicant’s guilty pleas for each offence, leading to a total sentence for each offence of, in round figures, 86 months. I would reduce this figure for assistance to the authorities by 8 months, resulting in a final figure of 6 years and 6 months for each sentence.
	
	
	Her Honour found special circumstances, a conclusion with which I agree both because this is the Applicant’s first time in custody and because there will be an accumulation of sentences. However, there is no reason why the non-parole period of the first sentence to be served should not be the 75% contemplated by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, i.e., in round figures, 58 months. In the case of the second sentence to be served I would fix the non-parole period at 3 years and 6 months and commence it so that the total effective non-parole period is 6 years and the effective total sentence is 9 years. For the purposes of s 23(4) I record that but for the assistance the Applicant has rendered I would have proposed sentences each of 7 years and 2 months, an effective total sentence of 10 years and an effective non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	Accordingly the orders I propose are:-
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	Allow the appeal;
	
	
	Quash the sentences imposed by Payne DCJ on 16 December 2013;
	
	
	In respect of the first count on the indictment dated 19 November 2013 and taking into account the offences on the Form 1 signed by the Applicant on 16 November 2013, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months commencing on 2 February 2013 together with a further term of 1 year and 8 months;
	
	
	In respect of the second count on the indictment dated 19 November 2013, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 2 August 2015 together with a further term of 3 years;
	
	
	Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Applicant shall be eligible for parole 2 February 2019.
	



	
	For the purposes of s 23(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) it should be recorded that, but for the assistance the Applicant has rendered, the sentences imposed would have been:
	



	
	imprisonment for 7 years and 2 months, including a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months, and
	
	
	imprisonment for 7 years and 2 months, including a non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months, and
	
	
	an effective total sentence of 10 years including non-parole periods totalling 7 years.

2770931,Engelbrecht v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2016] NSWCA 290,"Judgment


	
	McCOLL JA: The applicant, Timothy Engelbrecht, seeks judicial review of a decision of his Honour Judge Sides QC given in the District Court of New South Wales in which his Honour dismissed his appeal against a sentence imposed by a Magistrate in the Local Court. [1]  The appeal was brought pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (Appeal and Review Act). The applicant contends that the primary judge fell into jurisdictional error because his Honour misapprehended the nature of the power he was exercising in determining the appeal pursuant to the Appeal and Review Act, s 17.
	
	
	For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the primary judge erred in the manner of which the applicant complains, that his Honour’s judgment should be set aside and the proceedings remitted to the District Court for hearing in accordance with law.

Local Court proceedings


	
	On 10 June 2015, Magistrate Bartley found the applicant guilty of an offence of aggravated indecency contrary to s 61O(1A) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The circumstances attending the commission of the offence were as follows. The victim, James Ferguson, is a young man (18 at the time of the offence) with a mild intellectual disability who requires support from paid workers mainly centred on social issues. At the time of the offence, he shared a home in Hornsby with another young man with an intellectual disability. Around the clock staffing support, funded by the Department of Family and Community Services, was provided to residents at the home through a service provider named New Horizons.
	
	
	The applicant was employed at the home by New Horizons as a residential support worker and case-worker. He was charged with five charges of indecent or common assault involving Mr Ferguson. He was acquitted of four, but convicted on one s 61O(1A) matter (sequence 3). The Magistrate found that he committed an act of indecency towards the victim, which, the Magistrate found, involved him walking with his genitals exposed when Mr Ferguson was in his direct line of sight. The Magistrate also found the applicant intended Mr Ferguson to see him in that state. There was no issue that if the offence was committed, it was committed in circumstances of aggravation pursuant to s 61O(3), as the victim was under the authority of the applicant.
	
	
	In his judgment on conviction (conviction judgment) the Magistrate recorded that the primary facts concerning the offence were strongly contested. The applicant contended that it was Mr Ferguson who pulled the applicant’s pants down. He decided he should “get away” from Mr Ferguson rather than bend over to put his pile of belongings down before re-adjusting his clothing. The applicant said that he walked into another room and adjusted his clothing, and picked up his pile of belongings again, but that when he left that room, Mr Ferguson once again “pulled [his] shorts down to his ankles”. He then “shuffle[d]” what the Magistrate found was “a long distance” before again depositing the pile he was carrying, and “pulling up his shorts.” The applicant’s explanation for taking this course of action was that Mr Ferguson “was in an escalated mood” and he “decided not to react and give him what he wanted”. The Magistrate rejected the applicant’s evidence in this respect, finding that it lacked credibility.
	
	
	The Magistrate incorporated by reference his conviction judgment, insofar as it concerned the sequence 3 matter, into his sentencing reasons. In those reasons, his Honour noted that the applicant rejected the court’s findings of fact and guilt and did not “exhibit genuine contrition or remorse”.
	
	
	On 4 August 2015 the applicant was sentenced to 300 hours of community service work. These proceedings concern the applicant’s appeal to the District Court against sentence pursuant to s 11 and s 17 of the Appeal and Review Act (“severity appeal”).
	


District Court proceedings


	
	On 30 September 2015 the severity appeal came before Sides DCJ. When the matter was called on for hearing, the applicant’s solicitor, Mr M Mantaj, asserted that the Crown had resiled from an agreement in respect of the facts which were to be tendered on the appeal. He claimed the Crown had previously agreed that a redacted police facts document prepared at the end of the conviction hearing and provided to the author of the pre-sentence report used at the sentencing hearing would be tendered on the severity appeal. Mr Mantaj further asserted that the Crown had only notified him when he arrived at court that morning that it instead intended to tender the conviction judgment.
	
	
	The agreement to which Mr Mantaj referred was said to have been made on an occasion when the severity appeal was listed before his Honour Judge Colefax SC on 18 August 2015. In the course of the hearing in this Court, the Crown Advocate produced the transcript of that hearing. It is apparent that Mr Mantaj sought an adjournment on the basis that the Crown and he had agreed to obtain a copy of the agreed facts said to represent the Magistrate’s conviction findings, he wished to obtain a psychiatric assessment of the appellant and the Crown wished to obtain the sentencing remarks. The adjournment was granted. The first note on JusticeLink concerning the events of that day in relation to the severity appeal recorded:
	


“Note: Although there was an 8 day contested hearing in the Local Court, adequate findings of fact in the appeal are likely to be found in the remarks on sentence and the documents supplied to the author of the Pre Sentence Report.”


	
	Mr Mantaj submitted before the primary judge that the Crown’s changed position prejudiced the applicant. He said that in reliance on his agreement with the Crown, he had obtained an expert report from a psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen, which had been prepared on the basis that the redacted police facts documents would be tendered. He also indicated that if the matter was to proceed on the basis of the conviction judgment, he would seek to tender “a lot more than just the decision of his Honour.”
	
	
	Mr Mantaj sought an adjournment so that he could obtain “the transcript in circumstances where [he understood] the Crown [didn’t] even concede that there was an agreement as to that document being tendered to the Court as the facts.” Ms Prowse, who appeared for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, opposed that course. She informed his Honour that she could not see on the Crown file an agreement to the effect of that for which Mr Mantaj contended. She added that even if such an agreement had been made, the facts in the redacted police facts document did not represent the detail of the Magistrate’s conviction reasons. She submitted that she would rely on those reasons for his Honour “to effectively re-sentence” the applicant as they showed that the Magistrate had rejected the applicant’s version of the events.
	
	
	Mr Mantaj repeated that he was prejudiced by the Crown’s changed position. He submitted that if the matter was not to proceed on the basis of the redacted police facts document, it “ought to proceed on the basis of an analysis of the entire transcript” because that was what the Appeal and Review Act, s 17 required.
	
	
	The primary judge responded that on a severity appeal the Court was “not required, nor would it be proper, nor does it have the time to read the entire transcript of all the evidence that was given before the Magistrate.” He suggested s 17 referred to the evidence given at the original Local Court sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	In response to the primary judge’s concern that much of the transcript of the Local Court related to matters in respect of which the applicant had been acquitted, Mr Mantaj said he required an adjournment to obtain the transcript and “sit down with the Crown and identify the relevant evidence.” He observed that the Crown was seeking to tender the Magistrate’s findings in relation to all the sequences, not merely sequence 3.
	
	
	The Crown objected to the course Mr Mantaj proposed. It did not object to an adjournment if the basis of that was to enable Mr Mantaj to obtain another report from Dr Nielssen based on the Magistrate’s findings, but opposed an adjournment for any other purpose.
	
	
	Mr Mantaj insisted that the Crown should not be permitted to resile from the August agreement but re-iterated that, if it was, the Court should “consider at least as much of the transcript of the Local Court hearing as the parties wish to refer the Court to”. He said he was not in a position to do that that day because he had not been aware that the issue would arise. Accordingly, he repeated his submission that the matter ought to be adjourned so that he could “get, firstly that transcript, argue the question then of whether or not there was an agreement and if so what the consequence of it is and if that goes against me then I can tender the parts of the transcript which I would propose to rely upon.”
	
	
	Sides DCJ rejected the adjournment application. His Honour appeared to accept Mr Mantaj’s submission as to his earlier agreement with the Crown as to the manner in which the appeal would proceed. However, he also accepted the Crown’s submission that the psychiatrist’s report Mr Mantaj sought to tender on the basis of the agreed position for which he contended contained a version of events the Magistrate had not accepted. Accordingly, he said it was appropriate that the Crown “tender the material it had previously agreed would not be tendered”. His Honour then said:
	


“It has been further contended on the appellant’s behalf that, because the goalpost has now been moved, he is prejudiced because he does not have a transcript of the evidence of any of the witnesses given before the magistrate, which it is argued is the material referred to in s 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. The Court does not accept that submission. The evidence referred to [in s 17] is the evidence given at the sentence hearing and, in an appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed after a conviction recorded following a hearing, it is legitimate for the magistrate’s reasons at the end of the hearing to determine guilt to be tendered so that the factual matrix upon which the sentence [appeal is] to proceed can be established.

In this case it is also, in the Court’s view, relevant to the Court’s view of any account the appellant might have given Dr Nielssen. The Court is not persuaded that that is appropriate material or relevant to these proceedings, and that any further delay is in the interest of justice. The application to adjourn the matter is refused.”


	
	Sides DCJ then dealt with the applicant’s severity appeal. The Crown tendered a Crown Tender Bundle (Exhibit A), which included the transcript of the conviction judgment, the notice of appeal, the Court Attendance Notice, criminal antecedents and the pre-sentence report.
	
	
	Mr Mantaj objected to parts of the conviction judgment transcript the Crown had tendered which related to the sequences in respect of which the applicant was acquitted. The primary judge overruled that objection and admitted the entire transcript of the conviction judgment.
	
	
	Mr Mantaj tendered the Magistrate’s sentencing reasons (Exhibit #1). He then said to the primary judge that he noted his Honour’s “earlier ruling” but asked “whether [his Honour would] be prepared to accept into evidence parts of the transcript of the Local Court proceedings … that go to character only”. The Crown did not object to that course. Accordingly, a partial transcript of the Local Court hearing which contained character evidence became Exhibit #2. The applicant did not seek to tender Dr Nielssen’s report, the redacted police facts document or any other evidence from the Local Court.
	
	
	Sides DCJ dismissed the applicant’s sentence appeal in a second ex tempore judgment.
	


Issues on appeal


	
	The summons seeking judicial review complains that the primary judge erred in that, contrary to s 17 of the Appeal and Review Act, “his Honour refused to have regard to the transcript of the evidence given in the Local Court proceedings in determining the [severity appeal]”, and thus fell into jurisdictional error.
	
	
	The applicant seeks an order in the nature of certiorari setting aside his Honour’s judgment and that the proceedings be remitted to the District Court to be dealt with according to law. [3] 
	


Applicant’s submissions


	
	Mr Mantaj submitted that the primary judge erroneously construed the words “evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings” in s 17 of the Appeal and Review Act as a reference solely to the reasons given by Magistrate Bartley for his finding of guilt, to the exclusion of the oral testimony given by witnesses at the Local Court hearing which led to that finding. He submitted that on their proper construction, those words in s 17 referred to the evidence given by witnesses, together with exhibits, in the Local Court hearing.
	
	
	Mr Mantaj argued that a judicial officer’s reasons could not constitute evidence before the same judicial officer, that is to say, “in the original Local Court proceedings.” He contended that to describe reasons given in a particular proceeding as “evidence” in that same proceeding did violence to the English language and was inconsistent with the decision in Charara v The Queen. [4] 
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Mantaj submitted that for the purposes of the Appeal and Review Act, s 17 the phrase “the original Local Court proceedings” refers both to the contested hearing phase and the sentencing hearing phase of those proceedings. He argued that a judge hearing a severity appeal could not properly exercise the s 17 sentencing power without referring to the transcript of evidence given and relevant exhibits tendered in the conviction phase to assess such matters as the objective seriousness of the offence, and aggravating or mitigating factors. He submitted that in refusing to permit him to tender such evidence, the primary judge erroneously “sought to bifurcate” the criminal justice process by separating the proceedings leading to a finding of guilt from the sentencing proceedings. He accepted that the evidence to which a judge hearing a severity appeal could have regard would not include, or, at least not in a manner which would detract from, that evidence essential to the conviction.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Mantaj submitted that if the construction of the Appeal and Review Act, s 17 the primary judge adopted was permitted to stand, the effect would be that on the hearing of a severity appeal, the District Court would not be in a position to form its own judgment of the facts relevant to sentence, but, rather, would be confined to the facts found by the Magistrate. He contended there was nothing in the Appeal and Review Act which indicated it was intended to circumscribe the appellate function of the District Court so narrowly.
	
	
	Fourthly, Mr Mantaj submitted that the effect of the primary judge’s misapprehension of the ambit of s 17 was that the hearing of the severity appeal was not a hearing pursuant to s 17.
	


Respondent’s submissions


	
	The Acting Crown Advocate (Crown Advocate) submitted that a severity appeal pursuant to the Appeal and Review Act, s 17, is, in effect, a de novo hearing in which the District Court judge hears the matter afresh, determines the facts relevant to sentencing, [5]  and re-exercises the sentencing discretion irrespective of error by the Magistrate. The Crown Advocate contended that on a severity appeal, it was not open to an appellant to traverse the findings of the Magistrate that formed the basis of the conviction.
	
	
	Secondly, in his written submissions, the Crown Advocate contended that s 17 referred only to evidence given in the Local Court proceedings in relation to the sentence the subject of the appeal. He submitted that this construction of s 17 was confirmed by the legislative history of the Appeal and Review Act and also by the definition in s 3 of “original Local Court proceedings” as “the proceedings in the Local Court that involved the making or imposition of” (his emphasis), relevantly, the sentence. Ultimately, however, in the course of the hearing he accepted that such evidence included the evidence given during the conviction hearing that was relevant to the sentencing exercise. He contended, however, that in this case the applicant had submitted that all the evidence before the Magistrate should be considered, that is to say the evidence relating to all five of the charges before the Magistrate, not merely that relevant to sequence 3.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown Advocate submitted that on a severity appeal Mason P’s statement in Charara, on which the applicant relied as demonstrating that the Magistrate’s reasons were not “evidence” within the meaning of that expression in s 17, may not apply having regard to the de novo nature of the s 17 appeal. However, the Crown Advocate accepted that, even if that was correct, the Magistrate’s sentencing reasons could fairly be regarded as material that could be of assistance to the District Court judge exercising the sentencing discretion afresh. In addition, the Crown Advocate contended that in circumstances where the applicant proposed to tender an expert report which was based on a version of events the Magistrate had rejected, it was appropriate for the Crown to tender, and for the primary judge to have regard to, the Magistrate’s reasons for conviction to establish the factual matrix upon which the sentence appeal was to proceed.
	
	
	Fourthly, the Crown Advocate submitted that even if his contention as to the meaning of “evidence” in s 17 was incorrect, that provision did not make the “entire transcript” a mandatory relevant consideration to which the District Court was required to have regard. Rather, the District Court was required to determine the facts relevant to sentencing and to re-sentence the appellant upon the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties and admitted by the Court. In this regard it was the responsibility of the parties to the severity appeal to adduce whatever such evidence they contended was relevant to the re-exercise of the sentencing function. Accordingly, the Crown Advocate submitted the primary judge did not err in rejecting the proposition that the Court should have regard to the entire transcript of the evidence given before the Magistrate.
	
	
	Fifthly, the Crown Advocate submitted that, in fact, the primary judge heard the severity appeal on a de novo basis. Both parties tendered material and made submissions as to the appropriate sentence, following which the primary judge made findings relevant to sentencing (such as remorse) and appeared independently to re-exercise the sentencing discretion. Accordingly, the severity appeal was heard according to law.
	
	
	Sixthly, the Crown Advocate submitted that, if there was error on the primary judge’s part, it occurred when his Honour refused the adjournment application, not in the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	Seventhly, the Crown Advocate submitted that any error in refusing the adjournment did not constitute jurisdictional error, but, rather, was an exercise of discretion on a matter of practice and procedure in criminal proceedings which appellate courts would rarely disturb. [6] 
	
	
	Finally, the Crown Advocate submitted that the primary judge did not misconceive the nature of his function or the extent of the District Court’s power on the severity appeal such as to constitute jurisdictional error, given that his Honour admitted, on the applicant’s tender, a partial transcript of the evidence given by two witnesses in the Local Court, and did not refuse to admit any evidence the applicant sought to tender.
	


Consideration


	
	The exercise of jurisdiction under the Appeal and Review Act falls within the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court. Pursuant to s 176 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW), “[n]o adjudication on appeal of the District Court is to be removed by any order into the Supreme Court”. The effect of s 176 is to limit the availability of judicial review to cases involving jurisdictional error. [7] 
	
	
	There is no rigid taxonomy of jurisdictional error. [8]  However, generally speaking, an inferior court commits jurisdictional error “if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises that jurisdiction does exist”. [9] 
	
	
	Jurisdictional error will also be found where a judicial officer misconstrues the relevant statute and, accordingly, “misconceives the nature of the function which it is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case.” [10] 
	
	
	Where there is the appearance of an exercise of jurisdiction, but one which does not conform to the requirements of the law, such a failure will generally involve jurisdictional error as the process of decision-making has miscarried. [11] 
	
	
	Where there is a complaint of jurisdictional error, the court may have regard to “any admissible evidence relevant for that purpose”. [12] 
	


Sentencing


	
	To put the issues in context, it is necessary to refer to some basic sentencing principles.
	
	
	In imposing a sentence, a court must ensure the offender is adequately punished for the offence. [13]  The court must have regard to objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence. [14]  The sentence must be proportional to the gravity of the offence having regard to the objective circumstances. [15]  The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending. [16] 
	
	
	It is for the sentencing judge alone to decide the sentence to be imposed and, for that purpose, to find the relevant facts [17]  and to apply to the facts as found the relevant law and sentencing principles. [18]  This is in order to enable the judge to perform the task of assessing the degree of culpability of the offender for the crime of which he or she has been found guilty. [19] 
	
	
	Where a criminal charge has been heard by a judge alone, the sentencing judge is, effectively, both jury and judge. In those circumstances the sentencing exercise will entail the judge determining the issue of culpability, in contrast to the position where there has been a trial before a jury which has found the offender guilty. Even in that circumstance, whereas the verdict of guilt decides the issues joined by the plea to the charge, it does not decide all facts of possible relevance to sentencing. [20]  The sentencing judge will be able to make findings as to the matters underpinning the conviction for the purpose of assessing the degree of criminality involved and take them into account in sentencing. [21]  As is apparent from R v Isaacs, in determining the facts relevant to sentencing, some will have emerged in evidence at trial, while others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings. [22] 
	
	
	Findings of fact made by a sentencing judge must be consistent with the verdict of guilt and, in the case of facts taken into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused, must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. [23]  The effect of this constraint in a given case may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender. [24] 
	
	
	It is difficult, in the light of that task, to determine how a judge determining a severity appeal could assess the appellant’s culpability without having regard to the evidence adduced in relation to conviction in order to resolve that issue.
	
	
	Finally, note should be made of the implications for severity appeals of Parker v DPP. [25]  Parker was an application for an order in the nature of certiorari in respect of a severity appeal heard by a District Court judge pursuant to s 122 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) (Justices Act) who imposed a custodial sentence in lieu of the non-custodial sentence appealed from. [26]  Parker complained that his Honour did so in breach of the rules of procedural fairness, relevantly for the present case, in failing to signal to the accused that he was contemplating a custodial sentence, so that the accused might consider making an application to withdraw his appeal. [27] 
	
	
	In upholding the complaint of want of procedural fairness, Kirby P observed that there had long been “an established practice or convention in District Court appeals under s 122 that a judge, contemplating an increase in the sentence under appeal, will signal that possibility to the appellant” and that, although it was not a rule of law, it was an established practice which should rarely, if ever, be departed from. [28]  Parker warnings continue to be a feature of severity appeals under the Appeal and Review Act and are an unexceptionable exercise of the judge’s functions. [29] 
	
	
	As would be self-evident, a Parker warning could not be given if the District Court judge entertaining the severity appeal was not aware of the sentence the Magistrate had imposed.
	


Construction of s 17 of the Appeal and Review Act


	
	The task of statutory interpretation is concerned with giving a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended it to have. [30]  The exercise must begin with a consideration of the text, taken in context, bearing in mind that the primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. [31] 
	
	
	An “appeal” is always a creature of statute. The words “appeal” and “rehearing” may be used in a number of senses. [32]  Further, the word “rehearing” has been used in statutes, or employed in construing statutes, to indicate, in differing senses, the nature of the task to be performed by an appellate court. [33]  The variable usage of these terms is such that the precise nature of the statutory remedy of appeal afforded to a dissatisfied litigant, and the procedures attendant upon it, will ultimately depend upon the provisions of the statute creating the right of appeal. [34]  However the context of the term, the history of the legislation and the surrounding circumstances will also be relevant. [35] 
	
	
	Broadly speaking, there is a recognised distinction between first, appeals in the strict sense – in which the court has jurisdiction to determine whether the decision under appeal was or was not erroneous on the evidence and the law as it stood when the original decision was given, secondly, appeals de novo – where the court hears the matter afresh, may hear it on fresh material and may overturn the decision appealed from regardless of error (appeal de novo), [36]  and, thirdly, appeals by way of rehearing – where the court conducts a rehearing on the materials before the primary judge in which it is authorised to determine whether the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error and, in some cases, has power to receive additional evidence (error based appeal). [37]  In the latter case, although the appeal is described as being “by way of rehearing”, it does not “call for a fresh hearing or hearing de novo [and] the court does not hear the witnesses again.” [38] 
	
	
	One of the indicia of a rehearing function is the conferral of a discretion on an appellate body to admit further evidence. Such a power is of a remedial nature conferred “to facilitate the avoidance of errors which cannot be otherwise remedied by the application of the conventional appellate procedures.” [39] 
	
	
	In the case of appeals to the District Court from Local Courts, reference to some matters of history is necessary. Such appeals find their origin in appeals from Petty Sessions to Quarter Sessions in England which were introduced into New South Wales early in the colony’s history. The history was traced by Griffith CJ in Sweeney v Fitzhardinge, [40]  and need not be repeated. Suffice it to say, that, although frequently described as a rehearing, on such appeals the justices were not limited to the evidence before the Petty Sessions, but had to hear the whole matter de novo, that is to say, “to rehear the whole matter, and give their judgment upon all the evidence … brought before them.” [41] 
	
	
	The history recorded in Sweeney did not refer to the Justices Act, although it had commenced operation on 1 August 1905. However, appeals pursuant to Part V, Division 4, s 122 of the Justices Act, by unsuccessful defendants from a conviction or order of a Petty Sessions Justice to a Court of Quarter Sessions, were also de novo hearings. In a hearing de novo, even though called an “appeal”, the Court exercises original jurisdiction. [42]  Accordingly, although the unsuccessful defendant is the appellant, the informant or complainant begins and is required to make out again the case against the appellant. [43] 
	
	
	The civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Courts of Quarter Sessions was vested in the District Court of New South Wales upon its establishment in 1973 and the Courts of Quarter Sessions were abolished. [44]  Thereafter, the District Court exercised the jurisdiction under the Justices Act hitherto exercised by the Courts of Quarter Sessions and “the nature and incidents of that appellate jurisdiction remained the same.” [45]  On a severity appeal under the Justices Act, the District Court judge was to “decide for himself what penalty is to be imposed, not whether that (or those) imposed by the magistrate was (or were) appropriate.”
	
	
	In Goldfinch v R, [46]  McHugh JA (as his Honour then was) explained:
	


“An appeal to the District Court under s 122 is not an appeal in the sense that lawyers now use that term. It is an election to have the case retried on new materials. Once a person elects to appeal under s 122 the Crown must prove again its case. It may do so by the introduction of new evidence on the issues of liability and sentence. This exposes the appellant to the chance of an increased sentence. Likewise the appellant is not bound by the way he conducted the case in the Local Court. He may require the Crown to prove the case against him even though he pleaded guilty before the Local Court. Moreover, in an appeal under s 122, the sentence is the sentence of the judge, not that of the magistrate. It is necessary, therefore, that the appellant should be before the court. The District Court judge must also remember that it is his sentence and his responsibility for the sentence. Before a judge confirms a sentence, he must first make certain that the sentence represents his own view of the matter. The confirmation of a sentence is no empty formality.” [47]  (Emphasis added)


	
	McHugh JA suggested that s 122 be reformed by abolishing a hearing de novo on new evidence, remarking that “[n]ow that the Local Court comprises highly qualified, professional magistrates, the necessity to retry the case afresh on new evidence seems dubious.” [48] 
	
	
	The Justices Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998 (NSW) (1998 Amendment Act) substantially amended the Justices Act. The long title to that Act described it as “[a]n Act to amend the Justices Act 1902 in relation to appeals from magistrates’ decisions to the Supreme Court, the District Court and the Land and Environment Court…”. The amendments followed a 1992 review which recommended the reform of the Justices Act to ensure that the procedures followed for criminal proceedings before the Local Courts in New South Wales were relevant to modern needs. [49] 
	
	
	The 1998 Amendment Act omitted Part 5 of the Justices Act which had dealt with Appeal and Review, including Division 4 (Appeal to the District Court by defendant). It inserted Part 5 (Appeals to Supreme Court), Part 5A (Appeals to District Court), Division 2 of which dealt with “Appeals by defendants and other persons”, while Division 3 dealt with “Appeals by Crown”, while a new Part 5B dealt with appeals to the Land and Environment Court.
	
	
	In Part 5A, Division 2, s 120(1) provided:
	


“120 When an appeal can be made by a defendant or other person

(1)    Appeals against convictions, sentences or orders 

An appeal against any conviction or order made, or sentence imposed, by a Magistrate in summary proceedings may be made under this Division to the District Court by the person against whom the conviction or order was made or on whom the sentence was imposed.”


	
	Section 132 provided:
	


“132 Appeal to be by way of rehearing

(1)   An appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence heard before the Magistrate who made the conviction or order or imposed the sentence appealed against, except as provided by section 133.

(2)   For the purposes of subsection (1), a transcript is taken to be a correct transcript of a true record of evidence if the transcript is certified in the manner prescribed by the regulations.

(3)   On an appeal, new evidence may be given only with the leave of the District Court, if the Court is of the opinion that it is in the interests of justice that the evidence be given.

(4)   A clerk of a Local Court must, at the request of an appellant or respondent, provide one copy of the transcript of evidence of any witness free of charge to the appellant or respondent.” (Emphasis added)


	
	In his Second Reading Speech to the Bill which became the 1998 Amendment Act, the Attorney General, the Hon Jeff Shaw, said of the amendments insofar as they concerned appeals from the Local Court to the District Court:
	


“Currently under the Justices Act a person may appeal to the District Court against any conviction or order of a justice…

The hearing of the appeal may be determined in one of two ways. First, the appeal may be against conviction, which involves a full de novo hearing before the District Court requiring the court to rehear all the available evidence in relation to the matter. [50]  Although the depositions of the hearing before the magistrate may be used, there is no compulsion upon the appellant to allow the prosecution to proceed in this way, unless the witness is dead, too ill to travel or cannot be found. The second way in which an appeal may be determined is an appeal limited to a review of the sentence imposed by the Local Court. In sentence appeals the District Court judge hears further submissions from the accused and the prosecution without the need for further evidence to be taken and without the need for a transcript of the Local Court proceedings to be prepared. [51] 

It is the intention of this bill only to modify the former method of appeal, that is, an appeal against conviction. The reasons District Court appeals are heard de novo have their origins in appeals from a single justice in petty sessions to a bench of justices in quarter sessions. Because the latter could not review the former, the appeal was heard afresh by the panel of justices. Despite the change from lay justices to legally qualified magistrates, and from sessions of justices to District Court judges, the nature of the appeal jurisdiction has remained the same.”


	
	The Second Reading Speech was incorrect. As is apparent, s 132 as introduced by the 1998 Amendment Act dealt with the determination of s 120 appeals against conviction, orders and sentence in the same manner. Further, the effect of s 132 as introduced, with the admission of new evidence only to be permitted with leave, was that all such appeals were to proceed as error based appeals, rather than as appeals de novo as had hitherto been the case. [52] 
	
	
	The Courts Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (NSW) (1999 Amendment Act) inserted s 131A into Part 5A of the Justices Act which provided:
	


“Appeals against sentence to be by way of rehearing of evidence

An appeal against the severity of a sentence is to be by way of a rehearing of the evidence heard before the Magistrate who imposed the sentence, and new evidence or evidence in addition to, or in substitution for, the evidence given in relation to the sentence appealed against may be given on appeal.”


	
	As can be seen, s 17 of the Appeal and Review Act substantially reflects s 131A, save insofar as the definition of “fresh evidence” in s 3(1) does not include the reference to “new evidence”.
	
	
	The 1999 Amendment Act also omitted s 132(1) and replaced it with the following:
	


“(1)   An appeal against any conviction or order made by a Magistrate is to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence heard before the Magistrate, except as provided by section 133.”


	
	Section 133 (Circumstances when evidence to be given in person) was also amended to limit its application to s 132 appeals.
	
	
	The Second Reading Speech to the Bill which became the 1999 Amendment Act was silent as to the reasons for the amendments. The most probable explanation for the insertion of s 131A was the legislature’s realisation that the 1998 amendments to the Justices Act had altered the mode of determination of a sentence appeal, as well as conviction appeals, contrary to the intention manifest in the Second Reading Speech to the 1998 Amendment Bill. This inference is supported by the Explanatory Note to the 1999 Amendment Act which stated that s 132 and s 133 of the Justices Act had been amended so as not to apply in respect of appeals against sentence by the person against whom the sentence was imposed. The Note also explained that the purpose of s 131A was that “an appeal against sentence is to be by way of a new hearing, and new evidence may be given.” [53] 
	
	
	In Gianoutsos, [54]  McClellan CJ at CL explained the purpose of s 132 as being to modernise the way appeals from the Local Court were conducted in light of the fact Magistrates were legally qualified and that records of the Local Court were of a higher standard. Be that as it may, the legislature’s clear intention was that sentence appeals should continue to be heard as appeals de novo, as they had been prior to the 1998 Amendment Act.
	
	
	The Justices Act was repealed in 2001 by the Justices Legislation Repeal and Amendment Act 2001 (NSW) as part of the amendments which enacted the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). [55]  The Attorney General, the Hon Bob Debus, described the Appeal and Review Act as follows:
	


“[T]he Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Bill … consolidates and simplifies the criminal appeal and review provisions of the Justices Act 1902. The appeal provisions were substantially amended by the Justices Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998 and were not as antiquated as other sections. The new bill consolidates the existing law. The bill has provided an opportunity to clarify some matters that have arisen since the 1998 Act and to arrange the sections in a way that makes the relevant law easier to find and understand.” [56]  (Emphasis added)


	
	At the time the Justices Act was repealed, s 131A governed appeals to the District Court by defendants against sentence, while s 132 and s 133 governed District Court appeals against any conviction or order made by a magistrate.
	
	
	This distinction between the manner in which conviction and sentence appeals were to be determined was continued in s 17 and ss 18 and 19 of the Appeal and Review Act. One of the objects of that Act, according to the Explanatory Note to the Bill, was to “re-enact” Part 5A of the Justices Act. The Explanatory Note also stated that “[t]he re-enacted provisions are substantially the same as those they replace, but the opportunity has been taken to simplify and standardise their form.”
	


Construction of s 18


	
	In Charara, Mason P commented that the reforms effected by the 1998 Amendment Act had “altered the manner in which appeals from the Local Court to the District Court [were] conducted, apparently more significantly than may be generally appreciated.” [57]  At the time Charara was decided, s 132 of the Justices Act had been substantially re-enacted in s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act. It is apparent from Mason P’s reasons that on his construction of s 18, an appeal against conviction did not proceed as a de novo hearing but, rather, as an error based appeal. [58] 
	
	
	Watson, Blackmore and Hosking were of much the same view about the 1998 amendments as Mason P, describing their effect as “far reaching”. [59]  They commented that the concept of “rehearing” introduced by Part 5A constituted “a very significant departure from how appeals had previously been conducted” and meant the nature of the appeal was “more limited than before the introduction of the former Pt 5A.” [60] 
	
	
	When first enacted, s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act provided that an appeal against conviction was “to be way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings…”. [61] 
	
	
	Mason P’s conclusion in Charara that a s 18 appeal against conviction was an error based appeal was based in part on applying McClellan CJ at CL’s reasoning in Gianoutsos that a s 18 appeal was not a de novo hearing, [62]  on the explanation in the Second Reading Speech to the Bill which became the 1998 Amendment Act, to the effect that “the government had … decided to limit appeals to the District Court to a rehearing on the depositions of the Local Court, with provision for fresh evidence to be given by leave”, the fact that prior to the 1998 Amendment Act, although evidence given before the Magistrate could be read on appeal, otherwise the evidence was taken afresh and the authorities holding that a pre-1998 appeal was de novo. [63] 
	
	
	His Honour also found support for his analysis in the fact that the “appellate role of the District Court … [was] reinforced by the references to ‘appeal’ in ss 18 and 19 and by the power, conferred by s 20, to determine the appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction or by dismissing the appeal.” [64] 
	
	
	On a different subject, Mason P considered the view expressed in Howie and Johnson, Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW (at [4-s 19.10(g)]) that “the reasons of the magistrate for finding the offence proved are not ‘evidence’ and that the District Court may not have regard to those reasons unless the parties consent to that course.” [65]  His Honour disagreed with the latter proposition, saying:
	


“District Court judges traditionally and understandably refrained from reading the reasons of the Local Court when the appeal was de novo. But the nature of an appeal by way of rehearing on the transcript indicates to me that this approach is no longer justified. The magistrate’s reasons are not part of the ‘certified transcripts of evidence’ referred to in s 18(1) any more than the exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Nevertheless, as I see it, the District Court is impliedly directed to consider the reasons because the stated appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them.” [66] 


	
	Section 18 was amended after Mason P’s observation in Charara and the recommendation in the 2008 Report reviewing the operation of the Appeal and Review Act to exclude the words “certified transcripts of”. [67] 
	
	
	The nature of a conviction appeal pursuant to the Appeal and Review Act, s 18 in its current form was summarised in Dyason v Butterworth, [68]  as follows:
	


“[26]   A s 18(1) appeal is not an appeal de novo: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244; (2006) 164 A Crim R 39 (at [16] – [24]) per Mason P (Kirby and Hoeben JJ agreeing). Although s 18(1) is no longer precisely in the same form as it was when considered in Charara, the amendment does not detract from Mason P’s reasoning: B v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWCA 232 (at [39]) per Beazley P (Barrett JA and Tobias AJA agreeing).

[27]   The approach to be taken on a s 18(1) rehearing is analogous to that taken to a civil appeal under s 75A of the Supreme Court Act as explained in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118 (at [23]): McKellar v Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWCA 91 (‘McKellar’) (at [8]) per Basten JA (Beazley P and Whealy JA agreeing). The ‘judge is to form his or her judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who heard and saw the witnesses in the lower court’: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Burns [2010] NSWCA 265 (at [23]) per Beazley JA (Basten and Campbell JJA agreeing). While the Magistrate’s reasons are not part of the transcript of evidence, recourse can be had to them on appeal as otherwise the appellate function cannot properly take place: Charara v R (at [23]).

[28]   The powers of the District Court on a s 18(1) rehearing are exercisable where the appellant demonstrates that the order the subject of the appeal is the result of a legal, factual or discretionary error in which event the appellate court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and law as they then stand: Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40; (2000) 203 CLR 172 (at [23]) per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.”

Construction of s 17


	
	Neither party was able to identify any authority in which s 17 had been construed.
	
	
	The text of ss 17, 18 and 26 of the Appeal and Review Act all use the expressions “appeal” and provide in substantially the same terms for the appeal being by way of a rehearing of the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings. However, the fact that leave is not required to adduce fresh evidence in a s 17 appeal is significant. As I have explained, a “special power” to receive further evidence subject to a leave requirement such as found in s 18 and s 26 indicates that such appeals, albeit described as a “rehearing”, do not call for a fresh hearing or a hearing de novo, but, rather, are error based. [69] 
	
	
	Conversely, the omission of a leave requirement for the admission of “fresh evidence” indicates, in my view, that the s 17 appeal is a hearing de novo requiring the sentence proceedings consequent upon the conviction to be heard afresh. As I have said, on such an appeal, the Court exercises original jurisdiction and the sentence is that of the District Court judge and must represent his or her “view of the matter”, not whether the Magistrate’s view was appropriate. [70] 
	
	
	The fact that a s 17 severity appeal is of a different character to a conviction appeal is confirmed by the structure of the Appeal and Review Act, with separate provisions dealing with each appeal and their determination. As is apparent from the legislative history, until 1998 all criminal appeals from magistrates to District Court judges were heard de novo. For a brief period between the changes effected by the 1998 Amendment Act and the 1999 Amendment Act, when conviction and sentence appeals were governed by the same provisions, s 120 and s 132 of the Justices Act, such appeals were error based appeals.
	
	
	The change effected by the 1999 amendments introducing s 131A evinced a clear legislative intention to differentiate between the manner in which conviction and sentence appeals were to be determined. That intention was continued in the enactment of the different provisions dealing with each such appeal in the Appeal and Review Act, the latter being intended, as I earlier explained, to re-enact Part 5A of the Justices Act  in which s 131A and s 132 were found. The Explanatory Note to the 1999 Amendment Act is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of s 17 and makes it clear that a severity appeal is to be a hearing de novo. [71] 
	
	
	The conclusion that a severity appeal requires a hearing de novo is not gainsaid by the fact that it proceeds “by way of a rehearing of the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings”, albeit with a right to adduce fresh evidence. That was also the way rehearings de novo pursuant to Justices Act, s 122 proceeded. [72] 
	


Conclusion


	
	The Crown Advocate originally submitted that the evidence from the Local Court proceedings to which s 17 referred was confined to that involved in the sentencing phase of that hearing. However he ultimately accepted, properly in my view that such evidence could extend to such evidence from the conviction phase which was relevant to such matters as culpability and proportionality.
	
	
	In my view, Mason P’s observation in Charara that the Magistrate’s reasons are not part of the “evidence” in a s 18 appeal, [73]  applies with equal force to a s 17 appeal, notwithstanding the different nature of each appeal. However, it is apparent that District Court judges have always had regard, at least, to that part of the Magistrate’s reasons as imposed the challenged sentence. If that was not considered, the District Court judge could not afford the appellant procedural fairness by giving a Parker warning if he or she was minded to increase the challenged sentence.
	
	
	The consequence of this conclusion is that, in determining the severity appeal, the primary judge was required to have regard to the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, and to such other “fresh evidence” as was adduced. As his Honour had to determine issues such as the applicant’s culpability for the crime for which he had been convicted and was to be sentenced afresh, it was essential that his Honour have regard to the evidence given in the conviction phase of the hearing, insofar as it was relevant to the sequence 3 conviction. That was the course Mr Mantaj urged upon his Honour.
	
	
	I do not accept the Crown Advocate’s submission that Mr Mantaj sought the adjournment to tender irrelevant parts of the transcript. To the extent he referred to “an analysis of the entire transcript” as being what s 17 required, it is apparent, in my view, that having regard to the context, Mr Mantaj was referring to the evidence from the conviction hearing relevant to the sequence 3 conviction. This was made plain by his request that once the transcript was obtained, he and the Crown should collaborate to identify the relevant evidence.
	
	
	The Crown opposed that course before the District Court, a course the concessions the Crown Advocate has made on this application reveal to be in error.
	
	
	It was, accordingly, an error, with respect, on the primary judge’s part for him to reject Mr Mantaj’s submission that s 17 meant that such part of the transcript as was relevant evidence for the purpose of the severity appeal could be adduced and that he should be given an adjournment to facilitate the identification and provision of that evidence by way of the Local Court transcript.
	
	
	In such circumstances, in my view, it is apparent that his Honour acted on an incorrect principle as to the manner in which the severity appeal was to be determined such as to overcome the presumption in favour of the correctness of the exercise of his Honour’s discretionary refusal to grant the adjournment Mr Mantaj sought. [74]  Rather, refusing the adjournment occasioned a serious injustice as it denied the applicant the opportunity to bring to the severity appeal the matters concerning his culpability he sought to contend ought be the basis of his sentence so that the primary judge could apply the principle of proportionality in the course of determining himself what the sentence should be. [75] 
	
	
	I also reject the Crown Advocate’s submission that the severity appeal proceeded as a hearing de novo in circumstances where the primary judge did not have, and by his ruling on the adjournment application, refused the applicant the opportunity to tender, the evidence on the conviction hearing relevant to sequence 3.
	
	
	Having misapprehended the nature of his power pursuant to s 17, his Honour committed a jurisdictional error such that the hearing of the severity appeal was not a hearing according to law.
	


Law reform


	
	The 2008 Report identified an anomaly in the Appeal and Review Act as explained by Berman DCJ in R v Holten [76]  in relation to all-grounds appeals. Section 11 of the Appeal and Review Act does not provide for such appeals. The history for this would appear to lie in the 1998 amendments to which I have earlier referred. However the practice in the District Court to which Berman DCJ referred indicates that defendants effectively pursue such appeals, however are forced by the legislative lacunae to seek to “convert” a conviction appeal (if unsuccessful) into a severity appeal, or vice versa. [77] 
	
	
	These reasons highlight the different ways in which conviction and sentence appeals are to be determined under the Appeal and Review Act. It would be desirable if consideration was given to rationalising the nature of the respective appeals and to provide for all-grounds appeals.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	An order in the nature of certiorari that the record of the proceedings in the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction in the case Timothy John Engelbrecht v Regina (2013/00386765) be removed into this Court;
	
	
	An order in the nature of certiorari quashing the determination of his Honour Judge Sides of 30 September 2015 dismissing the sentence appeal brought by Timothy John Engelbrecht against the sentencing decision of Magistrate Bartley;
	
	
	Direct that the proceedings be returned to the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction to be heard and determined according to law;
	
	
	Order the Crown to pay the applicant’s costs of the application for judicial review.
	



	
	MACFARLAN JA: This is an application pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) for judicial review of a District Court decision of 30 September 2015 dismissing an appeal against a sentence imposed on the applicant, Mr Timothy Engelbrecht, by the Local Court on 4 August 2015. Mr Engelbrecht contends that the District Court committed jurisdictional error by acting on a misunderstanding of the effect of s 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the “CAR Act”) in relation to the material to which it was to have regard on the appeal.
	
	
	Section 17 of the CAR Act is in the following terms:
	


“17 Appeals against sentence to be by way of rehearing of evidence

An appeal against sentence is to be by way of a rehearing of the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, although fresh evidence may be given in the appeal proceedings.”


	
	“[O]riginal Local Court proceedings” are defined in s 3 as follows:
	


“original Local Court proceedings means the proceedings in the Local Court that involved the making or imposition of a conviction, sentence or order from which the proceedings under this Act arise.”


	
	Following an eight day hearing, Magistrate Bartley, on 10 June 2015, found Mr Engelbrecht guilty of an offence of aggravated indecent assault and not guilty of various other charges of aggravated indecent assault. On 4 August 2015 the magistrate sentenced Mr Engelbrecht to 300 hours of Community Service Work, incorporating his reasons for judgment on conviction into his Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	Mr Engelbrecht then appealed to the District Court pursuant to s 17 of the CAR Act against this sentence. The appeal was heard and determined by Sides DCJ on 30 September 2015. His Honour rejected an adjournment application made on Mr Engelbrecht’s behalf by his solicitor, Mr Mantaj. Mr Mantaj contended, inter alia, that Mr Engelbrecht was prejudiced because the prosecutor had only recently resiled from an agreement with Mr Mantaj that an Agreed Statement of Facts be put before the Court, the prosecutor instead indicating an intention to rely upon the Magistrate’s reasons for judgment given on conviction. Mr Mantaj asserted that he had not had sufficient time to review the evidence adduced at the Local Court conviction hearing and was not therefore in a position to identify what of it might be relevant to be referred to on sentence.
	
	
	Sides DCJ gave the following reasons for rejecting this basis for an adjournment:
	


“It has been further contended on the appellant’s behalf that, because the goalpost has now been moved, he is prejudiced because he does not have a transcript of the evidence of any of the witnesses given before the magistrate which it is argued is the material referred to in s 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. The Court does not accept that submission. The evidence referred to there is the evidence given at the sentence hearing and, in an appeal against severity of a sentence imposed after a conviction recorded following a hearing, it is legitimate for the magistrate’s reasons at the end of the hearing to determine guilt to be tendered so that the factual matrix upon which the … appeal [is] to proceed can be established.”


	
	It is evident from this reasoning that the judge took the view that on an appeal to the District Court against sentence “the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings”, as referred to in s 17 of the CAR Act, was a reference only to evidence specifically tendered at the sentencing hearing and did not extend to evidence given at the earlier hearing at which the offender’s guilt was determined. In my opinion, this view was erroneous.
	
	
	The conviction and sentence of offenders is dealt with in one set of proceedings. There is not one proceeding for the determination of guilt or innocence and another for the determination of sentence. Initiation of proceedings by the filing of an indictment or, as in the present case, the filing of a Court Attendance Notice leads, if a conviction occurs, not only to that conviction but also to the sentencing of the offender. Commonly, and desirably, the same judge or magistrate presides at both the conviction and sentencing hearings, if separate hearings are held. In sentencing, the judicial officer is able to have regard to the evidence given when guilt was determined without the need for that evidence to be adduced again.
	
	
	In the case of a jury trial, it will often be necessary for the judge, in reliance upon the evidence given at the trial, to make factual findings on “matters of potential importance to an assessment of the offender’s culpability” which are not implicit in the jury’s verdict and not inconsistent with it (Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1; [2001] HCA 67 at [4]-[20]; GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198; [2004] HCA 22 at [30]). There is no need to re-tender evidence given at the trial because it is already before the judge if the judge presided at the trial. If the sentencing judge is different to the trial judge, the parties are entitled to refer to the trial evidence. Whether, as a matter of convenience, the transcript of that evidence, or part of it, is marked as an exhibit is of no significance.
	
	
	The position is the same where a judge, and not a jury, has determined guilt. Considerations of common sense and case management may lead to the parties agreeing to limit the conviction transcript and exhibits provided to the sentencing judge, or to obviate the need for their use at all by providing an Agreed Statement of Facts or simply relying upon the judge’s reasons for conviction. Whilst those reasons are not, in the words of s 17 of the CAR Act, “evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings”, the section impliedly authorises their use as “the stated appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them” (Charara v The Queen (2006) 164 A Crim R 39; [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [23] referring to a presently analogous statutory provision).
	
	
	For these reasons, Mr Engelbrecht had a right to refer the District Court judge to any evidence given at the conviction hearing that was relevant to his sentencing. If the facts had justified it, the District Court judge could have rejected the adjournment application on the basis that Mr Engelbrecht and his advisors had already had sufficient opportunity to consider which parts of the transcript, if any, they wished to rely upon. However the application was rejected upon the basis of the Court’s misunderstanding that the evidence given at the conviction hearing was not evidence to which Mr Engelbrecht was entitled to refer because it was not evidence specifically tendered at the sentence hearing. This was a misunderstanding by the District Court judge of his powers and duties in connection with the disposition of the appeal and for that reason constituted jurisdictional error rendering his decision reviewable by this Court (Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163; [1995] HCA 58 at [11] and [12]; Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales (2010) 239 CLR 531; [2010] HCA 1).
	
	
	In conclusion three further points require mention.
	
	
	The respondent DPP contended that the application that Mr Mantaj made in the District Court was that the whole of the Local Court conviction evidence be put before the District Court. In theory at least, if not in hard copy form, the whole of that evidence was already before the Local Court magistrate when he was sentencing but common sense and propriety dictated that the practitioners only seek to refer to such of that evidence as they asserted to be relevant. Consistently with this, on the District Court appeal Mr Mantaj only sought the opportunity to identify and refer to that part of the Local Court conviction transcript that he considered relevant. This is evident from his references to seeking to “tender a lot more than just the decision of” the magistrate (p 1), seeking “to sit down with the Crown and identify the relevant evidence” (p 5), to the Court needing to consider “at least as much of the transcript of the Local Court hearing as the parties wished to refer the Court to” (p 6) and to him tendering “the parts of the transcript which I propose to rely upon” (p 6). In light of these clear statements, his statement, apparently interrupted by the judge before it was completed, that the appeal “ought to proceed on the basis of an analysis of the entire transcript” should not be taken as indicating otherwise. A literal reading of that statement would be inconsistent with his other statements and with the tenor of his application to be afforded time to examine the transcript to identify relevant parts.
	
	
	Secondly, after the adjournment application was refused, the District Court judge allowed Mr Mantaj to tender the transcript of certain character evidence given at the conviction hearing in the Local Court. That Mr Mantaj was able to tender this evidence did not indicate that, contrary to his assertion to the Court, he had in fact had the opportunity to consider the whole of the transcript. Nor did it indicate that the judge’s view had been, all along, that the evidence from the conviction hearing could be used at the sentence hearing. Rather, it was an implicit qualification to his earlier expressed view, made when limited evidence was tendered without objection.
	
	
	Thirdly, contrary to the respondent’s contention, Mr Engelbrecht is able on the present application to this Court to challenge the erroneous basis upon which his adjournment application was refused. The error in that respect occurred in the course of his Honour making an interlocutory decision that “affected the final result”, that is, led to the dismissal of the appeal on the same day (see by analogy Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Limited (2002) 209 CLR 478; [2002] HCA 22 at [6]; Michael Wilson & Partners Limited v Nicholls (2011) 244 CLR 247; [2011] HCA 48 at [78]).
	
	
	For these reasons, the orders proposed by McColl JA should be made.
	
	
	LEEMING JA: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of McColl JA in draft, which allows me to pass over much of the factual and procedural background, and to state my reasons concisely.
	


Background


	
	The offender, Mr Timothy John Engelbrecht, was found guilty of one offence of aggravated indecency, contrary to s 61O(1A) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He was found not guilty of four other charges which were tried at the same time in the Local Court. A critical difference between the offences with which the offender was charged was that the conduct giving rise to the count on which he was found guilty was observed by an independent witness, Mr Dowling, who was also tasked with caring for intellectually impaired young men (as was the offender), and that witness was not relevantly challenged in cross-examination.
	
	
	The conclusions expressed by the Magistrate were as follows:
	


“Although Mr Dowling’s independent evidence essentially was unchallenged, I exercise caution in evaluating it.

I bear in mind the accused’s clean criminal record and prior excellent character.

However, for all of the reasons given in my earlier analysis of Mr Engelbrecht’s evidence in respect of sequence 3, I find that it utterly lacks credibility and I reject it.

I apply R v Barrass [2005] NSWCCA 131 and adopt the reasoning and findings in my judgment recorded on 12 September 2014 at pp 2-5.

I find beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Ferguson was in Mr Engelbrecht’s direct line of sight when Mr Ferguson was in the kitchen at the time of the sequence 3 incident.

I find beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Engelbrecht intended Mr Ferguson to see him walking with his genitals exposed.

I accept beyond reasonable doubt Mr Dowling’s unchallenged evidence to the effect that, and I infer from it that, Mr Ferguson saw Mr Engelbrecht with his genitals exposed and drew that to Mr Dowling’s attention.

I FIND THE SEQUENCE 3 OFFENCE PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.”


	
	There was no appeal against conviction. The maximum penalty which could have been imposed was imprisonment for two years. The Crown did not seek a custodial order. A sentence of 300 hours community service was imposed.
	
	
	The sentencing Magistrate expressly incorporated his earlier judgment on guilt into his sentencing judgment, thereby including the passage reproduced above. His Honour considered that he was unable to find that the offence was committed for sexual gratification, and that the offender had a clean criminal record and was of prior excellent character. However, he concluded from a presentence report that there remained a significant risk of reoffending, and noted the absence of any genuine contrition or remorse. His Honour gave less weight to prior excellent character and the clean criminal record than would otherwise be the case, because of his position of trust. His Honour also gave substantial weight to general deterrence for the same reason.
	
	
	An appeal against severity was filed on the same day, invoking the right conferred by s 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). The effect of filing that appeal was to stay the operation of the sentence until the “final determination” of that appeal: s 63 of that Act. The notice of appeal stated, “I am appealing the above sentence BECAUSE THE PENALTY IS TOO SEVERE”. No grounds were specified.
	
	
	McColl JA has summarised the submissions made in support of the application for an adjournment when the appeal was listed for hearing. I would add the following.
	
	
	First, the Crown said, repeatedly and without opposition from Mr Mantaj, that the facts as to which Mr Mantaj claimed there had been agreement amounted (in relation to the only relevant offence) to a single paragraph. The document was not itself in evidence, either in the court below or in this Court.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Mantaj said initially that the matter “ought to proceed on the basis of an analysis of the entire transcript”, and rejected what was immediately put to him, that the reference in s 17 was a reference to the evidence in the sentencing proceeding.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Mantaj then accepted that the evidence on which he submitted the Court was bound to conduct the appeal included evidence relating to matters on which the offender was found not guilty. He then acknowledged that much would be irrelevant, and that he would seek to agree with the Crown aspects which were irrelevant.
	
	
	Fourthly, Mr Mantaj concluded his submissions by saying that the Court was required to consider “at least as much of the transcript of the Local Court hearing as the parties wish to refer the Court to”. He accepted that he had no authority for the submission.
	
	
	As McColl JA has recorded, the adjournment was refused. The appeal proceeded. Mr Mantaj was permitted to tender the remarks on sentence and parts of the evidence from the eight day trial. The appeal against sentence was dismissed.
	
	
	The offender invoked this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction. The sole ground (it is wrongly described in the summons as a ground of appeal) is:
	


“That the presiding Judge erred in that, contrary to the provisions of section 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, his Honour refused to have regard to the transcript of the evidence given in the Local Court proceeding in determining the appeal over which he was presiding, constituting jurisdictional error.”

The construction of s 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act


	
	McColl JA has reproduced ss 17 and 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and the definitions of “fresh evidence” and “original Local Court proceedings”. Neither party suggested there was any authority on point.
	
	
	Although I can see some force in the submission that “the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings” in s 17 is a reference to the evidence given leading to both conviction and sentence, I do not consider, on balance, that that is the proper construction of s 17.
	
	
	Sections 17 and 18 are to be read as a whole and harmoniously. So too must the definitions of “fresh evidence” and “original Local Court proceedings”: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355; [1998] HCA 28 at [69]-[70].
	
	
	The concluding words “from which the proceedings under this Act arise” in the definition of “original Local Court proceedings” and the cognate words “proceedings from which the appeal proceedings have arisen” in the definition of “fresh evidence” are likewise to be read harmoniously. They naturally refer to the various rights of appeal, including under ss 17 and 18. The exercise of those rights gives rise to separate proceedings, variously described as “proceedings under this Act” and “appeal proceedings”.
	
	
	The difference between the power to adduce fresh evidence in an appeal under s 17 and in an appeal under s 18 is that s 17 provides that “fresh evidence may be given in the appeal proceedings” while s 18 imposes a precondition, namely, that the Court is satisfied that fresh evidence is in the interests of justice.
	
	
	It is quite plain that the “evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings” for the purposes of a conviction appeal in s 18 is only the evidence which involved the making of the conviction. (Either there will have been no sentencing hearing, or, if one has occurred, it will, at least ordinarily, be irrelevant to the determination of the conviction appeal.)
	
	
	The rules of evidence will apply to the proceedings leading to conviction. However, at least ordinarily, they will not apply to proceedings which relate to sentencing: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), subss 4(1)(d) and (2). However, ss 17 and 18 proceed on the basis that there will be a “rehearing” of the “evidence” before the Magistrate, and so I put to one side the fact that, as Spigelman CJ observed, “the process of adducing evidence and making findings for the purposes of sentencing is quite distinct from what is required for purposes of determining criminal liability”: Gilham v R (2007) 73 NSWLR 308; [2007] NSWCCA 323 at [66].
	
	
	Further, the words “evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings” which are common to ss 17 and 18 are to be read with the defined term “original Local Court proceedings”. I see no reason to displace the ordinary approach whereby the Court is to “read the words of the definition into the substantive enactment and then construe the substantive enactment – in its extended or confined sense – in its context and bearing in mind its purpose and the mischief that it was designed to overcome”: Kelly v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 216; [2004] HCA 12 at [103]. Thus, applying the definition to the defined term in each of ss 18 and 17 and bearing in mind that “making” is apt to apply in an appeal against conviction, while “imposition” will apply in an appeal against sentence:
	



	
	in s 18 the words “evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings” are to be read as meaning “evidence given in the proceedings in the Local Court that involved the making of the conviction from which the proceedings under this Act arise”, while
	
	
	in s 17 the words “evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings” are to be read as meaning “evidence given in the proceedings in the Local Court that involved the imposition of the sentence from which the proceedings under this Act arise”.
	



	
	Read in that way, which I regard to be their ordinary grammatical meaning, the two statutory concepts of evidence in proceedings which involved the making of a conviction and evidence in proceedings which involved the imposition of a sentence require a distinction to be drawn between the evidence leading to conviction, and the evidence leading to sentence. The latter does not include the former.
	
	
	That construction is supported by the less constrained power to adduce fresh evidence in an appeal under s 17. As was common ground at the hearing, some of the evidence given prior to conviction may be relevant to an appeal against sentence. Of course, it is not possible in such an appeal to traverse any findings which are essential to the finding of guilt. But there may be many matters going to culpability which are not determined by the finding of guilt. Examples may be found in Gleeson CJ’s judgment in Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1; [2001] HCA 67 at [9]-[10].
	
	
	That construction is also, in my view, supported by the legislative history and the extrinsic materials. As McColl JA has explained, for many decades the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) made provision for an appeal to the Courts of Quarter Sessions, later to the District Court. Until 1999, there was a single provision applicable to appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence. By the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (NSW), that provision was altered, and a new section 131A inserted into the Justices Act. New s 131A provided:
	


“131A Appeals against sentence to be by way of rehearing of evidence

An appeal against the severity of a sentence is to be by way of a rehearing of the evidence heard before the Magistrate who imposed the sentence, and new evidence or evidence in addition to, or in substitution for, the evidence given in relation to the sentence appealed against may be given on appeal.”


	
	Plainly enough, s 131A preserved the structure of s 17 of the current legislation insofar as the same provision both describes the nature of the right of appeal and confers a power to adduce fresh evidence. However, s 131A is drafted a little differently. Two terms have been used to describe the same thing. I think it must be concluded that the words “the evidence heard before the Magistrate who imposed the sentence” mean the same as “the evidence given in relation to the sentence appealed against”. Ordinarily, of course, a difference in language – particularly in the same section – would suggest a difference in legal meaning. However, the connecting words “in addition to” and “in substitution for” compel the conclusion that both terms refer to the same evidence.
	
	
	Further, “the evidence given in relation to the sentence appealed against” is in my view naturally read as a reference only to the evidence given after conviction. The words “in relation to the sentence appealed against” stand in contrast with the unqualified description of the evidence in s 132(1) (as amended) for an appeal against conviction. Read naturally, those words “in relation to the sentence appealed against” do not include evidence given to secure the conviction for which the offender was sentenced.
	
	
	In short, the amendments made in 1999 were slightly clearer in identifying the evidence on which an appeal against sentence would proceed than the current provisions. Given that the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 was expressed to be legislation which consolidates and simplifies existing provisions, regard may be had to the former legislation.
	


Conclusion


	
	The premise of ss 17 and 18 is that a conviction has been entered, or a sentence imposed, in the Local Court following a summary procedure. Unlike a guilty verdict from a jury, a finding of guilt will not be “inscrutable”. It will instead be accompanied by findings and reasons for those findings. That is what occurred in the present case. It is not necessary to say anything further as to whether principles developed in relation to sentencing appeals following a jury’s verdict of guilty apply in such cases.
	
	
	It suffices to conclude that the single proposition of law presented in this proceeding is resolved adversely to the offender. A severity appeal under s 17 is based on the evidence before the sentencing Magistrate, plus such other “fresh evidence” as may be relevant. The reasons of the primary judge do not disclose error, still less jurisdictional error. The primary judge made no error in rejecting a submission founded on the text of s 17. To the extent that the offender sought to tender evidence from the eight day trial on his severity appeal, he was permitted to do so. I should not be taken to be expressing any view about the nature of the power to admit fresh evidence contained in s 17, something which again was not argued in this Court.
	


Supplementary matters


	
	I would add the following three supplementary matters. First, the basis of the adjournment sought before Sides DCJ was expressed to be so that the entirety of the evidence at trial could be tendered. It is true that Mr Mantaj during the course of his submissions advanced a lesser proposition, namely than only a part of the transcript should be tendered. However, in the proceedings in this Court’s original jurisdiction, Mr Mantaj read an affidavit, in which he swore that the following proposition was true and correct to the best of his recollection:
	


“The basis of this application was to allow the Applicant to place before the Court the transcript of the evidence given by the various witnesses in the Local Court hearing. The Applicant’s submission was (and continues to be) that by virtue of s 17 [of the] Act, the court hearing the severity appeal was obliged to have regard to that evidence in determining the appeal.”


	
	I proceed on the basis that the affidavit was sworn by an experienced solicitor seriously and solemnly. In those circumstances, not lightly would I treat the claim in this Court as being different from what was addressed by Mr Mantaj’s sworn evidence.
	
	
	Secondly, even if the question were whether some part of the evidence over eight days be tendered, that part was never identified. Even during the hearing in this Court, Mr Mantaj was unable to identify with any precision what he would have sought to tender on the appeal. Indeed during the hearing, Mr Mantaj submitted that he wished to tender some of the exhibits tendered before the Magistrate, something which had never been articulated either in the District Court, or in his summons or submissions in this Court.
	
	
	Thirdly, during the course of the hearing, it became clear that Mr Mantaj sought to depart from the ground formulated in his summons, and in his affidavit and submissions. The Crown opposed any reliance upon a complaint that there had been a denial of procedural fairness, on the basis that it was unpleaded, not contained in the submissions, and different evidence would have been obtained had that ground been advanced. Mr Mantaj made no response to that opposition. I accept the Crown’s submission.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, I would dismiss the summons. Costs should follow the event.

2770933,R v Bassim Karim [2016] NSWDC 261,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The offender is before the Court for sentence on two offences in an indictment dated 18 March 2016. He was originally committed for trial with the co-offender, Andrew Preston, in an indictment dated 15 July 2015 which contained a number of joint counts and a separate count in relation to Mr Preston. The matter was originally listed for trial for two to three weeks on 14 March 2016. It was listed for a six-week trial.
	
	
	On 14 March, on the application of the co‑accused Mr Preston, the trial date was vacated. The estimate of 4 to 6 weeks remained, said to be on the basis of additional material served by the Crown between 22 May 2015 and 4 March 2016. It is not entirely clear what occurred, except that I infer there must have been negotiations between the legal representatives of the offender and the Crown. When the matter was mentioned on 18 March 2016 a new indictment, the one before me now dated 18 March 2016, was presented and the offender pleaded guilty to those two counts.
	
	
	Two of the other offences on the original indictment are now offences to be taken into account as Form 1 offences. The pleas of guilty, with the Form 1 offences taken into account, were accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the matters for which the offender was committed for trial. As I understand it, the co-offender is listed for trial in the Downing Centre in November 2016.
	
	
	The specific offences are: Count 1 that between 14 December 2013 and 18 December 2013 at Sylvania the offender manufactured a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. That is an offence contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and as such carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender asks when sentencing him for this offence that I take into account two further offences to be found in a schedule to a Form 1 signed by him and exhibited in these proceedings. They are one charge of manufacturing a prohibited drug at Tempe between 15 and 17 December 2013 and one charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty on 7 April 2014.
	
	
	Count 2 in the indictment is an offence of supplying 16.6 grams of methylamphetamine at Woolooware on 7 April 2014. This is an offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, brought as a deemed supply offence which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	For reasons that are impossible to understand, I am also asked to deal with four apparently related offences that are sent up to the Court for sentence pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. They are two offences of possessing instructions for manufacturing a prohibited drug, one relating to the substantive offence, count 1, and the other relating to the Form 1 manufacture offence. There are two other offences of organising or conducting drug premises, again, one relating to the substantive offence, count 1, and the other to the Form 1 manufacturing offence at Tempe.
	
	
	The relevant facts are that on 17 December 2013, police attended at Tyne Container Services at Tempe to execute a search warrant. There had been an investigation ongoing since November 2013 into the manufacture and supply of prohibited drugs in the Sutherland Shire area. The police had identified the offender as being involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. They undertook a number of covert investigative methods to pursue this investigation. They discovered that he attended the shipping container yard in Tempe, and monitored him from the period 13 November 2013 through to the end of November. They also had intercepted telephone communication warrants and listened to telephone calls between the offender and his co‑accused, Mr Preston, indicating involvement in the manufacture of drugs.
	
	
	On 17 December 2013, police attended the container services premises to execute the warrant. They saw the offender near one of the containers. He looked at them, turned and ran in the opposite direction. They called on him to stop, but he continued running. The telephone intercept material indicated that he immediately contacted several associates, asking them to break into his premises in Sylvania to clear everything out. He also indicated that he was aware the police were looking for him and he asked for the premises to be cleaned up. All of this was indicative of his guilt in relation to the substantive offence of manufacturing methylamphetamine in the premises in Sylvania. He was also collected by an associate to avoid immediate apprehension by the police.
	
	
	When police searched the shipping containers they identified chemicals and equipment used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. They included a vacuum pump, caustic soda bottles, used disposable gloves, thinners and many other items used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. There was a plastic bucket in the bushes behind the container which was found to contain methylamphetamine. When police searched the car driven by the offender after his arrest, they located a number of receipts for hydrochloric acid and methylated spirits which were for use in the manufacture of this drug.
	
	
	The container premises were visited by an expert chemist. I accept that they had been used to manufacture a prohibited drug and the quantity to have been manufactured was 52 grams. They also found a computer printout which amounted to instructions on how to manufacture methylamphetamine. This would appear to be sequence 5, the third of the four related offences for which I must sentence him in due course.
	
	
	On the same day in the evening, police went to the offender’s premises in Sylvania and searched. In that unit they found equipment and chemicals used to manufacture prohibited drugs, including a 10-litre, round-bottomed reaction flask, glass trays, funnels, woks, plate burners and chemicals. The same expert chemist also attended this site and I accept from her opinion, that these premises had recently been used to conduct the manufacture of a prohibited drug, and I accept her opinion that the quantity to have been manufactured was 131 grams. Those specific facts are the facts relevant for count 1 in the indictment. Also in those premises police found documents which were instructions on how to manufacture methylamphetamine. It would appear that they are the facts relevant for sequence 2, the first of four related offences for which I must sentence him.
	
	
	On 7 April 2014, some four months later, police went to an address in Woolooware. When they entered the property they found the accused standing in the front bedroom. They announced that he was under arrest. He ran to the window towards a police officer and pushed this police officer in an attempt to keep running out of the room. I assume that these are the facts relevant for the second of the two Form 1 offences, assault police officer in the execution of his duty.
	
	
	Two other officers assisted and restrained the offender. He continued to try to escape whilst he was being restrained. He was cautioned and searched. In the right pocket of his jumper police found one plastic bag which contained a brown powder substance and a small bag of white powder. These substances were later analysed and determined to be 16.6 grams of methylamphetamine. Those latter facts are the facts relevant for the second count in the indictment, namely the deemed supply of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine by him on that occasion.
	
	
	I accept from the evidence the offender has given, that these drugs found in his possession at the time of his arrest were from a quantity he had bought for his own use. His plea of guilty to this offence indicates that he accepts not all of those drugs were for his own use and that he had some of them at least in his possession for the purpose of supply. I accept that that supply at best was likely to be by way of sharing with friends as he had done in the past. I also accept from other evidence given by the offender that his involvement in the manufacture of these drugs was for his own use. He has a long and relatively sad history which I will come to in due course, but which I accept ultimately led to his becoming significantly addicted to methylamphetamine.
	
	
	As his life unravelled around him with the increasing addiction to this drug, it became difficult for him to buy it. I accept from his evidence that there was an occasion on which, in his own words, he was ripped off and a gun was placed at his head. He decided to manufacture this drug for his own use so that he did not have to buy it himself in those circumstances. Clearly enough, his judgment was adversely affected by his significant use of methylamphetamine at the time. He claims that he became aware of the fact that this could happen by television shows and similar and that he took possession of the instructions to produce it. He started to manufacture it first of all in his unit premises in Sylvania. He then also started to manufacture it in the container premises at Tempe, in part because the fumes produced were becoming difficult in Sylvania and also Tempe afforded him a greater opportunity to hide in a larger area.
	
	
	There is no evidence that he was manufacturing these drugs for the purpose of supplying them to any person. I accept that his drug use at that stage had become so significant that the quantities he had manufactured in these two sites were consistent with the sorts of quantities he had been purchasing and that more probably than not he would have used for himself.
	
	
	All drug manufacturing offences are serious. Methylamphetamine appears to be a serious drug to which people become addicted very quickly, which adversely affects their behaviour and which almost invariably leads to their downfall and most of the time they take a lot of people along with them. The manufacture of that drug is serious but the factual circumstances of his commission of this offence, particularly the fact that he engaged in it to use the drugs for himself, put it towards the bottom of the range for offences of manufacturing. The quantities are not small but the surrounding circumstances lower the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The Form 1 offence, however, amounts to a second manufacturing offence, or at least the first of the Form 1 offences amounts to a second manufacturing offence. It means that he was at around the same period manufacturing this drug in two places and it is, therefore, a matter which needs to be taken into account in a meaningful way when addressing the sentence for the substantive offence.
	
	
	The second Form 1 offence, the assault officer in execution of his duty, is not a matter which, in my view, would increase the criminality of the substantive offence. Clearly enough any offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty ought be taken seriously, but this assault does not appear to have been a significant one. It was committed by him in panic whilst trying to escape arrest. It would not, in the general scheme, have given rise to a term of full-time imprisonment if sentenced separately and in those circumstances, whilst being taken into account as a Form 1 offence, should not elevate the sentence for the substantive offence.
	
	
	The Form 1 supply offence, in my view, is very much towards the bottom of the range for drug supply offences capable of being charged under this section. It is a deemed supply. The quantity is relatively small and it is clear that some of it at least was for his personal use. If this were the only offence being sentenced, it would be a matter dealt with in some other way than by a term of full‑time custody. That will not be available on this sentence because he will receive a full-time term of imprisonment for count 1. The only realistic outcome is a very short fixed term of imprisonment to be served concurrently with the substantive offence count 1.
	
	
	Only full-time custody would suffice to deal with the objective criminality in relation to count 1. The sentence must also encompass a degree of general deterrence so that it is clear that manufacturing methylamphetamine is not just the stuff of television series, but is a serious criminal offence which gives rise to a lengthy term of imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender has pleaded guilty. It was not at the earliest available opportunity. The matter, as I have said, was committed for trial. He appears to have pleaded guilty, however, after the first trial was adjourned, but that adjournment was not of his instigation. Even though late, at least so far as he is concerned, a trial was avoided. It was a four to six weeks trial. There is a significant utilitarian value in pleading guilty. He should not get a full discount at the top of the range, but in my view a discount of about 10% is appropriate in the circumstances.
	
	
	I accept that the offender is genuinely remorseful and contrite for having committed this offence. He has given evidence under oath on sentence and has said so. I accept that he is genuine. I also accept the evidence of his father which I found very useful. The offender’s father would appear to understand his son well and I accept from his evidence too that his son has expressed his remorse and contrition.
	
	
	He spent some five months and 19 days in custody. He was bail refused from his arrest on 7 April 2014 and would appear to have received bail on 11 September 2014. He then spent a few days bail refused in January 2015. Altogether, that amounts to five months and 19 days in custody. His present term should commence taking into account that pre-sentence custody.
	
	
	The offender presents with a relatively strong subjective case. He is now 43 years of age. He does have some criminal record but he had never been to gaol before. His criminal record is for relatively minor offences, possessing prohibited drugs and driving offences. Some of the matters on his record in fact were without a conviction.
	
	
	He is part of a strong family originally from Lebanon. His parents came to Australia in 1955 before he was born. Both his parents are hardworking and apparently educated members of the community in Lebanon. They returned to live in Lebanon in 1965 and stayed there until 1984. The civil war in Lebanon broke out in 1975. They were relatively safe for a period of time. The offender’s mother was a school principal in the village in which they lived. However, the war escalated in their area in 1982. I accept that at that stage he was a 9 or 10 year old boy and that he witnessed horrific events, including seeing cars blown up in front of him when he was in company with his mother. He also witnessed a friend being killed in a bomb shelter that he was present in and also witnessed other war tragedies. The family came back to Australia in 1984 for a holiday, but ended staying and have lived here ever since.
	
	
	Until 2006 I accept that he lived a good life, doing ordinary things that people do in the community. He started some apprenticeships but did not finish. He always worked hard.
	
	
	There is a psychological report before the Court and a number of references which I have read and taken into account.
	
	
	He started to use cannabis in his early 20s but that did not present a particular problem to him. I accept, more probably than not, that that was in order to deal with nightmares he was suffering, which themselves would appear to be connected with his war experiences in Lebanon as a child. They amounted to some form of self-medication.
	
	
	He married and he has three children, although he is now divorced. After the birth of his first child he stopped using drugs. But in 2006 his wife’s brother, his brother-in-law, died traumatically as a result of an epileptic fit. He attempted to resuscitate him and it appears that he thought that was successful but his brother-in-law suffered, it would appear, permanent brain damage as a result of the fit and eventually his life support system was turned off. He blames himself for not successfully resuscitating him. Whether or not that is valid is hard to know, but nonetheless he blames himself for that.
	
	
	From that time it would appear his life started to unravel. He started to use drugs significantly, having been offered methamphetamine by a family friend. He then started to use larger and larger quantities and was using about 2 grams a day at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	His criminal history would indicate that his drug use started at around 2006 at the time of his brother-in-law’s death, therefore supporting this history given.
	
	
	I accept the psychologist’s opinion that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as moderate to severe amphetamine use disorder. The post-traumatic stress disorder I accept is partly related to his experiences in Lebanon but also that is overlaid by the experience of his brother-in-law’s death. To that extent, that particular mental illness reduces to some extent, although not significantly, the extent to which general deterrence plays a part in his sentence. It also affects an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I accept that when he was in custody he realised the seriousness of his behaviour and the extent to which his life had spiralled out of control. He has not used drugs since his arrest. Since being released on bail he has lived with his father. I accept from his father’s evidence that he has not used drugs and is attempting to lead a normal life, although it would appear that as yet he has not undertaken any treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder or substance abuse.
	
	
	There is a plan suggested by the psychologist involving cognitive behavioural therapy for his post‑traumatic stress disorder and drug counselling on his release from custody. I accept that he is prepared to undertake that and will undertake that. Hopefully, he will also be offered some drug counselling or rehabilitation programs whilst in custody.
	
	
	I accept that his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. They are, of course, entirely connected with his ability to stay free of the use of illegal drugs and that will depend also on receiving treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder, because the two are connected. He will need a longer than normal period of supervision in the community to deal with that when he is released to parole.
	
	
	He has found it difficult to find work since being released on bail because of the notoriety of his arrest for these offences, but I accept he is a man who is prepared to work and will find work on his ultimate release to parole.
	
	
	He continues to have the support his father and family members including his ex-wife who is present in court to support him. He has an ongoing relationship with his children. All of these factors increase his prospects of rehabilitation. Unfortunately, none of his family recognised the extent of his drug use at the time he committed these offences but they do now and I accept that their ongoing support will increase his chances of successful rehabilitation.
	
	
	Further, he is not a young offender and having come to the Court effectively for the first time and being charged with any serious offence increases his chances that this will be a one off episode, as long as he takes advantage of counselling and treatment when he is released.
	
	
	I then turn to the relevant sentence. I have come to the conclusion that, without the plea of guilty, the first offence of manufacturing methylamphetamine ought to have given rise to an overall term of imprisonment of 3 years. That takes into account the Form 1 offences as well.
	
	
	I will be reducing that by three months to take effect of the relatively small discount for a late plea of guilty. That would be an overall term of two years and nine months. I will set a non-parole period of 18 months which will allow a parole period of 15 months with supervision for treatment and counselling. I will backdate that sentence to 19 January 2016 which I understand is five months and 19 days before today.
	
	
	The second count as I have said, in my view would, if sentenced alone in these circumstances, not give rise to a full term of imprisonment at all but there is no alternative option in this case and so I am simply sentencing by way of a 6 month fixed term of imprisonment, which I will order to be served concurrently with the other offence.
	
	
	Each of the s 166 offences I would deal with by way of conviction but 10A disposition. Those matters, in my view, ought not have been sent to this Court. They are summary matters which at best are backup offences or, alternatively, amount to offences which are evidence to prove his involvement in the manufacture, viz the instructions for manufacturing methylamphetamine or, the offences of organising or conducting drug premises are an integral part of the manufacturing offences before the Court. They ought not be taking up the time of this Court. They ought to have been withdrawn and dismissed in the Local Court but, nonetheless I am obliged to deal with them because they have been sent to this Court as part, apparently, of the negotiation process between the Crown and those appearing for the accused.
	
	
	For those reasons I make the following formal orders:
	
	
	COUNT 1 in the indictment, the manufacture prohibited drug charge, the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 19 January 2016 and expiring 18 July 2017 with parole thereafter of 15 months commencing 19 July 2017 and expiring 18 October 20, giving rise to an overall term of imprisonment of two years and nine months commencing 19 January 2016, expiring 18 October 2018. I direct that he be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period on the following condition, supervision from Probation and Parole with drug counselling and psychological/psychiatric treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
	
	
	I note I have taken into account the Form 1 offences when sentencing for this matter.
	
	
	COUNT 2 Convicted of count 2, supply methylamphetamine. Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing 19 January 2016, expiring 18 July 2016.
	
	
	RE 166 OFFENCES: Sequences 2, 3, 5 and 6. Convicted pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No further order.

2770934,R v Chambour; R v Khallouf (No 3) [2016] NSWDC 262,"ruling under s 67 regarding christopher pattison


	
	HIS HONOUR: There are currently before me four applications under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995. The application is to adduce firsthand hearsay from witnesses who are alleged to be not available. The first allegedly unavailable witness is Mr Christopher James Pattison. The second allegedly unavailable witness is Mr Isaac Parry. The third allegedly unavailable witness is Mr Durrant Brown, and the fourth allegedly unavailable witness is Mr Thomas Crossling. From my first evidentiary ruling it ought be clear that the four witnesses were part of the first group of people which interacted with the second group of people at the Opera Bar and the car park of the Sydney Opera House in the early hours of Sunday, 8 September 2013.
	
	
	The Crown has attempted to serve each of the four gentlemen in question with a subpoena to give evidence. An issue arose in argument yesterday about the adequacy and propriety of the documents which the Crown has sought to serve upon each of the four “missing” witnesses. The argument concerning the form of the subpoena has taken some considerable time. The subpoenas in question were issued by an officer of the DPP. The form of the subpoena is an historic one, but its exact providence has not been ascertained by me or indeed by any of the parties before me. I have attached a copy of the subpoena issued in relation to Chris Pattison, which forms part of exhibit W10, to these reasons: (Subpoena Chris Pattison 190916 (18.8 KB, pdf)). That form is one that I dealt with on 26 September 2016.
	
	
	Mr Vasic, who appears for the accused George Chambour, initially raised an objection to this subpoena on the basis that it did not contain the witness’s address. He submitted that the document ought contain the witness’s address as the address was required by the “prescribed form”. He submitted that the prescribed form was Form 74AC of the forms issued under the Supreme Court Rules. That gave rise to a submission that the Supreme Court Rules were applicable to criminal litigation in this Court. The argument was this. Schedule 3 the Supreme Court Act 1970 is headed, “Criminal Proceedings”. It contains paragraphs numbered between (a) and (i). Paragraphs numbered (a1) and (a2) are these:
	


“(a1)

proceedings (Including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment (“indictment”) including any information presented or filed as provided by law for the prosecution of offenders in the Court or in the District Court,

(a2)

proceedings (whether in the Court or the District Court) under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986,”.

Part 75 of the Supreme Court Rules is headed, “CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS”. It is divided into two Divisions. The Division 1 is headed “General” and Division 2 is headed “Summary jurisdiction”. The relevant rules are these:

“1 Application

Subject to section 17 of the Act and except as provided in this Part, the rules do not apply to any of the proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule to the Act.

1A Criminal Appeal Rules

The Criminal Appeal Rules remain in force.

2 Rules Applicable

The following provisions of these rules apply, so far as applicable, to proceedings specified in the Third Schedule to the Act (except clause (d) of that Schedule) and to proceedings to which Division 2 applies:

(a) Part 1 (preliminary matters), other than Part 1 rule 11(3),

(b) Part 1A (sittings and vacations),

(c) Part 2 (time),

(d) Part 55 (procedure for punishment for contempt),

(e) Part 61 rules 1(4), (5) and (6), 2 and 3 (registrars),

(f) Schedule F, forms 74AA, 74AB, 74AC and 74AD (subpoenas),

(g) clause 1 or the matter relating to the Jury Act 1977 in Schedule J.”

Part 75 3 makes provision for the applicability of certain of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules to criminal proceedings. Rule 3AA provides that the forms approved by the Uniform Rules Committee are not to be used in criminal proceedings. The rest of the rules in Division 1 are not relevant to the current application. Mr Vasic submitted that because of the provisions of the Third Schedule these Supreme Court Rules are applicable to the proceedings in this Court. I cannot accede to that submission.


	
	The Third Schedule to the Supreme Court Act 1970 as originally enacted was headed “Excluded Criminal Proceedings”. The current heading is “Criminal Proceedings”, but when the change was made has not been ascertained and is currently irrelevant. The current par (a) is the original par (a) and was immediately succeeded by the current par (b) which refers to gaol delivery. The Third Schedule has been amended from time-to-time. However, it is important to realise how the Third Schedule came to be enacted. Section 17 of the Supreme Court Act in its current form is this:
	


“(1) Except as provided in this section this Act and the rules do not apply to any of the proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule, and no claim for relief lies to the Court against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a1) or (a2) of that Schedule.

(2) Rules may be made under this Act:

(a) for regulating and prescribing the practice and procedure of the Court, and

(b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), for:

(i) providing for the regulation of the sittings and order of business of the Court and the regulation of the vacations and holidays to be observed by the Court and in the offices of the Court, and

(ii) prescribing the duties and functions of the Prothonotary and other officers of the Court and the records to be kept by them,

in relation to any of the proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule.

(2A) The provisions of this Act, including Part 9 (subsections (1) and (4) of section 124 excepted), apply in relation to rules made pursuant to subsection (2) as they apply in relation to other rules.

(3) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 41, 53, 54, 55, 72, 101 (5) and 130.”

It is clear that s 17 has been amended over the years since its enactment, but it is clear that, as originally enacted, it was to exclude from the operation of the Supreme Court Act, and the rules made under the Supreme Court Act, criminal proceedings. Section 17(2) then goes on to provide a special rule-making power for criminal proceedings. When Pt 75 of the Supreme Court Rules was enacted, there was no reference in the Third Schedule of the Supreme Court Act to the District Court at all, as I am about to seek to show. Therefore, when the Supreme Court Rules concerning criminal proceedings were enacted, and enacted they were by being a Schedule to the Supreme Court Act 1970 which could be amended by the Rules Committee of the Supreme Court, they dealt with criminal matters heard in the Supreme Court, and in the Supreme Court only.


	
	One will note that on any proper reading of s 17(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 that it permits the Supreme Court to make rules for regulating and prescribing the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court in respect of its criminal jurisdiction, but it does not give the Supreme Court Rules Committee power to make rules regarding the practice and procedure of this Court.
	
	
	The Third Schedule of the Supreme Court Act 1970 was amended by Act 250 of 1987 which received the Royal Assent on 16 December 1987 and came into force on 18 December 1987. That amended the original par (a) of the Third Schedule to read thus:
	


“Proceedings in the Court that are for, or that relate to proceedings in the District Court for the prosecution of offenders on indictment (“indictment” including any information presented or filed as provided by law for the prosecution of offenders) including the sentencing or otherwise dealing with persons convicted.”

The same Act also inserted a new paragraph (a1) which was in the following terms:

“proceedings in the Court –

   (i) under the provisions of s 51A of the Justices Act 1902; or

   (ii) relating to proceedings in the District Court under those    provisions:”

The short title of that Act was “Supreme Court (Appeals) Amendment Act 1987”. The long title of the Act was this:

“An Act to amend the Supreme Court Act 1970 to exclude an application to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the District Court where such an application or appeal would not lie on the same matter arising in the Supreme Court.”

The reason for the amendment is clear. It was to exclude appeals from this Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal. It did so by including criminal proceedings in this Court in the definition of excluded criminal proceedings contained in Sch 3.


	
	The Schedule was further amended by Act 20 of 1988. That amendment returned par (a) of the Third Schedule to its original form and omitted par (a1) and inserted two new paragraphs:
	


“(a1) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment (‘indictment’ including any information presented or filed as provided by law for the prosecution of offenders) in the Court or in the District Court;

(a2) proceedings (whether in the Court or the District Court) under section 51A of the Justices Act 1902.”

The Third Schedule was further amended by Act number 121 of 2001 when reference to s 51A of the Justices Act 1902 was replaced with a reference to Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.


	
	The purpose of Schedule 3 was to exclude certain proceedings from the general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and, in particular, the Court of Appeal and to set up a special regime for criminal proceedings, a special set of criminal procedure rules. Initially there was no reference in the Third Schedule to the District Court and hence it was a convenient means of referring to criminal proceedings by referring to matters in the Third Schedule. When the Third Schedule was amended to exclude certain criminal proceedings in this Court, the draftsmen neglected to modify Schedule 3, as used in SCR Part 75 to apply only proceedings in the Supreme Court, but one must read it down in such fashion because the Supreme Court does not have power under s 17(2) to prescribe the practice and procedure of this Court in its criminal jurisdiction. Therefore, by reason of the Supreme Court Rules Form 74AC, the form of subpoena to give evidence in criminal proceedings prescribed by the Supreme Court Rules, is not applicable in this Court.
	
	
	Mr Vasic, however, then argued that the District Court Act 1973 mandated the use of the same form. Section 171 of the District Court Act 1973 relates to criminal procedure rules and permits the Rule Committee of this Court to make rules regulating the practice and procedure of this Court in its criminal jurisdiction. Section 171 is lengthy and I shall not repeat it but it is clear that it was intended to give this Court a very wide rulemaking power. However the Act also includes s 171D. That section is this:
	


“Practice and procedure of Supreme Court to be followed unless other provision made.”

Subject to this Act and the rules, the procedure and practice of the District Court when exercising its criminal jurisdiction shall, as far as practicable, be the same as the procedure and practice of the Supreme Court when exercising similar jurisdiction.”

Section 171D was inserted by Act 170 of 1984 and came into force on 1 July 1985. It was perhaps enacted to fill any lacuna in the provisions of the Rules of this Court relating to criminal practice and procedure.


	
	I have had cause to consider the Rules of this Court as they were prior to the commencement of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 and the UCPR, Part 53 of the District Court Rules did not make any provision as to the form of subpoena to be used or any other relevant matter except that the issuing of subpoenas was governed by Pt 53 r 8 which was repealed in 2007. Since the passage of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, DCR Pt 53 r 18 to 25 were gazetted at the same time that the r 8 was repealed. Again, no form of subpoena has been prescribed by the rules or by any practice note issued by the Chief Judge. As far as I can ascertain no form of subpoena to give evidence has ever been prescribed under the District Court Act and Rules and hence one might think the origin of the “historic form” which I set out at the commencement of these reasons.
	
	
	However, Mr Vasic’s point is that because of s 171D it is appropriate, in fact, mandatory that the form prescribed under the Supreme Court Rules be used in the District Court. With that submission I cannot agree. A general provision that subject to the District Court Act 1973 and any rules made under s 171 of that Act the practice and procedure of the District Court when exercising its criminal jurisdiction should be the same as the procedure and practice of the Supreme Court does not mean that the forms prescribed in the Supreme Court must be used in this Court. Section 171D contains the words “so far as practicable”, thereby indicating that the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court ought be followed where it can practicably be done. A direction to follow the practice and the procedure of the Supreme Court is not, in my view, a mandatory direction that the same forms used in the Supreme Court be used in this Court. The real question, if there be a question, is whether the form used is adequate to convey the same direction the addressee of the subpoena as the form that is currently prescribed by the Supreme Court.
	
	
	Clearly the form of subpoena used by the DPP invokes the jurisdiction of this Court, although it has been many, many years since the Criminal Jurisdiction of this Court was called the “Criminal and Special Jurisdiction” of the Court. The document is headed “Subpoena to give evidence” and most lay men and women in Australia have heard of the word “subpoena”. The form of subpoena “requires” the addressee to attend court for the purpose of giving evidence. The word “requires” was long used in subpoenas to give evidence. It specifies when and where the witness must attend court and requires him to attend court each day until either excused or to the completion of the matter, and importantly tells the addressee that if he does not comply with the subpoena is liable to be arrested. The only differences between the form used by the DPP and Form 74 AC under the Supreme Court Rules is the notation that if the subpoena is issued “at the request” of a solicitor for the DPP the subpoena should be endorsed: “If you wish to be paid the expenses allowable in respect of your attendance, you must produce the certificate endorsed duly completed”. It can be found from many sources that in criminal proceedings the Crown is not required to pay conduct money. The Crown may be liable to pay witnesses’ expenses, but witnesses’ expenses are payable after they are incurred, whereas conduct money must be paid in advance. The other notation that the form used by the DPP does not contain is that being excused from compliance with one subpoena does not excuse the addressee from complying with another subpoena, but there is no suggestion in the current matter that any witness has been served with a subpoena by any other party and logic dictates that strictly such is not necessary, although it might be very prudent to endorse such a notation.
	
	
	The other differences between the form used by the DPP and form 74AC are the advice that the addressee does not need to comply with the subpoena if the party who requested it has excused the addressee from compliance, and the advice that the addressee may be advised in writing or orally that he can attend Court at a time later than that specified in the subpoena. These endorsements may make compliance of the subpoena less onerous but they do not affect the validity of the subpoena. They modify the strictness of compliance with the subpoena but do not, in my view, affect the validity of the subpoena itself.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor drew my attention to s 171(5) of the District Court Act, 1973. I have already stated that s 171 gives the Rules Committee of this Court, an extensive rule-making power in respect of criminal proceedings. Subsection (5) is in these terms:
	


“(5) Despite any other provision of this Act, the provisions of Part 3 of the Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and any rules under that Part apply to proceedings in the Court in its criminal jurisdiction.

The relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 are those between s 220 and 232. Section 171(5) came into force on 29 November 2006. The important point to note is that s 222(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides:

“If the prosecutor in proceedings is a public officer or a police officer, the officer may, subject to and in accordance with the rules, issue any such subpoena. The subpoena is to be filed and served in accordance with the rules.”

In other words, the DPP, as a public officer, is entitled to issue subpoenas which otherwise would be issued by the Registrar of the Court. There is a provision in the Rules concerning filing of a subpoena. However, that rule does not actually require filing. In Pt 53 r 19 is this:

“A party that issues a subpoena must, if required to do so by the Court, make a copy available for filing on the return date of the subpoena.”

I am unaware of any general direction or indeed any practice applicable in this Court requiring the DPP to file copies of subpoenas. However, it would appear to me that, in a particular case, the Court might do so if there were any dispute about, for example, the issuing of a subpoena or the form of a subpoena.


	
	As pointed out by the learned Crown Prosecutor, s 224 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in essence does not require the issue of conduct money with a subpoena issued by a prosecutor and s 227 permits a subpoena to be set aside by the addressee of the subpoena. That provision was pointed to by the learned Crown Prosecutor because Mr Vasic’s client, Mr Chambour, was not the addressee of the subpoena in question. Before the learned Crown Prosecutor drew that to my attention I had already pointed out that the only person who could move to set aside a subpoena is the person to whom the subpoena is addressed. However, Mr Vasic is quite entitled to point to any irregularity and to argue that the Court must take that into account in deciding whether there has been, that which is very important in the current proceedings, proof of the unavailability of the alleged “missing” witnesses.
	
	
	Part 2 of the Dictionary attached to the Evidence Act states this about the “Unavailability of persons”.
	


“(1)   For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:

   (a) the person is dead, or

(b) the person is, for any reason other than the application of s 16 (Competence and vompellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence, or

(c) the person is mentally or physically unable to give the evidence and it is not reasonably practicable to overcome that inability, or

(d) it would be unlawful for the person to give the evidence, or

(e) a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given, or

(f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or secure his or her attendance, but without success, or

(g) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success.

(2) In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact.”

I turn then to the evidence concerning each of the allegedly missing witnesses. The first allegedly missing witness is Mr Christopher james Pattison.


	
	Exhibit W11 establishes the residential address of Mr Pattison at a home unit in a specified street in a Sydney suburb which I will identify merely as PH. That has been the residential address of Mr Pattison since 23 August 2016 according to the records of Roads and Maritime Services. For that organ of government to record that as being his residential address that address must have been communicated to the RMS by Mr Pattison. Exhibit W10 is an affidavit of a police officer, Cons. Housam Khatib, who affirmed that he personally served a true copy of a subpoena upon Mr Pattison at that address. The subpoena has been dated 19 September 2016 by the issuer and was returnable on Wednesday 28 September 2016. Mr Pattison was called outside the Court but did not appear. The affidavit was affirmed on 20 September 2016 and one could infer, therefore, that the subpoena was served by Cons. Khatib on 20 September 2016. Unfortunately Cons. Khatib is not available as he has gone on six weeks’ leave. There is some doubt however as to whether, despite what the affidavit says, Cons Khatib personally served Mr Pattison, or merely left it in Mr Pattison’s letterbox.
	
	
	Exhibit W12 is a New South Wales electoral roll enquiry concerning Mr Christopher Pattison. That gives as his address a former address that he had prior to 23 August 2016, and that can be shown on the unredacted copy of exhibit W11. However, it means that it is talking about the same person. Exhibit W13 are enquiries made of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. They show that Mr Pattison has been, since 12 August 2016, in Sydney, and the immigration records further tell me that, as at 29 September 2016, he was still “onshore”, meaning that he had not departed from Australia.
	
	
	At the request of the prosecutor I issued a subpoena to give evidence in the “historic form”, signed it, and placed on it the seal of this Court, and an attempt was made to serve the subpoena on Mr Pattison on the evening of 26 September 2016, when, I am told, that attempt was unsuccessful. I was told by the learned Crown Prosecutor that there was no one at home when the subpoena sealed on 26 September 2016 was sought to be served on Mr Pattison at his residential address.
	
	
	There is some further information concerning Mr Pattison that is important. The officer in charge of the current prosecution is Detective Senior Constable Sarah Thomsen. Her statement of 15 September 2016, part of exhibit W5, says this:
	


“On Monday 6 September 2016 I obtained Pattison’s contact phone number. At midday on Tuesday 7 September 2016 I contacted Pattison on a telephone. He informed he had no intention of intending court and assisting police. He said ‘I don’t want to bring up stuff from the past.’ Later that day I received a subpoena from Sam Flint to be served on Christopher Pattison.

On Wednesday 8 September 2016 I conducted an RMS check on Christopher Pattison. I obtained his most recent address. I created a General Station Pad message and sent it through to Bankstown police station along with a copy of the subpoena. I requested that it be served on Pattison.

We received notification that police attended the location on 10 September and we were informed Pattison was in Queensland and he would not be returning until the evening of Sunday 11 September. Police were allocated to attend his address on Monday 12 September but were unsuccessful.

I attended his location at 10.20am on Wednesday 14 September 2016. A male by the name of Jamie answered the door and told me that Pattison was at work. He did not disclose where his workplace was. I left a business card and requested Jamie to tell Pattison to contact me as a matter of urgency.

To date [15 September 2016] Christopher Pattison has not made contact.”

Exhibit W5 contains a further statement from Detective Senior Constable Thomsen which contains this matter:

“[7] On Tuesday 20 September 2016 I contacted Senior Constable Stone at Bankstown police station. I requested that he [have] a car crew attend the address of Christopher at [PH]. I informed him that we had conducted an electoral roll check and a RMS check to confirm his address and that the subpoena could be placed in his letterbox. On the morning on Wednesday 21 September 2016 I received a signed Affidavit of Service from Constable Katib informing me that he had served that subpoena.”

The last paragraph is important because it indicates that, although the affidavit of service of Constable Katib suggests personal service, it may well be that the subpoena was merely left in Christopher Pattison’s letterbox. The other important thing to note is that it is clear from the telephone discussion recited Detective Senior Constable Thomsen that Christopher Pattison knew that the police were seeking to have him attend Court.


	
	It is unfortunate that Detective Senior Constable Thomsen did not leave the subpoena with ‘Jamie’ who appeared to be living at the same address as Pattison at 14 September 2016. Further, and unfortunately, the District Court Rules Pt 53 r 20 does not permit service of a natural person by leaving the subpoena at the person’s residence with a person who appears to be a resident of that same place and appears to be over the age of 16 years.
	
	
	A problem with the subpoena that has been left by the police in Christopher Pattison’s letterbox is that it is arguable that that does not comply with Pt 53, r 20, (2)(e). Part 53, r 20(1) provides that a subpoena ‘must’ be served on the person named, that is the addressee, in accordance with that rule. Subrule (2) describes modes of service but uses the word ‘may’ which suggests permission rather than necessity, i.e. the word ‘may’ usually indicates a permissive way of doing things, not a mandatory way of doing things. The distinction between ‘must’ in subrule (1) and ‘may’ in subrule (2) is, in my view, remarkable. Paragraph (e) of subrule (2) is this:
	


“If the person is not a police officer or a public officer, by sending it by post or facsimile to the person’s residential address.”

The question is, does a police officer leaving an item in a postbox amount to sending it by post? The usual mode of sending a document by post is by putting it in a pre-paid and addressed envelope, with the requisite stamps and putting it in a postbox, in the pious expectation that it will be delivered to the addressee. An affidavit of service would then attest to the posting of the subpoena and not to its actually being placed in the letterbox of the addressee. The rules are our servants, not our masters. A police officer who can attest to placing a subpoena in a letterbox is a better form of proof of service than merely proving the posting of a document in the normal course of post. Accordingly, I hold that the placing of a subpoena in an addressee’s postal box by a member of the police force is the equivalent of sending it by post to the addressee in the normal course of post. If service by post is good service, which it is under Pt 53, r 20 (2)(e), than what was done to serve Christopher Pattison was, in my view, good service.


	
	The question then becomes, as far as Mr Christopher Pattison is concerned, whether all reasonable steps have been taken by the Crown to find him or secure his attendance, but without success. I know he is in Australia, I know he is resident in a suburb of Sydney. I know he works locally. What has the Crown done to secure his attendance? The Crown has left a subpoena in his postbox and he has not obeyed it. The Crown has not asked me to issue a warrant for his arrest.
	
	
	In my view this is not a question of unavailability within (1) (f) of the definition of “Unavailability of persons” contained in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act but this is a question of unavailability within par (g) of the same provision. The question is whether all reasonable steps have been taken by the Crown to compel him to give evidence but without success. The Crown has not asked me to issue a warrant for his arrest and no-one has sought to serve any warrant on him. Accordingly I cannot be satisfied that Mr Christopher Pattison is unavailable and the application under s 67 is accordingly refused.
	


[FURTHER APPLICATION AND SUBMISSIONS]


	
	HIS HONOUR: For those same reasons I order that a warrant issue for the arrest of Christopher James Pattison requiring his attendance before this Court to give evidence. I order that the warrant not be served prior to 6.00 am on Tuesday 4 October 2016. That warrant issues under s 194(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995.

2770935,R v Chambour; R v Khallouf (No 4) [2016] NSWDC 263,"ruling under section 67 regarding isaac parry


	
	HIS HONOUR: Prior to adjourning yesterday afternoon I made a ruling concerning the Crown’s application under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995 concerning evidence that might be given by Mr Christopher James Pattison. I refused the Crown’s application, but at the Crown’s request, issued a warrant for the arrest of Christopher James Pattison.
	
	
	This morning I had intended to make rulings in respect of three other “missing” witnesses, about whom the Crown also made applications under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995. However, an exhibit tendered this morning, exhibit W25, tells me that Mr Christopher James Pattison is now “off shore”, that is, beyond the seas, and that witnesses Durrant Brown and Thomas James Crossling are also “off shore” meaning beyond the seas, outside the Commonwealth of Australia. However, it is not known at the current time for how long it is anticipated the witnesses who are now “off shore” might remain so.
	
	
	The Crown is seeking to obtain such evidence and hopes to put it before me next Tuesday morning, after the coming long weekend. However it is still open to me to make a ruling about the Crown’s application under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995 in respect of Mr Isaac Parry who is, according to exhibit W25, “on shore”.
	
	
	Exhibit W5 contains two statements of Detective Senior Constable Sarah Thomsen. In the first of those statements, that of 15 September 2016, the Detective Senior Constable said this about Isaac Parry:
	


“On Saturday 6 August, I contacted Isaac Parry on the number that he provided to police when giving his statement on 11 September 2013. The number has since been disconnected. I checked the computerised operation policing system (COPS) and obtained his most recent address, being the same address as Thomas Crossling and Durrant Brown.

On the morning of Sunday 28 August 2016 Detective Senior Constable Alex Moffat attended the last known address of Isaac Parry. There were no persons home.

On Thursday 1 September 2016, the subpoena and statement were emailed to Senior Constable Larissa Felgate at Sutherland Police Station and a request was made to serve the subpoena. The following week I received in the internal post a service document from Senior Constable Felgate informing me that she had served the subpoena and statement on Parry via post to the known address, this notice was dated 01/09/2016.

On 13 September 2016, I conducted an RMS check on the address of Isaac Parry. I found that with the RMS, he had a new registered address. Also, on the same day, I submitted a request through the OIA for the registered voting address of Isaac Parry with the NSW Electoral Roll.

At 12.15pm on Wednesday 14 September 2016, I attended the address of Isaac Parry. It was a secure building and I rang the buzzer for his unit twice. No person answered the buzzer.

At 1.30pm on the same day I received a response from the OIA. The NSW Electoral Roll registered address for Isaac matched the address I had attended earlier in the day.

To date, Isaac Parry has not made contact with me.”

I should point out that I interpret the first paragraph of that part of the Detective Senior Constable’s statement as meaning that she attempted to contact Isaac Parry on a telephone number which had been disconnected.


	
	This statement merely states that only one attempt had been made to contact Mr Parry at his current residential address, but that was in the middle of a working day when one would not expect most people to be at home.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Thomsen’s second statement, which is also part of exhibit W5, is dated 21 September 2016. About Mr Isaac Parry it says this:
	


“On Tuesday 20 September 2016, I contacted Detective Sergeant Langthorne at Surry Hills Police Station and requested that he serve the subpoena for Isaac by placing it in his letter box. I informed him that I had conducted the electoral roll check and an RMS check to confirm the address as [a specified home unit at a specified street address in a specified street in a Sydney suburb which I will refer to merely as WL]. Later the same day I received an email from Detective Sergeant Langthorne informing me that the subpoena had been served. He attached the affidavit of service to the email.”

Exhibit W20 is a notice of the attempt to serve Mr Parry at his previous address, that is the same address as Thomas Crossling and Durrant Brown, that subpoena having been issued on 26 July 2016 on behalf of the prosecutor and returnable on Monday 19 September 2016. It is essentially irrelevant but does prove some attempt by the Crown to obtain the attendance of Mr Parry at Court. Exhibit W23 is the result of the RMS inquiry made by Detective Senior Constable Thomsen. That shows that the address of Isaac Parry has been since 5 August 2014 in the place in WL to which I have earlier referred. Prior to that time his address was the same as that of Thomas Crossling and Durrant Brown. Exhibit W24 is the electoral roll inquiry which gives the address of Mr Parry the same as being that in WL to which I have earlier referred.


	
	Exhibit 21 is an affidavit of a member of the police force, Winston Knight Langthorne, which annexures a subpoena to give evidence issued by the prosecutor on 19 September 2016 returnable on Wednesday 28 September 2016. The affidavit attests to personal service of Mr Parry on 20 September 2016. However exhibit W22 is a further affidavit of Winston Knight Langthorne in essence telling me that service effected on 20 September 2016 was not personal service but in fact it was service by placing the subpoena in the letterbox of Mr Parry at the address in WL. I accept, therefore, that on the 20 September 2016 police placed in Mr Parry’s post box at his current residential address a subpoena returnable on the 28 September 2016. When Mr Parry was called three times outside the court on that day there is no appearance by him.
	
	
	Yesterday in relation to Christopher James Pattison I pointed out that the service effected in the present matter by Constable Langthorne was as good as and better than proving service by placing the subpoena in the ordinary course of the post. I accept that the Crown has drawn the attention of Mr Parry to the requirement to attend court, and that requirement ought to have been satisfied by him last Wednesday.
	
	
	Again the issue before me at the current time is not to seek to enforce the subpoena but to establish that he is unavailable. The Crown seeks to prove that Mr Parry is not available to give evidence because all reasonable steps have been taken by the Crown to find him or to secure his attendance at court but without success. I accept that Mr Parry has been “found” however I do not accept that the Crown has taken all reasonable steps to secure his attendance. The Crown has not sought to enforce the subpoena. Again, as I held when discussing Mr Christopher James Pattison this appears not to be a case within clause (1)(f) the definition of “Unavailability of persons” contained in Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act but rather a case which appears in my view to fall within par (g) “all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success. The Crown not having sought the issue of a warrant for the arrest of the witness, I cannot find that the Crown has taken all reasonable steps as required by par (g) of the definition. For those reasons the application under s 67 is at this time refused.
	
	
	I should at this stage address one issue that was raised by Mr Vasic on behalf of the accused, George Chambour. That objection was that the prescribed Form 74AC, a Supreme Court form applicable to proceedings in the Supreme Court requires the giving of the address of the addressee of the subpoena, but the subpoenas in the current matter are all “defective” because they give as the address of each of the witnesses whom it has been sought to serve with the subpoena the following matter by way of address: “C/- OIC Det S Thomsen, City Central Police Station, 192 Day Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000”. In other words the only address given for each of the addressees of the subpoenas is care of the officer-in-charge of the police case.
	
	
	No form or rule to which I have been taken requires the provision of a residential address nor the provision of a business address or the provision of the usual place of work of the addressee. It is also trite that a subpoena can be served upon a person at any time or any place, saving, of course, the prohibition of serving process in the precincts of the Court, and as I understand the prohibition of serving process on a Sunday has now been repealed. It appears to me that the purpose of an address is to identify the addressee, not to tie the addressee down to an address at which he is to be served. Besides having the practical effect of identifying the addressee of the subpoena the address on the subpoena has the practical effect of directing the process server, whoever that might be, to where it is thought the person addressed in the subpoena might be found. That is entirely pragmatic. That pragmatism is resolved when the address of the person to be served is known to the police and the police intend to serve that person. In modern times we have become very protective of the personal information of members of the public, very protective of their privacy. Necessary court process is a public document and the disclosure of the address of some witnesses, particularly in criminal proceedings, is often thought to be oppressive, having the potential to cause harm to the addressee if his or her usual place of residence became known to others.
	
	
	In the circumstances I reject the submission that the subpoena is defective because it is addressed to the addressee care of the officer-in-charge in the NSW Police. I would also add the observation that insofar as an address is sought to identify the addressee of the subpoena, another way of identifying the addressee would be to specify his or her date of birth, but that would come afoul of the same concerns of our community concerning the privacy of individuals and the unfortunate crime of “identity theft”. However as I said I am not persuaded that the subpoena is defective merely because the address of the addressee of the subpoena is care of the officer-in-charge.
	
	
	Now Madam Crown do you have another application?
	
	
	CROWN PROSECUTOR: I do your Honour. I ask that your Honour consider issuing a warrant pursuant to 194(1)(b) in relation to--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any objection? Neither the ruling?
	
	
	RAHME: No your Honour, no objection.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No objection from Mr Chambour nor from Mr Khallouf?
	


[Further submissions]


	
	HIS HONOUR: Pursuant to s 194(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 I direct that a warrant issue for the arrest of Isaac Parry at the residential and mailing address shown on exhibit W23. Such warrant not to be executed before 6am on Tuesday 4 October?
	
	
	ADJOURNED PART HEARD TO TUESDAY 4 OCTOBER 2016

	The defendants in three separate defamation proceedings relating to publications made on 21 July 2015 challenge the form and capacity of the imputations pleaded to arise from each of the matters complained of.
	
	
	I have attached the matters complained of published by the defendants as annexures to this judgment.
	


The DailyMail.com Australia Pty Ltd publication


	
	The imputations pleaded (at paragraph 3 of the statement of claim) are as follows:
	



	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the defendant.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the public.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of his mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the defendant.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of his mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the public.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a joke.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person because he wears a controversial haircut.
	



	
	The defendant’s objections, as noted in correspondence and oral submissions, were as follows:
	



	
	Imputations (i) and (ii) and (vii) are not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Imputations (i) – (iv), (v) and (vi) are ambiguous and do not differ in substance, and should be struck out.
	


The Nationwide News Pty Ltd publications (hereafter referred to as the Daily Telegraph publications)


	
	The imputations pleaded (in paragraph 4 of the statement of claim) in relation to the 21 July 2015 website publication are as follows:
	



	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the defendant.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the public.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of his mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the defendant.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of his mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the public.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a joke.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person.
	
	
	The plaintiff is hideously ugly.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person because he wears a silly haircut.
	



	
	The second matter complained of (paragraph 7 of the statement of claim), which is contained in the printed version of the Daily Telegraph, pleads the same imputations save for (viii), where the words “shameful haircut” appear:
	



	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the defendant.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the public.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of his mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the defendant.
	
	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of his mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the public.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a joke.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person.
	
	
	The plaintiff is hideously ugly.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person because he wears a shameful haircut.
	



	
	The defendant’s objections in correspondence and oral submissions were:
	



	
	Imputations (i), (ii), (v) and (vii) in each publication are not reasonably capable of being conveyed. (The defendant’s solicitor’s letter refers to imputation (v) and not to (vii), but this is not how the argument progressed before me). Although not stated in the correspondence, the submission as to the first matter complained of implied that no imputations were reasonably capable of being conveyed and, if accepted, would mean that no imputations (including (viii)) were capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Imputations (i) – (iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii) (“the ridicule imputations”) do not differ in substance.
	
	
	Additionally, imputation 4(v) does not differ in substance from the ridicule imputations.
	
	
	Imputations 4(ii) and (iv) are ambiguous in that it is unclear what is meant by “the public”: Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Alex [2014] NSWCA 273. Furthermore, it is clear from the fact that the defendant has picked up and republished the social media posts that the defendant is in fact part of the public.
	
	
	Imputation 4(vi) is ambiguous and rhetorical.

	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person because he wears a ridiculous haircut.
	



	
	In relation to the third matter complained of, which is a Facebook publication on KIIS 1065’s Facebook page, the imputations pleaded (at paragraph 12 of the statement of claim) are as follows:
	



	
	That the plaintiff, by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle, has justifiably exposed himself to ridicule by the defendant.

	The plaintiff is a joke.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a ridiculous person because he wears a horrendous haircut.
	



	
	The defendant’s objections, which apply equally to all three publications (those imputations being identical save for a different word in imputation (vii) in the third publication) are:
	



	
	Imputations (i), (ii) and (vi) are not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Imputations (i) – (iv) are ambiguous and do not differ in substance from each other, and imputations (vii) and (viii) do not differ in substance.
	


The relevant principles of law


	
	As to the issue of capacity, the test to apply to the application brought by the defendants under r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) is set out in  Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [134]-[138]. The rulings on capacity are as a separate trial under this rule.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen submits that the test set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd is “a low bar”. Whether or not that is a correct statement of the law, the parties agree that imputations should not be struck out other than in the plainest and most obvious of cases: Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335; New South Wales v Williams [2014] NSWCA 177; Abou-Lokmeh v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2016] NSWCA 228; Cornwell v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2016] NSWCA 255 at [41]-[45].
	
	
	As to the challenges to form, the requirement is that the imputation must specify the act or condition allegedly attributed to the plaintiff by the matter complained of with sufficient clarity to enable the defendants to know the case they have to meet: Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135. In that regard, it is important to note the New South Wales Court of Appeal’s observations that, independently of issues of capacity, where the imputation does not differ in substance it should be struck out: Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Alex [2016] NSWCA 273.
	
	
	The principle objections to the form of the imputations are:
	



	
	Failure to differ in substance (UCPR r 14.30(3));
	
	
	Ambiguity: Fairfax Media Publications v Alex [2014] NSWCA 273 per McColl JA at [19]-[24], referring to Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425.
	



	
	There is sometimes an overlap between complaints of these kinds as to form. For example, in Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200, where the trial judge’s rejection of an imputation on the basis that it did not differ in substance was replaced, on appeal, by a finding of ambiguity.
	
	
	Where challenges are made to the form and/or capacity of imputations, the court invariably rules on each imputation separately. That is very difficult here, because the imputations are so close in meaning that a finding that an imputation is not reasonably capable of being conveyed and/or does not differ in substance from several others, where one or more other imputations has been struck out, may depend upon how other imputations are repleaded.
	
	
	Another problem is the repetitious nature of the imputations, which are set out in groups ((i) and (ii), (iii) and (iv), followed by two “ridicule” imputations and an alternative but similar imputation that the plaintiff “is a joke” and is “hideously ugly”). The high degree of similarity of the contents of the imputations is exacerbated by the number of imputations pleaded. This was further added to, during the argument, by generalised submissions as to whether a particular imputation arose. As set out below, I have been careful to look at each publication separately, as certain of the imputations arise in some publications but not others.
	


Imputations of ridicule


	
	The imputations pleaded in these proceedings follow patterns established by what are sometimes called “ridicule” cases (the traditional description of defamation being a publication which causes “hatred, ridicule or contempt”: J Dean, “Hatred, Ridicule or Contempt: A book of libel cases”, Pan Books, 1953). The imputations pleaded have borrowed the words used to convey imputation in the following cases:
	



	
	“Permitted” the taking of photographs: Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 443 (where the plaintiff gave an interview and one of the photographs appeared to show his penis).
	
	
	“Justifiable” exposure to ridicule and an imputation that “the plaintiff is a joke”: Hanson-Young v Bauer Media Ltd (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 2029 at [13]-[25]; Hanson-Young v Bauer Media Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1306 (where the plaintiff’s face was photoshopped on a naked model and derisive comments made about her political stance).
	
	
	“Hideously ugly”: Berkoff v Burchill [1996] 4 All ER 1008 (where the plaintiff was compared to Frankenstein).
	



	
	There are no special rules about the form of pleading of “ridicule” imputations. However, perhaps because they are often to be found in publications of an informal and humorous nature, they can be more difficult to distil and draft than imputations about a person’s actions or personal qualities. This may account for the pleader’s recycling of the successful imputations in the cases listed in paragraph 19 above.
	
	
	However, what amounts to a good imputation in one case does not mean that it is a good imputation in another. A good example can be seen from imputations (i) and (ii), that the plaintiff “permitted” such a photograph to be taken. An imputation concerning giving permission to be photographed was held to be reasonably capable of arising in Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 443 (at 449). However, the facts in that case were that the photograph asserted to have been taken with his consent appeared to show his penis. The sting of the libel lay in the nakedness shown in the photograph being published to the world, and this was why permitting it was reasonably capable of amounting to an imputation with a defamatory meaning.
	
	
	Similarly, in Kelly v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 586, a photograph of a partially naked man tied with bondage equipment to a piano in a public park during the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras was held to give rise to a defamatory meaning, again in relation to his permitting the taking of a photograph. There would have been many people who permitted their photograph to be taken during this function; it was the plaintiff’s nakedness and ludicrous position in a public place that rendered his granting of permission to be capable of giving rise to a defamatory meaning.
	
	
	In both those cases, the sting of the libel lay in being photographed in circumstances outside the normal, namely with disregard to the social taboos of nakedness and/or lack of dignity. In fact, even if the person photographed partially naked did not intentionally disrobe and/or permit the taking of the photograph, being photographed partially nude may be sufficient to be defamatory even where there was clearly no permission given. This was the case in McDonald v The North Queensland Newspaper Co Ltd [1997] Qd R 62, where a photograph of a footballer being tackled revealed his penis. There was no suggestion that he had permitted the photograph to be taken, as the sting of the libel was that his penis was showing.
	
	
	However, the plaintiff in these photographs was not photographed naked or looking in any way different to his normal appearance; the subject of comment is the way he has styled his hair (namely a hairstyle known as a “mullet”).The differences between decisions such as Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd and the matters complained of in these proceedings are considerable, and demonstrate the dangers of copying the words of imputations in one “ridicule” publication and asserting that they also arise in other “ridicule” publications.
	
	
	The same is the case with “hideous” ugliness and “justifiable” ridicule and an imputation that the plaintiff “is a joke”. Mr Berkoff pleaded he was “hideously ugly” because he was compared to Frankenstein. The fact that these imputations have succeeded in other publications where comments have been made about a person’s appearance does not mean that they are necessarily the correct imputations to plead in relation to the publications over which the plaintiff has brought these proceedings.
	
	
	While I propose to consider each publication separately, a preliminary issue with which I propose to deal is that the photograph originally published of the plaintiff is capable by itself (independently of the words in each of the matters complained of) of giving rise to imputations (i) and (ii) of each of the publications in which it appears.
	
	
	There is also the question of whether, in its original or cropped form (with the other dancers and/or the photographer’s studio logo omitted) and/or when published with other photographs and/or as published in the photoshopped pictures, it is capable of conveying these imputations independently of the words.
	


The photograph of the plaintiff dancing and imputations (i) and (ii)


	
	Mr Rasmussen submits that the ordinary reader would assume, from the pose of the plaintiff and his apparent smile, that he is deliberately posing for the camera and thus “permitting” himself to be photographed. He also relies on the inclusion in the photograph of a logo “jnoodles photography/Facebook”. These factors, he submits, convey that the plaintiff is posing for the photograph and accordingly imputations (i) and (ii) in relation to each of the matters complained of is reasonably capable of being conveyed on the photograph alone.
	
	
	I do not accept this submission. First, there is nothing in the photograph to demonstrate that the plaintiff is posing for a photograph. The plaintiff and his partner are shown in profile on a crowded dance floor, dancing; the person they are next to has her back to the camera and others on the dance floor are partially cut off. The plaintiff is not smiling or looking at the camera as Mr Rasmussen claims. The informal composition of the photograph does not in any way suggest some formal posing by either the plaintiff or the young lady he is dancing with.
	
	
	Second, the fact that the photograph was taken by a professional photographer could be a factor indicating that the plaintiff was permitting his photograph but, in the absence of words to this effect in the matter complained of, this alone would be insufficient. Ms Barnett submitted that readers would be aware that photographers at social functions such as weddings or birthday parties may take portrait photographs but would also take photographs of general scenes, such as dancers on the dance floor (as is the case here) without approaching all the persons in the photograph for permission to do so.
	
	
	Third, the photographs are not all the same. The photograph in the Daily Telegraph (Exhibit B) is cropped; it does not show the photographer’s logo or the other dancers. I was not addressed as to these differences and whether either of them meant that the plaintiff appeared to be posing for the photograph. This was one of several submissions which were made in relation to all the publications when in fact the photograph with the logo was not produced in all or even most of them.
	
	
	The photograph in the first matter complained of in The Edge (2016/211033) is not cropped, but the logo of the photographer appears to have been deleted. Again, no submissions were made about this difference.
	
	
	Nor was any submission made to the photoshopped pictures of the plaintiff used to create memes and Internet photographs. In the event submissions had been made, I would make the same findings.
	
	
	Even if the plaintiff did appear to be posing for the photograph of his face which was repeated so often over the Internet, just what is it that the plaintiff “permitted” the photographer to do by posing for his picture to be taken? Permission to publish was not an issue in Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd because the matter complained of made clear that the photographer was a person who had been allowed into the team’s locker room for the purpose of preparation of a book about football celebrities. Whether or not such “permission” was granted by the plaintiff in these proceedings to do more than take the photograph is not capable of being determined by the photograph alone.
	
	
	The plaintiff does appear to be posing for other photographs in the Daily Telegraph, with the accreditation being “from Facebook”. The plaintiff’s ponytail/mullet hairstyle cannot be seen in these photographs as they are taken of his face; all that can be seen is his shaved head. I was not addressed on what to make of this.
	
	
	I have been careful, in relation to each of the publications, not to have any regard to the contents of photographs in other publications. However, in relation to Mr Rasmussen’s submissions that any or all of these photographs in some way support the imputation that the plaintiff permitted the photograph (independently of the text of the matter complained of), this is not a submission that I accept.
	
	
	Having noted these findings in relation to the original and cropped photographs (which I set out here, rather than repeat in relation to each of imputations (i) and (ii) in the matters complained of where it appears), I now consider each of the three claims brought by the plaintiff.
	


The proceedings against DailyMail.com: 2016/210991


	
	There is only one claim made against the DailyMail.com. The imputations are similar to those pleaded in the other two claims, but there is no pleaded imputation that the plaintiff is “hideously ugly”.
	


Imputations 3(i) and 3(ii)


	
	The opening headline (see Annexure A) states “Photo of teenager at a party with ridiculous haircut is huge hit on line” and describes it in paragraph 3 as “a single photograph snapped at an 18th birthday party” which went viral “thanks to one of the subjects’ unusual haircuts”. The photographer told the DailyMail.com that “When I was walking around taking photos I didn’t really think anything of it” (paragraph 9). He posted it onto social media and told the “birthday boys” holding the party he was going out to dinner and, when he looked again an hour later, saw that the photograph had received 300 ‘likes’ (paragraph 10).
	
	
	The photographer is then quoted as saying that he was a full-time student but that photography was “more of a hobby than a career” which was “on the side” and “just a bit of pocket money”. His photography studio contact details are included in the photograph.
	
	
	Whether the photographer was paid to take photographs or not, there is nothing in the language of the matter complained of to give rise to an imputation that the plaintiff “permitted” himself to be photographed in circumstances where he accordingly “justifiably” exposed himself to ridicule. As noted above, I am not prepared to draw inferences from the photograph alone that the plaintiff permitted himself to be photographed.
	
	
	Imputations 3(i) and 3(ii) are premised upon the plaintiff having deliberately exposed himself to ridicule by posing for the photograph. Neither the pictures in the matter complained of nor the text are capable of giving rise to such a claim. The words of the matter complained of are in fact to the contrary.
	
	
	Ms Barnett also pointed out that the addition of the words “by the defendant” and “by the public” to each of these imputations was similarly misconceived, because there is nothing in the matter complained of capable of conveying that the plaintiff permitted the photograph to be taken in public circumstances. I also accept her submission that imputations 3(i) and 3(ii) do not differ in substance, in that the matter complained of makes it clear that the publisher (which is reporting the public comments) is effectively part of the public.
	
	
	Independently of these defects, these imputations are not reasonably capable of being conveyed and will be struck out.
	


The DailyMail.com imputations 3(iii) and 3(iv)


	
	These imputations are not the subject of a capacity argument. The objection is to their form. Ms Barnett referred to her instructing solicitor’s letter of 5 October 2016 and extended those submissions to argue that these imputations are ambiguous because of:
	



	
	The use of the word “justifiably” (but cf Hanson-Young v Bauer Media Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1306 at [48] and Hanson-Young v Bauer Media Ltd (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 2029 at [31]);
	
	
	The phrase “exposed himself to ridicule”, which is asserted to be a mere rhetorical flourish (again, see the authorities referred to in (a) above);
	
	
	The phrases “by the public” and “by the defendant”, which is a distinction without a difference; these imputations do not differ from one another.
	
	
	Imputations 3(vi) and 3(vii) similarly do not differ in substance.
	



	
	As to imputations 3(iii) and 3(iv), I consider the phrases “by the public” and “by the defendant” not to be capable of being conveyed in the absence of there being something in the matter complained of to the effect that the plaintiff was seeking to attract the attention of the defendant. I also consider that these imputations do not differ in substance.
	
	
	These imputations come much closer to the sting of the libel. The plaintiff is entitled to plead imputations of the same kind as those pleaded by Senator Hanson-Young, and to plead one as an act and the other as a condition. In their present form, however, these imputations are struck out with leave to replead.
	
	
	Imputations 3(vi) and 3(vii) are the condition to go with the act the pleader seeks to describe in 3(iii) and 3(iv). These imputations are almost identical. The main difference between them is that imputation 3(vi) is unhelpfully vaguer than 3(vii). I propose to strike these out for the same reasons as 3(v). As already indicated, I consider the phrases “by the public” and “by the defendant” not to be capable of being conveyed in the absence of there being something in the matter complained of to the effect that the plaintiff was seeking to attract the attention of the defendant.
	
	
	Imputation 3(vii) comes much closer to the sting of the libel. The plaintiff is entitled to plead imputations of the same kind as those pleaded by Senator Hanson-Young, and to plead one as an act and the other as a condition. Imputation 3(vii) is therefore reasonably capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	


The DailyMail.com imputation 3(v)


	
	The imputation “the plaintiff is a joke” is submitted not to differ in substance from imputations 3(iii) and 3(iv), although I note, from Mr Svilan’s letter of 5 October 2016, that no objection was taken to this imputation. Ms Barnett has dealt with this by relying upon the submissions made as to this imputation by Ms Mullins, the solicitor in the proceedings the plaintiff brings against Nationwide News Pty Ltd.
	
	
	An imputation that “the plaintiff is a joke” was allowed to go to the jury, but by reason of the “joke” cartoon of the plaintiff (whose head was superimposed on a scantily clad body), and in circumstances where the plaintiff, a member of parliament, had been reduced to a joke by the cartoon.
	
	
	As I have set out below, the plaintiff is entitled to plead an imputation of condition in relation to his hairstyle. An imputation that the plaintiff is a joke would not differ in substance from either imputations 3(vi) or 3(vii). It is struck out on that basis.
	


The DailyMail.com imputation 3(vi) and 3(vii)


	
	Even on the low test applicable to UCPR r 28.2 arguments, the only subject that is capable of giving rise to ridicule is the plaintiff’s hairstyle. I accept the defendant’s submission that these imputations therefore do not differ in substance from each other.
	
	
	As to 3(vi), an imputation that the plaintiff is a ridiculous person should be struck out for lack of specificity for the reasons explained by Levine J in Scali v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 15 July 1993), when his Honour struck out an imputation that the plaintiff was “deserving of being held up to public ridicule”. As the court pointed out in Toben v Milne at [31], the defendants should not be called upon to defend such an imprecise and wide imputation.
	
	
	Imputation 3(vii) does, however, identify the basis for the ridicule as being the plaintiff’s hairstyle. This imputation is reasonably capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	
	
	If imputation 3(vii) remains, and is considered to be the “condition” to go with the “act” of exposing himself to ridicule (which the pleader attempts to capture in imputations 3(iii) and 3(iv)) this would be permissible.
	


The proceedings against the Daily Telegraph: 2016/210996


	
	The plaintiff brings a separate statement of claim in relation to two publications, with essentially the same imputations, save for the replacement of “silly” with “shameful” to describe his haircut, in imputations 4(viii) and 7(viii).
	


The first Daily Telegraph publication


	
	The first Daily Telegraph publication (Annexure B) is notable for its moderate headline, absence of commentary and lack of colourful language. The plaintiff’s hairstyle is identified (accurately) as a “mullet”, which is described as “interesting” (paragraph 8) and one of “a few other bold and bright haircuts at the party”. Two photographs of the plaintiff from his Facebook page, full-face, are captioned “Ziggy’s mullet has garnered a great deal of attention on the internet”. The article consists almost entirely of interviews with the plaintiff and his friends.
	


The first Daily Telegraph publication: imputations 4(i) and 4(ii)


	
	The first matter complained of refers to “a photo of [the plaintiff] dancing at an 18th birthday party in Hurstville” (paragraph 5) becoming an internet sensation after it was posted by the photographer. It then refers to the party host saying that the plaintiff’s hair had been cut like that for several years and the plaintiff “definitely” was not going to change it. He then says:
	


“He couldn’t care less, there were a few other bold and bright haircuts at the party. He doesn’t mind people he doesn’t know making fun but annoyed [sic] at people he knows who are doing it.

I am surprised. We didn’t expect any of this. I like the meme where the guy is pinning the mullet.” (paragraphs 15 – 16)


	
	There then appears a photograph of the plaintiff from his Facebook page wearing another hairstyle which includes long hair but an unshaven head. Underneath appears the caption “Copping it on the chin”. This is followed by a statement from the person who “works as a photographer while studying at university” that he “did not think the photo would “blow up” when he posted it onto his own Facebook page” (paragraph 17. The photographer went on to say he did not think it was “the right photo at the time”, but this is in terms of garnering social media attention and added:
	


“When I first saw that (the mullet) it didn’t seem real, it’s like a hair cut from [sic] movie The Combination. He’s copped it on the chin, the birthday boys are loving the attention. The response has been overwhelming.” (paragraphs 27 – 28)


	
	None of the language of the matter complained of is capable of supporting an inference that the plaintiff permitted the taking of the photograph in circumstances where he “justifiably” exposed himself to ridicule as a result. As indicated above, I do not accept that the posing in the photograph or the fact that the photograph was taken by a photographer retained to take photographs of the birthday party amounted to permission.
	
	
	Not even the memes which are reproduced are capable of conveying imputations of ridicule, given the context in which they are published, as the text of the matter complained of is clear to the same degree as that set out in Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1995] 2 AC 65. This is not a case of bane and antidote, requiring the weighing up of differing portions of the matter complained of by the tribunal of fact, but a total absence of characterisation of the plaintiff as anything other than a young man with an “interesting” hairstyle which had captured the attention of the internet.
	
	
	Any imputation of the plaintiff justifiably exposing himself to ridicule by permitting himself to be photographed with a mullet hairstyle is therefore not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	An additional problem is the addition of the words “by the Daily Telegraph” and “by the public” in order to plead two imputations. This is also relevant to the question of capacity, because there is nothing in the matter complained of capable of conveying that the plaintiff permitted the photograph to be taken in circumstances where he would come to the defendant’s notice.
	
	
	There were also objections as to form, as there are to imputations 4(iii) and 4(iv) below, which are in identical terms but which do not refer to the plaintiff having “permitted” being photographed.
	
	
	Imputations 4(i) and 4(ii) are not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	


The first Daily Telegraph publication: imputations 4(iii) and 4(iv)


	
	Imputations 4(iii) and 4(iv), apparently acknowledging the difficulty of asserting that the plaintiff was posing for the photograph, base the imputation upon the plaintiff justifying the ridicule by the defendant (imputation 4(iii)) and the public (imputation 4(iv)) merely by having a mullet hairstyle.
	
	
	For the same reasons as set out in relation to imputations 3(iii) and 3(iv) of the DailyMail.com publication, these imputations do not differ in substance from each other and draw an impermissible distinction between the “public” and the defendant.
	
	
	Even if they did, for the same reasons as set out in relation to 4(i) and 4(ii) above, they are not reasonably capable of being conveyed. The matter complained of makes no value judgment of the plaintiff’s haircut and no sense of ridicule of the plaintiff is conveyed. While the “hilarious memes” are reproduced, they are hilarious memes about the plaintiff’s “interesting” haircut.
	
	
	Imputations 4(iii) and 4(iv) are not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	


The first Daily Telegraph  publication: imputations 4(v), 4(vi) and 4(viii)


	
	Imputations 4(v) and 4(vi) have the same defects of form as outlined in relation to the other publications where these imputations are pleaded. However, both these imputations and imputation 4(viii) suffer from the greater defect of relying upon a concept of ridiculousness that is simply not present in the matte complained of.
	
	
	For the same reasons as set out above for imputations 4(i) to 4(iv), these imputations are not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	


The first Daily Telegraph publication: imputation 4(vii)


	
	Still less than imputations of ridicule could there be any possible basis for an imputation that the plaintiff is hideously ugly. Two photographs of the plaintiff’s full-on face are shown, under a caption that his mullet has garnered a lot of attention on the internet, but no portion of the matter complained of is capable of suggesting anything other than that his hairstyle has gained a lot of attention, that he is taking this attention “on the chin” and that he does not intend to change his hairstyle.
	
	
	Not even the reproduction of the memes is capable of giving rise to such an imputation, for the same reason as noted above in relation to the “ridiculous” imputation.
	
	
	This imputation is not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	


Conclusions concerning the first Daily Telegraph publication


	
	Only in the clearest cases would should the court strike out all the imputations pleaded as not being capable of being conveyed: Bik v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1979] 2 NSWLR 679n. Even at trial, the test to be applied, according to Herron CJ is the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125. The extreme caution to be used when exercising the summary power is necessary because, as Herron CJ noted, a judge sitting alone should avoid “driving the plaintiff from the judgment seat”. That is all the more the case in a capacity hearing where summary judgment is sought, and Bik v Mirror Newspapers Ltd must be read subject to this qualification.
	
	
	The defendant does not ask me to strike out the whole of the matter complained of as being incapable of conveying any defamatory imputation. The orders I have made in relation to the first matter complained of amount to striking out the imputations pleaded, and no more. If the plaintiff is able to formulate imputations in their place, he is not precluded from doing so.
	


The second Daily Telegraph publication: imputations 7(i) and 7(ii)


	
	The second matter complained of (Annexure C) does not feature the original photograph taken at the party, but has extracted the portion of the photograph showing the plaintiff and his dancing partner (the photographer’s logo is not included). It would be an interesting issue of law if the “viral” nature of the internet publication was such that any imputation arising from that photograph could be pleaded as an extrinsic fact; perhaps fortunately, the concept of viral publications and extrinsic facts is an issue which can await determination on some other occasion.
	
	
	This newspaper article commences with the heading “From bad hair day to mane [sic] attraction” and shows a photograph cropped from the original photograph, showing only the plaintiff and his partner, in a montage with two of the photoshopped pictures where the plaintiff’s fact has been used. The matter complained of commences (paragraphs 6 – 7):
	


“Meet Ziggy “the Mullet” Mossimani, the Sydney teenager whose bizarre hairdo has caused a global internet storm.

Ziggy’s cranial styling went viral after a photographer posted a picture of him dancing at an 18th birthday party at Hurstville.”


	
	The matter complained of goes on to state that the photograph had been shared two million times and been the subject of “an endless stream of hilarious memes featuring the teenager’s mullet” (paragraph 8). It then reports the plaintiff as initially enjoying the attention but then having “fired back at his critics”, using expletive terms, and concludes with a statement by a friend that the plaintiff was not going to change his hairstyle. Mr Nool, who is described as “a photographer while studying at university” said he did not think the photograph would “blow up” when he posted it on Facebook. This is followed by a “Hairy Hall of Shame” which has no relevance to imputations 7(i) and 7(ii).
	
	
	There is nothing in the text of the matter complained of to support an imputation that the plaintiff permitted the photograph to be taken, or that he sought the attention of the public (or the defendant) in any way.
	
	
	Imputations 7(i) and 7(ii) are not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	


The second Daily Telegraph publication: imputations 7(iii) and 7(iv)


	
	Unlike the first matter complained of, this publication makes it clear that the plaintiff’s “bizarre hairdo” and “crazy cranial styling” is worthy of comparison to the “Hairy Hall of Shame”.
	
	
	As is the case with imputations 3(iii) and 3(iv) in the DailyMail.com publication, these imputations do not differ in substance
	


The second Daily Telegraph publication: imputation 7(v)


	
	For the same reasons as set out above, I consider the imputation “the plaintiff is a joke” to be bad in form and not to differ in substance from imputations 7(vi) and 7(viii).
	
	
	This imputation is struck out.
	


The second Daily Telegraph publication: imputations 7(vi) and 7(viii)


	
	For the same reasons as set out above, I consider the imputation “the plaintiff is a ridiculous person” to be bad in form and not to differ in substance from imputation 7(viii).
	
	
	Taking into account the portions of the matter complained of which give rise to an imputation of ridicule (as set out above), imputation 7(viii) is reasonably capable of being conveyed but imputation 7(vi) will be struck out.
	


The second Daily Telegraph imputation 7(vii)


	
	Mr Rasmussen did not submit that the “hideously ugly” imputations is based upon the photoshopped images (even the photograph where a skunk has been added to the plaintiff’s head), but upon the text of the matter complained of and in particular from the “Hairy Hall of Shame”, featuring famous actors and singers whose hairstyles are criticised.
	
	
	From its headline (“mane attraction”) to the “Hairy Hall of Shame” at the end of the publication, the matter complained of makes it clear that the plaintiff’s mullet hairstyle is the subject of attack, but says nothing about the rest of his physiognomy. The “Hairy Hall of Shame” features photographs of six men whom it would be fair to describe as not only internationally famous but self-evidently handsome. No imputation of ugliness, let alone hideous ugliness, could arise from comparison to these persons or from the text used to describe them.
	
	
	This imputation is not reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	


The proceedings against Australian Radio Network: 2016/211033


	
	These are separate proceedings concerning three publications (see Annexures D, E and F) on the KIIS Radio website, with what is agreed to be identical imputations and content.
	


The first KIIS radio publication


	
	While the text and photographs in these publications are largely the same as the DailyMail.com and Daily Telegraph, the differences, particularly with regard to the headlines, are of significance.
	


Imputations 3(i) and 3(ii)


	
	The heading of this publication, “Sydney man showcases ridiculous haircut, internet goes crazy”, and goes on to say:
	


“Everyone, meet Ziggy, a 16-year-old man from Sydney who, for some reason, decided to cut his hair in a way that we simply cannot explain”


	
	In paragraph 4, the matter complained of goes on to say:
	


“After being uploaded last Tuesday, the photo has obtained more than 11,415 comments, almost 10,000 likes and more than a whopping 1.7 million views.

Ziggy’s mullet has awarded him the kind of fame he likely never would have dreamed of.”


	
	The photograph of the plaintiff has been cropped, and neither the other persons in the photograph nor the photographer’s logo appear. However, there is an interview with the photographer, who says that he was “walking round taking photos” but “did not think it would be the right photo” (i.e. a photo to catch social media attention). Since the picture was shared, that situation had changed.
	
	
	The verb “showcase” is defined in Wiktionary (an appropriate dictionary to consult, given the online nature of the material in the matters complained of) as being to display, demonstrate, show or present. A showcase is a place for displaying goods. The inference is that the plaintiff is putting himself and his hairstyle on public display.
	
	
	On a capacity basis, this publication is reasonably capable of giving rise to an imputation that the plaintiff permitted both the taking of the photograph of his “ridiculous” haircut and its posting on social media. The heading alone (especially the verb “showcases”) is sufficient to convey an imputation to this effect, but it is also aided by the references to “after being uploaded”, the kind of fame he would “never have dreamed of”, the apparent relationship between the photographer and the plaintiff that a loose-thinking reader might pick up from the references to “the right photo” and the reference to the picture being “shared on Tuesday”. On the r 28.2 UCPR test level, a reader would be entitled to infer that the plaintiff played some part in this uploading, in the hope of fame, as the next sentence goes on to say that the uploading gave him “the kind of fame he likely never would have dreamed of (paragraph 5).
	
	
	This is sufficient for an imputation that the plaintiff permitted the photograph to be taken (and, for that matter, uploaded), but the current imputations must be struck out with leave to replead because of a series of form errors.
	
	
	First, the plaintiff cannot plead two imputations in the place of one in circumstances where the delineation between “the public” and “the defendant” is without substance. The plaintiff is entitled to plead one imputation to the effect that by reason of permitting himself to be photographed with the hairstyle in question, he justifiably exposed himself to ridicule; any additional references to the public or a defendant are a matter for the plaintiff.
	
	
	Second, the plaintiff needs to identify the defamatory sting with more precision. What is it about permitting himself to be photographed that made him justifiably expose himself to ridicule?
	
	
	I will accordingly strike out both imputations with leave to replead.
	


Imputations 3(iii) and 3(iv)


	
	Depending upon the form of the imputation pleaded to replace imputations 3(i) and 3(ii), these imputations would at best be fall-back imputations in the event that the jury did not find an imputation of permission to be conveyed, as clearly both cannot arise at the same time.
	
	
	Additionally, the plaintiff cannot plead two imputations in place of one (and in this regard I note my acceptance of the submissions of the defendants objecting to the division between the defendant and “the public”).
	
	
	I propose to strike both these imputations out as embarrassing in form and not to grant leave to amend in their current form, because it is impossible to tell whether they will differ in substance until the repleaded first imputation has been determined. If the plaintiff does plead a fall-back to the new imputation to replace imputations 3(i) and 3(ii), no fresh imputation is needed.
	


Imputation 3(vi)


	
	As to imputation 3(vi), what passages of the matter complained and/or photographs give rise to an imputation that the plaintiff is “hideously ugly”?
	
	
	The heading of the matter complained of says that he has a “ridiculous haircut” and this sentiment is repeated in paragraphs 4 and 5. However, the publication goes on to say that the photograph has generated 11,415 comments, 10,000 likes and 1.7 million views, which suggests that the hairstyle has its fans and opponents, but is not indicative of ugliness; to the contrary, 10,000 people pressed the “like” button.
	
	
	As already noted in relation to the photoshopped pictures in the Daily Telegraph article, the closest any such picture gets to suggesting there is anything unattractive (as opposed to ridiculous) in the plaintiff’s appearance is the photograph where a skunk has been added to the plaintiff’s head. However, these photoshopped images need to be viewed in context of the whole of the matter complained of (Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1995] 2 AC 65). Viewed as a whole the matter complained of is commenting about his hairstyle being ridiculous, and this is not the same as saying that the plaintiff is ugly.
	
	
	The additional material Mr Rasmussen relies on is the article at the side and photograph (paragraphs 3 and 3A) which say “Worst ever Yearbook haircuts” and show a photograph of a small, fat boy with a mullet haircut. However, this photograph needs to be seen in context with the six photoshopped pictures of the plaintiff showing him on Mount Rushmore, on a dollar bill, as “pin the tail on the donkey” and as a horse, none of which suggest physical ugliness on the part of the plaintiff, let alone “hideous” ugliness. The plaintiff has not been compared to Frankenstein, or some other hideously ugly figure; his haircut has been criticised as ridiculous.
	
	
	This imputation is not reasonably capable of being conveyed and should be struck out.
	
	
	I have set out above my reasons for holding that imputations 3(v) and 3(vii) should be struck out as embarrassing in form and not differing in substance from other imputations, and I make the same rulings here.
	


Imputations 3(v), 3(vii) and 3(viii)


	
	I repeat my observations concerning the problems with form of imputations 3(v) and 3(vii).
	
	
	As to 3(viii), as is the case with the other publications, the plaintiff is entitled to plead an imputation of condition (namely being a ridiculous person for having such a hairstyle) as well as an imputation amounting to an act.
	
	
	This imputation is reasonably capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	


The second and third publications


	
	The second and third publications are essentially the same; the word “horrendous” is used in place of “ridiculous” in imputation 12(vii) but it was not suggested that this made any difference to any ruling I would make. Accordingly I propose to make the same rulings for all three publications.
	


Costs


	
	These are very short publications which make the point that the plaintiff’s striking mullet haircut has generated a great deal of interest on the Internet, most of it humorous, and some of it in the form of clever observations, such as the “Pythagoras” direction in one of the memes.
	
	
	The statements of claim in all three matters are overpleaded, in that the drafting seems to be designed to claim as many imputations as possible while simultaneously avoiding a defence of honest opinion or justification.
	
	
	As a result, the defendants have been successful in nearly all of their objections. In those circumstances, the plaintiff should pay the defendants’ costs of these applications.

	I make orders as follows:

2770944,Smith v Alone [2016] NSWDC 265,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The plaintiff, Mr Jeffrey Warren Smith, brings proceedings for damages for personal injury when he was struck by the defendant’s motor vehicle on 17 November 2011.
	
	
	Liability has been admitted and contributory negligence by the plaintiff (who was affected by alcohol at the time of the accident) agreed at 60%. The remaining issue is the assessment of damages. The following should be noted:
	



	
	The plaintiff is not entitled to damages for non-economic loss (s 131 Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Act”)) as the extent of his injuries has not been assessed as sufficient to pass the threshold.
	
	
	Past out of pocket expenses are agreed in the sum of $29,323.75.
	
	
	As to past and future economic loss, the defendant concedes that the plaintiff is permanently unfit for work as an installer of air-conditioning and ducting, and for other heavy manual labour of the kind that he performed prior to the accident.
	


The factual issues to be resolved


	
	The parties were not able to agree as to the issues for determination, so I will set out what their differing views are.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s statement of issues identified eleven issues as follows:
	



	
	With respect to past economic loss, has the plaintiff been totally incapacitated since the date of accident to the date of trial and, if not, to what extent did he retain earning capacity?
	
	
	Given almost five years have elapsed since the accident, what weekly net wage figure should be the measure of the plaintiffs past loss?
	
	
	As to future economic loss, given the plaintiffs injuries, both physical and psychiatric, and given his education and training, is the plaintiff totally incapacitated for all forms of work in the future?
	
	
	If the answer to 3 above is no, what percentage of earning capacity has the plaintiff retained?
	
	
	Given that almost five years have elapsed between the accident and trial and given the vagaries of the future, what weekly wage figure should the Court adopt as a yardstick for the plaintiffs future loss?
	
	
	Does the plaintiff exceed the threshold pursuant to s 141B Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW)?
	
	
	If the answer to 6 above is yes, how many hours of gratuitous domestic assistance has the plaintiff needed and received since the accident and as a consequence of the accident?
	
	
	Is the plaintiff entitled to an award with respect to future commercial care?
	
	
	If the answer to 8 above is yes:
	



	
	How many hours per week should be awarded to the plaintiff?
	
	
	What hourly rate should the Court apply?
	
	
	Over what period should the award apply?
	



	
	Is the plaintiff entitled to an award to represent losses of future out of pocket expenses including aids and equipment?
	
	
	If the answer to 10 above is yes, what amount should the Court so award?
	



	
	Under the heading “Factual issues to be resolved”, the defendant set out a series of issues which I distil as follows:
	



	
	The nature and extent of the plaintiff’s injuries;
	
	
	Whether the plaintiff has sustained a permanent injury to his back as a consequence of altered gait;
	
	
	The nature and extent of injuries to the plaintiff’s neck, ankle and left knee;
	
	
	The correct approach to the rehabilitation evidence given by Dr Zeman as opposed to the orthopaedic expertise of Dr Walker, the plaintiff’s treating doctor;
	
	
	The reconciliation of disparities between the evidence of the plaintiff and his sisters with contemporaneous records as to:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s state of health before the accident, including problems with alcohol and a diagnosis of depression.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident capacity for work, including his criminal record and periods of unemployment over the pre-accident period.
	
	
	Whether the matters raised in (a) and (b) require a higher than usual deduction for vicissitudes.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s residual work capacity and whether the motor vehicle accident has caused the plaintiff a total loss of earning capacity as claimed.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident home care situation and whether his post-accident home care requirements exceed the threshold.
	


The circumstances of the plaintiff’s accident


	
	The plaintiff and a work mate went to several hotels on the night of the accident. While the precise amount the plaintiff consumed is unknown, he was well affected by alcohol. The plaintiff’s accident occurred on the Moore-Oxley bypass at Campbelltown, after he stepped off a traffic island in the middle of the road directly into the path of the defendant’s vehicle, which was travelling in the southbound lane. He was struck with force by the defendant’s vehicle. He was conveyed to hospital by ambulance.
	
	
	While the plaintiff now has very little recollection of how the accident happened, he did not disagree with the contents of the police record of interview at the hospital:
	


“Q.  Then the question that was asked of you:  ""Where were you drinking that night?  What were your movements for the night?"" and the answer that you gave was, ""My friend Billy and I left from here.  I had one full strength long neck about 3pm‑ish when I came home from work.  Billy and I walked to the Campbelltown RSL Club.  At the RSL Club I went in and had a few beers.  I had four or five schooners of full strength VB.  I don't remember leaving the RSL Club and going next door, but Billy told me we then went to CCs and I had about five or six more drinks.  I don't remember that, though.  I didn't have any dinner that night.  I don't remember after the RSL Club, though"".  The question was, ""What do you think your level of intoxication was that night?""  ""I have no idea, I can't remember.  I'm not sure if it's because of the accident or the alcohol"".  Do you remember giving those answers to the police officer?

A.  Yes.  I vaguely remember, but, yeah.

Q.  The fact is that you had gone out and you had been drinking and consumed a substantial amount of beer on that night; do you agree?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  You accept that you were probably intoxicated on that night when the accident happened?

A.  Yes.” ( T 89 – 90)


	
	The plaintiff’s injuries were the subject of a series of medical complications which extended the period of his medical treatment well beyond the general parameters for recovery. This is a significant issue in relation to his claims for home care and for economic loss, but not for general damages, as assessment of the plaintiff’s non-economic loss is agreed not to pass the threshold.
	


The plaintiff’s evidence


	
	The plaintiff attended high school to school certificate level and then, between 1987 and 1990, completed an apprenticeship in sheet metal working. Although this apprenticeship was mostly practical work, he also attended some college classes.
	
	
	The plaintiff carried out farm work in the country town of Trangie and farms in that area between 1996 and 2005, during which time he was in a relationship with a young woman and became the father of two children. During this period, he worked on farms and heavy labouring jobs, but was not in continuous employment. His farm employment was influenced by seasonal factors as well as by the drought (T 122). His evidence was that, while he was living in the country, he supplemented his income with a second job as an air conditioner repairer but, judging by his tax returns for the latter part of this period, this kind of work appears to have been within modest financial parameters, in that there is no reference to it on his tax returns.
	
	
	Although Mr McCarthy submitted that the plaintiff had “worked for most of his career in air conditioning maintenance where he has applied his skills as a sheet metal worker” and that he has been fully employed since leaving Trangie in about 2005 - 6 (written submissions, paragraph 4), this does not appear to be consistent with the plaintiff’s description of his work prior to 2005. However, the plaintiff certainly did carry out this kind of work after he moved to Sydney in about 2005 - 2006. The plaintiff said that this was very physically demanding work:
	


“Q.  What physical role did you play in installing those units?

A.  Well, we installed the whole lot, so we were in the roof, on the roof, up and down the floors.

Q.  What were you actually doing?  Not all of us here have had experience in installing air conditioning, so just try and paint a picture of what you were actually doing with your hands?

A.  You're up, you work on the ladder ‑ like, 80% of the day you're up on the ladder, like, just installing the air conditioning and ducting the roof, the sheet metal ducting, lifting it over your head and screwing it all together and just ‑ then putting that together and cutting through your ceilings and onto the roof and ‑ yeah.

Q.  How would you describe that work, in terms of it being light, medium or heavy?

A.  It's very heavy work.  Just our toolboxes are, like, 20 or 30 kilos just in tools you've got to cart around with you.

Q.  Your tool box is 20 or 30 kilos, is it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How much of the day have you got to carry that around with you?

A.  All day, and a ladder.

Q.  You've got to carry the ladder as well?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  What percentage of the day are you on your feet?

A.  100% of the day.

Q.  Did you ever have any difficulties or problems from a physical point of view, doing that work?

A.  No.

Q.  Did you ever have any problems from an emotional point of view, doing that work?

A.  No.

Q.  Did you enjoy that work?

A.  Yes, very much.” (T 25)


	
	The plaintiff had been employed for about five weeks at Complete Air Conditioning at the time of the accident, after a period of unemployment of several months (since 27 June 2011).
	
	
	He described his pay and work at Sea-Air as follows:
	


Q.  What was the base wage?

A.  At Sea‑Air I think it was $35 an hour.

Q.  Do you remember what it was per year but, the annual wage?

A.  72,800.

Q.  And on top of that was there overtime?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How much overtime was available?

A.  As much as you wanted.  I was doing most days an extra two hours every day and maybe four on Saturday, so a good ten hours a week.

Q.  Was overtime paid at a higher rate?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What rate was overtime paid at?

A.  52.

Q.  Do you know how much you were, on average, clearing in your hand every week at Sea‑Air?

A.  At Sea‑Air, no.  On an average, I would say 1500 ‑ 1200, 1500. “ (T 23 – 24)


	
	In the course of describing his work history in examination in chief, the plaintiff acknowledged that, prior to the accident, he had been charged with traffic offences involving alcohol, but said that these convictions had never stopped him working:
	


“Q.  Were you physically strong before this accident?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You lost your driver's licence for a while, didn't you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  For a period of three years.  What period did that cover?

A.  2010 to 2013.

Q.  When you didn't have your licence did that ever stop you working?

A.  No.

Q.  How did you get about?

A.  On the tram.” (T 44)


	
	The plaintiff’s claim for damages is based on a regular work history and that he enjoyed excellent health. As Mr McCarthy put his client’s position in his written submissions, while his drinking had been referred to by medical practitioners, the plaintiff’s work life was unaffected, as the plaintiff “has not so much as stubbed his toe in 25 years” as a result of any drinking or other health problem (plaintiff’s written submissions, paragraph 47).
	
	
	The plaintiff in examination in chief was asked about criminal offences other than drink driving charges:
	


“Q.  Before we move onto the Sea‑Air do you recall there being some other incidents with the law over the course of your life?

A.  Sorry, can you repeat that.

Q.  Do you recall any other incidents with the law involving being charged by police over the course of your life?

A.  Had a cannabis possession once in the 90s.  I think that's pretty much it.” (T 19)


	
	He recalled other criminal proceedings as follows:
	


“Q.  What other trouble have you had, if any, where the law has got involved?  You told us about the drink/drives, you've told us about a possession.  You've told us about the assault that you spent 14 days in gaol for in 1997.  What other matters have you had where the police been involved?

A.  There was another assault charge.

Q.  Anything else?

A.  I got a 400 hour community service order once.  Can't remember what the charge was exactly for, probably the assault charge.  There was a charge where I was charged with a weapon but I think that charge was dropped or downgraded on ‑ it was the weapon was as in a motor vehicle but I'm not sure, yeah.  I can't remember, your Honour.  It was in the early 90s, I think.” (T 20)


	
	He also related an occasion when he had hit his brother-in-law and had been charged:
	


“Q.  What happened?

A.  We just got into an altercation one night at home.  It was just the one punch thrown and I give him a black eye and, yeah, the police were called and I was charged.

Q.  Were you drinking at the time?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All the offences you've told the Court about how many of them involved alcohol?

A.  All of them.

Q.  You hit your brother‑in‑law, apart from the black eye was he injured?

A.  No.

Q.  You two made up after that?

A.  Yeah, we were mates again the next day.  Just, yeah, heated argument at the time and yeah.” (T 20)


	
	The plaintiff was put on a bond, but breached the bond on a later alcohol-related occasion, when he “threw some chips” at a taxi driver and was sentenced to three months imprisonment (T 21). This event occurred after the plaintiff’s accident.
	
	
	The plaintiff acknowledged having to serve a six-month term of imprisonment in the second half of 2010. He also acknowledged having to complete a three-month term of imprisonment following the accident (for the taxi driver incident), but spent most of this time in hospital due to medical complications. He said that he had learned his lesson as to the relationship between drinking and violence-related offences from each of these occasions and was now careful about what he drank.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff noted in his submissions, in support of this evidence, that the plaintiff’s general practitioner’s records showed that he had cut down on his drinking shortly before the accident. The plaintiff’s evidence in response to Mr McCarthy’s questions in examination in chief were:
	


“Q.  Before we just move on to the accident, you've told her Honour about these incidents involving all the trouble you've gotten into in your life, and you've also told her Honour that these incidents have all revolved around you consuming alcohol.  Have you taken any measure to reduce the amount of alcohol you consume?

A.  Yes, your Honour.

Q.  What are those measures?

A.  I've went to see a psychologist and got prescribed some medication to try and stop drinking.

Q.  I'll stop you there.  When was that?

A.  I think that was in ‑ after I got released ‑ I think it was in 2012, maybe.  I'm not 100% sure.” (T 22)


	
	The plaintiff identified this general practitioner as Dr Michael. He said that he had cut down his drinking to a few drinks on the weekend and tried to have 3 to 4 alcohol-free days during the week. He told the court he had also successfully lost weight, as he had a longstanding blood pressure problem and was at risk for diabetes. Dr Michael is the general practitioner who has been prescribing Endep to him.
	
	
	This brings me to a description of the plaintiff’s injury and treatment. He remembered little from this period in hospital but described in detail the lengthy period of rehabilitation. The precise nature of his ongoing problems is set out in careful detail by Dr Walker, and I have set out the relevant extracts from his reports on this topic below.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s recovery from his injuries was slow and full of complications. He suffered from constant pain in the leg, and was unable to weight bear for what appears to have been a period of almost three years by reason of the initial non-union and then slow union of his distal fibula. This required the placement of a device called an “external fixateur” (sometimes spelled as “fixator” in the medical reports), which was not only painful and unsightly, but significantly hampered his ability to mobilise.
	
	
	An additional complicating factor was the series of infections which prolonged the plaintiff’s treatment, in addition to the failure of his fracture to unite. Further, he had the anxiety of being told by Dr Walker (see Dr Walker’s report of 2 December 2013) that if his leg fracture did not unite, the worst case scenario would be that he might be looking at a possible amputation.
	
	
	As a result, the plaintiff underwent a series of surgical procedures of a painful and frightening nature, which impaired significantly on his ability to care for himself and to return to work.
	
	
	By 30 April 2015, Dr Walker was able to note that following the latest surgery the plaintiff’s fracture was healing and should continue to heal, but even that this stage the plaintiff was using a walking stick 60% of the time. Dr Walker estimated that union following the 2014 operation would take about 12 to 18 months.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence was that he was, and remains, on constant medication and is still effectively unable to look after himself. For the first twelve months after his accident, he lived with his sister Rebecca, and received frequent home care visits from his other sister Tammy. Rebecca, her family and Tammy effectively had to do everything for him. After he moved to his own accommodation, a home unit in Campbelltown, they continued to visit him on a regular basis and continued to have to do everything for him. He has now moved into a property which was owned by a deceased member of the family, where he lives alone, and his sisters continue to come to his home three to four times a week to do everything for him, including grocery shopping, cooking, vacuuming, cleaning and other household tasks. He feels embarrassed about this and, if he was awarded a sum which enabled him to hire commercial cleaners, he would do so.
	
	
	The plaintiff described his current state of health, medication and future plans as follows:
	


“Q.  Would you like to be working?

A.  I would love to be working.

Q.  Have you made any attempt to get work since the accident?

A.  No.  I wouldn't be able to work.

Q.  Is there anything you can think of that you could do?

A.  I can't do much, unless ‑ I can't hardly even get out of bed unless I'm taking OxyContin.

Q.  OxyContin:  first of all, how often do you take it?

A.  Twice a day.

Q.  And how often do you purchase it?

A.  Once a fortnight.” (T 37)


	
	In addition to the physical pain from which the plaintiff suffers, he is depressed and “down a lot” (T 37). The plaintiff described himself (and his sisters confirmed) prior to the accident as being a happy and well-adjusted person. In the words of his sister Ms Jackson, he was a “pretty happy go lucky type of guy” and a person of “good character” (T 178). However, he has suffered significant changes in temperament following the accident:
	


“Q.  From an emotional point of view, Mr Smith, are you able to detect any changes between the sort of bloke you used to be and who you are now?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What's the nature of those changes?

A.  I don't feel as happy and that, like, I'm down a lot.  Like, this last weekend, just when me nephews played in the semi‑final football, usually I will be kicking a ball around with them and stuff, but I can't do that.  That makes me a bit upset, you know, stuff like that; little stuff that I can't do anymore that I would like to do.” (T 37)


	
	In addition, he had trouble remembering things. He needed constant reminders from his sisters and was concerned about his ability to cook for himself in such circumstances.
	
	
	As to his pre-accident mental wellbeing, the plaintiff acknowledged that he had been prescribed a drug called Pristiq prior to the accident, but said that he had never filled the prescription and never taken an antidepressant drug in his life (T 24). By comparison, he is now dependent upon strong pain medication such as Endep, uses a walking stick when not at home, and is rarely pain-free.
	
	
	As to homecare, the plaintiff told the court that, prior to the accident, he performed his own housework when he lived alone and that, apart from a four month period when he lived with his sister (February – July 2011), when he formed part of a household, he did all his own housework without assistance. He still “can’t do anything around his house because of pain” (plaintiff’s written submissions, paragraph 4).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s lengthy and complicated recovery from his injuries is a significant issue in relation to past economic loss and past home care, and a number of admissions were made in relation to these issues on behalf of the defendant. The principal issue of contention was the degree to which these problems were now present, and whether future claims for economic loss and home care should be assessed upon the same basis.
	


The plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination


	
	The issues upon which the plaintiff were cross-examined may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	Whether the plaintiff’s prior work history was as stated;
	
	
	Whether the plaintiff’s criminal record (including loss of driver’s licence) was as stated;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s pre-accident accommodation and home care circumstances;
	
	
	Whether the plaintiff was in fact unable to care for himself in the home and incapable of performing activities which would enable him to find work.
	



	
	The defendant’s case is that the plaintiff’s evidence as to his pre-accident health and working history and current asserted disabilities is unsatisfactory and unreliable, and that the history set out in contemporaneous tax returns and medical reports (such as those of hospital, prison and medical officers), where inconsistent with the plaintiff’s evidence, should be preferred (written submissions, paragraphs 23-28).
	


The plaintiff’s prior work history


	
	The evidence in relation to the plaintiff’s employment history consists of:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s evidence as to his working history and that of his sisters, which is that he was consistently in employment.
	
	
	A statement to Corrections Health Service (Exhibit 1, p. 38) that his occupation while he was living in Dubbo was “farm manager”. Certain of the plaintiff’s tax returns for the period 2001 to 2012 have also been tendered (Exhibit 3).
	
	
	Information about the plaintiff’s payment for the six months in 2010 that he was in prison.
	
	
	Payslips for the period from mid-February 2011 to 27 June 2011 and from October 2011 to November 2011 (Exhibit D). For the first of these periods at Sea-Air (20 weeks), the plaintiff’s net earnings were $22,540, less $7884.25 tax, plus $2,003 superannuation (which Mr O’Keefe notes in his written submissions is a weekly average of $1127). For the plaintiff’s second period of employment at Complete Air Conditioning (12 October 2011 to 23 November 2011), his pay varied between $ and $1157.70 net per week up until 9 November 2011 (a further payment on 23 November 2011 is made after the accident but appears to include other items). For the intervening periods in 2011 (January to mid-February and27 June to October 2011) the plaintiff was unemployed.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Kohlenberg, who worked for the same employer as the plaintiff for the period mid-February 2011 to 27 June 2011.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s work history may be very generally summarised as follows:
	



	
	From the time the plaintiff left school until approximately 2005, he was working in the country in rural occupations. He received income of $62,400 for farm work in 2001 and a similar salary for similar work in 2002. He could not recall if he filed any tax returns for 2003, 2004, 2007 or 2008. His tax returns from 2001 onwards have been prepared by an accountant in 2013 (T 88) after he suffered the accident the subject of these proceedings (T 119).
	
	
	He was unemployed during the 2005 financial year and received “Government allowances” of $12,806 for this period.
	
	
	In about 2005 to 2006 he came to Sydney but no tax returns are available for 2006 or 2007. He agreed in cross-examination that he could have been unemployed for parts of the time during these years.
	
	
	In 2008, he earned $47,879 as an air conditioning installation technician. He earned slightly more in 2009, and again in 2010 ($50,612). He was an independent contractor at this time, and made a tax deduction claim for car expenses, although for most of his working life (including this period of time) he had been disqualified from driving by reason of drink-driving convictions.
	
	
	His earning capacity was disrupted in the last six months of 2010 due to his imprisonment for six months. His taxable income of $33,339 for the financial year before the accident included payments from Newstart for the period 20 December 2010 (the date of his release from gaol) to 25 February 2011.
	
	
	He returned to work, for Sea-air, in mid-February 2011, but ceased employment there on 27 June 2011, when they could not offer full time work, according to evidence of Mr Kohlenberg. He was then unemployed until 12 October 2011. It was about five weeks after he was employed by Complete Air Conditioning that he was injured. I also note that he was paid a lump sum by Complete Air Conditioning after the accident which appears unrelated to his weekly earnings.
	



	
	In cross-examination, the plaintiff acknowledged that he had not been continuously employed in the five years before the accident:
	


“Q.  You've had long periods of unemployment haven't you prior to the motor vehicle accident?

A.  No, I was constantly employed for the five years prior, prior to the accident, maybe a couple of short terms unemployment.

Q.  What do you call a short term period of unemployment Mr Smith?

A.  Well I was at Gaff Air for three years, I was, maybe without a job in between there, in between jobs there for maybe three to six months, like I'm only guessing, I can't remember exact days, but over the last five years before prior to the accident I was, I would have been unemployed maybe six months out of that or it could be a bit longer, I'm not 100% sure, yeah.

Q.  Do you accept that you weren't in continuous employment in the five years before the accident?

A.  Yeah.” (T 86)


	
	The plaintiff’s employer is noted in his 2001 and 2002 returns as Mr Percy, the owner of a cotton farm. There is no reference to air conditioning work (Exhibit 3). He agreed he only received Newstart for the 2005 financial year and could not explain why there were no tax returns prepared for 2003 and 2004, or for 2006 and 2007:
	


“Q.  Are you able to offer any explanation why your lawyers didn't provide the insurance company with any tax returns for 2006 or 2007?

A.  Maybe I haven't done them.  I'm not sure.

Q.  Is it possible that in 2006 and 2007 you were also unemployed?

A.  After Graham Percy lost his cotton farm the bloke I was working for and there was a period there, there was a drought and there was a time there the work was quiet in the country yeah.  It could've been.  There was times where they would work for maybe half of the year and it was patchy through that time, so yeah.” (T 122)


	
	The plaintiff’s income tax return for 2008 (which he agreed was not prepared until 2012, and in fact gave his 2012 Campbelltown address: T 122,124 - 5) identifies him as an air conditioner installer with a taxable income of $47,879 (T 123), and refers to deductions for motor vehicle expenses, although the plaintiff was a disqualified driver. The plaintiff said that his “girlfriend” drove him and denied driving while disqualified (T 124).
	
	
	In 2010 the plaintiff’s employment was as follows:
	


“Q.  In 2010 if you could go to page 47, do you have page 47?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  You see there it says you worked for Westgate Irrigation and earned $2,286?

A. Yeah.

Q.  Do you know what that was for?

A.  Yep.

Q.  What was that work?

A.  I was irrigating.

Q.  I take it, was that done in Sydney?

A.  No.

Q.  Where was that work?

A.  My dad was sick at the time and I needed three weeks off so I done some work while I was down there in Hillston.

Q.  Whereabouts?

A.  Hillston.

Q.  Do you see the next entry down,""$5,224 Australian Government allowances""?

A.  Yep.

Q.  Do you accept that you were receiving unemployment benefits for a period of time?

A.  Yep.

Q.  Are you able to say for how many weeks you were unemployed?

A.  No, I'm not 100% sure, I can't ‑ I'm not sure.

Q.  Could it have been as long as four or five months?

A.  Yep.

Q.  Then do you see on the next number down ""$43,102""?

A.  Yep.

Q.  That was income that you earned in your business with Mark, is that right?

A.  Yep.

Q.  As a subcontractor?

A.  Yep.

Q.  Your earnings in that year were $50,612 before tax, do you agree?

A.  Yep.” (T 124 – 5)


	
	I deduce from the above that the plaintiff’s employment in air conditioning installation was following a pattern, over these years, of being work for only part of the time. For other periods he was either unemployed or, on occasion, doing labouring work for a few weeks. This is not a pattern of regular employment in this industry over his adult life as claimed.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s fellow employee, Mr Kohlenberg, who worked with the plaintiff for the period February to June 2011, gave evidence that the plaintiff was a hard and reliable worker, who left that place of employment only because he could not be offered full time permanent work. I accept that evidence. The plaintiff was physically fit and capable of hard work. His problem is that, at regular intervals, he had problems arising from his drinking which resulted in criminal charges and this was disrupting his working life on an increasingly frequent basis as he grew older, in part because the penalties imposed included first lengthy driving disqualifications and then two periods of imprisonment.
	
	
	Although the plaintiff claimed in examination in chief he did not drink in the same pattern as he had before he went to jail in 2010, the clinical records from jail assessments in 2010 and 2011 (Exhibit 1) demonstrate to the contrary. As I note in my discussion of Dr Westmore’s report, these records show that the plaintiff was admitted to Emergency as a result of a suicide attempt, that he complained of depression and was assessed as unfit for work by Centrelink and that doctors were concerned about the amount of alcohol he was drinking as well as by his failure to take medication for cholesterol problems.
	
	
	The next basis for challenge of the plaintiff’s evidence is the nature and extent of his criminal record. Mr McCarthy submitted (written submissions, paragraph 11) that the plaintiff’s criminal record was not serious, that there were what he called “no gotcha denials” of the plaintiff’s criminal record and that these offences were irrelevant to his work capacity.
	
	
	Mr O’Keefe submitted that the plaintiff’s criminal conduct is greater than admitted and that this, and the alcohol-related problems which generated it, put him at inevitable risk of “significant and disabling injury or arrest and conviction for offences that would have resulted in terms of imprisonment” (written submissions, paragraphs 40-41).
	


The plaintiff’s criminal record


	
	Some of the plaintiff’s criminal record, notably his early offences, is indeed irrelevant. I propose, however, to set out his criminal record in the following categories:
	



	
	Offences from 1987 to 1994;
	
	
	Criminal record between 1995 to 2000;
	
	
	Criminal record between 2001 to 2005;
	
	
	Criminal record from 2005 onwards.
	


(a) Offences from 1987 to 1994


	
	The plaintiff, as a young man, committed offences of peripheral relevance at best. However, these offences include two mid-range PCAs (in 1991 and 1992) and offences of violence in which the plaintiff acknowledged alcohol was involved.
	
	
	One of these was of some substance. On 27 December 1993, the plaintiff was charged with attempted murder, although a plea of guilty was later accepted for the alternate charge of “use offensive weapon with intent to commit indictable offence”. The plaintiff was sentenced to 400 hours community service. I accept the plaintiff’s explanation that he was charged overzealously and that the latter offence is a more realistic description of these events:
	


“Q.  Yes, did you drive your car at somebody?

A.  Yeah, well that's what they said.  There was a fight going in with my brother‑in‑law and that down the bottom corner, we lived in Dunedoo, a country town, and so I've jumped in the ute and drove down towards them but I wasn't driving the vehicle at anybody.  The same police officer in that town, because the population was 800 people, and I think four people got charged with attempted murder within six months.”

Q.  Is this the same brother‑in‑law as before?

A.  No.

Q.  It's the other brother‑in‑law, is it?

A.  Yes.” (T 73).


	
	The “other brother-in-law” referred to is his sister Rebecca’s husband. Although I inquired, when the plaintiff’s other sister Tammy gave evidence, if this brother-in-law was her partner, she denied this. I assume it must have been a brother of the plaintiff’s partner at the time.
	
	
	The circumstances in which the plaintiff “jumped in the ute” are relevant. The plaintiff was convicted on 7 November 1992 and 8 August 1993 of driving while disqualified and the disqualification period was extended on 10 August 1993 to two years from 25 November 1993.
	
	
	The plaintiff was also convicted of stealing and of possessing and administering a prohibited drug. The plaintiff explained that his mother had just died (T 75) and this would have been a time of family turmoil. I regard these offences as irrelevant.
	


(b) The plaintiff’s criminal record between 1995 to 2000


	
	The plaintiff was involved in a series of assault offences in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2000, one of which was a conviction for assaulting police in circumstances involving his de facto. The plaintiff says, and I accept, that alcohol was a feature in these events and that he was ‘young and stupid” at the time:
	


“Q.  You were gaoled for 14 days because of that, were you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You assaulted a police officer?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you were drunk, were you, at the time?

A.  Yes, like I pushed him as an assault, I didn't‑‑

Q.  You resisted arrest?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  You were sentenced to 14 days.  Where did you go to gaol, do you remember?

A.  Bathurst.

Q.  Was that a sobering experience for you?  Were you starting to get concerned about your behaviour and getting drunk and getting in trouble with police?

A.  No, not really, I was young and stupid.” (T 76)


	
	The plaintiff’s recollection was so vague that in most cases he could not remember whom he had assaulted, or why (see for example T 76-77).
	
	
	I note in relation to the common assault charge of 20 September 2000 that he was sentenced to imprisonment of 4 months which was suspended upon his entering into a s 12 bond.
	
	
	If this were all, these convictions would be of little or no relevance. As part of a larger pattern of alcohol induced violence, they assume a greater importance. Offences of seriousness begin to feature in the plaintiff’s convictions from 2001 onwards.
	


(c) Criminal record between 2001 to 2005


	
	The plaintiff was convicted of a third PCA offence in 2001, as well as conviction for driving while the plaintiff’s licence was suspended. He was disqualified for a period of 12 months but was convicted again on 26 March 2002, with a result that his disqualification period was extended to 13 June 2005.
	
	
	Between 2003 and 2005, the plaintiff was convicted of contravening an apprehended violence order (resulting in a s 12 bond for 9 months), as well as driving while disqualified, which resulted in his period of disqualification being extended to 13 June 2007. The plaintiff explained:
	


“Q.  It is the case that you were the subject of an apprehended violence order by your former partner, this is the mother of your children?

A.  Yeah, it may have been yeah, I'm not‑‑

Q.  You breached that order is that right?

A.  Not that I'm aware of, no.

Q.  According to this you contravened an apprehended domestic violence order, so an order must have been made which you then contravened, does that bring it back?

A.  No, it doesn't sorry, but, yeah, obviously it happened but, I certainly never put a hand on my, I certainly didn't assault my ex‑wife, yeah there's a lot of it, I watched me mother get, have domestic violence against her all her life and I'll actually step in if I see a man hurting a woman, so, I've never put a hand on her and I know it might have been, there might have been raised voices and spitting up, but it wasn't, no violence involved against a woman.

Q.  This is a nine month suspended sentence, that's not something you give a, that a magistrate gives for angry words?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  You've got no recollection of these events?

A.  No.  I can chase a phone number down if youse want to speak to her or any of the past girlfriends I've had.” (T 79)


	
	I note the plaintiff’s explanation for the charge of assaulting police came when a police officer intervened in a discussion the plaintiff was having with his girlfriend, where he had put his hands on either side of the wall against which the girlfriend was standing. Although the plaintiff clearly had good intentions as a result of his early life experiences, it would appear that when he had been drinking, he was not able to control his conduct towards family members, as this is one of several examples.
	
	
	On 7 February 2005 he was charged with the offence of driving with high-range PCA resulting in a community service order for 250 hours.
	
	
	The plaintiff was charged with other assaults, but could not recall the events in question:
	


“Q.  Do you remember being charged about a year later, on 7 February 2004 at Camden, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm?

A.  What date, sorry?

Q.  February 2004, in Camden?

A.  Yep.

Q.  What happened there?

A.  I said yes, because it's there in front of you.  I don't remember.

Q.  You can't remember?

A.  No.

Q.  You didn't seem to have any trouble remembering the earlier drink driving events?

A.  Yeah.  There's a lot of assault charges on my record, I can't‑‑

Q.  Why is it that some of these ones that are later seem to be causing you difficulty in terms of remembering?

A.  I can't answer that, I'm sorry.

Q.  Could it be you just don't wish to tell the Court?

A.  No, not at all.  I've got nothing to hide.”


	
	The plaintiff agreed he continued to drive while disqualified over this period:
	


“Q.  Do you remember a year later, in February 2005, out at Narromine, or Burke, you were using an unregistered vehicle and driving while disqualified?

A.  Yep.

Q.  Again in February 2005, you're now over 30, aren't you, you're 32?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Six years before the motor accident where you broke your leg?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  You're still driving while disqualified?

A.  Yep.

Q.  You were happy to drive an uninsured motor vehicle?  You have to answer yes or no?

A.  Yeah, I said yes.” (T 80)

(d) Criminal record from 2005 onwards


	
	At about the time the plaintiff came to Sydney, for the period from February 2005 to March 2008, there is a gap in his criminal record. In March 2008, he was charged on two occasions with common assault (although one of these charges was dismissed and no evidence proffered).
	
	
	On the occasion of the second of these assault charges, he also pleaded guilty to a charge of possess prohibited drug and drive with middle-range PCA. He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and lodged a severity appeal.
	
	
	According to the Criminal History entry of 19 November 2009, the conviction was confirmed and his sentence commenced on 21 June 2010 to conclude on 20 September 2010. He was disqualified for a further 3 years commencing 18 November 2009 and concluding on 17 November 2012.
	
	
	Unfortunately, the plaintiff continued to have difficulties, in that he was charged on 13 January 2010 with fraudulent misappropriation in relation to the sum of $2,000 and driving while suspended. He appealed these offences and there was some moderation in the sentence, but the disqualification period was extended from 18 November 2012 to 17 November 2014.
	
	
	On 3 March 2012, a date after the plaintiff’s accident, the plaintiff was charged with offences arising from the circumstances in which he said he threw some cold chips at a taxi driver and refused to pay the taxi fare. The criminal record shows that he was charged with assault; he appears to have refused to pay the taxi fare. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months commencing 20 October 2012 and concluding 19 January 2013.
	
	
	Since 2012 the plaintiff has not committed any criminal offences.
	
	
	Mr McCarthy submitted that a criminal record of this kind was not one that would concern the court, as far worse criminal records were seen in this court’s criminal jurisdiction. Mr O’Keefe describes the plaintiff’s criminal record as “significant” (written submissions, paragraph 29) and one which should be taken into account when determining the percentage of vicissitudes.
	


The plaintiff’s accommodation prior to the accident


	
	The plaintiff was also cross-examined about his accommodation prior to the accident, which consisted of sharing a house with approximately six other persons. He tidied up after himself and shared the use of a bathroom and kitchen. He had no need to make any home repairs, carry out gardening tasks or attend to heavier household tasks such as spring cleaning. There is no evidence he owned any household appliance such as a vacuum cleaner.
	
	
	The plaintiff appears to have lived on his own since the end of his de facto relationship, the date of which is unclear, but which appears to have been prior to 2015. Apart from the four months he lived with his sister (when his housework appears to have been done for him) he appears to have lived in this way, whether alone or in shared accommodation for a considerable part of his adult life.
	
	
	The provisions for the plaintiff’s past and future home care are set out in more detail below.
	


The plaintiff’s pre-accident medical problems


	
	The documents contained in Exhibit 1 show that the plaintiff had not only a longstanding and ongoing dependence upon alcohol which had begun to impact upon him physically but had developed a depressive anxiety condition which was diagnosed in about January 2010. This condition was ongoing and remained untreated at the date of the accident, in part because the plaintiff refused or failed to take medication prescribed. The plaintiff said (at T 116-117):
	


“Q.  Sir, you had no intention of changing your drinking habits at all prior to your motor vehicle accident, did you?

A.  I had intentions.  I was trying.

Q.  How is it that you can sit there on your oath and say you were trying when you didn't even take the Campral medication that had been prescribed for you?

A.  Yeah, I understand that, yep.

Q.  It doesn't sound like you were trying particularly hard, does it?

A.  No.

Q.  It doesn't sound like you were trying at all, does it?

A.  It doesn't look that way.”


	
	This included an admission to hospital in January 2010 in relation to suicide ideation where he left a suicide note (Exhibit 1, p 52). In February 2010 psychologist Jan Roberts prepared a report for the plaintiff’s general practitioner following a referral to her for psychological counselling, describing his condition as one of “depression and anxiety”, saying:
	


“Mr Smith lost his driver’s licence in November 2009 for driving under the influence of alcohol. He lost his licence three times in three years when he was 20 and twice in the last 18 years. He says he has been a heavy drinker from his youth. He says he wants to see a psychiatrist to obtain medication to help him stop drinking. He also admitted it was unlikely he would ever be able to stop drinking, given his long history. Mr Smith has his own air-conditioning installation business but without a driver’s licence he cannot work and faces losing his business.

Mr Smith was depressed about his prospects in court. He believes he will lose his driver’s licence for 8 years and may go to gaol… He sees his future as lost without his driver’s licence…

Mr Smith seemed well aware of his poor prospects in finding employment without a driver’s licence. Mr Smith also seemed aware that he was not likely to give up drinking…” (Exhibit 1, p. 61).


	
	In June 2010 the plaintiff described a suicide attempt to the prison authorities that followed a fight with his “wife”, but the date of this is uncertain (Exhibit 1, p. 78). The plaintiff’s doctor notes a diagnosis of the plaintiff as still having “depressive anxiety disorder” on 27 July 2011 (Exhibit 1, p. 1).
	


Assessing the evidence of the plaintiff


	
	Counsel for both parties paint starkly different pictures, in their submissions, as to the plaintiff’s work history, lifestyle and health prior to the accident. Mr McCarthy submits that the defendant’s submissions completely distort the plaintiff’s evidence by overemphasising the plaintiff’s asserted alcohol problems and criminal record, adding, in his oral submissions, that his client considered that he had been unfairly treated in this regard, in that he should be regarded a witness of credit who honestly admitted to having problems with alcohol and alcohol-related criminal offences, which he considers have now been taken out of proportion.
	
	
	The correct approach for a first instance judge to take when determining issues of credit of a plaintiff in personal injury proceedings has been the subject of a series of observations by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. First of all, the trial judge must engage with the cases presented by each party, as opposed to merely stating that there is no evidence, or not setting out the evidence. Secondly, the trial judge must look at all of the evidence, rather than dismiss it on the basis of preferring the opponent’s case.
	
	
	In The Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14 the New South Wales Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from an assessment of damages because of the inadequacy of the approach of the trial judge to the determination of the disputed issues of fact. The evidence before the trial judge consisted of seven days of trial evidence and “very many” (at [81]) medical reports. It is worth noting that the manner in which those medical reports had been put together by the plaintiff for the Court of Appeal was so inadequate that the plaintiff was ordered to bear the costs of putting this material together, from which I infer that the trial judge was similarly disadvantaged, but this was not referred to as an extenuating circumstance.
	
	
	I also note that, while the Court of Appeal was critical of the way in which the trial judge had approached the analysis of these very many medical reports and the seven days of oral evidence, the Court of Appeal did not suggest that the trial judge disregarded the parties’ submissions on the topics the subject of the disputed evidence, from which I infer that the generalised method of analysis used by the trial judge must have followed similarly generalised submissions of the parties.
	
	
	I raised these issues with Mr McCarthy because the circumstances of this case – an assessment of damages following a motor vehicle accident where the factual issues are the subject of extensive evidence – are very similar to The Nominal Defendant v Kostic. It is essential that I deal with these issues in the manner in which the Court of Appeal has directed trial judges to adopt, namely a careful and objective analysis of the contemporaneous documents as well as the oral evidence, rather than accept submissions that there is “no evidence” or dismiss the defendant’s submissions based on that contemporaneous evidence as irrelevant and instead accept the plaintiff as a witness of credit.
	
	
	While the plaintiff is certainly entitled to make submissions that there is no evidence, or that to pay attention to the defendant’s submissions is to place too much emphasis on irrelevancies, or that the defendant’s claims are unfair, I must still approach the factual issues by dealing with the submissions made by both parties and, in particular, in light of contemporaneous material such as hospital, medical and parole records for the plaintiff. This means I must engage with the defendant’s submissions, especially Mr O’Keefe’s careful written submissions, by analysing them and not simply dismiss them.
	
	
	As to the importance of analysis of submissions, the absence of reference to the submissions of counsel in The Nominal Defendant v Kostic is compelling when compared to Mitchell v Cullingral Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 389 at [118] – [123], where the relevant extracts from counsels’ submissions are set out in detail and were matters clearly put to the trial judge. In Mitchell v Cullingral Pty Ltd, the Court explained the trial judge’s duty as follows:
	


“A trial judge has a duty to refer to material evidence and make findings about material issues in the case: Waterways Authority v Fitzgibbon [2005] HCA 57; (2005) 79 ALJR 1816 at [130] (Hayne J). The absence of such findings and the absence of reference to such evidence can properly be taken as showing that the trial judge has erroneously overlooked or discarded it: ibid; Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 443-444 (Meagher JA); Whalan v Kogarah Municipal Council [2007] NSWCA 5 at [40] (Mason P, Ipp JA and Tobias JA); Najdovski v Crnojlovic [2008] NSWCA 175; (2008) 72 NSWLR 728 at [21] (Basten JA, Allsop P agreeing); Sangha v Baxter [2007] NSWCA 264 at [22] (Ipp JA, Campbell JA agreeing); Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14 at [59] (Ipp JA, Hodgson JA and Campbell JA agreeing). Another way in which this has been put is that the judge must engage with, or grapple or wrestle with, the cases presented by each party: Whalan at [40]; Kostic at [2]. This is not adequately done by setting out the evidence adduced by one side, setting out the evidence on the other side, and saying that the judge prefers one body of evidence to another: Goodrich Aerospace Pty Ltd v Arsic [2006] NSWCA 187; (2006) 66 NSWLR 186 at [28] (Ipp JA, Mason P and Tobias JA agreeing); Kostic at [58].”


	
	I am nevertheless conscious that the impact of the plaintiff’s alcohol intake and criminal record must be treated with caution. The real question is the plaintiff’s work capacity, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in Mahony v Watson [2003] NSWCA 259 at [53], rejecting a finding of failure to mitigate in relation to a plaintiff who had high-range PCA convictions both before and after the compensable accident which had resulted in loss of his licence, and continued to drink alcohol while taking strong pain medication (at [44]).
	
	
	The material tendered by the defendant not only relates to the plaintiff’s criminal record but also contains information about other relevant issues such as his literacy and his drinking habits. The plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities must be viewed in the context of these records, in part because these are records of what he said and did which were prepared by appropriately qualified observers and in part because of the effluxion of time.
	
	
	The defendant, in making submissions that I should approach the fact-finding task in this manner, referred me to King v Western Sydney Local Health Network [2011] NSWSC 1025 at [16] to [19].
	
	
	Taken as a whole, the evidence I have set out above demonstrates that the plaintiff has overstated his working history while minimising his alcohol intake, criminal record and pre-accident depression problems. I accept that some of this may be due to the events in question having happened long ago, or the distress of his accident and injury, or to the difficulties of the court process. However, I cannot accept the plaintiff as a reliable historian or a witness of credit where he has consistently minimised evidence which would reduce his claim for damages.
	
	
	Accordingly, where there is conflict between the plaintiff’s evidence and the matters set out in contemporaneous records, I propose to prefer those contemporaneous records as being. The same is the case in relation to the evidence of the plaintiff’s sisters who, while doing their best to give their evidence honestly, have given evidence which is factually inconsistent with those contemporaneous records and also with the medical and occupational therapy assessments (as is set out in more detail below).
	
	
	Taking those contemporaneous records into account, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has had a longstanding dependence upon alcohol which has directly contributed to his pattern of criminal behaviour, and that both of these factors have played an important role in relation to the depressive anxiety condition which he was diagnosed as suffering from in January 2010. While he did attend a drug and alcohol counsellor on 20 October 2011, rather than pursue the advice or treatment offered to him over a long period (see Exhibit 1, pp 4 and 120), he continued to consume alcohol. Alcohol also played a part in the accident the subject of these proceedings, in circumstances where there is an agreement that his contributory negligence was 60%.
	
	
	This history is relevant the plaintiff’s physical and mental capacity for work, which must be taken into account as to vicissitudes. If the plaintiff’s lifestyle had continued in this way, there would not only be the risk of some other significantly disabling injury of the kind the subject of these proceedings, but also of arrest or conviction for periods of imprisonment which would have severely impacted on his future employability. The plaintiff himself was aware of the poor prospects he had of finding employment without a driver’s licence and of the difficulty he would have giving up drinking, and said as much to the psychologist Jan Roberts (Exhibit 1, p 61).
	
	
	Nevertheless, the plaintiff’s injuries were not only serious but were substantially complicated by the lengthy period of convalescence caused by the failure of the fracture to unite and a series of infections. I now set out the medical evidence in relation to the plaintiff’s injuries and ongoing disabilities.
	


The plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities


	
	The plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities are set out in the statement of particulars filed in these proceedings filed on 24 January 2014. these have been summarised by counsel for the plaintiff in paragraph 7 of his written submissions as follows:
	



	
	Comminuted compound fracture of the left tibia and fibula (Dr Endrey-Walder, Exhibit B 1.1-2 and Exhibit B 2.1);
	
	
	“Potentially catastrophic injury to the occipital condyle which resulted in pontile bleeding” (Dr Endrey-Walder, Exhibit B 1.1-7);
	
	
	Back pain due to “abnormal ambulation” (Dr Endrey-Walder, Exhibit B 1.1-7);
	
	
	Significant wasting of the quadriceps muscle (Dr Endrey-Walder, Exhibit B 1.3-5);
	
	
	Marked patello-femoral arthritis (Dr Endrey-Walder, Exhibit B 1.3-5);
	
	
	Significant reduction of range of movement of left ankle (Dr Endrey-Walder, Exhibit B 1.3-5);
	
	
	Possible facet joint inflammation of the lumbar area secondary to reliance on crutches/walking stick/limping (Dr Endrey-Walder, Exhibit B 1.3-5);
	
	
	Injured nerves and tendons as well as skin grafting (Dr Barold, Exhibit B 1.4-2);
	
	
	Closed head injury with loss of consciousness (Dr Barold, Exhibit B 1.4-8);
	
	
	Mechanical strain injury to the neck and lumbar spine (Dr Barold, Exhibit B 1.4-8);
	
	
	Injury to left knee and ankle (Dr Barold, Exhibit B 1.4-8);
	
	
	Post traumatic degenerative change in left knee and ankle (Dr Barold, Exhibit B 1.4-9);
	
	
	Secondary straining to lumbar spine due to altered gait (Dr Barold, Exhibit B 1.4-9);
	
	
	Unsightly scarring (Dr Barold, Exhibit B 1.4-12) and see also Exhibit E;
	
	
	Memory difficulties “probably multi-determined in their aetiology” (Dr Westmore, Exhibit B 1.7-6);
	
	
	Adjustment disorder with predominantly depressed mood (Dr Westmore, Exhibit B 1.7-6);
	
	
	Significant antalgic gait with external rotation of the left leg with walking (Dr Walker, Exhibit B 2.17-1);
	
	
	Whiplash injury to the cervical spine (Dr R Abraszko, neurosurgeon, Exhibit B 2.18-2);
	
	
	Musculoskeletal injuries to thoracic and lumbar spine (Dr R Abraszko, neurosurgeon, Exhibit B 2.18-2);
	
	
	Headaches (Dr R Abraszko, neurosurgeon, Exhibit B 2.18-2);
	
	
	Successive infections in the course of his fracture healing (Dr Chin, Exhibit B 2.26-1).
	



	
	Some of the items referred to in the statement of particulars are not referred to in this list. I particularly note the following:
	



	
	Osteomyelitis and associated MRSA infection;
	
	
	Paraesthesia in left foot;
	
	
	Constant pain even when at rest and related claims (including inability to undertake “many domestic tasks without excess pain or at all”);
	
	
	Difficulty sleeping;
	
	
	A range of anxiety and depression related problems including interference with sexual relations, reduced enjoyment of usual social relationships, intrusive and traumatic thoughts and dreams regarding the accident; and
	
	
	Necessity to take medication.
	



	
	I have paid close attention to the list provided by counsel for the plaintiff and I have also factored in the list of injuries and disabilities in the statement of particulars where appropriate. I have paid particular regard to the reports of Dr Walker.
	
	
	The defendant lists the plaintiff’s current disabilities as being the following:
	



	
	A left occipital condyle fracture clinically united;
	
	
	Left tibia and fibula fracture complicated by non-union and local infection now resolved;
	
	
	Disuse atrophy of the muscles of the left leg; and
	
	
	Traumatic brain injury of mild degree (now recovered).
	



	
	It is not in dispute that the plaintiff suffered significant injuries, the seriousness of which was compounded by the lengthy period of time over which the plaintiff required treatment. After the plaintiff’s final surgery, his fracture line was still “healing”, according to Dr Walker (Exhibit B, tab 2). While the parties were not able to agree upon the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s disabilities other than the plaintiff’s leg injury, the other medical issues in dispute are essentially whether the plaintiff has sustained a permanent injury to his back as a consequence of altered gait and neck, ankle and left knee problems as well as the plaintiff’s head injury and asserted related memory loss.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submits, and I accept, that there was a period of three years from the date of the accident during which time the plaintiff could not walk independently and was either in a wheelchair, on crutches or requiring the use of a crutch. I accept that he was in severe pain for the whole of this period.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s surgery history may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	17 to 28 November 2011: Following the accident, the plaintiff underwent surgery on 17 November 2011 by Dr Chin and was discharged from Liverpool Hospital in a wheelchair.
	
	
	29 June 2012: The plaintiff underwent an exchange of the left tibial nail and iliac crest bone graft. Broken screws were removed from the pre-existing excisions in the course of this surgery.
	
	
	17 July to 27 August 2012: The plaintiff was admitted to Liverpool Hospital for further surgery by Dr Chin. This was complicated by an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics on during August and September 2012.
	
	
	8 February 2013: The plaintiff was admitted to Liverpool Hospital for further surgery, being the removal of the eye nail. He underwent a left tibial osteotomy and insertion of a TSF frame. He was referred to Dr Walker, his treating orthopaedic doctor but his previous treating surgeon, Dr Chin, in February 2013 because of the infection and the failure of the fracture to unite.
	
	
	2 June to 2 July 2013: The plaintiff was admitted to Liverpool Hospital for surgery under Dr Walker on 6 June, which consisted of removal of the intramedullary rod left tibia, a tibial ostectomy, insertion of antibiotic cemented beads and application of external fixation to the left tibia (see Dr Walker’s report of 30 April 2015 in Exhibit B). During this time he was also examined by Dr Ng, an infectious diseases consultant.
	
	
	2 August 2013: The plaintiff was admitted again to Liverpool Hospital in relation to problems with non-union of his left tibia.
	
	
	22 August 2013: The plaintiff underwent bone grafting (posterior iliac crest) at Liverpool Hospital under Dr Walker. This included adjustment of the external fixation. He attended Dr Walker’s rooms to have the sutures removed on 13 September 2013 and was advised that he would have to remain in the external fixation frame for at least another six months;
	
	
	6 March 2014: The plaintiff’s frame was removed and the plaintiff was placed in a CAM boot. On 11 April 2014, after review by Dr Walker, the plaintiff was advised that further surgery would be required, as a CT scan confirmed that a fracture was still not yet united. He was also suffering from a staph infection, one of several infections he had during his treatment.
	
	
	3 July 2014: The plaintiff underwent further surgery in Liverpool Hospital where a plate was fixed to the left tibia and a bone graft was placed on the posterior iliac crest. The plaintiff was discharged on 8 July 2014.
	



	
	According to Dr Walker’s two letters of 23 August 2016, this 2014 surgery was the end of the plaintiff’s surgical treatment. I note, however, that Mr McCarthy’s submissions identify 10 April 2015 as the last of his multiple surgeries (written submissions, paragraph 59). I accept Mr McCarthy’s statement that the plaintiff’s fracture line was still healing after the surgery of 3 July 2014, but there is no evidence that he underwent further surgery on 10 April 2015.
	
	
	The periods of time during which the plaintiff was in hospital were as follows:
	



	
	17 - 28 November 2011.
	
	
	28 June - 27 August 2012.
	
	
	8 February 2013 and following.
	
	
	2 June 2013 - 2 July 2013.
	
	
	2 August and again for one week later in August 2013.
	
	
	2 - 8 July 2014.
	



	
	These periods are of relevance to the claim for past home care, as no allowance should be made for this while the plaintiff is in hospital: Hill v Forrester (2010) 79 NSWLR 470.
	


The plaintiff’s medical evidence


	
	The extensive amount of surgery that the plaintiff underwent has resulted in a large number of medical records and reports being tendered, although many of these were not referred to. This is a not uncommon situation in personal injury proceedings, as the New South Wales Court of Appeal has noted in many of its judgments (see, for example, Mahony v Watson at [18]).
	
	
	Treating doctors’ reports differ from medico-legal reports in that they are prepared for the benefit of other medical specialists and may be written informally or even hurriedly, or in circumstances of emergency, or on the assumption that the recipient has an understanding of medical issues not referred to in the report but which are necessary in order to interpret the report’s contents. The correct method of analysis of the reports of treating doctors (and the differing approach where the report is a medico-legal report) was explained by the Court of Appeal in Patrech v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWCA 118 as follows:
	


“[88] In my opinion, the above analysis demonstrates that the “consistent picture” that his Honour concluded emerged from the medical reports, that the 2001 court case (and no earlier incident or experience) caused the breakdown in the appellant’s health, is not supported by the medical evidence. It is apparent that in reaching his conclusion his Honour failed to have regard to the purposes for which the particular reports were prepared. The purposes of the reports were various. Apart from the report of Mr Bayliss dated 13 April 2006, which was in response to a request for a report from the appellant’s solicitors, none of these medical practitioners provided medical reports for the purposes of the appellant’s negligence proceedings against the police service. There were also reports between the referring doctor and the treating specialist. Other reports were to the police services’ Health and Workplace Services and to the Workers Compensation Section for the purpose of assessing the appellant’s condition for discharge. Again, others were to State Super, to determine the appellant’s superannuation status.

[89] A trial judge is required to analyse the evidence. That analysis can only be properly undertaken if the evidence, in this case the medical evidence, is considered in its proper context. The trial judge’s assessment of the medical evidence may have been unassailable had the medical reports been medico-legal reports, including medico-legal reports of treating doctors, prepared for the purposes of trial or prepared for the purposes of similar or associated proceedings, such as workers’ compensation proceedings.


	
	While treating doctors are treating the injury, medico-legal reports are focussed upon court proceedings, which may result in the medical practitioner going beyond the medical issues and expressing views which are, for example, irrelevant to the issues or outside their area of expertise. In Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v Meneghello [2013] NSWCA 264, injuries considered comparatively minor by treating doctors were viewed as more serious in certain medico-legal reports which dealt with issues going beyond objective assessment (at [76]), many of which were accordingly given no weight.
	


The evidence of Dr Walker


	
	Dr Walker, the orthopaedic surgeon who took over the plaintiff’s case in February 2013 from Dr Chin because of ongoing problems with his tibia, provided both treating and medico-legal reports summarising the plaintiff’s treatment from that time onwards.
	
	
	In his letter of 15 February 2013 to Dr Ray Chin (who sent the plaintiff to him for a second opinion) he set out the circumstances of the accident and his treatment, noting that his healing was complicated by an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, and went on to say:
	


“His ongoing symptoms include anterior knee pain as well as pain in the tibia with weight bearing. He does also have a background constant pain in the leg. He has had no recent episodes of erythema or discharge to suggest ongoing infection.

On examination today his previous wounds are well healed. There is clinical evidence of infection. He is tender at the fracture site as well as over his fibula fracture site. He is neurovascularly intact. His overall alignment is satisfactory.

His recent plain radiographs show evidence of a previous segmental tibial fracture. The overall alignment is excellent. There is an intramedullary nail in place with no evidence of hardware failure. The fibula has not united and the distal tibial fracture has not united. There is minimal callus around the tibial site suggesting an atrophic non union.

Jeffrey has a non union of his distal tibia. It does not appear to be infected. His fibula has also not united.

Given the timeframe and the appearance of his e-rays I doubt his tibia will heal with further time. No doubt it is reasonable for some of his symptoms. The weight bearing pain he has in the tibia is most likely coming from his non union. His anterior knee pain may be associated with his intramedullary nail.”

(Exhibit B)


	
	Dr Walker went on to describe the surgery alternatives; his next three reports (Exhibit B) set out briefly what occurred.
	
	
	In his letter of 2 December 2013 to the solicitors for “Cbus Claims Services”, Dr Walker provides a summary of these reports, adding:
	


“He remains in his external fixator and he is weight bearing as tolerated. On his latest review his tibial fracture had not united and there were only early signs of union. He remains in his external fixator for an indefinite period of time. He is weight bearing as tolerated in the frame…

With regards to his treatment it is outlined above. As noted he remains in an external fixator and is unable to work at this point in time. He has ongoing pain in the left tibia as well as pain in the ankle and knee. He has a degree of stiffness in his ankle and knee. His ability to mobilise is significantly hampered by the fact that he has an external fixator on. This external fixator has been on for six months. The external fixator makes it difficult for him to mobilise. He would not be able to currently work as an air conditioner installer while he has an external fixator in place….

While he is in the frame he is obviously significantly hampered with regards to his ability to work and overall mobility. When the frame is removed and the tibial fracture has united I suspect he will still have difficulties working as an air conditioner installer. He is likely to have ongoing pain in his tibia to some degree with stiffness in his knee and ankle. Working on building sites and uneven surfaces will be difficult. Working up ladders and in confined spaces will also be difficult. I suspect kneeling will prove very difficult if not impossible for him.

With regard to complicating factors: his two complicating factors have been infection and failure of the fracture to heal. These two complications have prolonged his treatment and prevented any return to work. The fact the fracture in not united is the current complicating factor that is prolonging his treatment.

When his fracture has eventually united the limitations placed on him will be largely depending [sic] on his symptoms. Patients who have had a prolonged period of time treatment [sic] often have difficulties with standing and walking for long periods. They also have difficulties lifting heavy objects. As outlined above kneeling is likely to be difficult for him.

…

His short and long term prognosis is guarded given the fact that his fracture has not united. In the worst case scenario if his fracture were never to united he would be looking at a possible amputation.

I suspect it will be difficult for Mr Smith to ever return to work as an air conditioner installer. His treatment has been prolonged in terms of his tibial fracture and this lengthy period of time will make it difficult to return to previous activities. In particular he will have difficulty with lifting items that are heavier than 10 – 20 kgs. He will have difficulty on uneven surfaces at building sites. I suspect he will have difficulty in confined spaces and kneeling as well as climbing ladders.

Given his other previous jobs including sheet metal working, welding and maintenance worker I suspect he will struggle with most of these labour intensive jobs. His most likely forms of employment in the future will be non labour intensive jobs including roles in a supervisory role [sic] and desk type jobs” (Exhibit B)


	
	Unfortunately for the plaintiff, his fracture did not unite. On 6 July 2014, Dr Walker wrote to the plaintiff’s general practitioner advising that surgery, as opposed to conservative treatment, was therefore necessary.
	
	
	In his report dated 30 April 2015, Dr Walker notes that following this surgery, the plaintiff’s fracture “is healing and should continue to heal”. His ongoing symptoms included significant back pain and pain in his left leg with stiffness in his ankle and subtalar joint. He was able to weight-bear but used a walking stick 60% of the time. Dr Walker went on to note that the plaintiff’s level of permanent disability would not be able to be assessed until his fracture had united, which would be between 12 to 18 months following his last operation in 2014. He did not require any further medical treatment but “improvement with time” and accordingly there were no referrals or medical treatment at that stage.
	
	
	In his most recent report of 23 August 2016, Dr Walker notes that it had been 12 months since he had last reviewed the plaintiff. He did not see what he called “any dramatic improvement” in his symptoms, and that the plaintiff still had significant ongoing back, left knee, left tibial and left ankle pain, using a crutch for most activities outside the house, adding:
	


“I have reviewed his knee, ankle and subtalar joint range of motion.

His left knee has patellofemoral crepitus with a range of motion from 0 to 110 degrees.

His left ankle is stiff with dorsiflexion to 5 degrees and plantarflexion to 20 degrees.

His left subtalar joint has 0 degrees of eversion and 10 degrees of inversion.

His left calf is 1 cm smaller than his right calf musculature.

These equate to mild patellofemoral pain, mild ankle stiffness and mild hindfoot stiffness.

He walks with a significant antalgic gait with external rotation of the left leg with walking. He uses a Canadian crutch most of the time in his right arm.

His ongoing back, knee, tibia and ankle pain are directly related to his initially tibial fracture and the lengthy time required to get his tibia to unite. He had long period of relative immobilisation of the ankle (often in a boot or external fixature) and prolonged period on crutches and non weight bearing. These have contributed to knee, ankle and hindfoot pain and stiffness as well as ongoing back problems.

He has not improved in the last twelve months and is unlikely to ever improve significantly. This is with regards to pain and function, including his gait.

He will not return to his pre injury duties. He will not return to any meaningful manual type work. He will have difficulties negotiating uneven work sites, eg building sites. He will not be able to lift confidently and routinely any significant weight.

His only real work prospects are likely to be desk type jobs for which he has limited education and training. Given significant ongoing pain issues, I suspect even these duties would be difficult on any long term basis.

I do not see any real prospects of him returning to the work force.”


	
	While other doctors expressed views (many in medico-legal reports) as to the plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities, Dr Walker’s reports present a thorough and objective analysis of the plaintiff’s disabilities and should be regarded as the most reliable source for accurate information as to the plaintiff’s disabilities.
	
	
	Dr Walker was cross-examined in relation to these reports, but he essentially repeated these opinions in his answers.
	


The plaintiff’s medico-legal reports


	
	Mr McCarthy particularly draws my attention to the following extracts from medical reports which are relevant to the plaintiff’s earning capacity:
	


Dr Endrey-Walder


	
	Dr Endrey-Walder opines (Exhibit A):
	


“Mr Smith has, of course, had no remunerable work from the day of the accident, and he is certainly to be considered today as totally unfit for any kind of physical activity, whether remunerable or related to his domestic chores, which necessitates him being on his feet for more than a few minutes at a time. He is severely restricted in his ambulation even on flat ground, has great difficulty on uneven ground, cannot climb stairs or inclines without a walking stick, has no capacity for squatting or kneeling on the left knee. He has only ever earned his living as a sheet metal worker and has no experience in work situations that are sedentary/clerical in nature. Given the ongoing medication with narcotic analgesics one would not seriously expect him to be able to undergo vocational rehabilitation at this time”.


	
	Subsequent to Dr Endrey-Walder expressing these views on 28 October 2014, he prepared an updating report in which he referred to reports of Dr Walker and noted that the plaintiff’s tibial fracture was at last healed and “solid” but that he now had significant wasting, patella-femoral arthritis and continued to rely on the Canadian crutch whenever he was out of his home. Dr Endrey-Walder noted that this would hopefully be no longer necessary by the end of the year (i.e. the end of 2015). This appears to be the general view in relation to the plaintiff’s use of a crutch, and is a helpful observation.
	
	
	However, Dr Endrey-Walder’s other observations were of limited utility. He concurred with Ms Patterson’s view that there should be a pain management programme, but did not expose his reasons for doing so. As Ms Patterson made some admissions in court in relation to the contents of that document, this endorsement is not of much assistance. He also made a whole person impairment finding, which is irrelevant, as the plaintiff is not entitled to non-economic loss.
	
	
	Dr Endrey-Walder’s report and evidence in court really add nothing to Dr Walker’s reports. As the treating doctor and the author of a series of careful reports over a period of some years, Dr Walker’s evidence is to be preferred.
	


Dr Barold


	
	Mr McCarthy also asked me to note the following extract from the report of Dr Barold, a rehabilitation specialist, who made the following observations about the impact of the plaintiff’s disabilities on his capacity to work:
	


“With regard to his physical injuries, I consider Mr Smith to be unfit to return to his pre-injury work duties as an air conditioning mechanic and it is in fact difficult to determine as to whether he will ever be able to return to any form of employment in an open and competitive labour market. For the present he should avoid activities which involve prolonged static posturing or forward flexing, repetitive or sustained neck and back flexion and extension, bending, stooping, kneeling and squatting. He should limit the lifting of weights to less than 5kg to waist level only and should sit and stand and take rests as required”.


	
	Dr Barold’s estimates as to the amount of home care the plaintiff would require were essentially abandoned by the parties in favour of Ms Patterson’s report, and the findings as to the plaintiff’s unfitness for his former employment which are set out above are accepted by the defendant. His report was of little assistance.
	


Dr Westmore


	
	Dr Westmore is a highly skilled psychiatrist who is frequently called upon to provide medico-legal reports to the court. His perspective was as follows:
	


“At the time I assessed Mr Smith, I thought his capacity to return to work, from a psychiatric perspective, was moderately impaired as per the current guidelines … should he experience a premature decline in his physical health, such as the onset of early arthritis, then that in turn will obviously impact adversely on his mental state”.


	
	Dr Westmore’s report is relevant to the plaintiff’s claims of depression and other non-physical difficulties and is set out in more detail below.
	


Dr Kai-Lee


	
	Mr McCarthy also drew my attention to the report of Dr Kai-Lee, an orthopaedic surgeon, who gave the following opinion about the plaintiff’s work capacity:
	


“He is not able to work … Mr Smith is a sheet metal worker and working with industrial air conditioning. The job is heavy and requires him to be on his feet all day. After the injury he would not be able to do the job”.


	
	The defendant agrees the plaintiff cannot do this work.
	


Dr Abraszko


	
	Mr McCarthy also refers me to Dr Abraszko, who gave the following opinion about the plaintiff’s work capacity:
	


“He is not fit for work, which includes walking up and down a ladder and on the roof. He is not fit for his pre-injury duties”.


	
	Again, this is agreed.
	


The defendant’s medico-legal reports


	
	The defendant relies upon two reports of Professor Pryor, two reports of Dr Zeman and a report of Dr Newlyn, a psychiatrist.
	
	
	Professor Pryor provides a job skills analysis, noting that the plaintiff’s score fall into the low-average range, which was consistent with his reported educational and employment background and “suggested capacities for successfully completing practically orientated trade level courses” (Exhibit 2, report of 17 November 2011, p 6). He did, however, have “well below average formal reading skills”, although his skills were sufficient for employment.
	
	
	Professor Pryor noted the plaintiff had a pre-injury history of significant adjustment problems associated with alcohol abuse or possible addiction. He noted that “even now as he seeks to play down his past, it still appears that he is drinking excessively at up to 40 drinks per week as he self-reports”.
	
	
	While Professor Pryor noted that the plaintiff had had “a trying time” (Exhibit 2, report of 17 November 2011, p 8) with the surgery, he considered it “disappointing” that the plaintiff was “too busy” to take up an offer for psychological assistance, since he reported that much of his time was spent in bed.
	
	
	Professor Pryor concluded that the plaintiff had a variety of knowledge, skills and abilities and that, while he would not be able to resume his pre-injury employment, he could consider sales and lighter work. A job match report for sales assistant positions and other similar jobs including “a ticket seller, a locksmith and a motor vehicle parts interpreter” is provided, as is a labour market analysis report prepared by a Ms Liz Atteya.
	
	
	Mr McCarthy submitted that I should reject the report of Professor Pryor in its entirety because he is a psychologist and as such he is not possessed of the necessary expertise to comment on jobs suitable for persons with orthopaedic injuries. Only an orthopaedic surgeon or a person with medical qualification would be able to prepare a report of this kind.
	
	
	In Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis [2013] NSWCA 443, Basten JA noted the undesirability of orthopaedic surgeon expressing opinions as to home care when this is work falling within the area of expertise of occupational therapists. By extension, the same would apply to vocational issues. A psychologist such as Professor Pryor has the training to assess intellectual capacity and is also familiar with the job market and job requirements, by reason of the specialist training undertaken by psychologists working in this area of their profession. As to the plaintiff’s physical limitations, Professor Pryor has the advantage of being guided by medical reports on this subject, in the same way that an occupational therapist is guided by medical reports.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Professor Pryor has the expertise to make assessments as to the plaintiff’s employability.
	
	
	The defendant also relies upon the evidence of a medical practitioner who is an expert on rehabilitation medicine, Dr Brian Zeman, who provided two reports dated 28 April 2015 and 24 March 2016. Dr Zeman was also cross-examined.
	
	
	Dr Zeman carried out a physical examination of the plaintiff and obtained a detailed history of the accident, resulting medical symptoms, vocational history and current ongoing disabilities. The vocational assessment involved consideration of the plaintiff’s personal, educational and employment background and the psychometric evaluation of his intellectual skills and personal preferences.
	
	
	Dr Zeman noted that most of the job options he proposed in his previous report could still stand, although the plaintiff seems less motivated. He considered the plaintiff’s most suitable vocational options were likely to be found in the sales worker and labourer categories, and provided a job match on the basis of each of the assessments he carried out. He concluded:
	


“The medical assessment concluded that Mr Smith is fit for light to moderate physical work and sedentary work. His leg fractures have united and any infection has resolved. Some intermittent left neck pain may occur but his pains at this stage depend predominantly on factors unrelated to the degree of underlying organic pathology.” (Exhibit 2, report of 24 March 2016, p 3)


	
	Dr Zeman did not accept that the plaintiff had back pain and altered gait from using crutches (T 251), noting that CT scans had not demonstrated any support for this. He considered that the plaintiff should stop taking Endone and using a crutch. There was “no significant radiological sign of severe osteoarthritis in his knee” (T 256) and his orthopaedic problems have resolved (T 258). In his opinion, as a rehabilitation specialist, the plaintiff is able to perform jobs of the kind outlined by Professor Pryor (T 260 - 264). He considered that Dr Walker’s observations about the plaintiff’s ongoing pain needed to be seen in that context:
	


“I will not agree with Dr Walker's ‑ I can understand why Dr Walker has said that, but I will not agree that there is an ongoing course for significant pain and functional limitations.  Where orthopaedic people have difficulty accepting the pain is a symptom, you know, where this is a physical reason, sure, when there is ‑ when things have built up, there is some problems, but certainly not the problems that he is complaining of or the limitations that he has got at the moment.  I have seen people, right like Mr Smith and they should not be disabled as he claims to be.” (T 259)


	
	Dr Zeman also disagreed with the views of Dr Endrey-Walder (T 264). He was asked:
	


“Q. Why do you disagree with him doctor?

A.  He doesn't have, I mean I feel ‑ I've seen a lot of people who have come back and then mobilise or people after fractures.  And you have some initial problems but unless there is structural damage to the angles of the ankle or the knee then you are able to manage flat surfaces without much difficulty at all.  Uneven surfaces are only a problem if you've got a major problem with the movement of the ankle or the knee.  He doesn't have either of those.” (T 266)


	
	Finally, I note that Dr Newlyn provided a psychiatric report but, in view of my findings in relation to Dr Westmore’s report (see below), it is of little assistance.
	


Assessment of damages


	
	I first note that the parties agree upon the following mathematical issues. The plaintiff was 38 years old and at the date of trial was 43 years old. Given the physical nature of his work, retirement at the age of 67 is likely, resulting in a multiplier of 721.2. He has a life expectancy of 42 years, resulting in a multiplier of 931.6.
	
	
	I set out the parties’ respective damages schedules.

	Before determining the plaintiff’s entitlement to each of the heads of damage sought, I set out the parties submissions as to the correct approach for me to take to the assessment of damages and to issues of contention such as the percentage for vicissitudes, the obligation of the defendant to disentangle causation and the importance (or lack of importance) of the plaintiff’s criminal record.
	


The parties’ submissions as to methods for calculating damages


	
	As is noted in the list of issues at the commencement of this judgment, the plaintiff is not entitled to an award of non-economic loss as he has been medically assessed as not reaching the required threshold under the Act. Each of the opposing parties challenged the other’s method of assessment of damages in relation to earning capacity and vicissitudes. Counsel for the plaintiff also submitted that the defendant had not discharged the onus of untangling the causation chain.
	


The onus of proof


	
	If a plaintiff proves incapacity as a result of the injuries he sustained in an accident, he or she is entitled to damages in respect of the incapacity: Ridolfi v Hammond [2012] NSWCA 3 at [83], going on to note Watts v Rake (1960) 108 CLR 158 at 160 (per Dixon CJ) as to the principles in relation to pre-existing conditions. The defendant bears the onus of establishing that the plaintiff’s loss under the respective heads of damage arise from causes other than the defendant’s negligence: Purkess v Crittenden (1965) 114 CLR 164.
	
	
	In Ridolfi v Hammond, Sackville AJA went on to note (at [87] – [88]:
	


[87] The principles stated in Watts v Rake and Purkess v Crittenden now must be understood in the light of the principles stated in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20 ; 169 CLR 638. These principles were summarised by Ipp JA (with whom Mason P agreed) in Seltsam Pty Ltd v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208, at [103]:

(a) In the assessment of damages, the law takes account of hypothetical situations of the past, future effects of physical injury or degeneration, and the chance of future or hypothetical events occurring.

(b) The court must form an estimate of the likelihood that the alleged hypothetical past situation would have occurred.

(c) The court must form an estimate of the likelihood of the possibility of alleged future events occurring.

(d) These matters require an evaluation of possibilities and are to be distinguished from events that are alleged to have actually occurred in the past, which must be proved on a balance of probabilities.

[88] Ipp JA explained (at [104]–[107]) that:

[104] … Malec has an important bearing, for example, on the way in which a court must determine whether a defendant has discharged the “disentangling” evidentiary burden on it of showing that part of the plaintiff’s condition was traceable to causes other than the accident and that, had there been no accident, the plaintiff would have suffered disability from his pre-existing condition.

[105] Where a defendant alleges that the plaintiff suffered from a pre-existing condition, the evidential onus as explained in Watts v Rake and Purkess v Crittenden remains on the defendant and must be discharged by it. Nevertheless, to the extent that the issues involve hypothetical situations of the past, future effects of physical injury or degeneration, and the chance of future or hypothetical events occurring, the exercise of “disentanglement” discussed in those cases is more easily achieved. That is because the court is required to evaluate possibilities in these situations — not proof on a balance of probabilities.

[106] Without intending to give an exhaustive list of possibilities, it may be that, had the defendant’s negligent act not occurred, a pre-existing condition might have given rise to the possibility that the plaintiff’s enjoyment of life and ability to work would have been reduced and to a susceptibility to further injury; in addition, other causes entirely unrelated to the defendant’s negligent act might have contributed to the plaintiff’s ultimate condition.

[107] Appropriate allowances must be made for these contingencies. A proper assessment of damages requires the making of a judgment as to the economic and other consequences which might have been caused by a worsening of a pre-existing condition, had the plaintiff not been injured by the defendant’s negligence. A pre-existing condition proved to have possible ongoing harmful consequences (capable of reasonable definition) to the plaintiff, even without any negligent conduct on the part of the defendant, cannot be disregarded in arriving at proper compensation.

See also Insurance Australia Ltd v Helou [2008] NSWCA 240 ; 51 MVR 414, at 421–423 [51]–[56], per Campbell JA (with whom Allsop P and Bell JA agreed); Varga v Galea [2011] NSWCA 76, at [51]–[52], per McColl JA (with whom Beazley JA and Handley AJA agreed).”


	
	Although the fact situation in Ridolfi v Hammond was very different, in that the plaintiff suffered from a pre-existing injury (as opposed to the challenge to Mr Smith’s employability and employment history in this case), the statement of general principles is a helpful summary, and both parties relied upon the authorities so helpfully set out and explained in this extract from Sackville JA’s judgment.
	
	
	The defendant’s submission is that in determining disputed issues in the manner advocated by these decisions (such as future effects of physical injury or degeneration, and the chance of future or hypothetical events occurring), the exercise of ‘disentanglement’ is achieved by the court evaluating possibilities in these situations rather than requiring proof on a balance of probabilities. It is submitted that the defendant, having established another cause, such as a pre-existing condition, which contributes to disability, need not establish that the condition in question had made a material contribution to the injury. It is sufficient for the defendant adduce evidence sufficient to displace the inference that the injury suffered was wholly or partly caused by the injury by the defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff submits that the onus of proving a pre-existing condition with any capacity for past or future impact on the heads of damage suffered by the plaintiff always rests with the defendant, citing Watts v Rake at 160.
	
	
	Where the parties differ is not so much in terms of the onus, but in terms of the factual issues, as the plaintiff submits that “the defendant has done no disentangling” (written submissions, paragraph 37) while the defendant submits that he has. The principal issue of contention is the degree to which the defendant has discharged his onus in relation to vicissitudes.
	


Conclusions concerning past economic loss


	
	However, the question of the plaintiff’s past and future earning capacity loss must be determined by assessing the plaintiff’s earning capacity prior to and following the accident by having regard to the actual earnings of the plaintiff (Vosebe Pty Ltd v Bakavgas; Vosebe Pty Ltd v Vapore [2009] NSWCA 117 at [139]). The best evidence is generally the actual earnings of the plaintiff in the years immediately preceding the injury. Accordingly, when assessing both past and future economic loss, I take into account that the plaintiff had the capacity to earn up to $62,400 gross per year as a farm worker but that, since he has come to Sydney and worked in air conditioning installer, the increasingly serious problems of his alcohol triggered criminal activities had begun to impact not only on his work history and also on his health, in that he was diagnosed with depression and found by Centrelink to be unfit for work. In fact the longest period that the plaintiff was continuously employed is approximately 18 months, as counsel for the defendant notes in his written submissions at paragraph 59.
	
	
	Taking into account the actual disruptions of the plaintiff’s working life as I have set out above, I am satisfied that the plaintiff was in fact working for approximately nine months of each year and receiving unemployment benefits or other benefits (such as payment for work in prison) for the remaining part of the year. Taking this into account, I accept the defendant’s figure of $920 net per week as the appropriate measure of his pre-accident earning capacity. I note in particular Mr O’Keefe’s submissions (at paragraph 62) that the amount the plaintiff was paid while employed at Sea-Air was an averaged sum of $1,127 net per week. The plaintiff’s brief period of employment with Complete Air Conditioning (12 October to 23 November 2011) had rates of pay varying between $908 net per week to $1,157.70 net per week, apparently as a result of overtime. While I note the explanation for the plaintiff’s departure from Sea-Air as being due to a lack of full time work, this long period of unemployment in the months before the accident is not the subject of any satisfactory explanation by the plaintiff. I note, however, that between July and August 2011 the plaintiff consulted Dr Michael for his depressive anxiety disorder. It was during this period of time that he assaulted his brother-in-law. The amount claimed by the plaintiff ($1,250 per week) makes no accommodation for any of these significant gaps in the plaintiff’s employment history.
	
	
	However, the figure given by the defendant in the damages schedule, which adopts a baseline earning of $50,000 gross per year (or $1,000 gross per week) for 2.5 years only is, in my view, unacceptably low. I accordingly propose to award past economic loss for 238 weeks at $920 per week, which makes a total of $218,960.
	
	
	Past superannuation at 11.5% is $25,180.40
	


Future economic loss


	
	The defendant concedes that the plaintiff is permanently unfit for work as an installer of air-conditioning and ducting, and for other heavy manual labour of the kind that he performed prior to the accident. The issues for determination are how the plaintiff’s future economic loss should be assessed, having regard to his pre-accident work record, whether the plaintiff has any residual capacity for work and, if so, whether he is capable of any kind of clerical or sedentary work (on the basis that he is “functionally illiterate”), and whether unrelated medical problems (such as his pre-diagnosed depression problems) relevant to his future earning capacity have been established and are of relevance.
	


The plaintiff’s capacity for work other than heavy labouring jobs


	
	In his opening to me, Mr McCarthy stated:
	


“Your Honour, the unfortunate thing with Mr Smith is that he is ‑ I hope he's not offended by this ‑ but he's functionally illiterate.  He has the most borderline reading and writing skills that one could have and still get by in society.” (T 5)


	
	The plaintiff gave evidence that he completed Year 10 and a sheet metal apprenticeship course, but that he was unable to read anything complicated and had never read a book in his life.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s literacy skills were considered by the following experts:
	



	
	Professor Pryor, who noted the plaintiff had well below average reading skills
	
	
	In the Corrections Health Service Reception Assessment dated 15 October 1997 (Exhibit 1, p. 38), the entry “literacy skills” has two alternatives: poor and adequate. The word “adequate” has been circled.
	
	
	I note in the plaintiff’s general practitioner’s Health Care Plan dated 8 February 2010 (Exhibit 1, pages 56 - 7) he answers the question “how well does the patient speak English” with “Very well”. He also records that the plaintiff completed secondary school to year 12. The plaintiff was not asked about this and I assume that this latter entry is a mistake. It is, however, to be noted that the plaintiff’s general practitioner does not record any communication difficulties.
	



	
	The plaintiff has never owned a computer, which counsel for the plaintiff submitted was significant. He was, however, able to use his smartphone to pay bills. He is also able to send and receive text messages.
	
	
	The kinds of jobs proposed by the defendant’s experts do not require computer use. The plaintiff’s statements in evidence that he could not perform any of these jobs is an opinion unsupported by evidence. Nor do I accept his evidence that memory problems he has suffered since the accident would prevent him from working. As noted in my comments concerning Dr Westmore’s report, I am not satisfied that there is any evidence connecting the plaintiff’s memory problems with the injuries he suffered in the motor vehicle accident.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff is not illiterate and that, while his literacy skills are poor, they are sufficient for positions of employment of the kind proposed by Professor Pryor and Dr Zeman.
	


The plaintiff’s other medical problems


	
	Mr O’Keefe submits that the plaintiff’s pre-existing and unrelated medical issues substantially impact upon the plaintiff’s employability both in the past and the future. These are:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s pre-existing problems with depression and anxiety
	
	
	The plaintiff’s pre-existing problems with alcohol
	
	
	The plaintiff’s failure to take necessary medication for his cholesterol problem
	


The plaintiff’s pre-existing problems with depression and anxiety


	
	In January 2010, a little short of two years before the accident, the plaintiff had a series of interviews at Centrelink about obtaining employment, in the course of which he disclosed fortnightly treatment for depression and anxiety as well as two suicide attempts. The plaintiff initially said that he did not remember this:
	


“Q.  You see, I've got a document from Centrelink which is described as a job capacity assessment report with a date on it, 18 January 2010.  Do you remember going and seeing somebody?

A.  No, I don't.

Q.  Do you remember seeing somebody called Michael who was a physiologist at Centrelink in Camden?

A.  No.

Q.  At that time?

A.  No.

Q.  I want to suggest that you did go and see Michael at Centrelink at that time and you told him about your depression?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  You don't have any memory, is that what you're saying?

A.  I don't remember that, no.” (T 131)


	
	The plaintiff then suggested that this report must have been prepared when he was charged with the drink-driving offence for which he was facing a term of imprisonment:
	


“Q.  Michael wrote that you were in this report that you were unfit for working for a period of six months because of your depression?

A.  In 2000?

Q.  In 2010, January 2010?

A.  Right, that must've been when I just got done for DUI.

Q.  Do you remember going to Centrelink at that time and speaking with somebody about your depression, about being unable to work?

A.  No, I don't.

Q.  I won't read all of the document to you but it's on page 4 of the document the following is written ""A medical certificate was supplied by Centrelink.  Mr Smith's treating doctor reported the following health barriers to employment; depression, anxiety.  Treatment consists of counselling with a psychologist and case management by CMH every fortnight.  The medical certificate was completed by Dr Michael on 5 January 2010"".  You were seeing Dr Michael in January 2010, weren't you?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Or you did see him, didn't you?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Do you remember getting a certificate from him and providing it to Centrelink?

A.  No, I don't remember but, yeah.

Q.  Do you remember telling the man at Centrelink in January 2010 that you were getting fortnightly counselling?

A.  No. (T 131 – 2) [Emphasis added]


	
	The plaintiff denied that he had made up these claims in order to obtain Centrelink benefits:
	


“Q.  Could it be that you told this man things that were not true in order to assist you to get some benefits through Centrelink?

A.  I told him that I wasn't going to, told him how I was getting appointments every second week.

Q.  Yeah, because you thought it might assist you in some way?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Are you the sort of person that's willing every now and then to tell an untruth if you think it's to your advantage?

A.  No, not usually.

Q.  You say not usually, are there exceptions when sometimes you are willing to tell a lie to get what you want?

A.  I don't, I'm not a liar, no.

Q.  Mr Smith, in this job capacity assessment report the man, Michael wrote ""During discussions Mr Smith reported that he has suffered from depression for the past six months and has had two suicide attempts in that period and spent time in Campbelltown Hospital following each attempt.  He is case managed by CMH on a fortnightly basis and is seeing a psychologist for counselling""?

A.  Well I did go and see, is that the one you said at Leumeah?  Well I went there and seen a guy so when I told him I was probably booked in to go and see her every week and I told him I went.

Q.  You haven't told us in court in the last two days about going and getting counselling every two weeks, have you?

A.  I told you yesterday when you asked me would I use the money if I got any to‑‑

HER HONOUR: No, that's in the future, that's different.

WITNESS: Yeah, so and I said no because I don't like talking about, yeah.

O'KEEFE

Q.  You weren't going and getting counselling every two weeks after you lost your licence in November 2009, were you?

A.  When I went to Centrelink and told them that I was.

Q.  So you do say now that you did get counselling every couple of weeks, do you?

A.  You told me a minute ago I did.”

Q.  No, sir, what I told you is what was written in a job capacity assessment report by a man called Michael who was writing down what you told him?

A.  Yeah and I said I don't recall going but.

Q.  Are you telling us today that you did in fact go and get counselling every two weeks somewhere after you were caught drink driving in November 2009?

A.  I don't recall doing it, no.

Q.  Isn't it possible that you told Michael at Centrelink that you were getting counselling every fortnight when that wasn't true?

A.  I was probably booked into go and do it at the time when I told him.  I don't go round telling lies.” (T 132 – 3) [Emphasis added]


	
	The plaintiff was also asked about telling the Centrelink psychologist he suffered from panic attacks and hypotension, and about medication he had been prescribed for these conditions:
	


“Q.  Mr Smith, Michael then wrote down this ""Mr Smith mentioned that has a constant depressed mood and frequent panic attacks"".  Remember having panic attacks in 2010?

A.  Don't even know what a panic attack is.

Q.  You remember saying that you had hypertension which was treated with three types of medication?

A.  I've always had hypertension.

Q.  Have you ever taken three types of medication for it?

A.  Not sure, I was taking, I know I was taking two there at one stage and then they changed it all around until they got it right.

Q.  This man, Michael wrote that you said, ""Due to these medications Mr Smith cannot take antidepressant medication as it may cause significant side effects""?

A.  Yeah.  That's what my doctor told me.

Q.  Who told you that?

A.  The doctor that was prescribing me blood pressure tablets.

Q.  Who was that?

A.  I can't recall which doctor at the time I was seeing, either Michael or?

Q.  Dr Michael did prescribe you Pristiq, didn't he, in 2011?

A.  On one occasion, yeah.

Q.  You didn't tell us earlier today that you didn't take the Pristiq because it affected your hypertension medication, did you?

A.  I can't, I can't remember like everything that happened in my life.  I don't know why I didn't take it.

Q.  This man, Michael went on to write this, ""Mr Smith mentioned that he was charged with midrange DUI in November 2009 and has had his licence suspended.  He is to attend court on 27 January 2010 to be sentenced and find out how long his licence will be suspended for"".  Now, that was the case, wasn't it, that information, that's accurate information, isn't it?

A.  Can you read that again, sorry?” (T 132 – 3) [Emphasis added]


	
	The plaintiff agreed that this was accurate. He was then asked about the work history that he had given to the Centrelink psychologist:
	


Q.  ""Mr Smith mentioned that he last worked in November 2009 as an air conditioning mechanic.  He has a trade in sheet metal and refrigeration""?

A.  I have a trade in‑‑

Q.  What I'm suggesting to you, Mr Smith is that that's what you told Michael at Centrelink and that was true, that information, wasn't it?

A.  Last time I worked as a sheet metal worker was in 2009?

Q.  Yeah, this is something you told him in January 2010?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  What I want to suggest to you, Mr Smith, is that as a result of this assessment with this man, Michael a decision was made to find that you were unfit for work for the purposes of Centrelink and for getting Centrelink benefits in January 2010?

A.  Did I work in that time?

Q.  I'm asking you, did you?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.  Did you also get benefits from Centrelink during that time?

A.  I don't recall.  I would not if I was working I wouldn't have been.

Q.  On page 3 of the report Michael wrote ""Jeffrey Smith is a 36 year old male who lives in Narellan Vale, New South Wales who suffers from depression, anxiety, inclined to report of hypertension"", that's all accurate, isn't it?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  ""Mr Smith was referred for a JCA, a job capacity assessment by Centrelink with NSA, incapacitated MC lodge for reason for assessment"", I'm not sure what that means.  He then wrote ""During the assessment Mr Smith was very compliant and positive about participating in discussions about his medical condition and its effects on his daily and working life.  Mr Smith attended the interview on time and has heard the client information sharing document after discussing the reasons for his job capacity assessment"", can you remember me having read that to you having any of these discussions with the man called Michael?

A.  No, I don't.

Q.  Did you have any more counselling with a psychologist or any other person between the beginning of January 2010 and when you went to gaol in June 2010?

A.  Only those ones you just talked about earlier.  It's all confused.  I don't even know when you're talking about.” (T 134 – 5) [Emphasis added]


	
	As the highlighted passages demonstrate, the plaintiff underwent a job capacity assessment, armed with a letter confirming his medical issues prepared by his general practitioner, and was certified as unfit for work by Centrelink as a result. I have set out this section of the evidence at some length so that the plaintiff’s reluctance to admit to these events can be seen in context.
	
	
	The plaintiff was undoubtedly very concerned about the criminal proceedings he was facing, which were certain to result in a gaol term, as well as distressed about a failed relationship. The hospital records confirm the suicide attempt he made, and his level of distress at the time was clearly high. He was, however, certified as unfit for work by Centrelink, and that is a relevant factor in terms of causation.
	
	
	Dr Westmore, assessing the plaintiff as suffering from and adjustment disorder with predominantly depressed mood, had none of this information before him. He knew nothing of the plaintiff’s criminal history and its relationship with alcohol abuse, or of his prior history such as suicide attempts; to the contrary, he was told that the only incident of note in the plaintiff’s past mental health history was problems following the breakdown of the plaintiff’s relationship with his partner a decade ago. He was also told that the plaintiff was “generally a social drinker” thought there has been “some history of occasional bingeing” (21 July 2015 report, page 4). Even the circumstances of the accident were glossed over; Dr Westmore records the information he received as being that the plaintiff had gone out for dinner after work and had been walking home with a mate when the accident happened (page 2 of the 21 July 2015 report).
	
	
	In Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [67], Heydon JA noted that if an expert has been misinformed, the report is likely to be valueless. Dr Westmore’s diagnosis of the plaintiff’s adjustment disorder and comments about the plaintiff’s medical problems are without value for this reason. This means that I do not accept that there is any basis for the plaintiff’s claims of adjustment order or forgetfulness and that these are not factors to be taken into account either in relation to his economic loss claim or (in relation to the issue of forgetfulness) in relation to his claim for domestic assistance.
	
	
	The parties addressed me about this issue in relation to both future economic loss and vicissitudes. It would amount to double counting against the plaintiff to take this issue into account in both determining his future economic loss and his vicissitudes.
	
	
	A medical condition which results in the granting of a pension or a certificate of unfitness for work relates to future earning capacity. The plaintiff’s problems with depression are thus issues relevant to his future earning capacity. By comparison, his problems with alcohol (and their interaction with criminal behaviour) are matters relevant to vicissitudes.
	


The plaintiff’s drinking habits


	
	I first note that Mr McCarthy submitted that there was no evidence (and in particular no expert evidence) to suggest that the plaintiff’s drinking habits in any way impinged on his work capacity and/or impeded his recovery and/or were relevant to vicissitudes. He particularly drew my attention to the following:
	



	
	The defendant “has served no evidence to prove that the plaintiff’s consumption of alcohol did in the past, or would in the future, have led to interruptions in his working life” (written submissions, paragraph 37). To the contrary, the plaintiff’s working history demonstrates regular employment for long periods and his fellow worker, Mr Kohlenberg, described the plaintiff as a very good worker for the time that they worked together (22 February – 28 June 2011). There was no evidence of regular absences (or indeed any absences) due to alcohol abuse and Mr Kohlenberg was completely unaware of any occasion of excessive alcohol intake by the plaintiff.
	
	
	There was no evidence, expert or otherwise, that the plaintiff was any different from “thousands of Australians who drink a lot of alcohol”, including “members of our own profession” who drink more than medicinally recommended rates without their ability to perform their day jobs being affected (written submissions, at 38 – 39).
	
	
	The “inconvenient truth” for the defendant was that the plaintiff told his doctor shortly before the accident that he had “vastly decreased his alcohol consumption” (written submissions, at paragraph 40), in that he was only drinking 6 drinks on 1 – 2 days a week.
	
	
	Since the accident the plaintiff had voluntarily reduced his intake of alcohol and was now only drinking very moderately.
	



	
	The defendant submits that the plaintiff has a twenty-year history of alcohol abuse, coupled with a refusal to take medication prescribed for it or to attend counselling and that, like his depression and anxiety problems, his drinking problem remains unresolved (written submissions, paragraphs 30 – 39). This has included being less than frank with his medical practitioners about the nature and extent of his drinking habits (written submissions, paragraph 39) and is now complicated by his continued taking of Endone.
	
	
	Professor Pryor’s observations as to the likely extent of the plaintiff’s drinking problems are also of relevance.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has a lengthy history of alcohol abuse which, prior to the accident, began to impact upon his earning capacity and which would have increasingly curtailed his capacity for employment as he grew older, as well as exposing him to risks. However, I have only taken this factor into account in relation to the percentage for vicissitudes. I have determined his future economic loss by having regard to his past work history, not his problems with alcohol.
	
	
	This brings me to the plaintiff’s submission that any residual earning capacity the plaintiff has is effectively valueless because he is now chronically unemployed and unemployable as a result of his leg injuries, whatever pre-existing medical problems he may have had.
	


When does a plaintiff’s theoretical earning capacity have no value?


	
	While the plaintiff may in theory have a residual earning capacity, that does not necessarily mean that this capacity has that same value, or even any value at all.
	
	
	In Mead v Kearney [2012] NSWCA 215 the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a decision of Garling J holding that the plaintiff’s theoretical earning capacity had no value in circumstances where there was no reasonable prospect of the plaintiff obtaining work to exploit that theoretical capacity. The facts in that case were similar to the present; the plaintiff had a serious leg injury which left him with a limp as well as an ongoing depressive disorder and, as he lived in a small country town, work prospects were poor. Garling J stated:
	


“[190] It is necessary for a plaintiff to prove the loss for which compensation is claimed: Todorovic v Waller (1981) 150 CLR 402 at 412–413, however conversely, it is not incumbent upon the injured plaintiff to prove what employment he or she “is not [in]capacitated from performing”. It is for a defendant who contends that the plaintiff has a residual earning capacity to adduce evidence of what the plaintiff is capable of doing and what jobs are open to such a person: Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death (4th ed) at [118 [1.9.20]].

[191] This approach was referred to with approval in Magnou v Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd [2007] NSWCA 357 at [20]. I will consider these questions with the question of onus in mind.”


	
	Garling J assessed the plaintiff’s “theoretical work capacity” at 40% but then proceeded to determine whether the plaintiff could practically utilise that capacity to obtain work in the geographic area in which it was reasonable for him to seek work, an approach approved by the Court of Appeal in Nominal Defendant v Livaja [2011] NSWCA 121 at [65]. Having found that there was no realistic prospect of finding any suitable work in the area where the plaintiff lived, Garling J assessed the plaintiff’s earning capacity at nil. The defendants appealed on the basis that the trial judge had discounted evidence that the plaintiff could drive to Mudgee and obtain work there.
	
	
	Macfarlan JA, dismissing the appeal, held the evidence of the plaintiff’s difficulty for the four years prior to the trial supported the argument that no practically available work for which the plaintiff’s residual earning capacity could be exercised. The plaintiff had given evidence was that he had sought assistance from two rehabilitation providers, undertaken courses, read newspapers and looked on the internet for jobs advertisements and performed voluntary work, all without success. The defendants did not plead that the plaintiff failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate his loss in the period prior to the trial (I note no such claim has been made here either).
	
	
	Macfarlan JA held that the plaintiff’s efforts showed that he had really tried to get work but had been unsuccessful. Thus, without evidence that the plaintiff’s condition would improve in the future or be accommodated by future employment markets, the trial judge had correctly held that the plaintiff’s theoretical residual earning capacity would be of any use to him in the future.
	
	
	However, the court also endorsed the approach taken in Nominal Defendant v Livaja, namely that, in determining a plaintiff’s residual earning capacity, regard must be had to whether there is a practical likelihood of the plaintiff exploiting their “theoretical earning capacity” by obtaining work in the vocations which he or she may be theoretically capable of performing. This means that a defendant must not only adduce evidence of vocations are practically open to the plaintiff (not only geographically, but also having regard to the plaintiff’s personal circumstances, age and level of education and skills) in order to discharge the onus. It is not sufficient merely to adduce evidence of the range of vocations open to a plaintiff in order to discharge the onus of establishing that a plaintiff has a residual earning capacity.
	
	
	Mr McCarthy put each of the proposed forms of employment to the plaintiff, who said he would not be able to perform any of them. Mr McCarthy relies upon the plaintiff’s statements to this effect, and the evidence of Dr Walker that the length of and complexity of the plaintiff’s recovery means that whatever the plaintiff’s theoretical earning capacity would be, it effectively has no value.
	
	
	However, there is no evidence in these proceedings of the kind available in Nominal Defendant v Livaja as to geographical work problems. The defendant has discharged the onus of finding vocations open to the plaintiff which relate to his age, education and personal circumstances. Dr Walker’s observations as a surgeon that patients with long recoveries such as the plaintiff has had are of some empirical value, but the evidence of the experts in this field, Professor Pryor and Dr Zeman, is compelling, and their opinions (unlike those of Dr Walker) are within their level of expertise.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I do not accept that the plaintiff is incapable of working and that his future economic loss should be assessed on that basis. He still has a residual capacity for work, and I consider that the future economic loss estimates made by the defendant reflect both his future work capacity and a reasonable estimate of his residual work capacity.
	


Future economic loss


	
	Section 126 of the Act sets out the obligations for the plaintiff to satisfy the court as to his most likely future circumstances in terms of work capacity but for the injury whereas s 126(2) requires an adjustment. This requires the court to make findings as to the plaintiff’s most likely future circumstances on the basis that the injuries for which compensation is sought has not occurred.
	
	
	Accordingly, what I must do is make a finding as to the plaintiff’s future economic loss along the same lines as that I make for past economic loss and then, in accordance with s 126(2), allow for vicissitudes.
	
	
	The plaintiff claims future economic loss at the rate of $1,200 per week on the basis of the plaintiff’s earnings as an air conditioning installer. Despite the patchy working history of the plaintiff and his relatively short career in air conditioning installation, there is no allowance for periods of unemployment.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff does in fact have a residual capacity for work, and that the estimates given by the defendant are supported by the reports of Professor Pryor and Dr Zeman. It was not only Dr Zeman’s view, but also that of Dr Walker, that the plaintiff needed to stop taking addictive pain medication and using a crutch. Dr Zeamn said that the plaintiff’s complaints of pain and altered gait from crutches should no longer be a medical issue as his orthopaedic problems had resolved and there was no evidence on CT scans of significant problems. I am satisfied that the evidence of Professor Pryor and Dr Zeman as to the plaintiff’s future earning capacity should be accepted.
	
	
	The defendant, on the basis of this evidence proposes $1,000 net per week for two years while the plaintiff undertakes pain management and substance abuse withdrawal, followed by an assumed $250 per week residual earning capacity for some form of part time sedentary or unskilled work.
	
	
	The figure of $1,000 net per week, which is based on the plaintiff’s actual earning capacity, adopts the observations of Basten JA in Vosebe Pty Ltd v Bakavgas; Vosebe Pty Ltd v Vapore at [139]. I accept that this is the most accurate way to determine the plaintiff’s future earning capacity. As is set out in the schedule of damages, this adds up to $565,779, subject to a deduction for vicissitudes which is discussed further below.
	


Future superannuation


	
	The plaintiff proposes future superannuation at a figure of 13%. The defendant proposes 12.5%, noting that if the plaintiff had been self-employed in the future, as he had been in the recent past, no allowance would be made for those periods.
	
	
	The plaintiff gave no evidence (and was not cross-examined upon) what superannuation arrangements he had for the period of time he was self-employed. Common sense dictates that most self-employed persons arrange their own superannuation as part of their taxation structure. Accordingly, I propose to allow for future superannuation but at the rate of 12%.
	


The parties’ submissions as to allowance for vicissitudes


	
	Calculation of future economic loss must take account future contingencies such as sickness, accident, unemployment and industrial disputes. The effect of contingencies must be taken into account on the facts of the individual case: General Motors-Holden Pty Ltd v Moularas (1964) 111 CLR 234; [1965] ALR 646. This is a separate task from the consideration of the quantum of future economic loss.
	
	
	Although Mr McCarthy points out in his written submissions that an allowance for vicissitudes need not be made at all, New South Wales courts have generally adopted a convention of reducing the award for future loss of earning capacity by 15%, which is the position the plaintiff takes in these proceedings. However, the courts making these determinations acknowledge that there may be circumstances justifying a departure from this figure to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the facts of the case. In the present case, the defendant submits that the percentage for vicissitudes should be in the order of 40 – 50% (written submissions, paragraph 83).
	
	
	The 15% discount is departed from only in very clear cases. In FAI Allianz Insurance Ltd v Lang [2004] NSWCA 413 at [18], Bryson JA stated:
	


“[18] The Trial Judge adopted the conventional 15% without discussion or articulation of reasons. This is the usual course. The range of contingencies and vicissitudes allowed for by the conventional allowance of 15% is very wide; it is an expedient and approximate resolution of many imponderables, and the difficulty of producing a justification for any greater or lower figure in a particular case tells strongly against departing from the conventional figure.”


	
	In Wynn v New South Wales Insurance Ministerial Corporation (NSW Court of Appeal, 11 August 1994) the Court increased an estimate of 5% for vicissitudes to 15 %. While Mr McCarthy is correct to submit that vicissitudes could technically not be awarded at all, or for a figure below 15%, the Court of Appeal’s approach demonstrates that 15% is not the maximum figure, but the most likely figure (This decision has been trenchantly criticised - see for example, Graycar R, “Damaged Awards: The Vicissitudes of Life as a Woman” (1995) 3 TLJ 160 - but not on grounds relevant to the issues in these proceedings).
	
	
	Cases involving increased percentages for vicissitudes generally result from fact situations where there is a pre-existing medical condition. For example, in Woolage v NSW [2001] NSWCA 256 a trial judge’s deduction of 30%, taking into account the extent of the appellant’s pre-existing back condition, was not disturbed on appeal. However, the percentage has also been increased where a party has a criminal record, a substance abuse problem, or both.
	


Increasing vicissitudes where the plaintiff has a criminal record


	
	The combination of a pre-existing medical condition and other factors (such as a poor work history and involvement in crime-related activities) may result in larger percentages. In State of New South Wales v Maxwell [2007] NSWCA 53 the plaintiff, a prisoner, was injured while working in gaol. A significant increase from 15% to 50% was warranted because of the many relevant factors, namely his poor work record, criminal background, drug-taking, anger management and a pre-existing back condition.
	
	
	The Court explained its reasons for this increase as follows:
	


“[113] However, the appellant is on firmer ground in its submission that her Honour erred in making no allowance for the difficulties that the respondent would have encountered, even if uninjured. He would have needed more than favourable references from within the prison system to get anywhere near maximising the earning capacity inherent in his formal crane-driving qualifications. Even as an unskilled labourer he would have had difficulties in securing and retaining employment in light of his criminal record and his personal disposition.

[114] One hopes that this comparatively young man will readjust his lifestyle and climb out of his long pattern of drug dependency and associated criminality. There have, however, been incidents since his release from prison indicating that controlling anger and avoiding the use of illegal drugs remains a significant problem. And it is to be expected that some prospective employers will shy away from engaging him, at least in the short term until he (hopefully), builds up a record of responsible employment.

[115] These difficulties ought to have impacted on the awards for past and future economic loss.

[116] Neither party seeks a new trial unless it is unavoidable. The Court must do its best to determine what awards are justified.

[117] More than the pre-existing back problem should have been allowed for by way of “vicissitudes”, assuming the conventional model of calculating economic loss by reference to the balance of an anticipated working life as a certificated crane operator. We think that 50% reduction in the award would more accurately reflect the probable loss stemming from all of the circumstances.

[118] A 50% reduction in the award for past economic loss is also justified on similar reasoning.”


	
	A record of prior imprisonment is similarly accepted as a relevant factor to take into account. In Taupau v HVAC Constructions (Qld) Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 293 at [196], a decision I drew to the attention of the parties, Beazley JA noted that, although there had not been any challenge to the plaintiff’s evidence that his criminal activities and imprisonment had not affected his ability to find work, “given the interruptions to his employment because of periods of home detention and imprisonment, it would not have been inappropriate to take that factor into account by way of a vicissitude”, and the court accordingly assessed that vicissitude at 25% (at [214]).
	
	
	A history of drug or alcohol abuse may also be of relevance; in Kwong v Abdulwahab [2016] NSWCA 107 the trial judge increased vicissitudes to 25% for this reason and, while the Court of Appeal made a minor adjustment of $10,000 to the damages awarded, this reasoning was not the subject of challenge.  
	
	
	As already noted, counsel for the plaintiff submits that there has been an overemphasis on the plaintiff’s criminal record; many of the offences were committed when he was a young man and none of the offences could be called “very serious”, in that the most serious prison sentence he received was a six-month drink-driving sentence and in his entire life he has spent only nine and a half months in gaol in relation to three comparatively minor offences (written submissions at paragraph 42). The plaintiff is no “a hardened criminal the likes of which the Court routinely encounters in its criminal jurisdiction”. It would be impermissible for the court to speculate that he would be sent to prison again, especially as he has kept out of trouble since the last offence for which he was imprisoned, namely the assault on the taxi driver.
	
	
	While the plaintiff has been sentenced in relation to four drink driving offences, none of these involved accidents or injury, and counsel for the plaintiff submits that it would be mere speculation to assume that he would be involved in another accident. The only drink-related accident he has ever had is the accident the subject of these proceedings, for which the defendant is 40% to blame (written submissions at paragraphs 44 – 45). Nor have there been any work injuries.
	
	
	All of the defendant’s medical evidence points to the plaintiff having a significant alcohol problem and the material in Exhibit 1 demonstrates that this has led to increasingly serious problems in relation to alcohol related criminal offending. The percentage for vicissitudes was increased to 25% in both Taupau v HVAC Constructions (Qld) Pty Ltd (due to the plaintiff’s criminal activities) and in Kwong v Abdulwahab (due to substance abuse). In these proceedings, both these factors are present. Taking all of the above into account, I propose to increase the percentage for vicissitudes to a figure above 25%. I do not consider, however, that this is a case comparable to State of New South Wales v Maxwell where vicissitudes were increased to 50%, where the plaintiff not only had a criminal background and drug taking problems but also anger management and a pre-existing back condition. Accordingly, I propose to increase the percentage for vicissitudes from 25% to 35%. The amounts awarded for future economic loss set out above should accordingly be reduced by 35%.
	
	
	This brings me to the issue of home care.
	


Home care


	
	The following evidence is relevant to this determination:
	



	
	The evidence of the plaintiff and his sisters;
	
	
	The expert evidence of the occupational therapist, Ms Jackson;
	
	
	Views expressed by medical practitioners, where it is appropriate to have regard to them.
	


The plaintiff’s sisters’ evidence


	
	Both the plaintiff’s sisters gave evidence of a long and close relationship with the plaintiff. In February 2011, about two months after his release from gaol, the plaintiff went to live with his sister Rebecca and her family. He remained there until July, when an incident with his brother-in-law resulted in some criminal charges and an apprehended violence order was put in place, following which the plaintiff left to live in share accommodation. Whatever these past problems may have been, the plaintiff returned to live with his sister Rebecca after his discharge from hospital and remained living there until he moved into a three-bedroom townhouse.
	
	
	I briefly note the submissions of the parties as to this evidence. Counsel for the plaintiff stated that these “credible and reliable” witnesses (written submissions, paragraph 65) had not been challenged as to credit other than matters “faintly” put to Ms Jackson, concerning which her denial of “any elaboration” should be accepted. Counsel for the defendant submitted that they never seen him perform even simple household activities such as picking up items from the floor or driving his car were inconsistent with the medical evidence, that the amount of cleaning they claimed to do was excessive and that their evidence was coloured in that they were “self-interested in a particular result” (written submissions, paragraphs 25 – 27).
	
	
	Although Rebecca had only seen her brother a few times a year prior to his moving to Sydney in 2005 – 6 (T 195), she had been in regular contact with him since that time, during the whole of which time she said he was in full employment:
	


“Q.  Ms Jackson, in the time you have known your brother but zeroing in on the last ten years, aside from the periods when he has been injured and before when he was in gaol, have you ever known him to be in any form of long‑term unemployment?

A.  No.” (T 195)


	
	In cross-examination she agreed there had been periods of time when the plaintiff was unemployed:
	


“Q.  Were you aware that he applied for and obtained unemployment benefits for a period of possibly an entire year in 2005/2006?

A.  No, I wasn't aware.

Q.  You were aware that he obtained unemployment benefits from the government at other times after 2005 and before 2011?

A.  I know there was a couple of times in between jobs finishing and starting for a small period of time but‑‑

Q.  What do you say is a small period of time?

A.  Offhand a couple of months.  I don't know exactly .

Q.  Wasn't that a pattern of employment that was the norm for your brother that in the last two or three years before this motor vehicle accident he had periods of a couple of months off between jobs that lasted for four or five months?

A.  No, not true.

Q.  Wasn't it the case that he had at least six months off in 2010 because he was in gaol?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And isn't it the case that after he got out of gaol he was unemployed for about six to eight weeks?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And isn't it he case that he was unemployed for about two months in July and August 2011 just a few months before the accident?

A.  I'm not aware of that one.” (T 196)


	
	Ms Jackson described the plaintiff coming to her home regularly on weekends to interact with her sons (T 177) and to help her husband with work on the house that they had purchased, although this latter assistance must relate to the same time that the plaintiff moved in with them in February 2011, as this was stated to be to help them with the mortgage because they had just “recently” (T 198) purchased a house. She did not appear aware that at all relevant times the plaintiff was coming to her house he did not have a driver’s licence and did not know that he had been unemployed before coming to live with her (T 198).
	
	
	Ms Jackson regarded the dispute between her husband and the plaintiff as a minor matter:
	


“Q.  What happened?

A.  It was just basically over something small.  I was at work so I wasn't there.  They had a disagreement regarding the yard.  The boys had burnt some wood that my husband wasn't impressed with and they just had a few words over that, from what I was told, and got a bit physical, but nothing.

Q.  When you say got physical who got physical?

A.  Jeff got physical and my husband a little bit as well, they both just had a little bit of a I guess you could say a little bit of punch and yeah, over and done with type thing like overnight but.

Q.  Before that happened to your observations were Phil and Jeff good mates?

A.  Yeah, and they still are.

Q.  How long did it take for them to patch up their relationship, as far as you could see?

A.  A couple of days, but nothing really, yes.

Q.  Do you know how the police became involved in that?

A.  I'm not sure who called them, maybe a neighbour from what I understand.  Like I said I was at work, I wasn't actually present at the house when it happened but from my understanding it was the neighbour.” (T 177)


	
	In cross-examination Ms Jackson acknowledged that following this incident the plaintiff was charged as well as being the subject of an AVO, but would only concede that it was “partially” (T 198) for this reason that he moved out of her home.
	
	
	Ms Jackson is a loyal sister who did her best to put her brother in a good light. The objective circumstances of the charges and the plaintiff’s departure from her home show that it was not correct for her to describe these events as “nothing”. The degree of separation between Ms Jackson and the plaintiff after these events is hinted at when Ms Jackson acknowledges that between the July assault and the November accident she visited him “a little bit” (T 178) and was unaware that he was unemployed for most of this period (T 196).
	
	
	Ms Jackson knew very little about her brother’s prior criminal history or even about the charges brought against him during or shortly after the time he had been living in her home, including his lengthy disqualifications from driving:
	


“Q.  Are you aware that he was also involved around that time in assaulting a taxi driver?

A.  No.

Q.  You are aware of course that he went to gaol for three months in 2012, aren't you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is your understanding of a reason why he was gaoled at that time?

A.  I'm not sure.

Q.  You have given evidence that you are very close, you, your sister and your brother, haven't you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Yet you tell us this morning you're not sure what he went to gaol for in 2012, is that your evidence?

A.  But I'm not sure.  I'm not going to guess.  I don't know.

Q.  Are you aware that your brother was receiving counselling for alcohol abuse in 2011?

A.  Yes.

Q.  The fact is that your brother had a real problem with drinking alcohol to excess and getting into trouble, didn't he?

A.  Sometimes.

Q.  It had led to him losing his licence for driving whilst intoxicated and driving whilst disqualified, hadn't it, before this accident?

A.  I'm not sure.

Q.  Did your brother drive a car during 2011 before the motor vehicle accident?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Were you unaware that during 2011 before the motor vehicle accident your brother had his licence disqualified?

A.  I wasn't aware, no.” (T 199)


	
	Ms Jackson gave evidence that she had to drive her brother to appointments because of his medical problems, not because he was disqualified from driving. She acknowledged, in addition, that the plaintiff had purchased a car for himself, although she claimed never to have seen him drive it and did not know why he had purchased it:
	


“Q.  You have told an occupational therapist that you have had to drive your brother to various appointments following his injuries, haven't you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Were you aware during the time that you did so that your brother's drivers' license was disqualified?

A.  I'm not sure.

Q.  Cancelled?

A.  No I wasn't.

Q.  Do you know whether since the motor vehicle accident your brother has purchased motor vehicles?

A.  Yes.  He has.

Q.  Has he driven those motor vehicles?

A.  Not that I've seen.  No.

Q.  Have you ever asked him why he purchased motor vehicles since the accident?

A.  No.

Q.  Did you assume that he purchased motor vehicles so that he could drive?

A.  No.” (T 202)


	
	At T 202-203, Mr O’Keefe put it to Ms Jackson that she obviously loved her brother and was concerned to help him. While this statement is relevant to the question of whether there has been some exaggeration, it is also self-evident, from Ms Jackson’s family’s willingness to have the plaintiff live in her home for twelve months and to look after him carefully, that the principal reason for this was the affection Ms Jackson had for her brother.
	
	
	When the plaintiff came to live in her home after discharge from the hospital on 28 November 2011, Ms Jackson gave him one of her son’s bedrooms (her sons “doubled up” over this period: T 179). She and her husband worked different shifts and they spent several hours a day ministering to the plaintiff’s needs. She was assisted by her sister Tammy in the late afternoons and on the weekend “to give me a little bit of a break” (T 182). It would be fair to say that the whole family made sacrifices over this whole period. The extent of the care is set out in detail in the occupational therapist’s report and while the nature of some of the work carried out (for example, gardening) is challenged, the parameters of the home care claim for this period are largely conceded.
	
	
	The plaintiff moved out of her home after nearly twelve months and went to live in a townhouse. Ms Jackson said that she continued to perform the same amount of work, visiting him 3 – 4 times a week:
	


“Q.  In terms of what you did for him over there, was it similar to what you did for him at your own home or different?

A.  Similar.

Q.  To your observation did his mobility improve?

A.  Not really, no.

Q.  Can you estimate how much time on average per week you spent doing things just on Jeff's behalf rather than anyone else's behalf of the nature which you were doing for him at your house?

A.  I'd say about, still about 15 hours a week, I spent over there doing housework and cleaning, meals.

Q.  You'd visit your brother those three or four times but is it the case that not the whole of that period was spent actually working, some of the time spent socialising?

A.  The majority of the time was working, yeah, often we might sit down for 20 minutes to half an hour and have a cup of coffee in that time, but, generally I was over there to help him.

Q.  If you had to carve out from the 15 hours or so a week, the time spent just having a chat or socialising or comforting him or just keeping him company, how many hours would that carve out?

A.  I would say two hours.” (T 184)


	
	Ms Jackson’s account of her work for her brother (whom she described as remaining in bed and unable to perform any tasks) remaining the same after he moved was as follows:
	


“Q.  Are you sure you're not embellishing the amount of time that you've spent performing various activities for your brother?

A.  No I don't.  No I didn't.

Q.  You gave evidence yesterday about how much time you spent doing things for your brother whilst he was living at your home.  Can you recall when it was the he ceased to live at your home?

A.  No I can't recall it.

Q.  You don't know?

A.  No.

Q.  You gave evidence that you'd spent it was about 12 hours I think it was a week doing things for your brother at his unit in Campbelltown, is that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That was your estimate?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What were you doing that took 12 hours a week?

A.  I did a lot actually.  I was washing, I was ironing.  I was washing dishes, mopping floors, cleaning toilets, cleaning showers, changing beds, assisting him with medication.  Going to the shops and getting him his medication when he'd run low.  Just being there to do whatever needed to be done because at the time he was in bed most of the day.” (T 205)


	
	It was put to her that the level of helplessness she attributed to the plaintiff was greater than that observed by the occupational therapist:
	


Q.  …Are you aware that when the occupational therapist went in April 2015 he could reach up to the clothesline?

A.  No.  I wasn't aware, no.

Q.  Had you ever seen him do that when you've been there?

A.  No.

Q.  Were you aware that when the occupational therapist was there, and I'm sorry, I have been saying, pardon me for one moment.  I've been saying April 2015 whereas the assessment was on 21 May 2015.  There was only one wasn't there?  By Ms Patterson that you're aware of?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Were you aware that during the assessment by Ms Patterson your brother was able to stand and walk around for up to an hour during the assessment?

A.  No.

Q.  Have you ever seen your brother stand and walk around for up to an hour when you've been visiting him?

A.  No. (T 205 - 6).


	
	Ms Jackson’s evidence that the plaintiff was either in bed or on a chair for most of the time and unable to pick up an article from the floor was challenged, again on the basis of the physiotherapist’s report:
	


“Q.  When you see him he's in bed or in a chair most of the time is he?

A.  Yep.

Q.  Were you aware that when Ms Patterson attended on your brother he was able to bend and pick up a pen from the floor with minimal difficulty without holding onto anything?

A.  No.

Q.  Have you ever seen your brother bend over and pick something up off the floor?

A.  Not that I can recall.  No.

Q.  Were you aware that the occupational therapist saw your brother, in April last year, bend down and reach the bottom drawer in the kitchen without difficulty in his unit at Campbelltown?

A.  No.

Q.  Have you ever seen him do that?

A.  No I haven't.

Q.  Could it be that the reason why you've continued to provide so much assistance to your brother was that you didn't believe that he was capable of the sorts of things that I've just read out to you?

A.  I just felt that he needed my help and I could see he was in pain a lot of the time so I did it for him.” (T 206)


	
	Ms Jackson’s reasons for doing all his shopping – that he could not carry items or drive – were also challenged, on the same basis:
	


“Q.  Were you aware that your brother told Ms Patterson that he can lift a light shopping bag from the floor?

A.  No.

Q.  Have you ever seen him lift a bag up off the floor?

A.  Not off the floor, no.

Q.  Were you aware that your brother is able to, since purchasing motor vehicles, drive down to the local shops to get the odd grocery item?

A.  I know he has occasionally when he's had to, yes.

Q.  Don't you think, knowing that, in relation to his driving of a motor vehicle to the shops, don't you think that he might be able to do the shopping for himself?

A.  Not a full shopping, no.

Q.  Could it be that one of the reasons why you've continued to do the shopping for him is because you're an employee at Woolworths and you get a staff discount?

A.  No.” (T 206)


	
	The same is the case with the evidence of home care after the plaintiff moved into his current place of residence at Warragamba, a property owned by a deceased family member. Ms Jackson said she continued to provide the same amount of care, which is to do more or less everything:
	


“Q.  Do you provide any services for him when you go over?

A.  I still prepare meals and do his washing and vacuum and wash his floors and vacuum and make his bed, change his sheets, I still do the domestic housework for him.

Q.  Do you ever get over there on weekends?

A.  Sometimes on a Sunday, Saturday we're generally busy with sport with the boys, but, on a Sunday I try and get over there to see him.

Q.  Do you ever see Tammy over there?

A.  Not that often, we try and go around each other, so he's got someone over there a couple of times a week I might run into her, but we work different hours, so.

Q.  Is there anything different about the services and the work you do for him in Warragamba than there was with respect to the work and services you provided for him in Campbelltown?

A.  No.

Q.  Can you estimate how many hours it takes you in the average week to provide the services and care you've told the Court since he's been in Warragamba?

A.  It would still be around 15 hours a week.

Q.  Again, asking the same questions about time spent not working but just being a sister, if we had to calve [sic] that out of it at that time, how much would we calve [sic] out?

A.  About the two hours.” (T 185)


	
	The plaintiff’s other sister Tammy Smith, also gave evidence. She had much less to do with her brother than Ms Jackson. She provided assistance to the plaintiff while he was living in Ms Jackson’s home and later while he was living alone, but it was essentially of a backup nature to Ms Jackson’s efforts.
	
	
	The evidence of both Ms Jackson and Ms Smith was that of loving and concerned sisters. However, some of their evidence (such as claims of vacuuming the plaintiff’s home several times a week even though he lived by himself) seemed exaggerated, while other assistance provided to the plaintiff was of the kind that could well have been provided whether the plaintiff was injured or not, such as doing the plaintiff’s grocery shopping. Both the plaintiff’s sisters were entitled to a 5% discount on their groceries as store employees, and while both denied that this was the reason they purchased the groceries, it would seem common sense for them to do some.
	
	
	Some aspects of the plaintiff’s sisters’ evidence indicated a willingness to see the best in the plaintiff, notwithstanding evidence to the contrary. This was particularly the case in relation to Ms Jackson’s claim that she did not know the plaintiff had lost his licence for drink driving offences and the minimisation both sisters made of the incident involving the plaintiff’s assault on Ms Jackson’s partner. Where Ms Patterson, the occupational therapist, has made concessions that the amount of housework the plaintiff’s sisters asserted they were doing were excessive, I propose to accept them.
	


Past home care


	
	Section 141B of the Act provides:
	


“141B Maximum amount of damages for provision of certain attendant care services

(1) Compensation, included in an award of damages, for the value of attendant care services:

(a) which have been or are to be provided by another person to the person in whose favour the award is made, and

(b) for which the person in whose favour the award is made has not paid and is not liable to pay,

must not exceed the amount determined in accordance with this section.

(2) No compensation is to be awarded if the services would have been provided to the person even if the person had not been injured by the motor accident.

(3) Further, no compensation is to be awarded unless the services are provided (or to be provided):

(a) for at least 6 hours per week, and

(b) for a period of at least 6 consecutive months.

(4) If the services provided or to be provided are not less than 40 hours per week, the amount of compensation must not exceed:

(a) the amount per week comprising the amount estimated by the Australian Statistician as the average weekly total earnings of all employees in New South Wales for:

(i) in respect of the whole or any part of a quarter occurring between the date of the injury in relation to which the award is made and the date of the award, being a quarter for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and is, at the date of the award, available to the court making the award-that quarter, or

(ii) in respect of the whole or any part of any other quarter-the most recent quarter occurring before the date of the award for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and is, at that date, available to the court making the award, or

(b) if the Australian Statistician fails or ceases to estimate the amount referred to in paragraph (a), the prescribed amount or the amount determined in such manner or by reference to such matters, or both, as may be prescribed.

(5) If the services provided or to be provided are less than 40 hours per week, the amount of compensation must not exceed the amount calculated at an hourly rate of one-fortieth of the amount determined in accordance with subsection (4) (a) or (b), as the case requires.

(6) Unless evidence is adduced to the contrary, the court is to assume that the value of the services is the maximum amount determined under subsection (4) or (5), as the case requires.

(7) Except as provided by this section, nothing in this section affects any other law relating to the value of attendant care services.”


	
	No claim may be brought for periods of time when the plaintiff was in prison or hospital.
	
	
	The need for home care was for many years the subject of brief observations by orthopaedic surgeons. Following the observations of Basten JA in Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis such evidence is now generally the subject of reports by occupational therapists.
	
	
	As noted above, the plaintiff relies upon two lengthy reports by Ms Kate Patterson who was cross-examined. Mr McCarthy submits that Ms Patterson’s reports should be accepted without any amendment on the basis that she “adhered to her opinion and the defendant made no significant inroads into her opinion” (written submissions, paragraph 62) and that her opinion is expressly supported by Dr Endrey-Walker (written submissions, paragraph 63). Additionally, there was a reference to the plaintiff’s need for “domestic help” in the reports of Dr John David and Dr Kai-Lee.
	
	
	The defendant also prepared a report from an occupational therapist and sought to tender it despite it not being served prior to the hearing. Due to the unacceptably short notice given to the plaintiff I declined to permit the defendant to serve this report, although the deponent was available for cross-examination.
	
	
	I have, however, treated the plaintiff’s occupational therapist’s report (particularly in relation to future care issues) with some caution, for the following reasons. First, while reports from occupational therapists are of assistance, it is certainly not the case that no home care award can be made unless such a report is served. The touchstone is always reasonableness, and the evidence of the plaintiff and those members of his family who performed these services is the starting point.
	
	
	In Schultz v McCormack [2015] NSWCA 330 (albeit in the context of the Civil Liability Act 2005 (NSW)), McColl JA did not accept a submission that the plaintiff had to lead what was called “objective evidence” to support a claim that there was or would be a reasonable need for the gratuitous attendant services to be provided, that had arisen solely because of the injury to which the damages related, and that it would not have been provided to the appellant but for the injury. Her Honour noted at [129] that the trial judge had had the opportunity to observe the plaintiff and her husband in the witness box giving evidence in relation to these issues.
	
	
	Second, the occupational therapist did not have the benefit of observing just what assistance the plaintiff had over this period from his sisters; she did not meet Tammy at all and Rebecca left before she asked the plaintiff to demonstrate his ability to perform tasks (T 215 – 216). She accepted what the plaintiff and his sisters said without question (T 216) even though, as Ms Jackson acknowledged (T 205 – 207) she had photographed the plaintiff performing a series of tasks that Ms Jackson told the court (and also Ms Patterson) the plaintiff was unable to perform. She failed to pick up indications that the plaintiff was more mobile than he was telling her, such as the kind of car he was driving (she did not, in fact, even ask if he drove: T 231, which I consider a significant oversight) and the presence of a treadmill (T 217). She failed to inquire about his ability to use equipment such as a smartphone to pay his bills (T 232) although she acknowledged that this was significant information.
	
	
	Third, Ms Patterson made a series of concessions in relation to inaccuracies and overstatements for her past and future home care assessments in this regard. She based her estimates on the plaintiff living half the week with his sister and the other half with a girlfriend, which was completely inaccurate, and may explain the large sums accorded to gardening and related work that the plaintiff never performed in his share accommodation (T 217 – 8). Even when she made inquiries of her own, these were at times unrelated to the plaintiff’s actual needs; for example she acknowledged that some of her estimates (such as mowing costs) were not locally based (T 229) or from mowing companies such as Jim’s Mowing (T 231) and she used skilled carer rates for a person who would perform such simple tasks as unpacking the plaintiff’s grocery shopping (T 230).
	
	
	At the end of the cross-examination, Ms Patterson agreed:
	


Q.  Do you have any knowledge as to how long it would take for a cleaner to come in and clean once week a three‑bedroom unit or a small three‑bedroom house?

A.  Some cleaners send two people along so then that would make it quicker, but no knowledge is that it depends on the amount of cleaning that they're doing but floors and bathrooms probably an hour and a half to two hours (T 233).


	
	Mr McCarthy’s estimate of the number of hours from the date the plaintiff first left hospital (excluding later gaol and hospital time) results in 2,834 hours of service provided by the plaintiff’s sisters and that averaging out the number of hours over the final period to be assessed in her first report (7 August 2014 – 21 May 2015, a period of 41 weeks) results in an average of 13 hours of gratuitous domestic assistance per week.
	
	
	The plaintiff submits that there is no significant variation in the number of hours required between 21 May 2015 and the date the plaintiff moved in to his current home in Warragamba on 29 June (56 weeks) and this would result in 728 additional hours. The plaintiff’s care from 29 June to the date of the hearing (24 August 2016) is covered by Ms Patterson’s supplementary report as 107 hours (13.3 hours per week), showing the plaintiff still needs the same amount of assistance (or perhaps slightly more) than he did when first released from hospital in 2014. This results in the total of 3,669 hours, totalling $102,732.00.
	
	
	The defendant has not set out, and the plaintiff has not answered, the detailed reasons identified in the defendant’s schedule of damages as the reasons for the reductions in past home care. However, the defendant has squarely raised these issues, based on concessions made by the plaintiff’s sisters and Ms Patterson in their evidence, and I propose to deal with each of them in turn.
	


28 November 2011 to 26 January 2011


	
	There is very scant evidence about the plaintiff’s accommodation for much of his adult life. After he moved to Sydney, he appears to have lived in rented accommodation and then moved to the home of his sister Rebecca a few weeks prior to his release from gaol (as an indication of the general lack of information, his sister told the court she did not know where the plaintiff had been living prior to his coming to live in her home). Although the plaintiff was a good cook and was the barbecue cook for family meals, there is little evidence he did housework while he lived there, apart from tidying the room he occupied.
	
	
	The plaintiff was obliged to leave his sister’s home following charges being laid after he assaulted her husband. For the months prior to the accident the plaintiff was living with about 6 people in a 6-bedroom share or boarding house, in which he shared bathroom and kitchen facilities and there was no shared housework; the only obligation was that he “just cleaned up after yourself [sic]” (T 127). He was not able to drive as his licence was suspended, so his girlfriend drove him around in the car which he owned, for which car expenses he claimed a tax deduction (T 129 – 130).
	
	
	Mr O’Keefe submits that in these circumstances, Ms Patterson’s assessment should be accepted, but should not include any allowance for cleaning, gardening or outdoor maintenance as these tasks were not performed by the plaintiff at all. As the defendant’s schedule of damages shows, this reduces the hours to 19.13 hours for 8 weeks.
	
	
	Mr McCarthy relied upon Ms Patterson’s evidence. Ms Patterson was reliant upon the evidence of the plaintiff and his sisters and did not make her own inquiries. She was unaware that the plaintiff had been living in share accommodation (T 217 – 8) where he was essentially only looking after himself. In those circumstances, her estimates were based on wrong information, and the amount to be awarded should be adjusted accordingly.
	


26 January to 26 April 2012


	
	During this period the plaintiff was living with his sister Rebecca and her family. For the same reasons as set out above, allowances for general cleaning, gardening and outdoor maintenance should not be allowed. I am also troubled by a claim for car washing in circumstances where the plaintiff had a disqualification from driving for a period of many years. I accept the defendant’s estimate of 17.63 hours for 13 weeks.
	


26 April to 29 June 2012, 3 to 12 July 2012 and 27 August to 21 September 2012


	
	I consider that the same deductions should be made from Ms Patterson’s assessment, for the same reasons. Accordingly, I allow 12.13 hours for 9.1 weeks for the first period, 18.13 hours for 2 weeks for the second period and 17.65 hours for 4 weeks for the third period. It is unclear to me if the plaintiff is claiming for having moved once (namely into his sister’s home and then in about May 2013, into a home unit). I propose to err on the side of caution and to allow for eight hours of moving on two occasions; I see that the defendant has allowed for this in any event.
	


Home care after the plaintiff was released from prison on 23 December 2012


	
	The plaintiff was released from prison on 23 December 2012 and returned to live with his sister and her family. Again, I propose to accept the defendant’s assessment of past care and allow 10.13 hours for 19 weeks.
	
	
	The plaintiff then moved into a home unit on 7 May 2013. This home unit did not have a garden or lawn or require household maintenance beyond cleaning, and these items should not be allowed. Nor am I prepared to make an allowance for car cleaning. The plaintiff was still disqualified from driving.
	
	
	The plaintiff had an external fixateur from 2 July 2013 until its removal in March 2014 and required further surgery in March 2014. The defendant concedes that the plaintiff had a high need for assistance and I accept the defendant’s estimates for the whole of this period.
	


Home care from March 2015


	
	This brings me to the defendant’s cut-off period of March 2015, this being the time from which Mr McCarthy submits that any reasonable need for assistance falls below the intensity threshold of s 141A, namely 6 hours per week. The plaintiff continues to claim the same rate for the period after the removal of the fixateur as for before.
	
	
	I am satisfied by the reports of Dr Walker that the plaintiff’s fracture was still healing for a period of up to 18 months after his 3 July 2014 surgery. In practical terms, that takes the plaintiff up to the end of 2015, at which time it was hoped that the plaintiff would no longer need crutch. In this respect, I do not accept the defendant’s submissions that no allowance should be made.
	
	
	However, once the plaintiff’s fracture united and he had no real need of his crutch (according to Dr Zeman, whose evidence I accept on this point), the situation changed. The plaintiff was able to move around more freely and to perform a number of household tasks of the kind shown in Ms Patterson’s photographs. I note Mr McCarthy’s submission that these were taken on a “good day”, but I prefer the submissions of the defendant that the plaintiff’s state of recovery meant that he dropped below the threshold, although I consider that the plaintiff’s drop below the threshold did not occur until the end of 2015.
	
	
	In practical terms, that is a matter of approximately 8 months before these proceedings. The process of dropping below the threshold would have been a gradual one, with good days and bad days. A degree of flexibility is required in this regard. It is not possible to pinpoint when the plaintiff sufficiently recovered so as to fall below the threshold, and his sisters would have continued to provide the same care notwithstanding. Accordingly, I propose to continue the allowance of 8 hours of assistance per week up until the date of the hearing.
	
	
	As is noted in the final orders, the parties have liberty to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the mathematically agreed sum for all these heads of damages.
	


Future home care


	
	The same concept of reasonableness must be applied to claims for future assistance as to past assistance: Dang v Chea (2013) 63 MVR 240 at [38]-[41].
	
	
	As counsel for the defendant notes in his written submissions at paragraph 100, there is no evidence that family members fail or refuse to continue to provide assistance for the plaintiff in the future.
	
	
	The plaintiff, however, expressed embarrassment and concern that his sisters spent so much of their time looking after his domestic needs. He said at T 53:
	


“Q.  How do you feel about the fact that your family members and friends are taking all this time out of their life to help you?

A.  I appreciate it ‑ I don't really.  I don't like it.  Not much I can do about it.  Like it's pretty much they're obligated, I suppose.”


	
	The plaintiff also said that if he had the money available to him he would replace the service of his sisters with commercial cleaners and gardeners:
	


“Q. Well if you had the money would you replace their services with people who do it for pay?

A. Yeah, more than likely, yes.

Q. You're already hiring a gardener, a lawnmower guy, would you intend to keep paying him if you had the money?

A. Yes.” (T 53)


	
	The kind of assistance the plaintiff required in the past and future is set out in the report of Dr Barold, who noted the plaintiff was unsuitable to undertake the following domestic activities following the accident:
	



	
	Loading and emptying the washing machine;
	
	
	Ironing;
	
	
	Cleaning windows or the shower;
	
	
	Moving furniture, vacuuming, sweeping and mopping;
	
	
	Carrying shopping;
	
	
	Gardening and mowing.
	



	
	However, the parties relied upon the report of Ms Patterson who stated as follows in relation to the plaintiff’s future needs:
	


“11.3 FUTURE CARE RECOMMENDATIONS

My future care recommendations have been formulated based on Mr Smith’s need for care, rather than any situation that he may find himself in.

It is not reasonable to expect friends to provide the care Mr Smith needs as a result of his injuries and impairments.

Recommendations are also based on the expectation that Mr Smith will have been provided with the equipment and therapy recommendations outlined further in his report. Although these have been recommended to increase his participation in previous roles, his performance will still be limited by on-going upper limb, lower limb and back pain, and reduced functional abilities.

For those reasons, equipment and services may increase his independence with some tasks but he will continue to require commercial services to facilitate and encourage his participation in pre-injury tasks.

RECOMMENDATIONS

From 21 May 2015 onwards: It is estimated that Mr Smith is currently provided with approximately 13.0 hours per week of gratuitous assistance provided predominantly by his sister.

In my opinion, Mr Smith requires provision of 15.0 hours per week of commercial care to replace pre-injury contribution to domestic, garden and home maintenance tasks.

Recommendations are based on the assumption that Mr Smith will have received the therapy, services and equipment recommended throughout this report.

”


	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff is able to drive to the shopping centre and to carry out small grocery shopping tasks; he does not need assistance in unpacking items of this kind. Nor does he need transportation and community access or garden maintenance.
	
	
	The figures for the amount of housework done for the plaintiff in the future are excessive. In her evidence, Ms Smith said that she could clean the house within 3 hours and Ms Patterson gave an even lower figure.
	
	
	The question in those circumstances is whether or not the s 141B threshold can be met. To summarise these issues:
	



	
	Ms Patterson’s evidence was that if commercial assistance was required, the plaintiff’s three-bedroom home could be commercially cleaned in its entirety in 1.5 to 2 hours per week. I am satisfied, from the material set out in Ms Patterson’s report, that the plaintiff is in fact capable of doing a number of tasks himself and any need for commercial help would be for only a small portion of this time.
	
	
	One of the reasons given by the plaintiff’s sisters for the amount of assistance required by the plaintiff (and the plaintiff himself gave this evidence) was that the plaintiff’s memory had been affected by the accident, and that for this reason, as well as by reason of his ongoing psychiatric problems, he required a degree of motivation and reminding to perform tasks as he might otherwise forget, for example, to complete a cooking task, and was often depressed and in bed. There is no medical evidence that the plaintiff suffers from any loss of memory problems referrable to the accident and, as I have already noted, I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s depression was a pre-existing condition.
	
	
	This is not a case where the plaintiff is unable to drive his motor vehicle or unable to get around his home without a crutch. His shopping is done by his sisters, who can obtain a store discount, and this is likely to continue for this reason. His problems with cooking can be remedied by equipment such as a kitchen stool to sit on and a longhandled device to pick up items he drops. I am satisfied that he needs no assistance in these areas.
	



	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff requires, at best, assistance with the cleaning of his home in the form of performance of the more difficult tasks, and that this assistance would amount to around one to two hours per week. Given the evidence of the plaintiff’s sisters who presently provide care and they intend to continue to do so in the future, I am satisfied that this allowance for gratuitous care could not meet the ongoing threshold for such care to be compensable (Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Haq [2016] NSWCA 93 at [47]-[53]), and there is unlikely to be a need for commercial assistance in the future.
	
	
	There are three other reasons for my determination. The first is that there was a great deal of exaggeration in the amounts claimed on the plaintiff’s behalf. The concessions made by Ms Patterson were significant. Where claims of vacuuming the plaintiff’s house three or four times a week are made, or inaccurate information about the plaintiff’s ability to drive are provided to an expert of the kind Ms Patterson is, it should not be left to the court to try to ascertain how much of the care claim is left after the inflated or inaccurate claims are taken out. I have not accepted the plaintiff or his sisters as reliable witnesses, and the level of exaggeration about home needs is such that I prefer to err on the side of caution.
	
	
	Secondly, Ms Patterson’s style of presentation of report is that she sets out financial amounts for retention of commercial advice, rather than considering simple and obvious solutions. For example, Ms Patterson proposed six 1.5 hour sessions at $175 per hour for an occupational therapist to provide advice about equipment, retraining, home safety, manual handling and memory techniques. It would have been preferable if Ms Patterson had set out, in her report, the kind of information the plaintiff needed so that I could determine why it was necessary for him to be given all this training and advice, and why it would take ten hours to impart it. The equipment in question consists of items like a kitchen stool and vacuum and the “home safety” issues are unexplained. That sort of assistance should not be necessary for a person with the plaintiff’s level of disability.
	
	
	The third is that, in Metaxoulis v McDonald's Australia Ltd [2015] NSWCA 95 the Court of Appeal stated:
	


“[81] The appellant’s written submission proposed an allowance of $26 per hour for two hours per week for the remainder of the appellant’s life expectancy, being 44.4 years. If that calculation were accepted, there must be a significant reduction for vicissitudes, both to take account of normal ageing processes and to take account of the significant likelihood that the appellant would have required domestic assistance at an earlier stage because of his existing injury. The adjustment is appropriately undertaken by way of a proportionate reduction in accordance with the principles identified in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd. The appellant’s calculation produced a figure of $49,111; a reduction of 40% would produce an allowance, in round terms, of $30,000. That is an appropriate figure in the circumstances.”


	
	No such adjustment was made here. Mr McCarthy seemed to consider that it was only appropriate to do so where the plaintiff was at an age where such issues were likely to arise. However, as the length of working life set out in the above extract from this decision shows, such a deduction may be relevant even to persons of the plaintiff’s age. Were such a deduction to be made, it would bring the plaintiff even further below the threshold.
	
	
	While I do not propose to make an allowance for future home care, I note the defendant has conceded a sum to purchase home aids to enable the plaintiff to perform tasks in the home. (I note there has also been a concession about the plaintiff needing to undergo a pain management course in order to come to terms with his dependence on Endone, which I have factored into future medical expenses.)
	


Equipment


	
	There is no separate heading for equipment in the plaintiff’s schedule. All that was claimed was future commercial assistance.

	Additionally, counsel for the defendant suggested that the plaintiff would benefit from obtaining a dryer, which is not included in this schedule. He also suggested a dishwasher. There is no information available to me as to the cost in question.
	
	
	Further, rather than the cheap lightweight vacuum Ms Patterson lists, the plaintiff would benefit from a self-propelling vacuum, which would cost considerably more than $219 proposed. The significant advances made with vacuum construction and design may mean that this source of pain-producing housework may in the future be referred to less often in personal injury proceedings.
	
	
	Obtaining these items would significantly assist the plaintiff. For example, a dryer would make performing laundry tasks easier. The plaintiff would be better able to cook for himself if he had a kitchen stool to sit on and a long-handled dust pan for objects which drop.
	
	
	Having regard to the concessions made by the defendant in the course of his closing submissions, I propose to award a cushion of $15,000 for these items. This is more than Ms Patterson or the defendant suggested but, having regard to the answers of Ms Patterson in cross-examination, equipment of this kind will enable the plaintiff to do more around the house.
	


Past and future out of pocket expenses


	
	Past out of pocket expenses are agreed in the sum of $29,323.75 and are rounded up to $29,324.
	


Future out of pocket expenses


	
	There is only a difference of $10,000 between the parties’ estimates as the plaintiff’s future medical expenses are of narrow compass.
	
	
	Dr Walker confirmed that the plaintiff has no future requirement for surgery:
	


“Q.  You haven't advised him of any future plans for any more surgery, have you, at this stage?

A.  No, I mean I ‑ other than if he was going to have some recurrent state of infection.  He's got a plate in there.  I don't think he'll require posttraumatic surgery on his knee or his ankle in terms of arthritis, but if he was to get an infection, for example, so a patient could have plates in, they could be going along fine and also have a flare infection ..(not transcribable)..  If you have something like that then he would need the plate taken out and may need some ongoing treatment.  Other than that I can't anticipate any surgery in the future. (T 152)


	
	Dr Walker also confirmed that the plaintiff has no need for physiotherapy or hydrotherapy:
	


“Q.  Do you believe that there is any improvement to be gained for this man from ongoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy?

A.  I don't think so, after five years, no.” (T 155)


	
	All of the doctors agreed that the plaintiff should not continue to take Oxycontin. Dr Walker referred to it, scathingly, as “hospital grade heroin”:
	


“I also tell ‑ pretty much every patient who is on OxyContin, short‑term or long‑term, is a bad thing.  It's basically heroin.  It's hospital grade heroin.  It kills more people than, you know, heroin.  It's addictive.  I don't think it's a long‑term solution to ongoing pain management.  If a patient, for example, is on 80 milligrams of ‑ twice a day on OxyContin and you still have terrible pain ‑ it's addictive.  It makes them feel terrible.  It's not good for their mental health, and so I didn't institute it, and I don't recommend it to patients.  There are plenty of my patients on it, and it's not a good thing.

Q.  In those circumstances, would you be supportive of Mr Smith participating in a pain management program with a pain specialist with a view to ceasing OxyContin?

A.  Yes, definitely but unfortunately the pain management specialist is ongoing narcotic use and so, yeah, I'm actually the right person and I think it has to be with ‑ you have to have the patient on board.  If you don't have the patient on board then, you know, it doesn't help.  I would say that somebody needs help him get off it, he needs to be shown other ways of managing pain, but I would say that when you've been on it for a long time like he has the number of patients that get off is like ..(not transcribable).. and there's only so much I can do.” (T 151)


	
	Dr Zeman agreed with Dr Walker’s views (at 244):
	


“A.  Yes.  That's usually from the experience in the U.S., where it's also referred to as ""Hillbilly heroin"" and somewhat derogatively. I think fortunately we don't use it as much and we have other medications but it is a narcotic and like any narcotic you can get an addiction to it.” (T 244).


	
	There is little information about what would be involved in terms of any pain management programme for the plaintiff to reduce his OxyContin intake, or as to the cost of any replacement pain medication, if such is required. Ms Patterson, in cross-examination, estimated that the cost would be $8,000 and that is the figure I propose to accept.
	
	
	There will be expenses in the future of a follow-up nature for the plaintiff’s general practitioner. Dr Walker did not say that follow-up visits with him, or x-rays, were required.
	
	
	Both parties propose a buffer, but in the absence of more information as to the nature and extent of the costs of such treatment (and despite the fact that the onus lies on the plaintiff), I propose to err on the side of caution and award the buffer sought by the plaintiff of $35,000.
	


Conclusions as to damages


	
	The parties have liberty to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the mathematically agreed sums for past and future economic loss, past and future superannuation, past and future out of pocket expenses, past home care and equipment. I have also granted liberty to apply in relation to costs.

	PRICE J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges which carried maximum penalties as indicated.
	



	
	Ongoing supply of prohibited drugs contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) between 12 February 2014 and 13 March 2014. The particulars were supply of about 14 grams or half an ounce of cocaine on each of four separate dates in the charge period together with a smaller quantity, 3.3 grams, of another drug on one of the dates. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment or 3,500 penalty units or both.
	
	
	Supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act on 25 June 2014. The particulars of this offence were a supply of 12.6 grams of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty is 15 years or 2,000 penalty units or both.
	
	
	Possession of a prohibited weapon on 25 June 2014 contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW). The applicant had in his possession at his home two flick knives at the time of his arrest on the drug charges. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment.
	



	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence. On 4 September 2015, his Honour Judge Williams SC imposed under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) an aggregate sentence of 2 years and 7 months non-parole period and 2 years and 2 months balance of term. As required by s 53A(2)(b) his Honour indicated that the individual sentences he would have imposed, if not applying the provisions for aggregation, would have been 4 years and 6 months for the ongoing supply, 2 years for the individual supply in June 2014 and 12 months for the possession of a prohibited weapon, comprising a non-parole period of 9 months and a balance of term of 3 months.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper reasons in finding that the evidence of the appellant was implausible.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give any weight or effect to the evidence of the appellant as to the circumstances of his offending in determining the objective seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	The sentence in all the circumstances was manifestly excessive as to be unreasonable and/or unjust.
	



	
	The facts proved by the Crown and not contested were that in February and March 2014 the applicant was contacted by a female undercover operative working with police and he agreed to supply her with cocaine. Four transactions were carried out at intervals over the month from 12 February to 13 March 2014. In each case the undercover operative paid $3,500 in cash for between 13 and 14 grams of cocaine. Intercepted telephone conversations between the undercover operative and the applicant were open to the inference that he had one or more sources of the drugs he was supplying and that he was carrying on a regular distribution trade by way of these transactions for profit.
	
	
	Other than in exceptional circumstances the supply of drugs in this way would call for a full-time custodial sentence. This has been held in this Court on numerous occasions, for example, R v Clark (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 15 March 1990, unrep), Smaragdis v R [2010] NSWCCA 276 at [31] and it has been held specifically in relation to the offence under s 25A of ongoing supply in Fayd’Herbe v R [2007] NSWCCA 20 at [18]. The appellant’s counsel conceded before the sentencing judge that this case was not exceptional and that full-time custody would, accordingly, have to be imposed.
	
	
	Relevantly to ground 1 the applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He asserted that the selling of drugs was thrust upon him by a man named Garry Clifford. The applicant said that in 2013 he had been in possession of a motorcycle belonging to a third party and that he had performed mechanical work on it. At the request of either the third party or an intermediary he had put the motorcycle into the possession of Clifford for the purpose of having it certified in some manner from an engineering point of view and having it registered. He said that Clifford at that time ran a motorcycle shop at an unspecified location and that after having the motorcycle in his possession for some time Clifford told him it had been stolen.
	
	
	The applicant said that by this stage Clifford had moved his business to Minchinbury and that Clifford said he would recover the bike, return it to the applicant and enable him to return it to its owner only if the applicant would take from Clifford a bag of drugs and scales and sell these drugs over time for payment to a person whom Clifford nominated as Jess. The applicant said that he had carried out these instructions reluctantly and on receiving payments he had placed amounts of $3,500 in cash at a time in a letterbox at Clifford’s premises rather than putting the money into Clifford’s hands and without ever obtaining confirmation in any manner from Clifford that he had received the proceeds.
	
	
	The applicant was cross-examined on this version at length and it was challenged by the Crown Prosecutor as implausible. His Honour referred to some of the principal points of the cross-examination. The applicant had no sensible explanation for numerous improbabilities in his story, with which he had been pressed by the Crown Prosecutor during the cross-examination.
	
	
	His Honour was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the applicant’s explanation, as I have summarised it, was truthful. Therefore his Honour did not take it into account in the applicant’s favour as mitigating the seriousness of the offending. At p 7 of the Remarks on Sentence his Honour referred to the explanation as “a most improbable scenario”. His Honour noted there was no corroboration of the account from any source other than the applicant. Further his Honour considered that the circumstances as related by the applicant, even taken at face value, did not show that he had come under any real obligation or pressure to embark upon the drug supply. It was part of the applicant’s evidence that he was himself during this period a user of drugs.
	
	
	The Remarks adequately disclose his Honour’s reasons for not having been persuaded of the exculpatory account. Essentially it was a case of inherent improbability. In giving reasons his Honour was not obliged to specify every particular of the story which he found improbable. There is ample authority about the limits upon the extent to which a judge who makes findings of fact at first instance is required to expound his or her reasons. A principal authority is the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247. In the course of considering the requirement of a fact-finding judge to give reasons Kirby P (as his Honour then was) said at 259:
	


“This decision does not require of trial judges a tedious examination of detailed evidence or a minute explanation of every step in the reasoning process that leads to the judge’s conclusion. But the judicial obligation to give reasons, and not to frustrate the legislative facility of appeal on questions of law, at least obliges a judge to state generally and briefly the grounds which have led him or her to the conclusions reached concerning disputed factual questions and to list the findings on the principal contested issues.”


	
	In the same decision Mahoney JA said at 271:
	


“[T]he law does not require that a judge make an express finding in respect of every fact leading to, or relevant to, his final conclusion of fact; nor is it necessary that he reason, and be seen to reason, from one fact to the next along the chain of reasoning to that conclusion.”


	
	Further at 273 to 274 Mahoney JA said:
	


“The weight which a judge will give to the evidence of a witness will often be not capable of rationalisation beyond the statement: having heard him, I am not satisfied that I should accept what he says. The weight which a judge gives to a particular fact may be affected by, as it has frequently been put, his experience and, in particular, his experience of the significance of that fact in the order of things.”


	
	Mahoney JA went on to say that “in the particular case, [reasons] may partake as much of intuition based on experience as on formal and deductive reasoning”. The last passage which I consider is useful to quote here, from Mahoney JA’s decision at 274, is this:
	


“The determination of facts is assumed to be objective. But it would be to misunderstand the basis of a decision, and in particular decisions in matters of assessment, weight and the like, to assume that decisions can always, or perhaps ordinarily, be justified by objective rather than subjective considerations. And, if such be true of the reasoning process, it is, in my opinion, a mistake to conclude that a judge should or can set forth the reasoning process he has followed from one fact to another.”


	
	Those observations apply with particular force to the process of his Honour Judge Williams SC assessing the plausibility of the most unusual account which the applicant gave in an endeavour to exculpate himself, at least with respect to the degree of seriousness of his offending, in these sentencing proceedings. The learned judge’s remarks, according to the standards to which I have referred, were in my opinion entirely adequate. I would accordingly reject ground 1.
	
	
	Ground 2, which is that his Honour failed to give weight to the appellant’s evidence in determining the seriousness of the offending, falls with ground 1. There was no deficiency in the reasons upon which his Honour found the mitigating background story unproven on the balance of probabilities and therefore there was relevantly no credible evidence of the applicant to mitigate the circumstances of his offending, of which his Honour needed to take account. His Honour properly gave no weight to an explanation of surrounding circumstances which he had rejected as implausible. I would reject ground 2.
	
	
	Ground 3, that the sentence was manifestly excessive, in my opinion also does not succeed. The aggregate sentence may be considered from the point of view of the indicative sentences from which it derived. A 25% discount for the applicant’s pleas of guilty was allowed. That discount would have been applied by his Honour in arriving at the indicative terms by force of s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have made allowance for that discount having been applied in considering the indicative terms which his Honour nominated against sentences that have been given in comparable cases. It does not appear that there was anything in the least excessive about the indicatives and they, of course, informed the aggregate.
	
	
	There was nothing about the applicant’s subjective circumstances, in terms of his personal history, which would attract special lenience. He was about 38 years old at the time of the offence. He had no prior record of any relevance and this entitled him to consideration. Benefit for that was given in particular under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in that his Honour found special circumstances and adjusted the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term favourably to the applicant.
	
	
	On the other hand the drug dealing which was the subject of the charges was in substantial (half ounce) lots. It was recurrent over a month with another instance of selling a different drug in the middle of the year. The aggregate not only cannot be said to have been excessive by reference to the indicatives but it is also not shown to have been excessive by reference to comparable sentencing in other cases.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel before his Honour particularly asked that account be taken of decisions of this Court in Farkas v R [2014] NSWCCA 141; (2014) 243 A Crim R 388 and Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47. Each of those cases was different from the present case in respects which his Honour noted and considered. When the aggregate sentence is compared against the sentencing outcomes in those cases, with appropriate adjustments being made for differences of circumstances, it cannot be seen to be manifestly excessive on the basis of giving rise to an inconsistency with the patterns of sentencing by the Court. The same applies when one looks more widely than the particular cases that the applicant’s counsel cited to his Honour in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	For those reasons I would dismiss ground 3 as well. The orders that I would propose would be that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	PRICE J: The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

2770948,AGF v R [2016] NSWCCA 236,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with R A Hulme J and the orders he proposes.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: AGF (""the applicant"") applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 6 November 2009. The applicant cannot be identified for reasons which will become apparent; hence the pseudonym.
	
	
	The applicant was found guilty by a jury of a number of offences and her Honour imposed a total effective sentence of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. The non-parole period expires on 15 June 2018.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


1   The sentencing of the applicant miscarried because her Honour was not made aware of the manner in which the applicant had assisted the authorities.

2   The sentencing of the applicant miscarried because her Honour dealt with the applicant on the basis that he had previously been convicted of a child sexual assault offence.


	
	Given that the proposed grounds do not assert any error on behalf of the sentencing judge it is unnecessary to say anything for the moment about the facts concerning the offences, the applicant's subjective case or her Honour's reasoning and assessment of sentence.
	


History


	
	The matter is the subject of a rather complex procedural history but I will only refer to so much of it as is presently pertinent. To maintain the applicant's anonymity I will refrain from providing a citation of some other cases in this Court which form part the history.
	
	
	The applicant was tried in early 2009 on an indictment alleging a total of 13 sexual offences and 1 assault offence against his niece. The jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of 10 of the offences. They occurred between 1997 and 2003 when the complainant was aged from 12 to 18.
	
	
	When the applicant was sentenced later in 2009 there was no evidence brought forward about him having provided assistance to authorities.
	
	
	The applicant appealed against his conviction but not against his sentence. Heard at the same time as that appeal was an appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed in separate proceedings for an offence of assault concerning the same victim. The Court dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal against the assault sentence. The reduced sentence of 3 months that the Court imposed was completely subsumed within the sentences imposed in the primary proceedings so nothing more needs to be said about it.
	
	
	The applicant filed a notice of appeal against sentence and an application for an extension of time on 1 June 2016. This was some 4 years after his conviction appeal had been determined and 7 years after he had been sentenced.
	


Ground 1 - miscarriage of justice because of the absence of evidence of assistance to authorities

Explanation for not adducing the evidence in the sentence proceedings


	
	Senior counsel's advice was sought in 2014 as to the merits of an appeal against sentence but counsel was not briefed with information as to the applicant's assistance to authorities. When counsel was advised of it, sometime in the latter half of 2014, he requested that inquiries be made with the police officer in charge of the case and with the applicant's previous lawyers, both at sentence and on the conviction appeal. The officer confirmed that assistance had been provided. The applicant's previous legal representatives all provided affidavits as to their knowledge of it or otherwise.
	
	
	The solicitor and barrister who appeared in the trial and sentence proceedings provided affidavits indicating that they were unaware that the applicant had provided assistance and said that if they had been aware, it would have been raised during the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	The solicitor and barrister who represented the applicant in the conviction appeal indicated in their affidavits that the applicant had said something about having provided assistance. The filing of an appeal against sentence was contemplated but no further information was forthcoming and nothing happened.
	
	
	The applicant swore an affidavit on 8 April 2016. He said that he did not tell his legal representatives in the District Court proceedings that he had provided assistance but he told his solicitor after, and possibly before, the hearing of the conviction appeal in this Court. He said that he had provided information to a named police officer prior to his trial. He said that he did not bring this to the attention of his legal representatives for a number of reasons which I paraphrase and summarise as follows:
	



	
	He feared reprisals against himself and his family because he was an informant for the police, particularly because a suppression order regarding his identity had been lifted after his trial.
	
	
	He had received a death threat from a particular inmate. He acknowledged that this was because of the nature of his charges but said that he feared without the suppression order in place it would become common knowledge among other inmates that he was a police informer.
	
	
	He knew the person about whom he had given information was a suspect in two murders and believed that he had links with an outlaw motorcycle gang. Other inmates also had such links and this added to his fears of reprisals.
	
	
	He did not know until after his conviction appeal about the confidentiality with which matters of assistance may be dealt with in sentence proceedings.
	



	
	The applicant also claimed that he did not provide assistance in order to obtain a benefit for himself. He said that he did so ""out of my sense of right and wrong and my strong moral views against the manufacture and supply of illicit drugs"".
	
	
	The Court was informed at the hearing of the application that a police officer, at the request of the applicant's wife, had provided an affidavit setting out the applicant's assistance after the hearing of the conviction appeal four years ago. The lawyers on both sides of the record at the time were completely unaware of this. The officer apparently sent it directly to the associate to the presiding judge. What became of it is a mystery. It may be inferred, however, that at least by sometime in 2012 the applicant had become aware of the relevance of his assistance to the assessment of sentence and of the confidentiality with which such matters may be dealt with.
	
	
	Mr Boulten SC accepted that there were some aspects of this history that were ""unacceptable"". He also accepted that the delay in the issue being raised counted against an extension of time being granted but contended that if the Court found that the assistance was of some substance then intervention was warranted in order to repair a miscarriage of justice.
	


The assistance


	
	There is an obvious need to be circumspect about the nature of the assistance provided by the applicant. It is enough for present purposes to say that there were three components. The first involved the applicant providing information about very serious criminal activity by a person notorious for his involvement in serious, including violent, crime. In conjunction with information police obtained from a completely separate source it led to a police investigation being successful to the extent that the notorious person was charged with 17 offences, some of considerable seriousness. He ultimately received a sentence of imprisonment. The assistance the applicant provided in relation to this matter did not extend to him making a statement or offering to give evidence.
	
	
	The second aspect was that the applicant provided information to police about organised crime activity in a certain area. The third is that he provided information about the criminal activities of a prison inmate.
	


Value of the assistance


	
	As to the value of the applicant's assistance in relation to the first matter, his information on its own would not have been sufficient to bring about the success of the police investigation whereas the information from the other source would have been. It is of significance, however, that the validity of the applicant's information was confirmed by that from the other source and by the successful outcome of the investigation and prosecution.
	
	
	In terms of the matters required to be considered by s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the assistance was reasonably significant and it could be regarded as useful, truthful, reliable and timely. Having regard to the type of person the information concerned, it had the potential to expose the applicant, and perhaps his family, to a significant risk of personal harm.
	
	
	In relation to the second and third aspects of the assistance, the applicant's information was described as ""more general"". Some of it was confirmed through police intelligence holdings and some could not be. It was not of a nature that police could act upon it. It is of far less significance than the first aspect.
	


Principles in relation to ""fresh"" and ""new"" evidence tendered on appeal


	
	There was no controversy that because at the time of the sentence proceedings in 2009 the applicant knew that he had provided assistance to the police, even though it was not known by his lawyers, the evidence of it should be regarded as new rather than fresh. The Court may receive new evidence where it is ""necessary to do so in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice"": Betts v The Queen (2016) 90 ALJR 758; [2016] HCA 25 at [2], [10].
	
	
	The principles relating to the reception of fresh and new evidence in an application for leave to appeal against sentence were thoroughly canvassed by Simpson J (as her Honour then was) in her judgment in Khoury v R (2011) 209 A Crim R 509; [2011] NSWCCA 118 where she said, in part:
	


""[104] The general principle is that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at p 377. That applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals.

[105] The rule is far from absolute, and has been diluted over the years. In criminal cases it has long been recognised that the rigour with which it is applied must be tempered in order to accommodate the interests of justice: Green v The King [1939] HCA 4; 61 CLR 167, per Latham CJ; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 per Barwick CJ. In criminal cases, two important but competing policy considerations collide:

(1) that the administration of justice requires finality in litigation; in general, parties to litigation (including criminal litigation) have one, and one only, opportunity to present their cases in the best light they can, and are bound by the conduct of their cases at first instance;

(2) that error in the sentencing process, however caused, that is the occasion of injustice, ought to be remedied.

But there are limits as to the extent to which the court may legitimately accept additional evidence. There is no call here to consider the application of the principles in appeals against conviction: these have most recently been considered in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 and Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61 at [282] and following. These remarks are confined to the circumstances in which this Court may properly, and will, admit and take account of additional evidence on applications for leave to appeal against sentence, in respect of which a distinct sub-set of principles has evolved.

[106] I say ""additional evidence"" because a distinction has been drawn between ""fresh"" evidence and ""new"" evidence: see Abou-Chabake, per Kirby J, at [63].

[107] ""Fresh"" evidence has been defined by Mason J (as he then was) in Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; 142 CLR 659 at p 675 as:

""... evidence of which the accused was unaware at the time of his trial and ... evidence which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence.""

""New"" evidence, on the other hand, is evidence that does not qualify as ""fresh"", either because it was available, but not used, at first instance, or because, in the exercise of reasonable diligence it could have been obtained. …

[108] If evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion - the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance. If it is not judged to have that capacity, its admission is pointless, and, while it has to be considered in order for that evaluation to be made, the evidence may not, in the result, be acted upon: see, for example, Fordham.""


	
	Her Honour then made specific reference to applications for leave to appeal against sentence and there being ""an additional, sometimes intractable, barrier to admissibility"" in relation to facts or circumstances which have arisen post-sentencing. In this context she referred to assistance provided to authorities and physical and mental health conditions. She then referred to a ""sub-set of evidentiary propositions peculiar to the admission of additional evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence"" where the matter existed at the time of sentence but was not known, or imperfectly understood, at that time where, if the interests of justice have so dictated, the Court has admitted the evidence in order to correct the misunderstanding. Her Honour continued:
	


""[121] That the evidence may cast light on circumstances known, but not fully appreciated, at sentencing, does not dictate that it will be admitted. The judgment remains a discretionary one. It is proper for the Court examine the circumstances of, and any explanation for, the non-production of the evidence - a deliberate decision on the part either of the applicant, or his or her legal representatives, ignorance in the applicant of the significance of the evidence, resulting in its not being communicated to the legal representatives, incompetent legal representation. At the outer limits, the cases also include those in which post sentencing circumstances are taken into account as relevant to known pre-sentencing circumstances (for example, Springer). Also relevant will be the potential significance of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance (for example, Ashton).""


	
	The point included in [108], and mentioned again in the final sentence of [121] of the above - the necessity of evaluating the capacity of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance - is critical to the outcome in this case.
	


Submissions for the applicant


	
	In written submissions, the assistance provided by the applicant was described as ""very considerable"". The failure of the applicant to bring it to the attention of his lawyers was explained. It was misguided but should not be held against him. There was no tactical advantage to be gained by withholding it. It was submitted that it was in the interests of justice that the Court receive the evidence and reduce the applicant's sentences as would ""almost inevitably"" have occurred if the evidence of assistance had been placed before the primary judge.
	
	
	Reference was made to this Court having received such evidence in the past in exceptional cases to guard against miscarriages of justice, even when the evidence was not strictly fresh. Many v R (1990) 51 A Crim R 54 was cited as an example.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	Counsel for the Crown submitted that the new evidence of assistance is not of such a character that its absence in the proceedings in the District Court resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	It was submitted that the assistance was of limited weight. It did not, of itself, lead to the laying of any charges against any person. It did not involve the applicant giving evidence, or offering to do so: s 23(2)(b) and (d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the fact that the sentencing judge found that because the applicant continued to deny his guilt, ""There is … no remorse and contrition to be taken into account as a mitigating factor"". As a consequence, it was submitted that it could not be said that the giving of assistance supported a finding of remorse.
	
	
	It was submitted as well that the applicant's assistance to authorities would not create a situation in which he would ""suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence"": s 23(2)(g). The sentencing judge found that for other reasons, including the nature of his offences, the applicant ""will serve his time in custody significantly more arduously than would others"". The judge referred to the fact that he was in protective custody and was ""likely to remain as an A2 classified prisoner for the whole of his term of imprisonment"". He would have little, if any, access to educational facilities or rehabilitation programs. Her Honour accepted that the applicant ""has fear, genuinely based, that he may be murdered in the gaol system, if not seriously harmed"".
	


Consideration


	
	The delay in bringing this issue before the Court has obviously been considerable and is not well-explained. It is particularly curious that the matter was not pursued further in 2012 when the applicant informed the lawyers who were representing him in the conviction appeal. A further aspect is the delay between his current lawyer becoming aware of the issue in the latter half of 2014 and the commencement of proceedings only a few months ago. However, there is force in the submission that there was no tactical advantage or self-interest in the applicant's tardiness. Counsel for the Crown candidly conceded this was so.
	
	
	The rationale for reducing sentences for those who provide assistance to authorities was explained by Hunt CJ at CL and Badgery-Parker J in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 252 - 253:
	


""It is clearly in the public interest that offenders should be encouraged to supply information to the authorities which will assist them in bringing other offenders to justice and to give evidence against those other offenders in relation to whom they have given such information. In order to ensure that such encouragement is given, an appropriate reward for providing assistance should be granted, whatever an offender's motive may have been in giving it, be it genuine remorse or contrition or simply self-interest. What has to be encouraged is a full and frank co-operation on the part of the offender, whatever be his motive. The effect of the discount will depend to a large extent upon the willingness with which the disclosure is made. The offender will not receive any discount at all where he outlines his disclosure so as to reveal only the information which he knows is already in the possession of the authorities. The discount will rarely be substantial unless an offender discloses everything which he knows. To this extent, the enquiry is into the subjective nature of the offender's co-operation. If of course the motive with which the information is given is one of genuine remorse or contrition on the part of the offender, that is a circumstance which may well warrant even greater leniency being extended to him, but that is because of normal sentencing principles and practice. Contrition is not a necessary ingredient which must be shown in order to obtain the discount for giving assistance to the authorities. Again, in order to ensure such encouragement is given a reward for providing assistance should be granted if the offender has genuinely co-operated with the authorities whether or not the information supplied objectively turns out in fact to have been effective. The information which he gives must be such as could significantly assist the authorities. The information must, of course, be true; a false disclosure attracts no discount at all. What is relevant here is the potential of the information to assist the authorities as comprehended by the offender himself.""


	
	What was said in R v Cartwright remains valid in spite of the subsequent enactment of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. One of its important features, in the form which it took at the time of sentencing and still now, is the prohibition in s 23(3) against reducing a sentence to a point which is ""unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence"".
	
	
	The applicant's assistance involved the provision of information whereas significant reductions of sentence are usually reserved for offenders who also give evidence against others, or undertake to do so. Nevertheless, the assistance which concerned a rather dangerous criminal was of some substance. It was not such as to warrant a reduction of sentence by a large proportion but the extent of the reduction it should have attracted is not trivial either when one has regard to the very lengthy term that was imposed. The level of reduction should reflect the serious nature of the criminal activity about which the applicant volunteered information to police; the validity of his information; and the potential risk to which he exposed himself. The level of reduction should also serve the public interest discussed in R v Cartwright.
	
	
	In my assessment, the applicant's overall sentence should be reduced by 10 per cent. That will not be productive of an unreasonably disproportionate sentence. It will be necessary to reduce the individual sentences and the degrees of accumulation in a manner that achieves this.
	


Ground 2 - miscarriage of justice because the applicant was dealt with on the basis that he had previously been convicted of a child sexual assault offence


	
	This ground concerns another aspect of the complex procedural history. When the applicant was sentenced in 2009 his record comprised two prior convictions. They were for offences of assault and sexual assault of a person under the age of 16 years. The applicant had been sentenced for these offences in 2008 and received sentences of 18 months and 5 years respectively.
	
	
	When sentenced in 2009, the judge referred in her sentencing remarks to these matters as follows (omitting unnecessary detail):
	


""At the time he committed these offences, he was a person with no criminal record. He has subsequently been convicted of one count of sexual assault of a child under sixteen after trial, and pleaded guilty to one count of common assault in relation to the complainant before me, a matter to which I have already referred. …

The offence for which he was convicted, the child sexual assault offence, occurred sometime between early 1983 and April 1985. … The complainant and her sister were staying over, and he went into her room when she was asleep and licked her vagina. … His Honour sentenced him to an overall term of five years for that offence with a three year non-parole period backdated to commence on 16 June 2008 …

The assault to which he pleaded guilty occurred on 20 March 2004. … His Honour viewed it as a serious assault and sentenced the offender to an overall term of imprisonment of eighteen months with a non-parole period of nine months. … I am told that there is an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to both conviction and sentence in relation to these matters. It has not yet been heard, and thus I will sentence on the basis that these sentences remain as ordered.

Whilst he committed the offences before me as a person with no prior criminal record, he cannot in reality be sentenced as a person of good character or have that taken into account as a mitigating factor. It is the case that he had no criminal conviction at the time he committed these offences, but in fact as events have transpired, he had committed the child sexual offence for which he was convicted and sentenced earlier, that is, namely in 1983 to 1985. In any event, the good character of an offender in a matter like this, even if available as a mitigating circumstance, is not particularly relevant, especially where as here, the offences against the complainant and the matters before me were part of a course of ongoing conduct over a lengthy period.""


	
	The appeal to this Court to which the second sentencing judge referred was heard and determined in 2010 and resulted in the applicant's conviction for the child sexual assault offence being quashed and a retrial ordered. The Director of Public Prosecutions subsequently determined to pursue the matter no further.
	


Submissions for the applicant


	
	The written submissions for the applicant acknowledged that ""the absence of previous convictions for matters of this type is, as her Honour correctly pointed out, a matter of minor significance when an offender was participating in an ongoing course of conduct over time"". However, it was submitted that ""the fact that the applicant had a previous conviction for sexually abusing a different victim at an earlier time must have aggravated sentence to some degree"". As a consequence, the sentence imposed ""must have been somewhat higher than they ought to be in the light of the fact that the applicant's conviction for the offence involving [the other victim] has now been quashed"".
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentencing exercise carried out in 2009 ""was predicated on an incorrect fact"" and so this ground should be upheld. Alternatively, it was submitted that if Ground 1 was upheld, re-sentencing should be carried out with regard to the fact that the previous child sexual assault conviction was subsequently quashed.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	It was submitted for the Crown there is no suggestion of the primary judge having regarded the prior conviction for a child sexual assault offence as a matter of aggravation. Her Honour did not suggest that there was a greater need for general or specific deterrence or for denunciation by reason of that prior offence. She simply said that she could not take into account as a mitigating factor that the applicant was a person of prior good character. She also noted that even if she could, it would not be a matter that was ""particularly relevant"".
	
	
	Even after the conviction for the prior child sexual assault offence was quashed, it remained the fact that the applicant's record comprised a conviction for a prior assault. It therefore remained the position that he was not a person of prior good character. In short, it was submitted that the applicant's submission that the sentence ""must have been somewhat higher"" could not be sustained.
	


Consideration


	
	The Crown's submission should be accepted. The sentencing judge’s treatment of the past convictions was confined to denying the applicant a mitigating factor of prior good character that is conceded to be of minimal significance in any event. A finding of prior good character would not have been open if her Honour had been aware only of the prior assault offence, particularly when that offence concerned the same victim as in the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced.
	
	
	This ground cannot be upheld.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	In re-sentencing, in the unusual circumstances of this case, it is, arguably, simply a matter for this Court to arithmetically adjust the sentences imposed upon the applicant to give effect to the allowance that should be made for his assistance to authorities. A literal interpretation of what was said by the High Court of Australia in Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 would have it that the Court is required to completely re-exercise the entire sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The point need not be decided here because there was consensus at the hearing of the application that, subject to the two matters raised by the grounds of appeal, the sentences imposed in the District Court were otherwise appropriate. In indicating why I accept the correctness of that consensus it is necessary to provide some detail about the offences in question and the applicant's subjective case.
	
	
	The complainant is the niece of the applicant's wife. She went to live with them in February 1995 when she was 9 years old because her father was deceased and her mother had a serious mental illness. The applicant assumed the role of a parent towards her but from the time when she was 12 years of age until she was 18 years of age he repeatedly subjected her to sexual abuse.
	
	
	The following are the details of each of the 10 offences. The statutory provisions referred to are all within the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The commencement dates for the sentences are as adjusted by this Court following the quashing of some unrelated sentences.
	


Count 1 - aggravated indecent assault - s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) - maximum penalty 7 years


	
	On an occasion when the complainant was 12 years old the applicant told her to lie on his bed with him. He was watching a pornographic video and touching his penis. He touched and rubbed her genital area on the outside of her clothing and told her to touch herself. She refused to do so and got up and left quickly.
	
	
	Sentence: fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing 16 June 2008.
	


Count 4 - aggravated sexual intercourse with child between 10 and 16 - s 66C(2) - maximum penalty 10 years and Count 5 - commit act of indecency towards person under 16 - s 61O(1) - maximum penalty 5 years


	
	In 1998 when the complainant was aged 12 or 13 there was an occasion when the applicant dragged her to her bedroom and threw her onto her bed. He pulled her underwear down, lifted up her skirt and licked her vaginal area. The complainant was screaming and crying and telling him to stop. He was angry and told her to shut up. The applicant then told the complainant to watch him masturbating to ejaculation into a towel. He said to her, ""Sorry mate, I just had to do that"".
	
	
	Sentence: fixed terms of imprisonment for 3 years and for 12 months, both commencing 16 June 2009.
	


Counts 6 and 7 - each, aggravated sexual intercourse with child between 10 and 16 - s 66C(2) - maximum penalty 10 years


	
	On an occasion in the first half of 1999 when the complainant was aged 13 she was home alone with the applicant. He told her to go to the front room, take her clothes off and lie on the floor which she did. He then performed oral sex upon her. The applicant took off his pants and asked the complainant to perform oral sex on him which she did. He ejaculated into her mouth. She then ran to her bedroom and then to a friend's house across the road.
	
	
	Sentence: fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years from 16 June 2010.
	


Count 8 - attempted aggravated sexual intercourse with child between 10 and 16 - ss 66C(2) and 66D - maximum penalty 10 years


	
	Each of the offences in Counts 8 to 10 occurred during the summer school holidays of 1999-2000 when the complainant was aged 14. On one occasion he told her to come to his room and offered her wine which she refused. He had previously spoken of wanting to have sex with her but she said she did not want to. On this occasion he told her that she was developed enough now, it would not hurt and she should relax but she reiterated that she did not want to. He tried to penetrate her vagina but was unsuccessful. She was crying, squirming and experiencing considerable pain. She pushed him off and went to her bedroom.
	
	
	Sentence: fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing 16 June 2011.
	


Count 9 - attempted aggravated sexual intercourse with child between 10 and 16 - ss 66C(2) and 66D - maximum penalty 10 years


	
	On another occasion in the same holiday period he did the same thing. He used a condom and lubricant but was again unsuccessful in achieving penetration. She experienced pain and told him to stop, which he did not do immediately. After some 10 minutes she went to her own bedroom.
	
	
	Sentence: fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing 16 June 2011.
	


Count 10 - aggravated sexual intercourse with child between 10 and 16 - s 66C(2) - maximum penalty 10 years


	
	On another occasion in this period the applicant again asked the complainant to have sex with him and this time succeeded in achieving penetration. He wore a condom, used a lubricant and ejaculated. She experienced pain once again.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that by this stage the complainant had come to accept that this was what was expected of her and so she did not resist any longer. She thought she had no choice; it was going to happen anyway; so she went along with it to avoid any force or violence.
	
	
	Sentence: fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years commencing 16 June 2011.
	


Count 11 - assault - s 61 - maximum penalty 2 years


	
	This offence occurred at the end of 2001 when the applicant was in what the judge described as a jealous rage because the complainant had been in the company of a young man the previous night at a school formal. The assault included kicking and putting the complainant onto the floor with his hands around her neck while he was kneeling on top of her. He said he was going to kill her and that she was a liar. The judge accepted that there was no suggestion of physical injury but it was towards the top of the range in terms of objective seriousness for such an offence.
	
	
	Sentence: fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months commencing 16 June 2012.
	


Count 13 - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent - s 61J - maximum penalty 20 years - standard non-parole period 10 years


	
	The complainant was aged 18 when this offence occurred on about 13 December 2003. She had just returned home from ""Schoolies Week"". The applicant asked her about men she may have met. He then told her to go to the front room and she realised this meant he wanted to have sex with her. She told him that she did not want to and that she hated him and he disgusted her. She was crying but took off her clothes because she thought she had no choice. While he was having penile-vaginal intercourse with her she scratched his back and told him that he was a disgusting paedophile. He said that she was putting him off and the intercourse ended without ejaculation.
	
	
	The complainant moved out of the applicant's home in early 2004.
	
	
	Sentence: imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 16 June 2013.
	
	
	Taken into account at the applicant's request in sentencing for Count 13 was an offence of using a carriage service to access child pornographic material (s 474.19 Criminal Code (Cth)). 303 images from 32 web pages were found when a search warrant was executed after the applicant was arrested. Her Honour described some as ""not particularly explicit"" while others ""were at the highest level of explicitness"".
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence in the trial of ""numerous"" occasions when similar sexual activity occurred. Appropriately, the judge took this into account only as an indication that the charged acts for which the applicant was found guilty were not isolated incidents. There was also evidence in the trial of the applicant saying things to the complainant by way of manipulation and coercion; for example, ""Come on mate, we're friends. We have a special bond. It will stop when you're eighteen, it is only sex, it happens all the time. This is very common.""
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the complainant coming into the applicant's home ""as a very needy nine-year-old girl whose father had died when she was very young, and whose mother was not able to care for her because of her own mental health problems"". She said the offences constituted a ""gross violation of the trust that children ought to feel they can place in all adults, but particularly parents or those who stand in the place of their parents, to have their innocence removed from them in this way"". She described each of the offences as serious and, correctly with respect, noted the importance of general deterrence in sentencing.
	


The applicant's subjective case


	
	The applicant was aged 60 at the time of sentencing. He had been married for 39 years and his wife remained supportive. As indicated earlier, the judge found there was no remorse.
	
	
	The judge accepted expert opinion that the applicant experienced post-traumatic stress disorder arising from his employment and also that he suffered from a chronic adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. There was no evidence connecting his offending behaviour with any of his psychological or psychiatric conditions but the judge accepted it lessened the weight to be given to general deterrence and that the conditions would likely deteriorate through incarceration. Further, and as previously mentioned, the judge accepted that the applicant's time in custody would be significantly more arduous because of his protective classification.
	
	
	The judge found special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and reduced the non-parole component of the sentence accordingly.
	


Determination


	
	Having taken into account the considerable seriousness of the applicant's offending but also aspects of his subjective case, the most pertinent being his mental condition, I am satisfied that the common position of the parties as to the otherwise appropriateness of the sentences imposed in the District Court should be accepted.
	


Orders


	
	In giving effect to the applicant's success on Ground 1, and with some rounding for practical purposes, I propose the following orders which will have the effect that the applicant will be subject to an overall sentence of 13 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 9 years:
	


1   Time to file Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal extended to 1 June 2016.

2   Leave to appeal granted and appeal allowed.

3   Sentences imposed in the District Court on 6 November 2009 quashed and the following sentences imposed:

		25 October 2016",2016-10-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2772595,Shore v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 270,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for rulings on 8 September 2016 in relation to the form of certain of the imputations pleaded as arising from the matter complained of, an article published in the Daily Telegraph on 3 June 2016.
	
	
	The matter complained of, appearing under the heading “Origin a tactic for invasion” and credited to Jack Houghton, is only five paragraphs long. I start the numbering at 3 to allow for the heading and byline to be numbered:
	


“3. POLICE are investigating if a scorned lover used the State of Origin as a distraction to mount a brutal home invasion against her ex-husband.

4. A 78-year old grandmother was found by police bound to a chair with cable ties after three men clad in balaclavas and gloves raided her northwest Sydney home. Her son, who lives with the elderly woman, told police a bitter custody dispute with his ex-wife had escalated to an elaborate plot to steal “court documents” while he took their children to the football on Wednesday night.

5. “She knows I’m there every night with Mum but (on the night) she knew I would be at the game because I had the kid,” he said. “(Mum) called me at 10.30 pm after (the men) left and I called the police who went and untied her.”

6. The Daily Telegraph understands the stolen documents directly relate to the custody dispute between the parents.

7. “She is capable of this but I just didn’t expect it,” the man said. “There is also a boyfriend in the picture who matches the description of one of the intruders.”


	
	The plaintiffs assert, by reasons of extrinsic identification facts, that each of them is identifiable as the “ex-wife” and “boyfriend” respectively. The first plaintiff pleads ten imputations, and the second plaintiff pleads six imputations. In the course of exchange of correspondence a series of alterations has resulted in so many proposed amendments that I do not propose to set out the imputations as pleaded in the statement of claim. I have simply made rulings on the imputations which I have been asked to rule on.
	
	
	Prior to the argument a number of imputations were the subject of agreed amendment. The five remaining imputations the subject of challenge for the first plaintiff (the ex-wife of the second defendant) are:
	



	
	The first plaintiff mounted a brutal home invasion against her ex-husband (imputation 4(a)).
	
	
	The first plaintiff fabricated an elaborate plot to steal court documents from the home of her ex-husband while he took their children to a football match (imputation 4(c)).
	
	
	The first plaintiff caused a 78-year old grandmother to be bound to a chair with cable ties in a home invasion (imputation 4(d);
	
	
	The first plaintiff is the sort of person who would have a home invader as a boyfriend (Imputation 4(e));
	
	
	The first plaintiff is a criminal (imputation 4(i)).
	



	
	The four imputations the subject of challenge for the second plaintiff (the person alleged to be the first plaintiff’s boyfriend) are:
	



	
	The second plaintiff was one of three men who carries out a brutal home invasion (imputation 6(a));
	
	
	The second plaintiff was one of three men who invaded the home of a 78-year old grandmother and bound her to a chair with cable ties (imputation 6(b));
	
	
	The second plaintiff is a criminal (imputation 6(c)).
	
	
	The second plaintiff was the boyfriend of the first plaintiff who organised a home invasion (imputation 6(e)).
	



	
	Given the similarity between certain of the imputations pleaded for both plaintiffs, this reduces to five challenges to the imputations pleaded.
	
	
	The principles relevant to capacity are set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[136] as being an exercise in generosity not parsimony, and as a matter of impression. The relevant principles concerning challenges to the form of imputations are set out in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 137. The observations of Gleeson CJ concerning the need for practical justice rather than philology when determining objections to form are particularly apt in these proceedings, given the brevity of the matter complained of.
	


Imputation 4(a)


	
	This is a significant imputation for the first plaintiff, because the words in this paragraph, commencing with the word “POLICE” in capital letters, are in slightly larger type and distil the meaning of the story. The defendants’ solicitors wrote making objection is to the word “mount”, on the basis that this word is ambiguous and could mean organised, authorised and/or actively participated in the home invasion. The first plaintiff initially sought to accommodate this objection by pleading three separate imputations containing each of these words, only to be met by a submission that, although the defendants had previously asserted these meanings were different, the three imputations did not differ in substance, and only an imputation that the first plaintiff “organised” the home invasion should be permitted.
	
	
	The objections of the defendants were:
	



	
	The word “mount” was itself ambiguous in itself, in that it had more than one meaning; and
	
	
	Whether the word had more than one meaning or not, the use of “mount” was impermissible as it appears in the matter complained of.
	



	
	Plaintiffs are keen to use the precise words in the publication in their imputations, becaus it is perceived as being more difficult for a defendant to submit to the tribunal of fact that the imputation is not conveyed. Objections from defendants are generally expressed as being uncertainty as to what to justify to claims that the meaning is obscure, but the underlying problem is always that, as Hutley JA noted in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 688:
	


“Though a defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet, it is strange to hear the suggestion that this defendant does not understand an imputation which is precisely in the words it has used, so that it is embarrassed in justifying it. This must mean it does not know what it is alleged an ordinary reasonable hearer would make of it.”

Ambiguity


	
	There is a long history of challenge to the form of imputations on the basis that words in the matter complained of are asserted to be ambiguous:
	



	
	Words can be ambiguous where the level of meaning is extremely general (such as “wrongly” and “improper”).
	
	
	There is a genuine double meaning (such as “corrupt”, which can mean different kinds of dishonest behaviour).
	
	
	The word used is a “weasel word”: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 163 (see Don Watson, “The Dictionary of Weasel Words” (Knopf, Sydney, 2005)).
	
	
	There is an alternative specialist legal meaning (such as “breach of trust”).
	
	
	The word is slang. However, what is “slang” may change from case to case. In Jones v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1854 no objection was taken to “conman”, whereas its appropriateness in an imputation was the subject of challenge in Young v Munro (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 12 May 1995).
	
	
	The imputation uses the words of the matter complained of: Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255; Waller v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 611.
	
	
	The imputation uses words which are a mere rhetorical flourish which do not add to the sting of the imputation and are thus impermissible: Mayfield-Smith v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 419 at 420; Waterhouse v David Syme & Co Ltd [2000] NSWSC 817 at [22].
	



	
	In the present case, the defendants’ submissions are that the ambiguity falls within categories (b) and (f).
	
	
	This is a eight-sentence publication. How precise does a plaintiff have to be in such circumstances?
	
	
	In Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation Gleeson CJ, explaining why an imputation “X is disgusting” might be permitted where that was all that was said, went on to state (at 137):
	


“The requirement upon a plaintiff cannot go beyond doing the best that can reasonably be done in the circumstances.”


	
	Gleeson CJ illustrated this point by noting (at 148) that the imputation “the plaintiff was an abortionist” had been wrongly struck out by the first instance judge in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd “because it forced the plaintiff into pleading with greater precision” than the actual publication.
	
	
	Although Gleeson CJ said in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in the clearest of terms, that Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd remained the law, arguments about lack of specificity have been a continuing feature of defamation practice notwithstanding Hutley JA pointing out (in Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 671, concerning imputations in the passive voice) that “there are no forms of imputations”.
	
	
	The defendants draw my attention to Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd, where Hunt AJA explained that merely pleading the words of the matter complained of as the imputation for which the party contends – where those words do not adequately distil the act or condition attributed to the plaintiff – does not comply with the requirements of the rules of pleading. Hunt AJA said:
	


“Justification for pleading the imputations in the words of the matter complained of is sought in a statement by Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (at 137), that the requirement placed by r 11(2) on the plaintiff to specify the act or condition which he claims was attributed to him cannot go beyond doing the best that can reasonably be done in the circumstances. It is said that, as the plaintiff does not know the precise sense the defendant intended to convey, the most he can reasonably do in the circumstances is to use the defendant’s own words in his imputations. This is a complete misinterpretation as to what the Chief Justice said in Drummoyne.

Gleeson CJ said (at 137) that the requirement that the plaintiff specify the act or condition he claims was attributed to him raises questions of degree, and that the satisfaction of that requirement depends on the circumstances of the particular case, as the attribution of an act or condition may be done with a high degree of particularity or it may take the form of the most generalised and non-specific abuse. Therefore, the Chief Justice said, the requirement placed on the plaintiff cannot go beyond doing the best that can reasonably be done in the circumstances, and the appropriate degree of specificity needs to be related to the nature and content of the defamatory matter. Those statements do not justify this new method of pleading imputations.

To start with, the issue is not what the defendant intended to convey; the issue is how the ordinary reasonable reader interpreted what the defendant said. What the Chief Justice made clear when he commenced his remarks on this subject was that the plaintiff must specify the act or condition ‘which he claims was attributed to him’ and he concluded his remarks by accepting the test formulated at first instance (already quoted in para [124] supra) that the issue which has to be decided in the particular case is ‘whether there is likely to be confusion either at the pleading stage or at the trial in relation to the meaning for which the plaintiff contends’. The plaintiff is required to specify the act or condition which he contends was understood by the ordinary reasonable reader as being attributed to him by the matter complained of. Unless his imputation identifies that act or condition, the defendant has no way of knowing whether he can plead various defences to the publication. He is entitled to have that identification made before pleading. The trial judge who has to decide the defences pleaded is also entitled to have identified the act or condition found by the jury to have been understood by the ordinary reasonable reader as being attributed to the plaintiff by the matter complained of [127–129].”


	
	However, in the present case, the word “mount” makes sense in the matter complained of, just as it does in the imputation, in the way that Hutley JA considered in Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission was permissible.
	
	
	The next submission was that the defendants did not know the case they had to meet. In Piggins v Denton [2006] NSWSC 954, Simpson J criticised the practice of defendants asserting that they did not know what evidence to lead to plead a defence of justification to an imputation that the plaintiff was responsible for a particular event. The word used in the imputation challenged in those proceedings was the word “responsible”:
	


“[21] One of the objections taken to the form of this imputation concerned the use of the expression “is responsible for”. The complaint is that the imputation fails to specify in what respect the plaintiff is said to bear responsibility for the failure of the club; it fails to identify any act or condition which made him so responsible.

[22] This is a familiar refrain in the submissions of defendants concerning the formulation of imputations. It is frequently, as in this case, attached to a further argument about the difficulty a defendant would experience in attempting to justify the imputations. Underlying this is a notion that, in my opinion, ought to be exploded. It is that plaintiffs ought to be required to frame imputations in such a way as to facilitate the defence of the plaintiff’s claim. This is not so.”


	
	The word or words used must be sufficiently clear so as to avoid the likelihood of confusion in relation to the meaning the plaintiff contends (Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Alex [2014] NSWCA 273 per McColl JA at [21]). It should be as broad, or as narrow, as the matter complained of, but does not need to be more specific than the language of the matter complained of itself.
	


Use of the words in the matter complained of


	
	The actual words of the matter complained of may be used where their meaning is clear (Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 per McColl JA at [29]; Waller v Nationwide News Pty Ltd per McCallum J at [18]).
	
	
	However, an imputation is not necessarily conveyed merely by repeating the language of the publication: Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 per Beazley P and Ward JA at [21].
	
	
	In Capolingua v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2016] WASC 156, Le Miere J struck out as ambiguous a contextual imputation in the form of the words of the matter complained of. The language which was copied referred to the plaintiff behaving “inconsistently with her obligation to be scrupulous in the use of public resources”:
	


“[14] The defendant complains that its imputation is no more uncertain than the plaintiff’s imputation pleaded at par 6.1 of the statement of claim. There are two answers to that submission. First, I am not dealing with an application to strike out the plaintiff’s imputation. Secondly, the addition of the phrase ‘and inconsistently with her obligation to be scrupulous in the use of public resources’ to the imputation that the plaintiff had wrongfully obtained the tickets renders the imputation uncertain and embarrassing. The adverb ‘wrongfully’ in pleading imputations should be avoided unless the context in which it is used makes clear its intended meaning and the degree of wrongfulness involved: McCormick v John Fairfax &Sons Ltd(1989) NSWLR 485 494 (Hunt J). In the plaintiff’s imputation, the word ‘wrongfully’ is qualified or elaborated upon by the word ‘deliberately’. The defendant’s imputation qualifies or elaborates upon the notion that the plaintiff obtained the tickets ‘wrongfully’ by adding that she did so ‘inconsistently with her obligation to be scrupulous in the use of public resources’ which, as I have said, is relevantly ambiguous. What is the plaintiff said to have done? Is it that she deliberately obtained the tickets wrongfully, in which case the imputation does not differ from the plaintiff’s. Or is it that the plaintiff wrongfully obtained the tickets recklessly, negligently, carelessly or without sufficient diligence?”


	
	No such problem occurs here. The word “mount”, when read in context, has a clear meaning. The dictionary or “vertical” meaning of the word is not the only meaning; the real meaning comes from the horizontal flow of language forming the sentence in which it appears.
	
	
	The defendants complained that “mount” had three meanings (organise, authorise and actively participated) but when the first plaintiff proposed three imputations setting this out, the defendants objected to that course, and sought to bind the first plaintiff to the word “organise” on the basis that this was the only way the imputation could be distilled to give its actual meaning.
	
	
	In additional submissions in support of the word “organise”, Ms Barnett referred to Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Alex at [23]-[24]. She submitted that the ambiguity arose because it was clear the first plaintiff was not actually at the premises and that the word “mount” (which included not merely authorising but participating) did not accurately distil the meaning. Ms Barnet submitted that it was clear from the matter complained of that “the first plaintiff was the one who was at home using the State of Origin as a ploy” and that “she was not there” (meaning she was not at the scene of the home invasion).
	
	
	That is not what the matter complained of says. The first plaintiff used the State of Origin as a ploy because she knew her ex-husband would be taking the children to the football and that her ex-husband’s mother would be at home alone. There is no statement in the matter complained of that the first plaintiff was “at home” somewhere else, or “not there”. I am not prepared to read this into the text. Nor am I prepared to order Mr Evatt to adhere to the word “organised” because he suggested this as one of the three alternative meanings. A party is entitled to change his or her position during argument.
	
	
	This is a clear case of the sting of the libel being captured by the use of the word in the matter complained of. Courts should be cautious not to “straitjacket” a plaintiff into Thesaurus-based alternatives: Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos (2001) 54 NSWLR 165 at [18]. I am satisfied that the word “mount” is not ambiguous and that it encapsulates the sting of the libel.
	
	
	Accordingly I reject the defendants’ submissions that the form of this imputation is defective.
	


Imputation 4(c)


	
	This was amended by agreement during submissions to replace “fabricated” with “organised”.
	


Imputations 4(a) and 4(d), 6(a) and (b) and 6(d)


	
	Mr Richardson acknowledged that imputation 4(d) arose. The submission was that these imputations did not differ in substance, as imputation 4(d) specified the brutality in the home invasion in imputation 4(a).
	
	
	The acts of mounting a home invasion and directing the tying up of a 78-year-old woman with cable ties are two separate acts. The first plaintiff is entitled to plead an imputation arising from such conduct.
	
	
	The same is the case in relation to imputations 6(a) and 6(b).
	
	
	The parties had conflicting submissions about whether there would be objection to imputation 6(d), but Ms Barnett withdrew her objections during the argument. Mr Richardson had already acknowledged imputation 6(d) (“the second plaintiff was one of three men who invaded a home in North West Sydney in order to steal court documents”) was reasonably capable of being conveyed. I will note in the orders that this imputation, as well as the others set out under this heading, are reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	


Imputation 4(e) and 6(e)


	
	The fact that a person is a relative or spouse of a criminal – even a notorious criminal – has been held not to be capable (without more) of conveying a defamatory imputation: Galea v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 20 February 1998).
	
	
	The publication in Galea v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd was described by Levine J as:
	


“…reprehensible in the sense, as I understand it, that the photograph of [the plaintiff] and the attribution of a family relationship is a gratuitous falsity. It does not however amount to an actionable defamation and accordingly I summarily dismiss the action striking out the Statement of Claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action in defamation.” 


	
	Mr Evatt sought to argue that being a boyfriend or girlfriend imputed more than being a relative, in that one cannot choose one’s relatives. However, unless the imputation goes on to assert that the relationship results in the plaintiff turning a blind eye to, or benefiting from, the criminal acts (as to which see Krahe v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 536), it is not capable of being defamatory.
	
	
	An additional problem, in the present case, is that the matter complained of makes it clear that the plaintiffs conspired with each other to commit the crimes described. In those circumstances, this imputation misses the point entirely, as Mr Richardson noted in his opening observations.
	
	
	These imputations are not reasonably capable of being conveyed and, for the reasons expressed in Galea v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd, not capable of being defamatory.
	


Imputations 4(i) and 6(c)


	
	In Corby v Network Ten Pty Ltd; Corby Junior v Network Ten Pty Ltd; Rose v Network Ten Pty Ltd; Kisina v Network Ten Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1431, the plaintiffs each pleaded an imputation that “the plaintiff is a criminal in that he/she runs illegal drugs to Indonesia”. The defendants’ objections are that, if such words were to be added here, this would effectively mean that an imputation “the plaintiff is a criminal” could not differ in substance from the conduct described in the other imputations. There is no suggestion that other forms of criminality are imputed.
	
	
	Mr Evatt submitted that the reference to “criminal” was “the general” rather than “the specific”. Mr Richardson submitted that the criminal conduct was set out in no less than four imputations. In those circumstances, it was a rolled-up claim without sufficient refinement.
	
	
	I accept the defendants’ submission that this imputation, for each of the plaintiffs, does not differ in substance from other imputations of criminality pleaded and should be struck out.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiffs have had to make major amendments before and during the argument, and must now file an amended statement of claim. The defendants have been substantially successful and the appropriate order is for the plaintiffs to pay their costs.
	


Orders


	
	The orders made in relation to capacity set out in the orders below are all made pursuant to a separate trial under r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). The orders made in relation to objections as to form are similarly all made pursuant to r 14.30.
	



	
	Imputation 4(a) is reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Grant leave to the first plaintiff to amend imputation 4(c) to read “The first plaintiff organised an elaborate plot to steal court documents”.
	
	
	Imputation 4(d) is reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Imputations 4(e) and 6(e) are struck out.
	
	
	Imputations 4(i) and 6(c) are struck out.
	
	
	Imputations 6(a), 6(b) and 6(d) are reasonably capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Note the plaintiffs concede that paragraphs 3 and 5, which refer to “the defendants” as publishers, is pleaded contrary to the principles set out in Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288.
	
	
	The plaintiffs are to file an amended statement of claim in 14 days setting out the revised and amended imputations and revisions to paragraphs 3 and 5.
	
	
	The plaintiffs are to pay the defendants’ costs of the imputations argument.
	
	
	Defence to be filed and served 28 days after service of the amended statement of claim.
	
	
	Reply to be filed and served 7 days thereafter.
	
	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Thursday 10 November 2016.

		27 October 2016",2016-10-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2774641,Evitts v R [2015] NSWDC 415,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentences passed by the Chief Magistrate, His Honour Judge Henson, sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 30 September 2015.
	
	
	The appellant was charged with two offences. The first charge was that late in the evening of 17 March 2015 or early in the morning of 18 March 2015 the appellant assaulted Constable Samantha Almond, a police officer, when she was executing her duty, by kicking her in the crotch with her high healed shoe. The second offence was that in the same period of time the appellant failed to leave licenced premises, namely, Jacksons on George, situated at 175 George Street, Sydney when required to do so by an authorised person, she being a person to whom an authorised person was entitled to refuse admission to the licensed premises under s 77 of the Liquor Act 2007. The offence is constituted by s 77(4) of that Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for assaulting a police officer in the execution of his or her duty is imprisonment for two years and or a fine of $5,500 if the matter be prosecuted in the Local Court. If the matter were prosecuted in this Court the appellant would have been liable for imprisonment for up to five years. The maximum penalty for the offence under the Liquor Act 2007 is a fine of $5,500.
	
	
	17 March in any year is St Patrick’s Day. In 2015 St Patrick’s Day fell on a Tuesday. At about 11.30pm on St Patrick’s Day 2015 the appellant was in Jackson’s on George. She approached the bar in order to purchase a drink but was observed by bar staff to be moderately intoxicated, slurring her speech, displaying pale, flushed skin and bloodshot watery eyes. She was refused service by the bar staff. The appellant then argued with the bar staff that she was not intoxicated. She was then approached by security guards who advised her that because of her level of intoxication she was required to leave the premises. The appellant then started arguing with the security guards and according to the agreed facts was “quarrelsome”. She repeatedly called the bar staff “twats”. She was to use that terminology throughout the evening. That terminology is slang for female genitalia. It now also has come to mean the buttocks. During her argument with the security staff the security staff showed her an information card advising her of the fact that it was a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up $550 to refuse to leave premises when intoxicated. According to the agreed facts the appellant read the card out aloud to the security staff making a joke of the situation. Because she failed to leave the premises as was required by the security staff, the police were called.
	
	
	The police arrived at 10 minutes to midnight. They were identified in the Facts Sheet as being five in number but the only relevant member of the New South Wales Police was Constable Almond whom I have already mentioned. The police identified themselves to the appellant and told her that by failing to leave the premises upon being directed to do so by the security staff she had committed an offence. The appellant then commenced arguing with the police. She protested that she was not intoxicated. Nevertheless, the police could smell intoxicating liquor on her breath, and observed her to display pale, flushed skin. She was slurring her speech, she was unsteady on her feet and her eyes were bloodshot. Still protesting that she was not intoxicated the appellant was escorted out of the premises by the police. Outside the premises there was a further argument between the appellant and the police. She requested them to administer a breath test to her, calling the police “twats”. She protested that she had done nothing wrong. She also protested that she had never been told to leave by the security staff which was obviously untrue. When asked to provide identification she protested that she had none on her. Because of her argumentative and quarrelsome behaviour she was arrested for a breach of s 77 of the Liquor Act 2007. She was then escorted to the rear of a police caged vehicle and directed to sit down on the floor of the cage. She was then told to keep her feet still whilst the police took her pink high heels from her feet.
	
	
	The agreed facts continue thus:
	


“Swearing at police the accused has again stated: ‘You fucking twats, I haven’t done anything wrong’. Immediately pushing herself towards the back, the rear back wall of the caged section of the vehicle, the accused has quickly brought back both her legs, tucking her knees in towards her chest.

Police were trying to remove the accused’s shoes and the accused pushed her legs forwards extending them out straight in the direction of the police. Coming into contact with Constable Almond, the accused has dug the heels of her pink high heels into the crotch region of Constable Almond. Constable Almond has felt immediate pain to her crotch region.

Police have immediately grabbed the accused’s legs. Holding her legs, police then removed the accused’s pink high heels from her feet. The appellant was then advised that she was now also under arrest for assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty. The appellant was then conveyed to the Day Street Police Station but whilst in custody continued to be quarrelsome, argumentative and belligerent and continued to swear at the police.”

In her evidence today the appellant said that she only swore once at the police but that is inconsistent with the agreed facts on which the appellant stood for sentence, before the learned Chief Magistrate.


	
	According to the agreed facts when the appellant had the charges explained to her, she said to Constable Almond “you deserved to be kicked”. The appellant denied saying that in her oral evidence today but clearly that was an agreed fact on which she stood for sentence before the learned Chief Magistrate.
	
	
	At the time of these offences the appellant was 26 years old. She remains that age. She came before the Local Court as a lady of prior good character. She has no criminal record in Australia and has given evidence, which I am prepared to accept, that she had no prior record in the United Kingdom. The appellant was born and grew up in and was educated in the United Kingdom. She graduated from Loughborough University where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Sports and Exercise Science. She then joined Deloitte in the United Kingdom and became a qualified accountant. She became a chartered accountant in 2004, gaining that qualification from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales. She came to Australia in late 2014 and is working in Australia for Deloitte on a 457 visa. She works for Deloitte as a senior analyst here in Sydney.
	
	
	The original court attendance notices were first returnable on 22 April 2015. They were next mentioned on 3 June 2015. On 10 June 2015 they were again mentioned before Magistrate O’Brien who confirmed that pleas of not guilty had been entered. I can only assume that the first pleas of not guilty were entered either on 22 April or 3 June. On 10 June the Deputy Chief Magistrate, Magistrate O’Brien, set the matter down for hearing on 16 September 2015. When the matter came on for hearing on that day the appellant entered pleas of guilty before Magistrate Keogh and the matter was then adjourned until 30 September 2015 when the appellant stood for sentence before his Honour Judge Henson the Chief Magistrate. His Honour fined the appellant $1,000 for the offence of assaulting a police office in the execution of the officer’s duty and fined the appellant $500 for the offence contrary to s 77(4) of the Liquor Act 2007.
	
	
	In essence, the appellant asks me to deal with her under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. She wishes me to set the convictions aside and to place her on a bond to be of good behaviour under s 10. In the alternative to my dealing with her on that basis, in respect of both the offences, the appellant asks that I deal with her for assaulting the police officer under s 10 but the fine entered for the offence against the Liquor Act 2007 stand.
	
	
	Clearly, this young lady was a woman of prior good character. She has contributed much to our community, perhaps I should say ‘to our communities’. There is evidence before me of her doing work for the disadvantaged in the United Kingdom when she was a student and of assisting those less fortunate than her. She represented the United Kingdom in karate. She was obviously also a keen sportswoman and still is an active sportswoman. In a reference from her sister the following is stated:
	


“Prior to Emily’s corporate career she has worked with a local sporting initiative within the community on an employed and volunteer basis, and has worked in a boarding school environment where she has demonstrated her compassionate and caring nature, as well as leadership, moral guidance and overall decency of character.”

There are a large number of references before me, as there were before the learned Chief Magistrate, attesting to this event being out of character. I accept that it is unlikely that the appellant will offend again in any similar manner, chastened as she has been by the legal process to date and the odium that she has experienced as a result of her being prosecuted for these offences. She clearly has been ashamed and embarrassed.


	
	Under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the things which I can take into consideration are: the appellant’s character, her antecedents, her age, her health and her mental condition, the trivial nature of the offence, any extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, or any other matter that a Court thinks proper to consider.
	
	
	The offence of assaulting a police officer, is not trivial. I cannot see any extenuating circumstance. This was, as has been submitted by the Crown, alcohol-fuelled violence. There is no matter other than those specifically stated in s 10(3) that has been drawn to my attention. In essence, the appellant relies on her prior good character, her relative youth, and she also relies on a “medical condition”. She also relies upon the fact that the convictions recorded may interfere with her professional career path. As a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales she is required to notify that Institute of any conviction. Such is common in many professions, not only accountancy, but also in law and medicine. However, I believe it unlikely that the sort of offence which the offender has been convicted will lead to any change of status as a chartered accountant. One would think that any conviction for any crime involving dishonesty would interfere with such a qualification but it is difficult to see how this crime could affect a person’s ability to work as an accountant.
	
	
	The appellant relied upon a report of Tracey Cahn, a clinical psychologist, dated 28 September 2015 following upon an interview on 21 September 2015. Ms Cahn diagnosed “adjustment disorder mixed anxiety and depressed mood”. Quite frankly anybody who is about to appear for sentence would be expected to be suffering from anxiety and depression. According to Ms Cahn’s report a number of events were identified as contributing factors to the emotional distress precipitating “the incident” which I assume is meant the two criminal offences committed by the appellant. The list of events is this:
	



	
	“Moderate drinking at the time of the incident.
	
	
	Lack of knowledge of Australian Liquor Laws relating to removal from premises/failure to leave.
	
	
	Perception of provocative actions by the security guard, which triggered a reactive response by Ms Evitts.
	
	
	A strong belief that she was not intoxicated and her behaviour at the time of the incident was not unruly.
	
	
	Poor strategies for the management of alcohol.”
	


The first is the moderate drinking at the time of the incident. Ms Cahn had a history that the appellant went out with a group of work colleagues for work drinks at approximately 9pm. According to Ms Cahn’s history the appellant consumed four small glasses of wine at an establishment called “The Hart” and then proceeded to Jacksons on George at approximately 10pm. As I have earlier stated she was refused service at 11.30pm at Jacksons on George. According to the appellant’s oral evidence before me she had nothing to drink at Jacksons on George and when she approached the bar to obtain her first drink there she was denied service. However, what the appellant actually consumed on this evening is a matter of conjecture. The appellant told me not that she went drinking at 9pm but that she went drinking at 6.30pm. She did not have “four small glasses of wine” but four large glasses of wine. Whether the glasses of wine were large or small one would not expect if only four had been consumed between 6.30 and 11.30pm one would not expect the level of intoxication noted by bar staff, security staff and the police. Inherently, what the appellant says about the extent of her intoxication and the extent of her alcohol consumption is extremely unreliable.


	
	The next point raised by the psychologist was a lack of knowledge of “Australian Liquor Laws”. There is no Australian Liquor Law. There are laws in each State and Territory of the Commonwealth which are different. However, most of our law is still based on English law and the extent of the differences between the law in the States and the United Kingdom is not great. Furthermore, ignorance of the law is no excuse.
	
	
	The next point raised by the psychologist was “perception of provocative actions by the security guard”. That is only her perception and the perception of people when intoxicated is often erroneous. Nothing can be attributed to such a perception other than intoxication.
	
	
	The next point raised by the psychologist was a “strong belief” that the appellant was not intoxicated. She protested her sobriety to both the bar staff, the security staff and the police but none of them accepted that, nor does the appellant now accept that, because she has pleaded guilty to the offence under the Liquor Act 2007. Her “strong belief” was in fact a misunderstanding of the situation based on her intoxication.
	
	
	That the appellant had “poor strategies for the management of alcohol” consumption is axiomatic. There is nothing in the report other than an attempt to medicalise what is in fact criminal behaviour.
	
	
	The provisions in s 10 about taking into account the offender’s health and mental condition is not here apposite. If it were so, it would mean that anyone who committed an offence whilst intoxicated ought be given the benefit of s 10.
	
	
	There are two things which point in the opposite direction to the path that the appellant asks me to take. The first point is that police do a very important job in our community. Without the police there would be disorder. The police keep the peace. They do dangerous work often and often, for it, are abused. They expose themselves to danger and here Constable Almond was assaulted and suffered pain in her groin. Police often do work for which they are abused but which ultimately is in the interests of everybody concerned. They run risks, they are entitled to protection of not only the Courts and the law but also the general community. As I said earlier, assaulting a police office is not a trivial offence. The appellant’s general behaviour was self-indulgent and belligerent. Not only did she assault Constable Almond but she told Constable Almond that she deserved to be kicked. Clearly, the appellant intended to kick the constable despite what she said in the witness box today.
	
	
	The other thing which stands against the course which the appellant asksme to take is that she appeared for sentence before another Judge of this Court who also holds the position as Chief Magistrate of this State. His Honour is a very experienced Judge who hears many more cases of this nature than I do. For example, if one goes to look at statistics one finds that since July 2011, 959 persons have been sentenced in the Local Court for assaulting police but only three people have been sentenced in the District Court for assaulting police. In other words, the vast majority of these cases are dealt with by magistrates who have greater exposure to the prevalence of this offence than judges of this Court do. The sentences passed by the Chief Magistrate are entitled to be given weight because of the extent of his experience and his oversight of the other magistrates who also deal with the same sort of offence.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate case in which I should interfere with the sentences passed in the Local Court. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

2774642,Kilgariff v R [2015] NSWDC 414,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against a conviction recorded by Magistrate Trad sitting in the Local Court at Sutherland on 2 February 2014.
	
	
	The appellant was the owner of a 1990 Ford Falcon motor car registered number AW 95 BT. Its registration expired on 19 June 2014. Antecedent to the 19 June 2014, the Roads and Maritime Services recorded the appellant’s address for the purposes of the registration of his motor vehicle as being 1‑13 Mangrove Lane, Taren Point. On 5 June 2014, the appellant sent a letter by registered post to RMS at North Sydney advising that his correct address was now 17 Mangrove Lane, Taren Point. The RMS received the appellant’s letter on 12 June 2014. However, it had already sent the registration renewal notice to the appellant on 8 May 2014 at his prior address then recorded by the RMS, as I said, as 1-13 Mangrove Lane Taren Point. I do not know exactly when it was that the appellant changed his address from 1-13 Mangrove Lane, Taren Point to 17 Mangrove Lane, Taren Point but the appellant has averred on oath that he did not receive the communication from the RMS of 8 May 2014.
	
	
	The registration of the appellant’s motor vehicle, as I said, expired on 19 June 2014. On 2 July 2014, the police, namely, Senior Constable Hudson of the Sutherland Highway Patrol, detected the appellant driving his motor vehicle in Pinson Road, Taren Point. The vehicle Senior Constable Hudson was driving was fitted with Automatic Number Plate Recognition software and other forms of advanced technology. This software recognised that the registration of the vehicle being driven by the appellant had expired. Senior Constable Atkins then activated the warning devices on his Highway Patrol vehicle and the appellant pulled over to the left and stopped. The appellant was submitted to a random breath testing which he passed but was then told that as far as the police were concerned, his vehicle was unregistered. That was “news” to the appellant. However, the police officer walked around the vehicle to the near side portion of the windscreen where the appellant still had affixed to his vehicle a registration label. That label indicated that the registration had expired on 19 June 2014. The appellant was then given a traffic infringement notice for $623.
	
	
	The appellant did not pay the traffic infringement notice and elected to have the matter dealt with by the Local Court. In the Local Court the appellant raised a large number of technical objections all of which were dismissed by the learned magistrate. He did not, however, run the defence of a reasonable and honest mistake of fact. He has been granted leave to raise that defence in this Court.
	
	
	The appellant is a former member of the legal profession who is retired. At the time of the offence he was 71 years old. He is now 73 years old. He came before the court as a man of prior good character. The RMS, with its usual alacrity, responded to the appellant’s letter of 5 June 2014 advising it of his change of address by sending to him a reminder notice about the re-registration of his vehicle on 9 July 2014, that is, a week after the appellant was pulled over by Senior Constable Hudson. It took the RMS 27 days to react to the appellant’s advising it of his change of address. During that window, unfortunately, the appellant was detected driving his vehicle whilst its registration had expired.
	
	
	Most members of the public react to notices received from the government. One would expect the current appellant to do so. He received no notice from the government and not keeping daily watch on the old registration label can be readily excused as something that no one regularly does. Indeed, one usually awaits communication from the RMS, or its predecessor the RTA, that registration is about to expire before going through the process of obtaining a pink slip and a green slip and paying the appropriate fee to the RMS. One has also to bear in mind that the appellant, as a retired person, may not be as quick off the mark as younger members of the community and time can fly easily the older one is.
	
	
	The only thing which might stand in the way of finding of reasonable and honest mistake of fact was the fact that the appellant had an old registration label on his vehicle, but, as I said, one would not expect anyone to regularly read that but be waiting, if it were anticipated the registration might soon expire, for the appropriate notice from the government which, unfortunately, the appellant received far too late. For those reasons I accept that there was a reasonable and honest mistake of fact. That means that the Crown has failed to negative that defence and, therefore, that the appellant was wrongly convicted.
	
	
	For those reasons, I set aside the conviction recorded and the sentence passed by the Local Court at Sutherland on 2 February 2015.

2774643,Assi v R (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 268,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentences passed by Magistrate McManus sitting in the Local Court at Kogarah on 10 December 2014. The background to the matter can be ascertained from my decision in Assi v Regina [2015] NSWDC 343 which concerned the appellant’s application for leave to appeal from the refusal of the Local Court to him to withdraw his pleas of guilty. That application was dismissed. The judgment to which I have just referred records that dismissal but importantly sets out the background of the case.
	
	
	The matter came back before me for the sentencing appeal on 6 December 2015 at Darlinghurst when further documentary evidence was tendered, namely an up to date pre-sentence report dated 2 November 2015, a report of Dr Nielssen of 6 November 2015 and a certificate of Dr Shoshana Espinosa bearing date 5 November 2015. Viva voce evidence was also called from a member of the New South Wales constabulary and a documentary exhibit was tendered which was marked exhibit 13. The evidence of the member of the New South Wales constabulary was given in closed court and there is a suppression order on the contents of exhibit 13. At the conclusion of that day I made an order pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 directing Community Corrections to prepare an assessment of the appellant’s suitability for home detention. I then adjourned the matter until today. This morning the Crown tendered a home detention assessment made by the Department of Corrective Services bearing the date 23 January 2016 which has been marked as exhibit 14. The appellant has been assessed as suitable for a home detention order. The terms and conditions of such an order have been explained to him and he has signed a home detention undertaking pursuant to s 78(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate in respect of the sequence one offence namely obtaining a financial advantage of $137,819.70, sentenced he appellant to 12 months imprisonment and fixed an eight month non-parole period. However the sentence was to commence on 9 December 2014. In respect of the sequence two offence the Local Court imposed a sentence of 15 months imprisonment and fixed a non-parole period of ten months that sentence to commence on 8 August 2015. In effect the appellant was sentenced to a head sentence of two years and three months with a non-parole period of 18 months.
	
	
	Since those sentences were passed much more evidence has been obtained. The appellant is in poor health, he has a low back problem and is anticipating undergoing spinal surgery for that complaint. He also suffers from depression and anxiety and there is a mental health assessment and plan report made by the local health authority. The appellant has also been complaining of a neck pain and there is a diagnosis of degenerative cervical spine disease, usually referred to as cervical spondylosis. It has been ascertained that the appellant is also the main carer for his mother who was now either 87 or 88 years old and suffers from multiple medical problems and requires the appellant’s assistance for almost two hours almost every day. Although the pre-sentence report of 2 November 2015 tells me that the appellant’s medical problems preclude him from working, it is clear from the most recent assessment that he is in fact working for three days a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 8.30am and 2pm and is regarded as a part-time permanent worker.
	
	
	Of greater moment, perhaps, is the assistance which he has given to authorities but before I refer to that I should briefly comment on Dr Olav Nielssen’s report of 6 November 2015 following upon his interview with the appellant on 2 November 2015. Dr Nielssen has diagnosed an anxiety disorder, either a panic disorder or a post-traumatic stress disorder, although the doctor does not use the disjunctive conjunction but the conjunctive conjunction. He also refers to the appellant’s having a depressive illness. In his opinion Doctor Nielssen said this:
	


“Factors contribute to having become depressed include a possible inherited vulnerability to depression, the effect of war related trauma during his late childhood and adolescence, the effect of chronic pain arising from failed back surgery and most of all the effect of the financial losses and bankruptcy, and criminal charges arising from his association with Mr Lazar.

Mr Assi will be able to continue treatment with escitalopram for anxiety and depression in custody, and may require a higher dose of that medication. Based on the accounts of other prisoners, he would be unlikely to receive much in the way of counselling or psychological treatment for his psychiatric disorder, as the resources for counselling are limited and chronic anxiety disorder would be considered a low priority in the prison setting.

Mr Assi’s main difficulty would appear to be related to his physical health, as he reported symptoms of sciatica, or compression of the spinal nerve supply, the sciatic nerve of the lower leg, for which it would appear to require fairly urgent surgery to prevent permanent loss of function. He will be likely to experience significant delays in receiving treatment for that condition if he were taken into custody at this point.”

In the following paragraph the psychiatrist points out difficulties which the appellant might experience if he were threatened with violence when he was in custody.


	
	It is completely inappropriate form to refer in open court to the assistance that the appellant has given to authorities. Clearly his motivation to do that has been the sentencing hearing. However, it is clear that the assistance which he has given has been of significant value and as a result there is a real threat not only to the appellant’s personal safety but also to the safety of other members of his family. Suffice it to say that I am persuaded on the oral evidence of the member of the New South Wales Police Force given at Darlinghurst that if the appellant were admitted to full-time custody in a Corrective Services institution there would be a grave risk to his person.
	
	
	The extent of the money which the appellant obtained by reason of his fraud was large. Clearly a custodial sentence of one form of another is called for. That is common ground. However I accede to the proposition, which is not opposed by the Crown, that both general and personal deterrence and retribution will be fully provided for in a sentence of home imprisonment.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the sentences passed by the Magistrate McManus sitting in the Local Court at Kogarah on 10 December 2014. In respect of sequence 1 I order the offender to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of three years from today. Conditions apply during the term of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time;
	
	
	to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	to reside at [redacted];
	
	
	to advise the Registrar of the Court by pre-paid post of any change of residential address;
	
	
	to accept the supervision of and obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service during the term of the bond.
	



	
	Mr Assi would you stand up please. In respect of sequence two, I am satisfied of the matters mentioned in s 78 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have had regard to the contents of the assessment report on you and I am satisfied the assessment report states the opinion that you are a suitable person to serve the term of imprisonment by a way of home detention. I order that you be imprisoned for a period of 15 months. I fix a non‑parole period of 12 months, I order that the sentence by served by way of home detention.
	
	
	Mr Assi I am required to tell you that once you have signed the s 9 bond in the Registry you are to proceed home directly. My Associate is required to telephone Corrective Services to tell them that you are now subject to the home detention order, do you understand? So as soon as you sign the bond go straight home.
	
	
	APPELLANT: Thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You may be seated Mr Assi. I again direct exhibit 13 be sealed again and not to be opened by anyone except by me or by a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal. There are no loose ends to be covered up are there gentlemen?
	
	
	CURRAN: The only loose end I suppose is the other orders of the Magistrate which are the compensation matters, it’s a matter of discretion for the Court whether it will do any good or not is another thing, I’m not really sure of the current circumstances between him and the bank and what his current bankruptcy situation is.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I think the Commonwealth can sort that out. I don’t know whether the bankruptcy provisions override the order for compensation, probably would I suspect.
	
	
	CURRAN: I ask this, really all those orders are basically judgment debts in effect.

2774644,Alameddine v R [2016] NSWDC 269,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence passed by Magistrate Williams sitting in the Local Court in Newtown on 27 October 2014.
	
	
	On 8 July 2015 the appellant was handed a court attendance notice by a member of the New South Wales Police shortly after he had been stopped by the police. The court attendance notice required him to appear before the Local Court at Newtown on 28 July 2015. At the same time the police the police suspended the operation of the appellant’s driver’s licence. A formal court attendance notice charged the offender with two offences but eventually the second offence was withdrawn. The relevant court attendance notice charged the appellant that on 8 July 2015 at Dulwich Hill he did drive a motor vehicle registered number CKA 47K in a manner dangerous to the public upon a road, namely, Marrickville Road.
	
	
	The matter was dealt with ex parte by Magistrate Grogan on 15 September 2015. For this offence Magistrate Grogan imposed a fine of $1,500 and disqualified the appellant from driving for three years but directed that s 225 of the Road Transport Act applied, such that the suspension commenced on 8 July 2015 the time that the police suspended the appellant’s licence. That ex parte conviction and sentence were set aside pursuant to s 4 on 21 September and eventually on 27 October 2015 the appellant pleaded guilty to the offence which I have described and the learned magistrate imposed a fine of $1,200, disqualified the appellant from driving for 14 months but again made an order s 225 of the Road Transport Act backdating the suspension to 8 July 2015 and also required the appellant to enter into a bond pursuant to s 9 for a period of 12 months.
	
	
	The appellant now appeals against the length of the disqualification period imposed by Magistrate Williams. The automatic disqualification period is three years, the disqualification period imposed originally by Magistrate Grogan. The minimum disqualification period is 12 months. The disqualification period imposed by Magistrate Williams was only 14 months.
	
	
	The facts of the offender’s offence are disturbing. 8 July 2015 was a Wednesday. The offence occurred at or shortly after 6.35pm in what can generally be described as peak hour. The appellant was driving a BMW X5 which was owned by his mother. He was driving south on Marrickville Road. He passed the intersection of that road with Wardell Road. A police car in the opposite side of the road in a line of traffic observed the appellant to be driving well above the sign posted speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour. It was estimated that the appellant’s speed was greater than 100 kilometres per hour, increasing to 120 kilometres per hour. A radar fitted to the police vehicle indicated speeds between 113 kilometres per hour and 121 kilometres per hour. The final reading ‘locked’ onto the radar was 118 kilometres per hour but unfortunately the radar device could not be used because it had not recorded the speed at 118 kilometres per hour for sufficient time. The excuse proffered by the appellant for driving at this speed was to enable him to watch a State of Origin rugby league match.
	
	
	The police facts state this:
	


“At that time of night the Inner West of Sydney, and particularly in Marrickville Road, is heavily used by all road users, being motorists travelling via vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. None of these other road users would be expecting a vehicle to be travelling well in excess of the sign posted speed limit, and therefore the risk of a serious collision is greatly exaggerated due to the elevated speed the accused was travelling at the time.”

It could be rightfully stead using technical language non‑technically that the appellant was driving fast, he was driving furiously, he was driving recklessly.


	
	At the time the appellant was 24 years old. At the current time he is 25. The appellant’s traffic record is before me and comprises four pages which indicate that in the period from the granting of a learner licence on 1 August 2006 to 15 January 2016, a period less than ten years, the appellant had been suspended on 13 occasions, mainly for fines faults but for offences including using a handheld mobile phone, exceeding the speed limit but by less than 20 kilometres per hour, failing to display a P‑plate, but the main offences were disobeying traffic control signs and traffic control lights and failure to stop at a traffic control light when it displayed a red arrow. Failing to obey control signs and traffic signals can often result in collisions which can cause serious injury and even death. The appellant has now completed a traffic offender’s program but Magistrate Williams was aware of that when he sentenced the appellant on 27 October 2015.
	
	
	The crime that the offender committed was a serious one, the criminality, that is, the extent of the driving in a manner dangerous to the public was extreme, given the time of day, peak hour traffic on an afternoon in mid‑winter in inner-suburban Sydney when there were many motorists and other road users exposed to the appellant’s excessive speed.
	
	
	In his letter to the learned magistrate the appellant said this:
	


“I have been off the road since 8 July 2015, and it has been difficult. I am fortunate to have my own small business. I am a carpenter by trade and I own Connect Building Pty Limited. My office is in Greenacre and my home is in Marrickville. The nature of my work requires me to drive daily to and from construction sites around Sydney. I haven’t been able to do that as of late. Getting to places on public transport is time consuming, I have tried that, it’s been hard. Catching a taxi has been expensive and I cannot afford that long term. Lately, I have been asking my fiancée to drive me around when she is available, but I know that has put a burden on her. It has been quite challenging, and the business has suffered. I am getting married soon, and all this has been on my mind, all because of one poor decision.”

Essentially the appellant was putting forward as the need to hold on to his driver’s licence economic hardship. I am told today that the appellant has now hired a driver to drive him around in the course of his business and to drive him after hours, presumably during the working week.


	
	The appellant was also providing transport to his mother who has serious health problems, taking her to medical examinations and any necessary attendances at hospitals and the like. However, that duty has now been taken up by the appellant’s fiancée who does not need to drive him around because of the driver that has been employed by his business. One can understand that hiring somebody to drive another in the course of work would incur cost to the business and might eat up some of his profit but there is no evidence before me of economic hardship of any moment that requires that the disqualification period should be reduced to the minimum.
	
	
	Indeed, the Local Court and, indeed, this Court has a discretion to impose a higher disqualification period than the automatic three year period.
	
	
	In the circumstances there is nothing on the evidence before me which persuades me that I should interfere with the discretion exercised by Magistrate Williams on 27 October 2015. Quite frankly, bearing in mind the disqualification period imposed by Magistrate Grogan based on the same facts, the appellant should consider himself to have been lucky that Magistrate Williams only imposed a disqualification period of 14 months.
	
	
	For those reasons the appeal is dismissed.

		26 October 2016",2016-02-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2774645,Sutherland v R [2016] NSWDC 266,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against severity of sentence passed by Magistrate Bartley sitting in the Local Court at Sutherland on 3 March 2016. The appellant was charged with an offence contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The charge was assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Emma Sciberras at Miranda on 22 February 2015 at approximately 1.45am.
	
	
	The assault occurred at the Miranda Hotel situated on The Kingsway at Miranda. It was in the early hours of a Sunday morning. It is evident from the facts that the appellant and her boyfriend had been in the hotel for some time. Another patron, Ms Sciberras, had borrowed the appellant’s boyfriend’s cigarette lighter and had failed to return it promptly. About half an hour after the cigarette lighter had been borrowed, the appellant confronted Ms Sciberras. Ms Sciberras was in the poker machine area. The appellant and her boyfriend entered the poker machine area and walked up to Ms Sciberras who was standing at one of the machines. The appellant stood about half a metre in front of the victim facing her. She asked the victim to return her boyfriend’s cigarette lighter, and the appellant then punched Ms Sciberras in the face with a closed fist. The impact caused Ms Sciberras to fall backwards onto the ground, striking her head after having landed on her back. The appellant then stepped towards the victim and stood looking down at her while other patrons of the hotel came to the scene. Ms Sciberras stood up and, clearly, the pair grappled. Bystanders became involved and attempted to separate the two women. Security personnel eventually separated Ms Sciberras and the appellant and then called police. Ms Sciberras sustained bruising and swelling to the back of her head. She attended the St George Hospital where she was treated for concussion.
	
	
	The appellant first appeared before the Local Court at Sutherland on 26 June 2015, some four months later. She entered a plea of not guilty on 3 September 2015 and the matter was eventually fixed for hearing on 18 January 2016. On that day the appellant reversed her plea, and pleadingguilty and subsequently stood for sentence before Magistrate Bartley on 3 March 2016. The appellant’s plea of guilty was late and entitled her to the minimum discount for pleading guilty, a discount of 10%.
	
	
	The appellant wrote a letter addressed to the victim dated 1 March 2016, which I infer was tendered in the Local Court. After introducing herself in the opening paragraph of the letter, the appellant went on to say this:
	


“I agree that I did get into an altercation with you and I acknowledge that you needed to have treatment. I am sorry that you needed to have treatment.

I would like to sincerely apologise for my behaviour on that night and can assure you that it is not how I would normally act.

I have been suffering with depression for quite some time. At the time of the incident I was having my medication adjusted as my doctor was trying to work out what medication would work best for me. I acknowledge that I should not drink alcohol whilst on [medication].

I believe that my depression worsened as a result of being informed by my doctor that I was born without a uterus and I will never have the chance to have my own children.”


	
	There is no direct evidence of the last statement, but I accept that that information had been recently conveyed by the appellant’s general practitioner to her and may have contributed to her taking to alcohol on Saturday, 1 February 2015. However, equally it may have been a night out at licensed premises with the idea of general enjoyment. Clearly the appellant had been in the licensed premises for some time and was intoxicated and that intoxication negatived her prescribed medication.
	
	
	For the purposes of being sentenced the appellant was interviewed by a senior community corrections officer on 26 February 2016. On p 2 of the pre‑sentence report the following material is provided:
	


“The offender recalled being involved in physical altercations during her schooling years, claiming it was due to being bullied and standing up for herself. In relation to the matter before the Court the offender seemed to justify her behaviour and appeared to have little insight into ramifications of her actions. Ms Sutherland attributed a part of her offending behaviour to a change in her prescribed medication and consuming alcohol.”

Later in the report the senior corrections officer expressed the opinion that the appellant preferred to attribute partial blame for her offending behaviour to changes in her prescribed medication and her consumption of alcohol on the night. In other words, the senior corrections officer had reservations as to real remorse and contrition for the crime committed by the appellant. That appears to be borne out by the terms of the apology offered by the appellant to the victim in the letter which I have quoted, where she expressed regret for the need for the victim to have treatment rather than for the whole episode of the assault and the consequent indignity and interference with her normal enjoyment of life.


	
	The learned magistrate imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 15 months but suspended that pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour also included in the terms of the good behaviour bond following upon the suspension of sentence that the appellant report to the Community Corrections Service at Liverpool within seven days and that she commence therapy by a psychologist, as advised by her then treating psychologist, or any successive psychologist.
	
	
	The appellant had asked the Local Court to deal with her under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The same application has been made to me. It is necessary to briefly consider the appellant’s background. She was born on 15 November 1996. At the time of the offence she was 18 years old. She is currently 19 years old. The appellant was interviewed for some four hours on 12 September 2015 by a psychologist, Ms Ann-Marie de Santa Brigida, at the request of her solicitor. The only medical information available to me is contained in Ms de Santa Brigida’s report. The appellant gave the psychologist a history that in Year 8 she first experienced symptoms of depression. On my understanding the appellant was in Year 8 in the year 2009. Symptoms of depression included sleep problems, a feeling of insecurity and, therefore, a difficulty in falling asleep, attenuated energy and motivation, feelings of worthlessness and sadness, and loss of pleasure in activities that she had previously found pleasurable. In Year 9, that is in 2010, the appellant commenced self-harm by cutting herself and also stated that occasionally she would cut her arms and on one occasion that she cut “I hate you” onto her leg.
	
	
	On 10 June 2011 her general practitioner Dr Hamad prepared a health care plan. I assume it was a mental health care plan. He has not been put before me. However, I do know that after the completion of that plan the appellant came under the care of a psychologist, Ms Therese French, who reported back to Dr Hamad on 4 August 2011. On 22 September 2011 Dr Hamad prepared a further health care plan which clearly involved a further referral to Ms French, who again reported to Dr Hamad on 12 December 2011.
	
	
	It would appear that in 2013 when she was in Year 12 the appellant was expelled from school. The psychologist obtained this history of the appellant’s schooling:
	


“Ms Sutherland stated that she attended Austral Primary School where she completed Year 6, and she stated that she experienced no problems in primary school. She stated that she subsequently attended John Edmondson High School and she reported that she was suspended on numerous occasions for fighting with another student, pushing a teacher and in Year 12 she was expelled for punching the deputy principal.”


	
	I do know from the psychologist’s report that in April 2014 the appellant was prescribed Effexor by Dr Hamad. On 2 October 2014 the appellant unfortunately made an attempt on her own life. That caused her to be admitted to Campbelltown Hospital where she was an in-patient for two weeks. The diagnoses made at that hospital were of anxiety, depression and a personality disorder. On discharge from the hospital the appellant was referred to the Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Program at the Fairfield and Liverpool Hospitals. There she was diagnosed as suffering from a borderline personality disorder. In her report, Ms de Santa Brigida said this about that diagnosis:
	


“It is also noted that affective instability due to irritability, dysphoria and anxiety is a feature of Borderline Personality Disorder. It is noted that intense anger and difficulty controlling anger is also a feature of this disorder. It is further noted that impulsivity is a feature of Borderline Personality Disorder and this can manifest in a multitude of ways, including difficulty in reigning in their own behaviour, unstable relationships that fluctuate between idealisation and devaluation, self-damaging behaviour such as overspending, substance abuse and recurrent suicidal behaviour and/or self-harming behaviour.”

The next sentence of Ms de Santa Brigida’s report makes her assertion that the appellant was suffering from that condition at the time of the offence in question.


	
	If the diagnosis be correct, and there is nothing to suggest otherwise, a borderline personality disorder would have affected the appellant all her life and therefore would have been extant before the time of diagnosis and would still be current. One cannot cure a personality disorder of any type. However, the symptoms of it can be kept in check by medication. Clearly the medical practitioners were attempting to do that. At the time that the offence now in question occurred they were experimenting with changing the medication or the dosage of the medication However, the fact remains that at all material times the appellant must have known about the diagnosis, its consequences on her behaviour and of the need to take her medication and not to take alcohol with the medication because alcohol could undo the effect of the medication. This, in my assessment, is what occurred on the evening of Saturday 21st and the morning of Sunday 22nd February 2015. The appellant’s psychiatric condition spoke when, by her conduct in taking alcohol, she negatived the effect of the medication designed to overcome the symptoms of her medical problem.
	
	
	At some stage, I do not know when, Dr Hamad appears to have referred the appellant to Ms Jessica Fedeli, a psychologist at the West Hoxton Medical Centre. I take the place of Ms Fedeli’s practice from Ms de Santa Brigida’s report. In the same report Ms de Santa Brigida points out that Dr Therese French was at the same practice as Ms de Santa Brigida but it is clear from Ms de Santa Brigida’s report, and contrary to the submission put to me on behalf of the appellant, that Ms Fedeli was at the same practice. By the time the appellant was interviewed by Ms de Santa Brigida she was attending upon Ms Fedeli.
	
	
	For the purposes of making the application under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 Ms de Santa Brigida prepared a psychological treatment plan merely requiring the appellant to continue attending upon Ms Fedeli. It is clear that the appellant would have been attending upon Ms Fedeli in any event.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the appellant did suffer from a medical condition at the time of the offence and at the time she should stood for sentence such that she fell within s 32 (1) (a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. It is clear that she is not a mentally ill person. The second limb of s 32 (1) requires the Court to consider whether it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant, to use the terminology of the Act, in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 than deal with her according to law.
	
	
	The appellant’s condition was being treated appropriately in any event. Doctors need from time to time to adjust levels of medication and perhaps change the medication being provided for a condition even though the condition might remain the same. Here the crime that was committed by the appellant was committed because she voluntarily took liquor which disinhibited her, allowed her to overcome the effects of medication and allowed her behaviour to be affected by her mental illness. When a person has a propensity to act violently if intoxicated then that person must abstain from intoxication. In fact, at law intoxication in such circumstances is seen as an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating factor. Here the appellant knew that she was prone to violence when un-medicated, was taking appropriate medication, but knew that if she took alcohol the medication would be overcome. She went ahead and did so. In my view this appellant must be dealt with according to law and ought not be dealt with under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	The crime is not a trivial one, nor are there any extenuating circumstances. One must feel absolute sympathy for the appellant because of the news which had only been recently conveyed to her. For any person to be denied fertility is a shattering experience. Nevertheless, it does not justify taking to binge drinking or even taking to drink to assuage one’s grief when one knows that the taking of alcohol could lead to an act of violence.
	
	
	The crime committed could be categorised as “a coward punch”. This was an act of violence in a place open to members of the public. In Pattalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 171 Hoeben CJ at CL, with whom McCallum and Schmidt JJ concurred, said this at [23]:
	


“Over recent years, the incidence of such offences, particularly when associated with the excessive consumption of alcohol, have been all too frequent. Such offences are a cause for grave disquiet and the community is understandably angry and frustrated at their occurrence. Regrettably, it is now notorious {as his Honour recognised } that a single punch can not only cause catastrophic injuries but also death. For offences of this kind, the community has the rightful expectation that judicial officers will impose meaningful penalties.”

The facts in that case were that a man leaving licensed premises at a night club in Pitt Street, Sydney in the early hours of a Saturday morning threw a punch at another person standing nearby, who had also left the same premises, causing that man to fall to the ground sustaining injury. The offender in that case had been charged with the same offence with which this appellant was charged, assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This offence could have been dealt with on indictment in this Court. If so, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. If dealt with in the Local Court the maximum penalty is imprisonment for two years.


	
	However, the appellant appeared before the Local Court as a young lady of prior good character, a young lady who had only recently reached her legal majority, a young lady who has had the misfortune of being diagnosed with a serious mental illness, and had only been recently been diagnosed with a physical disability which clearly affected her greatly.
	
	
	Whilst both specific deterrence and general deterrence are important one must resist the temptation to overreact to such acts of violence. Unfortunately his Honour’s reasons for judgment have not been transcribed and are not before me. However, in my view to contemplate a full time custodial sentence in these circumstances, where there is no direct medical evidence of the extent of the victim’s injuries nor any evidence to suggest that there was any ongoing problem caused by the injury, where the appellant was a very young lady labouring with a number of problems is in my view excessive. In my view the appropriate penalty in a case such as this was of a bond pursuant to s 9 to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the sentence passed by the Local Court at Sutherland on 3 March 2016. Brittney Jade Sutherland, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I order that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 18 months from today. The conditions applying to the term of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at [redacted];
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of the Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to report to the officer in charge of the Community Corrections Service at Liverpool within seven days;
	
	
	you are to accept the supervision of and obey all reasonable directions of Community Corrections during the term of the bond; and
	
	
	you are to continue treatment provided by Ms Jessica Fideli at West Hoxton Medical Practice until discharged by her from her care or to commence and continue other treatment by a psychologist to whom you may be referred by Dr Hamad of West Hoxton.

		26 October 2016",2016-06-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2784160,AK v R [2016] NSWCCA 238,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Johnson J.  I agree with his Honour’s reasons and proposed orders.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him at the Newcastle District Court on 17 September 2013 with respect to a number of sexual offences.
	
	
	The Applicant is referred to in this judgment by a pseudonym, AK (which are not his correct initials). Likewise, the names of the young female victims (and their relatives) are not used, with pseudonyms being used in their place. These steps are taken to guard against identifying the victims consistent with the statutory protection provided by s.578A Crimes Act 1900 and s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.
	


The Charges and Sentences


	
	On 11 July 2012, the Applicant was committed to stand trial at the Newcastle District Court with respect to eight charges involving two complainants. He was arraigned on two separate indictments, one for each complainant. The trials were listed back-to-back in the East Maitland District Court to commence on 29 April 2013. This date was vacated in advance and the trials were relisted to commence on 6 May 2013 at the Newcastle District Court.
	
	
	In advance of the relisted date, negotiations took place between the Crown and the Applicant’s legal representatives, in consultation with the complainants and the officer-in-charge. On the first day of the trial, 6 May 2013, the Applicant was re-arraigned on a single indictment and his pleas of guilty to the following offences were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the original indictments:
	



	
	Count 1 - Between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010, assaulting Kylie (not her real name) and at the time of the assault committing an act of indecency on Kylie, a child then under the age of 16 years, namely 10 or 11 years contrary to s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 10 years’ imprisonment; standard non-parole period eight years) (touching the genitals of Kylie).
	
	
	Count 2 - Between 18 August 2010 and 18 August 2011, assaulting Helen (not her real name) and at the time of the assault committing an act of indecency on Helen, a child then under the age of 16 years, namely nine or 10 years contrary to s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 (showering with Helen and touching her genitals).
	
	
	Count 3 - Between 31 July 2011 and 18 August 2011, having sexual intercourse with Helen, a child below the age of 14 years, namely 10 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely at the time of the sexual intercourse Helen was under the authority of the Applicant contrary to s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 20 years’ imprisonment with no standard non-parole period) (having penile vaginal intercourse with Helen).
	



	
	The Applicant asked the sentencing court to take into account on a Form 1, when sentencing for Count 3, a further offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with Helen, aged 10 years contrary to s.66C(2) (an act of penile anal intercourse with Helen occurring immediately after Count 3).
	
	
	I note that the s.66C(2) offences in this case, although carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment, did not have a standard non-parole period at the time of these offences. The New South Wales Parliament altered the law in this respect in 2015 by enacting a standard non-parole period of nine years for offences under s.66C(2) committed since 29 June 2015: Crimes Legislation Amendment (Child Sex Offences) Act 2015. Of course, this standard non-parole period has no application to the Applicant, and cannot influence sentencing in this case: McGrath v R [2010] NSWCCA 48; 199 A Crim R 527 at 536 [37], 540 [60].
	
	
	Following the Applicant’s pleas of guilty, a sentence hearing date was set but was delayed due to the Applicant indicating he wished to traverse his pleas, necessitating a change in legal representation. Ultimately, the Applicant adhered to his pleas and the sentencing proceedings took place on 13 and 16 September 2013.
	
	
	On 17 September 2013, the Applicant was sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment:
	



	
	Count 1 - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of one year commencing on 6 May 2013 and expiring on 5 May 2014, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 6 May 2014 and expiring on 5 May 2015.
	
	
	Count 2 - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 6 May 2013 and expiring on 5 May 2015, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 6 May 2015 and expiring on 5 May 2016.
	
	
	Count 3 - taking into account the matter on the Form 1, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years and six months commencing on 6 November 2013 and expiring on 5 May 2021, with a balance of term of three years and two months commencing on 6 May 2021 and expiring on 5 July 2024.
	



	
	The overall effective sentence for the offences comprised a non-parole period of eight years commencing on 6 May 2013 and expiring on 5 May 2021, with a balance of term of three years, three months and two weeks commencing on 6 May 2021 and expiring on 19 August 2024.
	
	
	It was agreed by the parties before this Court (T2-3, 16 March 2016) that the sentencing Judge had approached the calculation of sentences, and their imposition, in a somewhat unorthodox way which required correction after 17 September 2013. It is sufficient to observe, for present purposes, that the sentences ultimately imposed by his Honour for the offences were those set out at [9]-[10] above.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge erred in the manner in which he took into account the uncharged sexual conduct of the Applicant.
	
	
	Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred in finding that the Applicant did not accept that his offending “is of a class that cannot and should not ever be contemplated or countenanced”.
	


Extension of Time to Appeal


	
	The Applicant was sentenced on 17 September 2013 and relied upon a Notice of Application for Extension of Time and a Notice of Appeal, each dated 8 October 2015.
	
	
	An affidavit of the Applicant sworn 10 March 2016 and of his solicitor, Stephen Eccleshall, affirmed 10 March 2016 were relied upon in support of the application for the extension of time. It is apparent from those affidavits that the Applicant sought to take steps to bring an appeal, but that difficulties arose in his communications with Legal Aid NSW and the Court.
	
	
	In light of the affidavits, the Crown did not oppose an extension of time being granted to the Applicant.
	
	
	Having considered the affidavits bearing upon the question of extension of time, and taking into account the Crown’s concession that an extension ought be granted, I am satisfied that the Applicant should be granted an extension of time to bring the application for leave to appeal against sentence.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	An agreed statement of facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. What follows is drawn from that document.
	
	
	In about July 2008, the Applicant (then 44 years old) commenced an intimate relationship with the mother of Helen and moved in with her and her three young children.
	
	
	Counts 2 and 3 (the offences against Helen) were committed in 2010-2011. However, according to the agreed statement of facts, “There had been inappropriate sexual touching of the complainant [Helen] by the accused since the winter of 2009, when she was aged eight”.
	


Count 2 - Aggravated Indecent Assault Under s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 Committed Against Helen


	
	On an afternoon between August 2010 and August 2011, when Helen’s mother was out at work, Helen (then nine or 10 years old) was at home with her two younger brothers and the Applicant. The Applicant put a movie on for the boys in the lounge room and asked Helen to come to the bathroom and have a shower with him. She said “No” and went to watch television.
	
	
	When Helen went into the kitchen to get a drink, the Applicant closed the door to the lounge room and pulled her into the bathroom. He turned on the shower and made her take off her clothes and get into the shower with him. They were both naked. In the shower, the Applicant touched Helen’s vagina with his hands whilst she told him to stop. When the victim’s mother came home, the Applicant stopped.
	
	
	Helen got out of the shower and took her clothes into the back room, dried herself and dressed. She went outside and then walked back into the house, where she told her mother she had been outside. The incident was witnessed by Helen’s eight-year old brother.
	


Count 3 - Aggravated Sexual Intercourse with a Child Under Authority Under s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 Committed Against Helen


	
	On an afternoon in August 2011, Helen (then 10 years old) had returned home from a dancing lesson. Her mother left the house to go to the shops. The Applicant was cooking dinner in the kitchen and told Helen to go to her bedroom, but she refused, walking back to the lounge room.
	
	
	The Applicant followed Helen and, in the hallway leading to the main bedroom, he picked her up and carried her into the bedroom laying her down on her bed. The Applicant told her brothers to go back into the lounge room and wait.
	
	
	The Applicant was wearing shorts and a singlet and Helen was wearing pyjamas and underpants. The Applicant held Helen on the bed, pulled her pants down, licked and kissed her body and genitals and then announced he was “going to root” her before commencing penile vaginal intercourse. Helen felt embarrassed, angry and scared.
	


Form 1 Offence - Aggravated Sexual Intercourse with a Child Under Authority Committed Against Helen


	
	After committing the offence which constituted Count 3, the Applicant repositioned Helen and had penile anal intercourse with her (Form 1 offence). She tried to kick him off and was scared. The Applicant stopped when he could hear Helen’s mother and others entering the house. Helen dressed quickly and ran out to the lounge room. The Applicant returned to the kitchen and continued to cook dinner.
	
	
	Helen was first interviewed and disclosed these offences on 18 August 2011.
	
	
	According to the agreed statement of facts, Helen was assessed on 18 April 2013 by Professor Susan Hayes, a forensic psychologist and Professor of Behavioural Science in Medicine at the University of Sydney. Professor Hayes confirmed a diagnosis of severe expressive and receptive language delay, consistent with verbal reasoning at the lower end of borderline intellectual disability, accompanied by poor adaptive skills.
	


Count 1 - Aggravated Indecent Assault Under s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 Against Kylie


	
	Kylie was related to Helen and frequently spent time at her home. Kylie treated the Applicant as an uncle.
	
	
	On an occasion in 2010, when Kylie (then aged 10 or 11 years) was present at Helen’s home, she was waiting for her mother to return. Kylie was alone in the house with the Applicant. The Applicant came and stood naked at the entrance to Helen’s bedroom, where Kylie was located. She told him to go away.
	
	
	The Applicant went away and got dressed and later sat on the lounge with Kylie. He placed his hand under her underpants and onto her vagina. He left it there until Kylie removed it. After doing this, Kylie got up and sat on another lounge.
	


Arrest and Charging of Applicant


	
	The Applicant was arrested and charged on 20 January 2012.
	
	
	He remained on bail until bail was revoked on 6 May 2013 upon his entering pleas of guilty.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Applicant was born in 1964 and was 46 or 47 years old at the time of the offences. He was 49 years of age at the time of sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant had a criminal history containing entries for driving with PCA (1982), assault occasioning actual bodily harm (1987), driving with high-range PCA (1992), driving with high-range PCA (1998), knowingly obtain a benefit by deception (2000), driving with high-range PCA (2002), driving with middle-range PCA and driving whilst disqualified (2005), make false instrument and steal property in a dwelling house (2005) and use false instrument (2005). Sentences imposed for these offences included a community service order (1995), periodic detention (2000) and suspended terms of imprisonment (2002 and 2005).
	
	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	A report dated 14 August 2013 of Dr Mark Howard, psychologist, was tendered for the Applicant at the sentencing hearing. Having regard to the second ground of appeal, it is appropriate to set out parts of this report.
	
	
	Dr Howard met and interviewed the Applicant at the Parklea Correctional Centre on 9 August 2013 and undertook psychometric testing of him. The Applicant provided a history to Dr Howard. The history included the Applicant’s excessive use of alcohol, which had led him to attend an inpatient rehabilitation program at The Glen in 2003 and attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous sessions during 2004.
	
	
	Under a heading “Factors Related to Offending”, Dr Howard said (AB61-62):
	


“At the time of assessment [the Applicant] assumed responsibility for his involvement in the index offences as alleged. However, he maintained that he had minimal recall for events directly surrounding the offences. He did not identify any particular factors that may have precipitated such memory loss; he did not associate medical issues or use of medication during 2010-2011 with significant cognitive effects, and denied major spikes in alcohol use in this period. He disclosed that he may have occasionally spoke in an irritable manner or swore at his partner [Helen’s mother] at the time of going to sleep or possibly when waking during the night after using alcohol, and having little recall of this the next day. However, he denied prolonged lapses in memory or awareness as a result of his alcohol use during this period.

[The Applicant] had difficulty identifying particular motivations or precipitants to his offending, ‘I don't know’. He stated that he had no history of sexual attraction to or thoughts about sexual activity with [Helen] or to [Kylie], and he exhibited a degree of distaste about the prospect of this. He denied any history of fantasies about or use of pornography involving female children. He described a generally positive relationship with [Helen] and expressed the belief that she saw him as a father figure; he said he had only occasional contact and had not developed a close bond with her cousin [Kylie]. He recalled that he had been required to engage in relatively intimate parental duties with [Helen] at times, including an occasion in which she asked for attention after falling and hurting her groin, although he said he made efforts to refer this matter to the mother or to formal medical staff. He expressed the belief that he may have made excessive efforts to develop a bond with [Helen] because she was isolated from her father and he had been isolated from his daughter in the past, ‘maybe I tried too hard’. However, he stated that the mother had never raised complaints about [the Applicant] engaging in sexually inappropriate behaviours or developing inappropriate relations with her children. He noted that issues surrounding the index offences did not arise in any form until the time of his being charged and expelled from the [xxx] residence in 2011.

[The Applicant] repeatedly expressed remorse for his offending behaviour as alleged and the prospect that he may have caused harm to [Helen] or other children involved, ‘I feel sorry for what I've done...I feel so remorseful...I'm just so sorry to the kids’, ‘If I could take it back I would, but I can't’.”


	
	Dr Howard expressed a number of conclusions under a heading “Clinical Opinion” (AB63):
	


“[The Applicant] is a 49 year old male who presented as cooperative and attentive throughout the assessment. He described a stable early upbringing and historically positive relations with family. He disclosed difficulties making progress in formal education, which he related to deficits in skills for reading and writing in particular. As an adult he has been relatively consistently employed, although in recent years has decreased his workload in response to spinal and other physical complaints. Objective assessment indicated that [the Applicant] is in the lower reaches of the Below Average range of intelligence, with a performance that was stronger than 4% of the normative sample for his age. This outcome was broadly consistent with [the Applicant’s] presentation and reported functional history.”


	
	Dr Howard turned to the topic of the Applicant’s sexual attraction towards children (AB64):
	


“During the assessment [the Applicant] reported having minimal recall of events directly surrounding the index offences, which limited examination of factors associated with his offending. He denied any history of paraphilic tendencies or sexual attraction towards the victims [Helen] or [Kylie] in particular. He did disclose difficulties with sexual dysfunction with his partner [Helen’s mother] from 2010, which may be indicative of non-conventional sexuality in some cases. However, [the Applicant] attributed this directly to increasing issues with spinal and other physical injury at the time as opposed to noticeable changes in sexual orientation or preferences.”


	
	With respect to the Applicant’s risk of sexual reoffending, Dr Howard said (AB64-65):
	


“Factors associated with [the Applicant’s] risk of sexual reoffending were further examined in reference to the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP). Identified recent or ongoing risk factors included: current issues with stability and support such as problems with relationships and problems with employment; past non-sexual criminality; problems with substance use; and partial signs of problems with self-awareness and problems with stress or coping. In contrast, there were no indications of elevated risk associated with chronic, diverse or escalating sexual violence; attitudes that condone such behaviour; diagnosed sexual deviance or major mental disorder; problems with past child abuse; or problems with compliance to treatment or supervision.”


	
	Dr Howard made a number of recommendations including the following (AB65):
	


“It would be beneficial if [the Applicant] were referred to interventions which may assist him in developing insight into factors underlying his offending and tools for avoiding similar risks in the future. To this end he may be assessed for eligibility to complete a low-moderate intensity sex offender program such as CORE, or possibly the Denier's Program. Programs such as CORE may be delivered as part of case management with Community Offender Services following release, in addition to being available in custodial contexts”.

Some Findings in the Remarks on Sentence


	
	It is appropriate to set out parts of the sentencing Judge’s remarks on sentence to assist an understanding of the challenges made before this Court on behalf of the Applicant.
	
	
	Early in the remarks, his Honour summarised aspects of the offences in the following way (ROS1-2; AB8-9) (emphasis added):
	


“The background to these matters is that in 2008 the offender formed a relationship with [Helen’s] mother and came to live with her and [Helen’s] siblings at [xxx]. There appears to have been a relationship which developed improperly over a period of years and the first matter that he has been charged with relates to the indecent assault upon a cousin of [Helen], [Kylie].

That matter occurred between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010 when [Kylie] was 10 or 11 years of age. The short facts are that whilst [Kylie] was at the home of the offender and with him alone and waiting for her mother, she was assaulted by the offender placing his hand under her underpants and onto her vagina. [Kylie] was able to remove the offender's hand and waited for her mother to arrive.

The next matter which I understand was part of a continuing course of behaviour involved the person [Helen] and it is an indecent assault matter, count 2 on the indictment.”


	
	Soon after, his Honour said with respect to the offences (ROS2-3; AB9-10) (emphasis added):
	


“That is, that indecent assaults by an adult person on a child or

children and in particular in respect of count 2 as part of a continuing course of action, is considered most serious by Parliament and thus to be taken seriously by Courts and the Court proposes to do so.

In respect of the objective degree of seriousness, the first matter involving [Kylie] would not be seen and using the unfortunate words at the lower end of the objective seriousness and in respect of the second matter to be in the middle range of objective seriousness. Particularly in respect of the second matter where, as indicated, it was part of a continuing course of behaviour.”


	
	After adverting to aspects of the offending conduct, including the Form 1 offence, his Honour continued (ROS4; AB11):
	


“This is a matter again which requires, in respect of this offender, specific deterrence. The reason for that is that despite the best endeavours of his solicitor to obtain a report from a psychologist, there are a number of matters that remain unanswered in respect of his offending behaviour, particularly in respect of his paraphiliac tendencies. This offender denied that he had any paraphiliac tendencies or sexual attractions towards his victims [Helen] or [Kylie]. In that regard the Court does not accept that report to the psychologist Dr Howard and in that sense the sentence must reflect to this man a specific deterrent that if he re-offends he will certainly receive significant custodial time again.”


	
	The sentencing Judge turned to features of Dr Howard’s report and said concerning the risk of reoffending (ROS5-6; AB12-13):
	


“Unfortunately the testing in the report does not in my mind sufficiently identify his chance of re-offending. It is correct that the psychologist did comment on the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol RSVP but there was no static 99R test which is often used and is seen in this court as to the possibility of recidivism. That perhaps is understandable where the person denies or is unable to give a history that would allow the therapist to diagnose sexual deviance or mental disorder and I find that to be so here.”


	
	The sentencing Judge then turned to the issue of remorse, and the level of the Applicant’s insight in a passage which gave rise to the second ground of appeal (ROS6; AB13) (emphasis added):
	


“In respect of the remorse shown by the offender I accept that he has pleaded guilty even if that plea was entered on the first day of his trial. I accept that as I have already stated that his verbal skills may have limited his ability to express his thoughts and to that extent I do accept that he has shown some remorse. What is difficult to accept is that he has not considered his behaviour to be that of a paedophile. That is, that he does not see at this point that his offending is of a class that cannot and should not ever be contemplated or countenanced. That hopefully will be addressed by a therapist whilst he is in custody.”


	
	His Honour allowed a discount of 10% for the Applicant’s late pleas of guilty (ROS6; AB13).
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances was made having regard to the likelihood that the Applicant would spend time in protective custody, and having regard to the Applicant’s limited intellectual capacity (as described in Dr Howard’s report) that would make his time in custody more difficult (ROS6; AB13).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge made an assessment of the gravity of the various offences in the following way, in a manner which contributed to the first ground of appeal (ROS6-7; AB13-14) (emphasis added):
	


“In respect of the first matter I have indicated that that was at the bottom end of the range of offending. The second matter somewhere below the [middle] but in respect of the third matter, I find that that is above the middle range of offending although it might be seen to be for a closed period. In doing that, I indicate that he had lived with the complainant [Helen] since 2008 and therefore I have no doubt that he mentored or proceeded to conduct himself in a way that add to this offending and but for the complaint made almost immediately by the child, the offending would have continued.”


	
	The sentencing Judge referred to a psychological report of Professor Hayes (referred to at [28]) which comprised a victim impact statement from Helen. In that report (AB43), Professor Hayes expressed the opinion that, as a result of the sexual abuse, Helen had developed chronic post-traumatic stress disorder which impacted further upon her development and behaviour. Professor Hayes considered that the impact of the sexual abuse on Helen had been severe. She had experienced confusion, fear and anger which had impacted adversely on her life and education. She had difficulty trusting people and making friends, and was very careful around men. With respect to the report of Professor Hayes, the sentencing Judge said (ROS7; AB14):
	


“In assessing I have had a report from Professor Susan Hayes, Forensic Psychologist and that matter was in respect of the impact upon the victim [Helen]. I am not taking that matter into account as to the objective matters on sentence and suffice to say that in terms of count 3 and the Form 1 matter, one does not need to be an expert in the field to understand the damage that that behaviour would and must have on the victim.”


	
	Before moving to impose sentences, his Honour said he wished to “emphasise that it is in this offender’s interest that he seek to address those issues whilst in custody”. His Honour said that he would annex to the sentencing remarks the report of Dr Howard for the assistance of the State Parole Authority and the Probation and Parole Service (ROS7; AB14).
	
	
	His Honour then proceeded to announce the sentences in a manner which (as mentioned at [11] above), gave rise to a level of confusion which had been resolved by the time of the hearing in this Court. An affidavit of Marley Zelinka sworn 4 March 2016 was relied upon by the Crown on this aspect and a further affidavit of Mr Eccleshall affirmed 15 March 2016 was filed for the Applicant.
	
	
	It is not necessary to set out the technical deficiencies in the initial orders made at first instance, for the purpose of resolving the grounds raised before this Court.
	


Ground 1 - Suggested Error in the Manner in Which the Sentencing Judge Took Into Account the Uncharged Sexual Conduct of the Applicant

The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Ms Wasley, counsel for the Applicant, acknowledged that the agreed statement of facts referred to “inappropriate sexual touching” of Helen by the Applicant since the winter of 2009 (when she was aged eight years) before turning to the specific offences against Helen which occurred in 2010-2011. Whilst submitting that the specific offences against Helen were not said to have been representative counts, counsel acknowledged that it was open to the sentencing Judge to have regard to the earlier improper conduct on behalf of the Applicant on sentence.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Applicant, however, that what occurred here was reliance by his Honour on these matters to find “a continuing course of action” or “a continuing course of behaviour”, culminating in a finding that the Applicant “mentored or proceeded to conduct himself in a way that add to this offending” and that “but for the complaint made almost immediately by the child, the offending would have continued” (see [45]-[46] and [52] above).
	
	
	Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the only relevance of other sexual activity is to place the offences charged in their context, and to deny the Applicant the leniency to which he might have been entitled if they were isolated incidents: R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466; MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261; R v Gommerson [2014] NSWCCA 159; 243 A Crim R 534.
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had erred in taking the uncharged conduct into account as a circumstance of aggravation in respect of Counts 2 and 3, rather than relying upon the conduct to deny the Applicant leniency on the basis that the offences as charged were not isolated incidents.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to have regard to the earlier sexual misconduct on the part of the Applicant. The Crown had submitted in writing to the sentencing Judge that the offences were not isolated incidents or an aberration, and had argued orally that they constituted an ongoing course of conduct as well.
	
	
	It was submitted that the findings made by the sentencing Judge were open on the evidence.
	
	
	With respect to the submissions for the Applicant that his Honour had erred in particular, in finding that the Applicant’s prior conduct “add to his offending”, the Crown submitted that undue emphasis had been given to this observation. It was noted that his Honour did not specifically make a finding of aggravation.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no error had been established in the manner contended for in the first ground of appeal.
	


Decision


	
	It was clearly open to the sentencing Judge to have regard to the agreed fact that the Applicant had engaged in inappropriate sexual touching of Helen since the winter of 2009, when she was only eight years of age. It was important that this aspect of the case was not in dispute, although the conduct which attracted this description was not particularised.
	
	
	Although the terms “representative counts” or “representative charges” were not used at the sentencing hearing, it was clear that the Applicant’s offences were to be considered against a background of “inappropriate sexual touching” of a girl aged between eight and 10 or 11 years. The principles arising from sentencing in representative count cases have some application to a case such as this.
	
	
	Since the decision of this Court in R v JCW, the accepted approach when courts are imposing a sentence in respect of representative counts, in relation to which pleas of guilty have been entered, is as follows:
	



	
	that the overall history of the conduct from which the representative charges have been selected may be looked at for the purpose of understanding the relationship between the parties;
	
	
	to exclude any suggestion that the offences charged were of an isolated nature; and
	
	
	as bearing upon the degree of any leniency the court might be considering in regard to sentencing.
	



	
	It has been accepted that the history should not be used as the basis for sentencing the convicted person for charges other than those in the indictment, or as a matter of aggravation of those charges: R v JCW at 478 [68].
	
	
	In Giles v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 308; 198 A Crim R 395, Basten JA considered (at 408 [67]) that the undisputed fact that the offender committed numerous additional offences (similar to those charged), was relevant to his state of mind in committing the offences charged, his motive, his sense (or absence of sense) of wrongdoing at the time, his willingness to control inappropriate urges for sexual gratification, the effects on the complainant of his conduct and by way of explanation of the fact that the conduct went undetected for a significant period. Following a Victorian line of authority, his Honour considered that the fact that the offences constituted part of an ongoing course of conduct placed them in a higher range of offending (at 408 [68]).
	
	
	RS Hulme J applied the principles in R v JCW, confining the use of the uncharged criminal acts in the manner described in that decision (see [67] above).
	
	
	As the third member of the Court, I found the reasoning of Basten JA persuasive, but did not consider the Court should depart from the principles in R v JCW in circumstances where no party had invited reconsideration of those principles (at 415 [102]-[104]).
	
	
	Since the decision in Giles v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), this Court has not been invited to reconsider the principles in R v JCW. Accordingly, with the agreement of Harrison and Garling JJ, I said in R v Gommerson at 547 [68]-[69]:
	


“68   The offences committed against JH were representative counts. It was not argued for the Crown that the approach adopted by Basten JA (to which I gave guarded support) in Giles v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCCA 308; 198 A Crim R 395 ought be taken in this case in approaching sentencing for representative counts. 

69   The law to be applied, in those circumstances, remains that stated in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466. Applying that principle, the Court should bear in mind that the present offences were not isolated offences against JH: R v JCW at 478 [67]-[68].” 


	
	I approach the resolution of the first ground of appeal with the principles from R v JCW in mind.
	
	
	It was open to the sentencing Judge to have regard to the Applicant’s earlier conduct involving inappropriate sexual touching on sentence. It is regrettable that his Honour did not use the accepted principles, as set out in the Crown’s submissions in the District Court, that the offences were not “isolated incidents or an aberration”.
	
	
	That said, it was not erroneous for his Honour to describe the Applicant’s conduct in these offences against Helen in Counts 2 and 3 (and the Form 1 offence attached to Count 3) as being part of a continuing course of action. It may be that the description of conduct as being part of a “course of conduct” may not be apt in a particular case, if the uncharged conduct is said to constitute a small number of incidents. However, the manner in which the uncharged conduct was described in the agreed statement of facts meant that the description was apt in the Applicant’s case.
	
	
	The difficulty which arose, however, was the conclusion that the Applicant “mentored or proceeded to conduct himself in a way that add to this offending”. This statement was made in the part of the remarks where an assessment was being made of the objective seriousness of the offences (see [52] above). It is difficult to avoid a conclusion that in saying that these matters “add to this offending”, his Honour was doing anything other than elevating the objective seriousness of the offences by way of aggravation. Such an approach is not available in accordance with sentencing law as it applies in this State.
	
	
	I am satisfied that error has been established in accordance with the first ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2 - Suggested Error in Finding that the Applicant did not Accept that his Offending was of a Class that Cannot and Should Not Ever be Contemplated or Countenanced

The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Counsel for the Applicant referred to parts of the remarks on sentence where his Honour adverted to specific deterrence, the risk of the Applicant’s reoffending and his attitude towards his own offences and child sex offences more generally.
	
	
	It was submitted that his Honour fell into error in approaching the sentencing exercise upon the basis that the Applicant did “not see at this point that his offending is of a class that cannot and should not ever be contemplated or countenanced” (see [49] above).
	
	
	Counsel referred to the report of Dr Howard where it was said that the Applicant had “assumed responsibility for his involvement” in the offences despite his “minimal recall for events directly surrounding the offences” (see [39] above). It was noted that Dr Howard reported that the Applicant “repeatedly expressed remorse for his offending behaviour as alleged and that the prospect that he may have caused harm” to the children involved (also at [39] above).
	
	
	It was noted that Dr Howard had pointed to factors relating to risk of reoffending, and had made recommendations concerning therapeutic interventions which could be tailored to address the Applicant’s level of intellectual functioning and literacy.
	
	
	Counsel for the Applicant submitted that it was open to his Honour to reject the Applicant’s denial of sexual attraction towards Helen and Kylie provided in his untested account to Dr Howard. It was submitted, however, that it was not open to the sentencing Judge, on the evidence, to find that the Applicant “does not see at this point that his offending is of a class that cannot and should not ever be contemplated or countenanced”. It was submitted that the Applicant’s pleas of guilty and his Honour’s acceptance that the Applicant had shown “some remorse”, militated against such a finding.
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentencing Judge relied upon this determination as the basis for placing excessive emphasis on specific deterrence and that, in this respect, the sentencing exercise had miscarried.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown emphasised that the Applicant had not given evidence at the sentencing hearing and that it was open to his Honour to reject any untested statement made by him to Dr Howard.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had not erred in giving what was described as excessive emphasis to specific deterrence in this case.
	
	
	It was noted that the Applicant told Dr Howard that he had minimal recall to the events surrounding the offences, and that his Honour took a generous approach in not rejecting the claim of memory loss in the absence of supporting evidence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge was entirely justified in querying how the Applicant could fail to appreciate (even with his low intellectual functioning) the problematic nature of his offending against two young girls who were his de facto’s relatives. This was especially so, the Crown submitted, as these were not isolated events with the conduct towards Helen having occurred over a period of some two years in a familial setting, culminating in full penile vaginal and anal intercourse.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the acts ceased only when the Applicant was at risk of being caught (with others entering the house) and ultimately came to an end when Helen made a complaint in August 2011.
	
	
	Against this background, the Crown submitted that it was difficult to accept how the Applicant could deny that he had paraphiliac tendencies or sexual attraction towards children, and failed to acknowledge that he had a problem or that his conduct was of a class “that cannot and should not ever be contemplated or countenanced”.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that the fact the Applicant had, according to Dr Howard, assumed responsibility and repeatedly expressed remorse did not overcome the difficulties flowing from the Applicant’s own statements to Dr Howard about this offending.
	
	
	In circumstances where his Honour had properly rejected the Applicant’s asserted denial, and with inconclusive findings as to the risk of recidivism, the Crown submitted that it was entirely open to his Honour to be particularly concerned with the issue of specific deterrence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour made clear that particular emphasis needed to be given to specific deterrence in this case, so that his reasoning was apparent in the sentencing remarks: R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1 at [187].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated under the second ground of appeal.
	


Decision


	
	The onus lies upon the Applicant to establish error on the part of the sentencing Judge in the exercise of discretion in this case in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. The relevant principles were summarised conveniently by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25] (footnotes omitted):
	


“As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King, itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender's appeal, as ‘manifest excess’, or in a prosecution appeal, as ‘manifest inadequacy’.”


	
	Here, the Applicant contends that his Honour fell into specific error in giving excessive emphasis to specific deterrence.
	
	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. The matters relied upon in this respect arise from things said by the Applicant to Dr Howard, as contained in the psychologist’s report.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge’s approach to this topic involved consideration of the Applicant’s remorse, his level of insight, his level of frankness in his dealings with Dr Howard and his willingness to explain why he committed serious sexual offences against young girls on a number of occasions. These matters bear upon issues of remorse, the Applicant’s level of insight, the need for specific deterrence and the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation flowing from an understanding of why he committed serious crimes of this type.
	
	
	This Court has observed that the assessment of the genuineness of remorse is likely to be better informed in circumstances where it is expressed directly, as remorse is an intrinsically subjective matter, the evaluation of which depends upon human interaction: Mun v R [2015] NSWCCA 234 at [29].
	
	
	Further, it has been emphasised that considerable caution must be exercised in determining what weight, if any, can be placed upon self-serving and untested statements by an offender contained in a report of a health professional: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 362 at 377 [58]-[59], 380 [79]; R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185 [40]-[41]; Mun v R at [40].
	
	
	It is necessary to read fairly the various parts of the sentencing remarks where his Honour touched upon this issue. Undertaking this task, it may be seen that his Honour concluded that the Applicant, who had committed serious sexual offences against young girls on a number of occasions, either could or would not characterise his own conduct as being, at least, grossly abnormal sexual conduct so that he did not see, at the time of sentencing, that his offending was of a class that cannot and should not ever be contemplated or countenanced.
	
	
	In my view, such an analysis of what his Honour said is unremarkable. It was certainly an approach open to his Honour on the material before the Court on sentence.
	
	
	Where a person commits serious sexual offences against children, an assessment of the risk of reoffending and the need for specific deterrence, will involve an examination of not just a formulaic expression of remorse to a psychologist, but the degree of insight the offender has demonstrated into what he did, and why he did it. The Applicant’s claimed lack of memory of the events had the flavour of an avoidance mechanism, sometimes seen in child sex offenders. The balance of the evidence before the sentencing court, essentially the report of Dr Howard, did not in my view, provide a foundation for a more benign approach on the issue of specific deterrence in this case. It should be noted that Dr Howard recommended that the Applicant undergo the CORE program or the Denier’s Program (see [43] above). Of course, the Denier’s Program is used for offenders who deny committing the sex offences for which they were sentenced. This is a practical measure of the Applicant’s limited or absent insight into his child sex offending.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge ensured that the relevant authorities would have access to Dr Howards’ report, to assist custodial treatment or counselling which may serve to reduce the Applicant’s risk of reoffending.
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated error in the manner asserted in the second ground of appeal. I would reject that ground.
	


Resentencing the Applicant


	
	The Court has upheld the first ground of appeal, but rejected the other ground. Error having been demonstrated, this Court is required to exercise its independent sentencing discretion when it resentences the Applicant in accordance with the principles in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at 618-619 [43].
	
	
	No further evidence was adduced by the Applicant to be placed before this Court in the event that error was established. The Court is to proceed to sentence upon the basis of the evidence which was before the sentencing Judge.
	


The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that, in resentencing, this Court would have regard to the limited intellectual functioning of the Applicant. It was submitted that the correct application of sentencing principles would see the Court impose a lesser sentence upon the Applicant for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon other sentencing decisions for aggravated sexual assault offences: Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49; NW v R [2011] NSWCCA 178 and BIP v R [2011] NSWCCA 224. It was not submitted for the Applicant that these decisions demonstrated a range of sentence for this type of offence. Rather, it was submitted that they provided examples of sentencing by reference to the maximum penalty at the time of the commission of these offences.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that the Court would proceed to impose a lesser sentence in this case.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	If error was demonstrated, the Crown submitted that this Court, having undertaken its task in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen, would not form the opinion that another and more lenient sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the individual sentences, and the overall sentence, were entirely appropriate, given the maximum penalties, the issue of totality for several counts and victims, the findings of objective seriousness, the inclusion of a serious Form 1 matter and the paucity of positive subjective factors.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the appeal ought be dismissed.
	


Decision


	
	I have approached the question of sentence by consideration of all objective and subjective factors arising in this case, and application of sentencing principles which the law requires to be considered. Having undertaken that task, it is necessary to determine whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law and should be passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	The Applicant’s offences were serious examples of offending of this type. He was in his mid-40s and committed offences against young girls aged between nine and 11 years. He had access to the girls because his stepdaughter (Helen) lived in the same house as the Applicant and was under his authority (an aggravating factor on Count 3 and the Form 1 offence). He obtained access to the other victim only because she visited the house as a friend of Helen.
	
	
	In each case, the Applicant took advantage of the absence of other adults from the house to sexually abuse one or other of the young girls. His conduct towards Helen did not involve isolated or aberrant conduct. The Applicant had demonstrated a sexual attraction to Helen, involving inappropriate sexual touching for some two years (since she had been eight years of age). Although not constituting an aggravating factor on sentence for Counts 2 and 3, these circumstances assist an understanding of the relationship between the Applicant and Helen and bear upon the degree of leniency to which he might otherwise have been entitled.
	
	
	The Applicant’s sexual offending had escalated in its seriousness to the point where he engaged in acts of vaginal and anal intercourse with Helen when she was 10 years old. Given the Applicant’s conduct towards Helen, it may be concluded that his sexual offending against her would likely have continued had she not complained on 18 August 2011, not long after the Count 3 and Form 1 offences. Certainly, there was no basis to conclude that the Applicant had determined to cease his offending conduct with the commission of those offences.
	
	
	A standard non-parole period of eight years applied to the s.61M(2) offences (Counts 1 and 2) against the background of a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment for those offences. The curious temporal relationship between these two periods was considered in Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [69]-[71]:
	


“69    An offence under s.61M(2) carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of eight years. The oddity of this situation was noted by the New South Wales Sentencing Council in its report ‘Penalties Relating to Sexual Assault Offences in New South Wales’, Vol 1, August 2008, page 56, at paragraph 3.47: 

‘Recently, the SNPP for a s 61M(2) offence was increased to 8 years. This amendment has, however, had the effect of precluding the setting of an additional term under s 44 of the Act of one third of the NPP, for the simple reason that the resulting sentence would exceed the maximum sentence by eight months. The 8 year SNPP exceeds the two-thirds worst case scenario of 7 years 6 months, by six months.’ 

70    The New South Wales Sentencing Council returned to this topic at paragraphs 3.65 (page 63) and 3.68 (pages 64-65) of that report, before suggesting that consideration be given to a number of changes, including (page 69): 

‘Giving consideration at the time of any wholesale review of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to standardising the SNPPs for sexual (and other) of sentences within a band of 40-60% of the available maximum penalty, subject to the possibility of individual exceptions, by reference to an assessment of the incidence of offending and special considerations relating thereto.’ 

71    This Court has adverted to the ‘somewhat curious and inconsistent approach of the legislature’ in the specification of standard non-parole periods for certain offences, where the standard non-parole period is not too distant from the maximum penalty for the offence: R v Dagwell [2006] NSWCCA 98 at [38]. Although it is difficult to reconcile the two statutory guideposts in the form of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period for a s.61M(2) offence, it remains the position that the legislature has made statutory provision for a standard non-parole period and that it is necessary for sentencing courts to give proper attention to the standard non-parole period, particularly when the term of that period approaches the maximum term provided for the offence: Hudson v R [2008] NSWCCA 90 at [28].”


	
	It is appropriate to consider the actual character of the offences under s.61M(2) to assist an assessment of objective seriousness. Count 2 involved a very serious example of an offence of this type, with the Applicant physically forcing Helen to come with him to the bathroom. He made her take off her clothes and get into the shower with him whilst he was naked. He then touched her vagina with his hands whilst the young girl told him to stop. It may be inferred that the only reason the offence came to an end was because Helen’s mother came home at that point.
	
	
	The s.61M(2) against Kylie was also serious, involving the Applicant presenting himself to her naked in the doorway. Despite the young girl’s obvious resistance, the Applicant placed his hand in her underpants and on her vagina until she removed it.
	
	
	The s.66C(2) offence comprising Count 3 was a very serious example of an offence of this type. When alone in the house, the Applicant picked up Helen and carried her into her bedroom, before removing his pants and holding her down on the bed. He pulled her pants down before licking and kissing her lips, breasts and vagina and then touching her vagina and bottom. He proceeded to insert his penis into her vagina.
	
	
	The Form 1 offence involved a s.66C(2) offence committed immediately after Count 3. The Applicant told Helen to bend over and had penile anal intercourse with her. She tried unsuccessfully to kick the Applicant away. The Applicant ceased this conduct when he heard the girl’s mother and others enter the house.
	
	
	The Applicant was fortunate to have a very serious s.66C(2) offence such as this placed on a Form 1 for the purpose of sentence. The inclusion of an offence such as this on a Form 1 required the sentencing court to give greater weight in sentencing for Count 3, to the need for specific deterrence, and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences: Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42]. In this case, the seriousness of the Form 1 offence called for particular emphasis to be given to specific deterrence, and the need for retribution, in passing sentencing on Count 3.
	
	
	Also relevant on the question of sentence was the victim impact statement concerning Helen in the form of Professor Hayes’ report of 18 April 2013. It may be said that the sentencing Judge took a generous approach to the Applicant on this aspect (see [53] above), given the contents of Professor Hayes’ report concerning the harm actually done to Helen as a result of these offences.
	
	
	In R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56; 239 A Crim R 469, this Court said at 483 [110]:
	


“This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. In R v G [2008] UKHL 37; [2009] 1 AC 92, Baroness Hale of Richmond (at [49]) referred to the ‘long term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do’. The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity: Clarkson v R [2011] VSCA 157; 32 VR 361 at 364 [3], 368-372 [26]-[39].”


	
	What the Court said in R v Gavel reflects the expectation of what the sexual abuse of a child is likely to produce. In this case, there was additional expert evidence from Professor Hayes concerning the serious harm actually done to Helen as a result of the Applicant’s offending against her.
	
	
	This is an important feature in the present case. Young child victims are especially vulnerable. It is important that sentences passed for serious child sexual assault crimes such as this recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The Applicant was entitled to a discount of 10% for his pleas of guilty and this Court should maintain that discount on resentence.
	
	
	I have kept in mind Dr Howard’s assessment of the Applicant’s intellectual functioning.
	
	
	The Applicant’s criminal history does not contain any sexual offences. However, it does contain a range of matters which operate to restrict the extent to which leniency may be provided to him.
	
	
	I do not consider that the sentencing decision in Clarke v R, NW v R and BIP v R provide any real assistance to the determination of this appeal. As counsel for the Applicant acknowledged, they do not demonstrate any range of sentencing. They provide a small number of examples of sentences passed upon particular offenders in the circumstances of their particular offences.
	
	
	As part of the exercise of this Court’s independent sentencing discretion, I have kept in mind the sentences imposed at first instance. Of course, it is necessary to have regard to those sentences for the purpose of forming the ultimate conclusion as to whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	Having considered the objective circumstances of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, in conjunction with application of all relevant sentencing principles, I am of the view that no lesser sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	Having made this finding, I conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Conclusion


	
	I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	grant the Applicant an extension of time to 8 October 2015 to make application for leave to appeal against sentence;
	
	
	grant leave to appeal against sentence;
	
	
	appeal dismissed.
	



	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Johnson J.

2784165,Islam v R [2016] NSWCCA 233,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Prabal Islam, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on 8 August 2014 with respect to two money laundering offences under the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”).
	


The Charges and Sentences


	
	Following pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 26 June 2013, the Applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court. On 12 June 2014, he appeared before his Honour Judge Blackmore SC on two counts:
	



	
	Count 1 - On or about 1 August 2012 at Mascot, dealing with money reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime to the value of $100,000.00 or more, contrary to s.400.9(1) of the Code, for which the maximum penalty was three years’ imprisonment or a fine of 180 penalty units ($19,800.00) or both;
	
	
	Count 2 - Between about 31 July 2012 and 1 August 2012, at Mascot and elsewhere in Sydney, dealing with money to the value of $1 million or more intending that the money would become an instrument of crime, contrary to s.400.3(1) of the Code, for which the maximum penalty was 25 years’ imprisonment or a fine of 1,500 penalty units ($165,000.00) or both.
	



	
	In addition to these offences, pursuant to s.16BA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the Applicant requested the sentencing Judge to take into account, on sentence for Count 2, a further offence of, on about 1 August 2012 at Mascot, attempting to move physical currency to the value of $10,000.00 or more out of Australia without a report, contrary to s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). If dealt with separately, this offence carried a maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment or a fine of 500 penalty units ($55,000.00) or both.
	
	
	Sentencing proceedings were conducted before his Honour on 12 June, 31 July, 5 and 8 August 2014. On 8 August 2014, the Applicant was sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment:
	



	
	Count 1 - a fixed term of imprisonment for nine months commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 April 2015;
	
	
	Count 2 - taking into account the offence under s.16BA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), a term of imprisonment for five years and six months commencing on 25 January 2015 and expiring on 24 July 2020, with a non-parole period of three years and six months.
	



	
	With partial accumulation of the sentence for Count 2, the total effective sentence comprised imprisonment for six years commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 July 2020, with a non-parole period of four years commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 July 2018.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Applicant relies upon three grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge erred in his characterisation of the offending namely, the intended use of the money as an “instrument of crime” in Count 2;
	
	
	Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred when determining the non-parole period of the total sentence by limiting himself by the application of a presumptive non-parole period;
	
	
	Ground 3 - the sentencing Judge erred by giving no weight to contrition because “that expression is not supported by sworn evidence”.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	A statement of agreed facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing and what follows is drawn from that statement.
	
	
	On 30 July 2012, police intercepted a telephone call between the Applicant (then 25 years old) and Abu Saleh (“Saleh”) in which the Applicant discussed the booking of tickets for flights for himself and others. The conversation was as follows:
	


“APPLICANT: Hey, I’m gonna get my mum and dad in business, and I’m gonna, and all of us are gonna in thing, economy, all right?

SALEH: Why?

…

SALEH: Fly in business, trust me …

APPLICANT: They don’t wanna (unintelligible).

SALEH: No, don’t worry about them, tell them it’s from us, from the company.”


	
	On 31 July 2012, the Applicant purchased from Delight Travel Pty Limited, seven business class tickets, one first class ticket and one first class child ticket to Dhaka, Bangladesh for travel on Singapore Airlines on 1 August 2012. All of the tickets were for return travel. The Applicant paid $58,660.00 in cash for the tickets.
	
	
	On the evening of 31 July 2012, police observed the Applicant attending an Ashfield address leased by Saleh and leaving a short time later, carrying an open top bag containing a number of packages. The Applicant placed the open top bag in the boot of a Porsche Cayenne. Later on the same evening, police observed the Applicant attend the city office of a solicitor who had previously acted for Saleh, where he collected a black sports bag which had been left there. The Applicant was in possession of each of these bags on 1 August 2012 when he attended the Airport. The open bag and black sports bag each contained a number of coloured Louis Vuitton and Gucci cotton shoe bags (“the shoe bags”).
	
	
	At about 9.30 am on 1 August 2012, the Applicant attended the Sydney International Airport at Mascot with his co-offenders, Cheuk Fai Chan (“Chan”) and Andrew Almada (“Almada”) and met with a group of seven other travellers, including the Applicant’s father and several members of his family. The Applicant and his companions were scheduled to depart on a Singapore Airlines flight to Dhaka, Bangladesh later that day.
	
	
	The Applicant was carrying the open top bag and the black sports bag which contained the shoe bags.
	
	
	Shortly after the Applicant met the group, the following took place:
	



	
	Chan rearranged the contents of the open top bag containing the shoe bags;
	
	
	the Applicant removed a shoe bag from the black sports bag and placed the shoe bag into Almada's suitcase, which Almada had opened - Almada then closed his suitcase;
	
	
	the Applicant removed two shoe bags from the black sports bag and approached the Applicant’s father who opened his suitcase - the Applicant placed the shoe bags underneath some items in the suitcase - the Applicant’s father then rearranged items in his suitcase to allow the suitcase to close;
	
	
	the Applicant removed a shoe bag from the black sports bag and approach Almada who opened his suitcase - the Applicant put the shoe bag in Almada’s suitcase - Almada then closed his suitcase.
	



	
	After checking in for their flight, the Applicant and his fellow travellers attempted to pass through Customs. The Applicant, his father, Almada and Chan had each completed and presented outgoing passenger cards on which they had declared that they were not taking more than AUD$10,000.00 out of Australia. The group was selected for a 100% baggage check of their checked-in suitcases. They were escorted to the Customs outwards examination area and their checked-in suitcases were retrieved to conduct a baggage check.
	
	
	After being selected for the baggage search, the Applicant made a telephone call to Saleh at about 10.30 am. Clearly, the two men were concerned. The conversation was as follows:
	


“APPLICANT: Something happened about the goods.

SALEH: What happened?

APPLICANT: About the money.

SALEH: Have they got the money?

APPLICANT: They are scanning the bag.

SALEH: Is it?

APPLICANT: Yes.

SALEH: Fuck.

APPLICANT: I’m waiting here, everybody is here as well.

SALEH: Have the police arrived?

APPLICANT: No.

SALEH: Is it a big problem? [END OF CALL]”


	
	During the baggage examination process, the Applicant identified three suitcases that belonged to him and confirmed that he had packed the bags and was aware of their contents. When asked about the contents, the Applicant advised Customs that he had “just over $10,000.00” with him. Customs officers then searched the Applicant’s luggage and located AUD$359,650.00 in $50.00 and $100.00 denominations hidden inside two shoe bags.
	
	
	After the money had been located, the Applicant informed Customs officers that he had also put money in the suitcases of his father, Chan and Almada. Customs officers searched the suitcases of the other travellers and located:
	



	
	AUD$204,450.00 hidden in two shoe bags inside the Applicant’s father’s suitcase;
	
	
	AUD$249,600.00 hidden inside five shoe bags in Chan’s suitcase; and
	
	
	AUD$210,200.00 hidden in two designer bags inside Almada’s suitcase and a further AUD$5,650.00 in a shoulder bag.
	



	
	The total amount of cash hidden inside the suitcases was AUD$1,023,900.00. When spoken to by Customs, the Applicant declared that the money was his and that he had packed it in the bags of the others.
	
	
	Following his arrest on 1 August 2012, the Applicant spent eight days in custody before his release on bail on 8 August 2012.
	
	
	Department of Immigration and Citizenship records showed that the Applicant, Almada and Chan had travelled to Singapore together in May 2012.
	
	
	The Applicant had not lodged a tax return since 2006. He had been in receipt of Newstart Allowance for the following periods:
	



	
	between January 2008 and February 2008;
	
	
	between August 2009 and March 2010; and
	
	
	between September 2011 and December 2011.
	



	
	In his outgoing passenger card completed on 1 August 2012, the Applicant indicated that his occupation was “student”.
	


Course of Proceedings in the District Court


	
	The sentencing hearing commenced in the Sydney District Court on 12 June 2014. On that date, the hearing was adjourned for sentence to 31 July 2014 and the Applicant’s bail was continued. Conditions of his bail included surrender of his passport and not to leave Australia or approach any points of international departure from Australia.
	
	
	On 13 June 2014, the Applicant breached his bail by leaving Australia and travelling to Bangladesh, using a New Zealand passport of which Australian authorities were unaware. The Applicant was in Bangladesh between 14-16 June, then Bangkok from 16 June to 1 July, then Singapore from 1 July to 18 July, then Bangladesh again from 18 to 30 July, then Bangkok again from 31 July to 2 August before he returned to Australia on 3 August 2014.
	
	
	On 31 July 2014, the proceedings were adjourned until 8 August 2014 and a bench warrant issued.
	
	
	Upon his return to Australia on 3 August 2014, the Applicant was arrested at Brisbane Airport under the bench warrant and he remained in custody until he was sentenced on 8 August 2014.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Applicant was born in 1986. He was 25 years old at the time of the offences and 28 years of age at the time of sentence.
	
	
	A presentence report and a report of Michelle Player, clinical psychologist, dated 17 September 2013 were before the sentencing court.
	
	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The reports indicated that the Applicant was born in Bangladesh and came to Australia, via New Zealand, in 1997. According to the presentence report, the Applicant had a normal upbringing and described his parents as supportive. He completed his Higher School Certificate in 2004 and had undertaken studies in business administration, accounting and real estate although he had not completed these courses. He informed the author of the presentence report that he had been employed for 18 months up to November 2013 by a real estate agency on a retainer and commission basis.
	
	
	The Applicant informed the author of the presentence report that he had been using the drug “Ice” in a six-month period prior to his arrest. He claimed that he had been in debt to his drug dealer to the amount of $6,000.00 - $7,000.00 and that this was his motivation for becoming involved in the offences.
	
	
	The Applicant has a criminal history in New South Wales extending back to 2005. He committed five offences of driving whilst suspended or driving whilst disqualified in 2005. Further offences of driving whilst disqualified were committed in 2007 and 2009. For the 2009 offence, he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	In 2008, the Applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment for a computer offence under s.308C Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (causing an unauthorised computer function with intent to commit a serious indictable offence) and an offence of obtaining money by deception. The convictions and sentences were confirmed on appeal to the Sydney District Court.
	
	
	In 2010, the Applicant was sentenced to an effective term of 18 months’ imprisonment for further s.308C offences and offences of obtaining money by deception. An appeal to the District Court against conviction and sentence was dismissed in June 2010.
	
	
	The presentence report indicated that the Applicant came to the attention of the Probation and Parole Service in 2005, when he was sentenced by way of good behaviour bonds for offences of driving whilst suspended. He came to the attention of the Service again in July 2007 as a result of sentences by way of community service orders for offences of dishonesty. The Applicant’s performance on those orders was unsatisfactory.
	
	
	In 2009, he was supervised for a short period whilst on parole and was subject to parole again between September 2011 and May 2012.
	
	
	Accordingly, the present offences were committed some three months after the Applicant had completed a period of parole.
	


The Applicant’s Co-Offenders


	
	The co-offenders, Almada and Chan, were also sentenced by his Honour Judge Blackmore SC on 8 August 2014. Each of them pleaded guilty to one count of dealing with money reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime to the value of $100,000.00 or more, contrary to s.400.9(1) of the Code. Each of Almada and Chan requested the sentencing Judge to take into account, under s.16BA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), a further offence of attempting to move physical currency to the value of $10,000.00 or more out of Australia without a report, contrary to s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).
	
	
	Chan was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment with a direction that he be released at the expiration of four months, upon entering into a recognisance under s.20(1)(b) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to be of good behaviour for three years.
	
	
	Almada was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment with a direction that he be released at the expiration of nine months, upon entering into a recognisance under s.20(1)(b) to be of good behaviour for three years.
	


Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge


	
	Before moving to the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to set out a number of findings by the sentencing Judge, some of which give rise to grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge undertook an assessment of the seriousness of the Applicant’s offences (relevant to the first ground) (AB40-41) (emphasis added):
	


“The offences committed by Islam are clearly extremely serious. They involve a penalty that is the second highest provided under the Commonwealth law. Moreover, this offence is particularly serious as he organised and involved the other offenders and additional third parties. There is no actual evidence as to what purpose the offender Islam had in mind when he attempted to export this large amount of money, but I am satisfied that the money would have become an instrument of crime. The offender Islam’s role is clearly the most significant of the three offenders. The evidence does not allow for a finding that he was the owner of the money. He appears to have received the money on the evening before he intended to travel. Having said that, if he was not the owner of the money, he was at the very least a highly trusted associate of the owner or owners. Further, this offender was involved in obtaining travel documents for the other offenders which indicates his close involvement with the offence. 

Most criminal activity has at its heart the desire to obtain money. Money is used to obtain illegal items that can later be obtained and imported and sold at extreme profits such as drugs, or the money might have been used in some other serious criminal activities such as terrorism. As I have indicated, there is no actual evidence as to the intended use of the money. However, when an offender is detected dealing with such extremely large amounts of cash, the sentence imposed must attempt to deter other similarly minded and tempted individuals. In my view the only penalty available in this case is a lengthy term of imprisonment.

The evidence suggests that the other two offenders were recruited by Islam. Almada appears to be more heavily involved based on the facts. Clearly the other two were aware of the nature of their offending. They were assisting Islam to carry out a very serious offence allowing his transfer [of] over one million dollars from the country for use in criminal activity.

There is no evidence that they were all aware of the purpose that Islam may have had for the transfer of money. However, the very large amounts of money involved in these cases require a sentence that reflects general deterrence in each case. The only appropriate sentence is one of full time custody in each case.”


	
	With respect to the Applicant’s background and subjective circumstances, his Honour said (relevant to the third ground) (AB41-43) (emphasis added):
	


“Mr Islam has a relatively serious prior criminal history. He has spent periods in custody for offences of fraud and other offences. He is not entitled to any particular leniency as a result of his prior record.

Both of the offenders, Almada and Chan, also have criminal records, although not nearly as significant as that of the offender Islam. Neither offender could be described as a person of prior good character, but their records are such that it is clear that they have not previously been involved in criminal activity of this level of seriousness. In my view that should result in some leniency being applied on sentence in each case.

Mr Islam is still a relatively young man. He only arrived in Australia in 1997 and since then he has obtained a serious criminal history. In recent time he has been working as a salesman, and according to the information provided to the Probation Service he has been quite successful in that role. His motivation for committing this offence was said to be to pay off a substantial drug debt. He said that he had been using the drug ice for up to six months prior to the offence and that he was not thinking straight at the time that he committed this offence. Accepting that this is true, it is no excuse for committing such a serious offence. Having said that, if the offender is able to avoid further drug use, his consistent recent work history does show that he has some prospects of rehabilitation.

The Crown has submitted that the offender has shown scant contrition and remorse for his actions. Obviously he has pleaded guilty, that is capable of being viewed as an expression of contrition, but he did not give evidence about his contrition and consequently that expression is not supported by sworn evidence. Moreover after granting him bail following the sentencing hearing the offender left the jurisdiction to apparently visit Bangladesh. He did that in breach of his set bail conditions. He did that using a passport that he held from New Zealand. It was a passport that the authorities were not aware of. He [sic] behaviour in leaving the jurisdiction is said by the Crown to show a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law.

On the other hand he did return to Australia even though he must have realised that he was facing a period in full time custody. That shows in my view that he is prepared to facilitate justice. On balance in my view his departure from the country contrary to his bail conditions, whilst unlawful, has only minor relevance.”


	
	His Honour found that the Applicant was “the principal offender of the three” (AB43).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge addressed the timing of the pleas of guilty, the Applicant’s willingness to consent to a confiscation order and the determination of the non-parole period for the Applicant (relevant to the second and third grounds) (AB44-45) (emphasis added):
	


“The offences here were very serious. Each of the offenders has pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. They are entitled to a significant discount upon the sentence that might otherwise have been set, which I will provide at a rate of 25%. That is to acknowledge their willingness to facilitate justice.

I note an acknowledgement by each offender that they will not oppose an order for confiscation of the money. I also note that that is relied [upon] as some form of assistance to authorities. Given the fact that each of the offenders was caught red-handed with this money without any reasonable explanation as to how they came to have it, the cases against them were overwhelming. It seems difficult in the circumstances to see how they could have legitimately objected [to] an order forfeiting the money to the Commonwealth. Inasmuch as they have consented to the order it also has facilitated justice and I will take it into account on the sentence, but it cannot be regarded as a significant mitigating factor in my view.

In relation to the offender Islam I note the suggestion that special circumstances should be applied in his case. These are Commonwealth charges. The usual ratio apply in such charges, already allows for a significantly reduced period of custody vis-à-vis the total sentence. In my view no additional reduction is required.”

Ground 1 - Suggested Error in Characterisation of the Offending on Count 2

The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Mr Game SC, for the Applicant, submitted that the “dealing” with respect to each count was possession of the money. In respect of Count 2, the dealing (possession) must be done with a particular intention in relation to some future activity: Milne v The Queen [2014] HCA 4; 252 CLR 149 at 164 [37]. He submitted that the nature of the intended future criminal use of the money was clearly relevant to the criminality involved in the offending.
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentencing Judge considered that the element of “instrument of crime” consisted of the future use of the money overseas in some “criminal activity”. The Applicant submitted that this was not the gravamen of the offence, nor was it permissible to sentence on this basis.
	
	
	Although neither the charge nor the agreed facts indicated without doubt what the intended use of the money was, the Applicant submitted that the Crown submissions in the District Court had stated that the future intended use of the money, as an “instrument of crime”, was the removal of the funds from Australia without report contrary to s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).
	
	
	Mr Game SC submitted that the sentencing Judge’s speculative consideration of the future use of the money contemplated criminality significantly worse than that encompassed in the plea and the case alleged by the Crown. In this way, it was submitted that his Honour had fallen into error.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the impugned sentencing remarks did not compel a conclusion that his Honour sentenced the Applicant on Count 2 with respect to criminality that was significantly worse than that encompassed by the plea in the case alleged by the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the gravamen of the offence is the present dealing with money or other property, accompanied by an intention to use that money or property in future criminal activity. The Applicant had pleaded guilty to an unparticularised offence of dealing with more than $1 million, intending that the money would become an instrument of crime.
	
	
	It was acknowledged that, in submissions before the District Court, the Crown had identified the predicate offence as being breaches of the reporting requirements under s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). It was submitted that, if his Honour’s finding that he was satisfied the money would become an instrument of crime was a reference to a s.53 offence, it was uncontroversial.
	
	
	Even if his Honour’s remarks were to be construed as a reference to an unspecified potential intended use to be made of the money in the event that it had been successfully smuggled out of the country by the Applicant, the Crown submitted that his Honour’s remarks did not demonstrate error. His Honour had noted, on a number of occasions, that the evidence was not capable of establishing the particular purpose or intended use for the money.
	
	
	Consequently, it was submitted that his Honour’s finding was neutral, and was simply a finding that the Court was satisfied that the money the Applicant dealt with possessed the necessary character required by the offence provisions. It was submitted that his Honour’s remarks are not capable of being viewed as a finding that aggravated the seriousness of the Applicant’s offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was pertinent to note that the sentencing Judge had made no finding that the money was to be used for any particular future crime or purpose, and made no finding that the Applicant himself was aware of any such purpose. Such findings may have constituted aggravating factors or have been capable of affecting the objective seriousness of the offence. The Crown submitted, however, that his Honour’s findings did not operate in this way.
	


Decision


	
	An offence under s.400.9(1) of the Code (such as Count 1) relates to past use of money or property valued at $100,000.00 or more - is it reasonable to suspect that the money or property (dealt with by the offender) is the proceeds of crime?
	
	
	A s.400.3(1)(b)(ii) offence (such as Count 2), on the other hand, concerns the future use of money or property valued at $1,000,000.00 or more - does the person (who deals with the property) intend that the money or property will become an instrument of crime?
	
	
	The first count involved an offence under s.400.9(1) of the Code which provides:
	


“Dealing with property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of

crime etc.

(1)    A person commits an offence if:

(a)   the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)   it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c)   at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.""


	
	The second count involved a charge under s.400.3(1) of the Code which states:
	


“Dealing in proceeds of crime etc - money or property worth

$1,000,000 or more

(1)    A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a)   the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)   either: 

(i)    the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or

(ii)    the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and

(c)   at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more.""


	
	The term “deals with money or other property” is defined in s.400.2 of the Code:
	


“A person deals with money or other property if the person does any of the following:

(a)    receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property,

(b)   imports money or other property into Australia,

(c)   exports money or other property from Australia;

(d)   engages in a banking transaction relating to money or other property.""


	
	Section 400.1(1) of the Code defines “proceeds of crime” (relevant to Count 1):
	


“proceeds of crime means any money or other property that is wholly or partly derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).”


	
	Section 400.1(1) of the Code defines “instrument of crime” (relevant to Count 2):
	


“Money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even it if may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).”


	
	Finally, it is appropriate to set out the terms of s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (the offence to be taken into account on sentence for Count 2):
	


“Reports about movements of physical currency into or out of Australia

53   (1)    Offence A person commits an offence if:

(a)   either:

(i)    the person moves physical currency into Australia; or

(ii)    the person moves physical currency out of Australia; and

(b)   the total amount of the physical currency is not less than $10,000; and

(c)   a report in respect of the movement has not been given in accordance with this section.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years or 500 penalty units, or both.” 


	
	The breadth of conduct covered by money laundering offences in Pt 10.2 of the Code has been emphasised: R v Guo; R v Qian [2010] NSWCCA 170; 201 A Crim R 403 at 414 [84]. The broad definitions of “deals with money or other property”, “proceeds of crime” and “instrument of crime” serve to explain the breadth of conduct involved in money laundering offences.
	
	
	In R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89, Howie J said at 118 [119]:
	


“The offences within the Division, therefore, apply to a large range of activity in relation to money or other property to be used in connection with, or arising from, serious crime. Not only is there a very wide ambit in relation to the conduct caught by the offences but there is also a substantial range of criminal activity to which the money or property could relate, being limited in effect to an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory. The offences are not concerned only with the source of the money or property that is dealt with but also its ultimate use. The offences cover money obtained illegally or to be used for illegal purposes or dealt with in a manner that is illegal.”


	
	The proper construction of s.400.3(1)(b)(ii) of the Code was considered by the High Court of Australia in Milne v The Queen. The Court (French CJ, Hayne, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ) said at 163 [33] (footnotes omitted):
	


“For property to become an instrument of crime within the meaning of s 400.3(1) it must be ‘used’. An ordinary meaning of the verb ‘use’ is ‘[t]o make use of (some immaterial thing) as a means or instrument; to employ for a certain end or purpose.’ That is the relevant ordinary meaning for the definition of ‘become an instrument of crime’ which involves the ‘use’ of property to serve a purpose, namely the ‘commission of an offence’ or ‘to facilitate the commission of an offence’. The relevant ordinary meaning of ‘facilitate’ in this case is ‘[t]o render easier the performance of (an action), the attainment of (a result); to afford facilities for, promote, help forward (an action or process).""


	
	The High Court returned to the definition of “instrument of crime” in Milne v The Queen at 164 [37]:
	


“The definition of ‘instrument of crime’ and the deployment of that term in s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) require a temporal separation between the requisite dealing and the intended use of the property. They also require an instrumental connection between the intended use of property and the commission or facilitation of the commission of an offence. Conduct involving property which is no more than a necessary condition of the commission of a subsequent offence does not on that account amount to the use of the property in or to facilitate the commission of that offence. Nor is the instrumental connection demonstrated merely by an intention to take advantage of circumstances arising after and as a result of the requisite dealing.”


	
	In R v Ansari, Howie J, at 118-119 [120]-[124], referred to circumstances where the origin of money or property, or its intended criminal use, may not be identified:
	


“120    With offences that are so wide ranging in their scope it becomes somewhat difficult to imagine an offence falling within the worst category of its kind against which any particular offence can be measured. It might be thought that dealing with money that is to be used for the purposes of terrorism might be within the class of the most serious offences encompassed by the sections in the Division. But it is perhaps not so difficult to conceive of offences that will form the bulk of conduct falling within the scope of the Division that would come before the criminal courts. The most obvious will relate to money obtained as a result of drug activity and that is being dealt with in order to make it more difficult to track or identify as the proceeds of a particular crime. It may also be money that has been legitimately earned but is to be dealt with in such a way as to disguise its source in order, for example, to defraud the taxation office.

121    But frequently it will be impossible for the authorities to identify the origins of the funds or what is ultimately to be the use made of them, yet it can be shown that the manner of dealing with them was a breach of the law, such as to avoid the mandatory reporting conditions under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act. It may be the case that the persons dealing with the money do not know its source or ultimate destination and do not care provided they are being paid for rendering a service.

122    The legislation itself has attempted to structure offences to give some guidance as to the seriousness of the conduct by reference to the applicable maximum penalty for each offence. The scheme is that the greater the sum of money involved, the more serious the offence. But the legislation also takes into account the mental state of the offender, so that an offence involving the intentional dealing with proceeds of crime or instruments of crime is more serious than one where the state of mind is recklessness as to the criminal nature of the property. Therefore s 400.3(1), where the amount involved is more than a million dollars and where the offender believes that the property is the proceeds of crime or intends that it will become an instrument of crime, provides for the most serious of the money laundering offences carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and/or 1500 penalty units.

123    It is likely that an offender before the court for sentencing for an offence within the Division will be a person facilitating the laundering of the money or actually involved in that process, rather than the owner of the money or the beneficiary of the laundering. The prosecution may not be able to show that the offender knew of the source of the money or its ultimate destination. In Assafiri v R [2007] NSWCCA 159 an analogy was drawn between money laundering offences and drug importations in that both types of offences usually reveal a hierarchy of persons involved in the conduct who have different roles to play and different gains to be made from the commission of the crime. The most important consideration in sentencing an offender for an offence under this Division will be to consider what the offender did, because there may be little or no evidence before the court as to the organisation behind the offence, the source of the funds or the ultimate use to made of them: see R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [19].

124    However according to normal sentencing principles, if the Crown wants to submit that the particular offence is aggravated by a circumstance that makes it more serious than objectively it would appear to be from the bare conduct of the offender, for example because the money with which the offender dealt was known by him to be intended to support terrorism, then the Crown should prove that fact beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if the offender seeks to mitigate the seriousness of the apparent conduct by some fact, for example that the offender believed the funds were to be used for a humanitarian purpose, then it would fall to the offender to prove that fact on the balance of probabilities. Where however the accused denies the offence or there is no evidence as to his state of knowledge of the source of the funds, the purpose of dealing with the funds or their ultimate destination, the Court must simply deal with the matter on the objective facts as proved by the evidence. That was the case here. The Judge was not required to find facts that were most favourable to the appellants.”


	
	During the course of oral submissions at the sentencing hearing, the Crown made clear that the intended offence as an “instrument of crime” in Count 2 was the breach of reporting requirements under s.53(1). It appears from the following exchange that the sentencing Judge had in mind factors of the type referred to by Howie J in R v Ansari (at [68] above). The Crown made clear, however, the limited way in which it put its case on the s.400.3(1)(b)(ii) count (AB21):
	


“HIS HONOUR: Which does - you know it’s always interesting, what other factors that would justify the maximum and then you look at what people are actually getting.

NEILD: Yes. I suppose the nature of the predicate offence may be something. I mean this is an offence that’s obviously very commonly committed in these circumstances where it’s the breach of the reporting requirement that’s the predicate offence and I suppose it’s - you know if someone were to be financing with a million dollars some dreadful act of terror or something like that that would clearly be more serious than this, in my respectful submission.

HIS HONOUR: Well let’s just turn to the actual elements of the offence though. ‘Intending the money would become an instrument of crime’. You don’t have any precise evidence about what crime you're just saying that it’s--

NEILD: That’s right, so perhaps if there were in this case--

HIS HONOUR: The inference is obvious that it must be some crime but you can’t say exactly what.

NEILD: Yes. Well in this case it’s the breach of the reporting requirements that’s the way in which it’s going to become an instrument of crime and in that sense I suppose that is a, obviously in terms of the maximum penalty amongst other factors, a less serious offence than others that might be contemplated. And also then I suppose there may be factors--

HIS HONOUR: So if for example you had evidence that the million dollars was to be used to buy a quantity of drugs in Nigeria - a huge quantity of drugs, to ultimately be imported back into Australia and then you would have some additional evidence to request a maximum--

NEILD: Yes, thinking as I go I think that’s the sort of situation that could comfortably be described as being more serious than this your Honour but certainly with respect I would say this comfortably falls well above the lower end of the scale, even though it does barely pass the million dollar mark.” 


	
	This approach was confirmed in the Crown’s written submissions before the District Court (AB93):
	


“The offender’s criminality is of a high order. He was responsible for dealing with over $1 million in cash intending that the money would become an instrument of crime, namely offences against s 53 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act. The offence against s 400.3(1) was calculated, involving planning and the intended use of third parties. The purpose of the offence was to have a very significant amount of cash, the source of which is unknown, unlawfully removed from Australia.”


	
	This submission was repeated elsewhere in the Crown’s written submissions before the sentencing Judge concerning the s.400.3(1)(b)(ii) offence (AB96):
	


“The Offender’s criminality is significant. The Offender’s conduct involved first the possession of money which can reasonably be suspected as being the proceeds of crime and secondly, the dealing in money where it is intended that the money will become an instrument of crime, namely removal of the funds from Australia without report.”


	
	This was not a case, of the type referred to by Howie J in R v Ansari (see [68] above), where it was necessary for the sentencing court to consider the nature of intended use of the money as an instrument of crime. Here, the Crown adopted the approach, perhaps generously to the Applicant, that the intended use of the money so as to become an instrument of crime related to breaches of the reporting requirement in s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). The Crown did not put its case on this aspect by reference to what may be done with the money once it reached Bangladesh.
	
	
	The Crown having put its case in this way, it was not open to the sentencing Judge to approach the element of intention that the money will become an instrument of crime upon the basis that the Applicant was carrying out “a very serious offence allowing his transfer [of] over one million dollars from the country for use in criminal activity” (see [42] above).
	
	
	I accept the Applicant’s submission that his Honour’s finding on this aspect was based upon the intended use of the money for a more serious unidentified criminal purpose than that which the Crown had relied upon at the sentencing hearing. In this way, the sentencing Judge has fallen into error in a manner which operated adversely to the Applicant.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the first ground of appeal has been made good.
	


Ground 2 - Suggested Error in Determination of the Non-Parole Period Component of the Total Sentence by the Application of a Presumptive Non-Parole Period

The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Mr Game SC submitted that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in stating that the “usual ratio” applied in the determination of the non-parole period for Commonwealth offences and that “no additional reduction is required”. It was submitted that this approach was inconsistent with the proper exercise of sentencing discretion for Commonwealth offences, including the determination of the non-parole period: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 534 [44].
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown conceded that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in the manner identified in the second ground.
	
	
	However, the Crown submitted that the Court would conclude, in any event, that no lesser sentence was warranted under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Decision


	
	His Honour was not assisted on this question by a submission for the Applicant which sought (wrongly) to apply the “special circumstances” formula in s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to Commonwealth offences (see [45] above).
	
	
	However, I am satisfied that the sentencing Judge fell into error in approaching the determination of the non-parole period by reference to the “usual ratio”, and the conclusion by his Honour that “no additional reduction is required” (see [45] above).
	
	
	The High Court made clear in Hili v The Queen, at 526 [13], 532-533 [37]-[38], that there is no judicially determined norm or starting point for the period of imprisonment that a federal offender should actually serve, prior to release on parole. Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) makes exhaustive provision for fixing non-parole periods for federal offenders: Hili v The Queen at 527-528 [22].
	
	
	A sentencing Judge should determine the length of sentence to be served before release on parole by reference to, and application of, s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the principles identified in Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623; Deakin v The Queen  [1984] HCA 31; 58 ALJR 367 and Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525: Hili v The Queen at 533 [40]. A critical consideration is the determination of the period of imprisonment that justice requires an offender must serve in custody: Hili v The Queen at 533 [41]. The non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in full-time custody having regard to all the elements of punishment including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the crime and the offender’s subjective circumstances: Power v The Queen at 627-629. The risk of reoffending is a relevant factor in setting the minimum term: Bugmy v The Queen at 537.
	
	
	In Hili v The Queen at 533 [41], the High Court said that the necessary deterrent and punitive effects of sentences for serious tax frauds must be reflected in both the head sentence and the minimum term. The same may be said with respect to serious money laundering offences as seen in the present case.
	
	
	Error has been demonstrated in accordance with the second ground of appeal.
	


Ground 3 - Suggested Error by Giving No Weight to Contrition Because of the Absence of Sworn Evidence from the Applicant

The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	The Applicant submitted that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in his approach to contrition, by treating the Applicant’s failure to give sworn evidence as being a decisive factor (see [43] above).
	
	
	Although this aspect may have been of particular significance on sentence for a State offence (s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)), it was submitted that there is no equivalent provision in Commonwealth legislation. Section 16A(2)(f) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) requires a sentencing court to take into account the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence or in any other manner.
	
	
	Reference was made to the statement by the author of the presentence report that the Applicant “expressed regret for involving family members and others in his offending” (AB71). It was noted, as well, that the clinical psychologist, Ms Player, had stated that the Applicant “expressed remorse for his involvement in his offending” (AB85).
	
	
	It was submitted further that the Applicant had consented to an order for forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) and had been provided with a letter from the Australian Federal Police to this effect. Although his Honour took account of this as illustrating the Applicant’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice, it was submitted that it was also capable of evidencing remorse.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that, under federal sentencing legislation, where an offender provides co-operation regarding a confiscation order, it may evidence contrition and remorse: s.16A(2)(f) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth); s.320 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth); Stock v R [2011] NSWCCA 49 at [36]; McMahon v R [2011] NSWCCA 147 at [72].
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that error had been demonstrated in accordance with this ground of appeal.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the Applicant bore the onus of satisfying the sentencing court, to the civil standard, that he was contrite for his offending. His Honour was not bound to give weight to, or even accept, the various expressions of remorse relied upon by the Applicant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the fact that s.16A(2)(f) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) is not expressed in the same terms as s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) had no significance, as this Court has said that a sentencing Judge is not bound to give weight to suggested expressions of remorse contained in third-party reports: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 367.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the expressions of contrition contained in the presentence report and psychological report were unpersuasive expressions of any real contrition. The Crown pointed, as well, to the Applicant’s departure from Australia whilst awaiting sentence, with him travelling to Bangladesh on a New Zealand passport, and remaining absent and in breach of his bail until he chose to return some weeks later.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had taken into account the Applicant’s consent to forfeiture of the money that he and others had been in possession of when arrested at the Airport. The Crown submitted that his Honour had rightly observed that this was a matter of little weight and was not a matter that demonstrated contrition to any significant degree, if at all.
	


Decision


	
	This Court has observed that the assessment of the genuineness of remorse is likely to be better informed in circumstances where it is expressed directly, as remorse is an intrinsically subjective matter, the evaluation of which depends upon human interaction: Mun v R [2015] NSWCCA 234 at [29]. Further, it has been emphasised that considerable caution must be exercised in determining what weight, if any, can be placed upon self-serving and untested statements by an offender contained in a report of a health professional: Mun v R at [40].
	
	
	It has been said that remorse means regret for the wrongdoing which the offender’s actions have caused because it can be safely assumed that an offender will always regret the fact of apprehension: Alvares v R [2011] NSWCCA 33; 209 A Crim R 297 at 313 [44].
	
	
	I do not consider that the sentencing Judge erred in taking into account the absence of evidence from the Applicant on the question of contrition and remorse. His Honour did not purport to apply s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Rather, his Honour had regard to all matters that were capable of shedding light upon the existence of genuine contrition and remorse, as to which the Applicant bore the onus of proof to the civil standard.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge was entitled to have regard to the absence of sworn evidence from the Applicant concerning contrition. This Court has said repeatedly that limited weight ought be given to the self-serving, untested statements made in a report of a health professional (R v Qutami at 377 [58]-[59], 380 [79]) or in a presentence report (R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185 [40]-[41]). I do not accept that his Honour determined to put the question of contrition to one side because the Applicant had not given sworn evidence.
	
	
	The determination of questions of fact, such as the extent to which remorse has been shown, is quintessentially a task that falls to the sentencing Judge, who is not bound to accept assertions by an offender that he is remorseful, even when the assertion is made in the witness box: Alvares v R at 320 [65].
	
	
	The Applicant’s complaint concerning the sentencing Judge’s approach to the confiscation order does not strictly lie within the terms of Ground 3. That said, the Applicant had been literally caught in the act of committing these serious crimes. His preparedness to consent to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) did not provide any real assistance to the Applicant on the issue of contrition.
	
	
	It was clear that the money did not belong to the Applicant or his co-offenders. This was a good example of the scenario identified by Howie J in R v Ansari at 119 [123] (see [68] above), where a money laundering offender “will be a person facilitating the laundering of the money or actually involved in that process, rather than the owner of the money or the beneficiary of the laundering”. In truth, the Applicant forewent an opportunity to make a hopeless attempt to resist the confiscation of money which was not his. There is very little scope for this scenario to have demonstrated genuine contrition on his part.
	
	
	The Applicant’s decision to depart the jurisdiction, whilst the sentencing proceedings were on foot, did not assist him on the question of contrition. The Applicant was fortunate that the sentencing Judge took a relatively benign view of his conduct (see [43] above).
	
	
	In my view, this is a case where the approach expressed in Mun v R had particular application. The fact that the Applicant did not give evidence of contrition was a relevant and important aspect bearing upon the exercise of the sentencing discretion. No error has been demonstrated in the approach of the sentencing Judge in this area.
	
	
	I would reject the third ground of appeal.
	


Application of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)

The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that error had been demonstrated and that this Court should proceed to resentence the Applicant and impose a lesser sentence. An affidavit of the Applicant affirmed 12 February 2016 was relied upon for the purpose of resentencing.
	
	
	It was submitted that consideration of all factors relevant to sentence, including application of the correct approach to sentencing on Count 2, and the correct approach to determination of the non-parole period, would result in a lesser sentence being imposed upon the Applicant who had, it was submitted, made positive steps towards his rehabilitation in a manner demonstrated in his affidavit of 12 February 2016.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that, even if error had been demonstrated, this Court would reach the opinion that no lesser sentence was warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Decision


	
	The Applicant has demonstrated error in accordance with the first and second grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Error having been established, this Court is required to exercise its independent sentencing discretion when it resentences the Applicant, in accordance with the principles in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at 618-619 [43].
	
	
	It is necessary to move to the question of sentence applying the correct approach with respect to areas where error has been established, and having regard to all objective and subjective factors bearing on sentence, including the recent affidavit of the Applicant, together with the provisions of s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	The error in the first ground concerns Count 2 only, while the error in the second ground relates to both Counts 1 and 2.
	
	
	The offence in Count 1 was a serious example of a s.400.9(1) crime. The amount of money involved (which was more than 10 times the statutory threshold) reflected the very serious criminal conduct which could reasonably be suspected to be the source of the cash. Added to this were the circumstances in which the Applicant took possession of this very large sum and his dealings with Saleh and others in that respect.
	
	
	Whilst the sum of money was just above the statutory threshold, the offence in Count 2 was nevertheless a serious example of a money laundering offence under s.400.3(1)(b)(ii) of the Code. The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	The most important consideration on sentence is what the Applicant actually did: R v Ansari at 119 [123]-[124] (see [68] above). The Applicant played a pivotal role in the lead up to the s.400.3(b)(ii) offence, and in its implementation. He took possession of this large sum of money and organised the travel arrangements of the multiple persons who were to carry the money.
	
	
	It may be inferred that Saleh provided the substantial sum of $58,660.00 to the Applicant to purchase the multiple airline tickets. Saleh was happy to fund two return first class tickets and five return business class tickets to Dhaka. Clearly, there was no shortage of money available to fund expensive air travel by the carriers as part of this money laundering exercise. The Applicant distributed the money to the various carriers who were to convey it to Bangladesh. He was the point of contact with Saleh, whom he dealt with directly and by telephone. It may be readily inferred that Saleh trusted the Applicant with this very large sum of money. The Applicant’s criminality was significantly greater than that of his co-offenders, who were to be sentenced for lesser offences.
	
	
	The understanding of the Applicant as to the purposes for which the money was to become an instrument of crime is a relevant consideration. The fact that the Applicant was involved in dealing with the money, for the intended purpose of breaching the reporting requirements under s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth), constituted a serious example of a crime of this type. However, this aspect is not decisive of the seriousness of the particular offence or the appropriate penalty: R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370 at 380 [33].
	
	
	Whilst the intended use of the money is a circumstance to be considered in assessing the overall conduct of the Applicant, it is not the primary factor. Any focus or regard to the maximum penalty for an intended offence (such as a s.53(1) offence) is likely to distract from consideration of the actual offence, and actual maximum penalty, for which the Applicant is being sentenced: R v Huang; R v Siu at 381 [37]. In setting the maximum penalties for s.400.3 “instrument of crime” offences, the legislature did not fix them by reference to the maximum penalty for the potential subsequent “instrument of crime” offence.
	
	
	Money laundering on the scale disclosed in these offences should be considered as serious criminal activity that is at the very heart of organised professional crime syndicates: R v Huang; R v Siu at 381 [36]. The evidence concerning Saleh, the steps taken by him to supply the money to the Applicant and the large expenditure on multiple expensive airline tickets confirms this view.
	
	
	The courts have emphasised the important role of general deterrence in sentencing for offences of this type: R v Huang; R v Siu at 381 [36]; R v Guo; R v Qian at 418 [91].
	
	
	The Applicant had a prior criminal history, including sentences of imprisonment for computer and dishonesty offences. He had served terms of imprisonment and was not long off parole when he committed these offences. Specific deterrence remains an important factor on sentence in his case.
	
	
	I have taken into account the Applicant’s affidavit affirmed 12 February 2016.
	
	
	Although the Applicant pleaded guilty at an early time, the plea was in the face of an overwhelming Crown case. His willingness to agree to the confiscation of the sum of money did not provide any real assistance to the Applicant by way of contrition (see [100]-[101] above).
	
	
	I will maintain the 25% discount for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The appropriate course at first instance would have been to fix terms of imprisonment as nominated, but to set a single non-parole period under s.19AB Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), which commenced on 25 July 2014. In approaching the resentencing of the Applicant, I shall proceed in that way.
	
	
	Having taken into account all relevant objective and subjective factors, I am satisfied that the sentence on Count 1 should remain a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment. However, it is appropriate to resentence the Applicant on this matter without using the formula of a fixed term of imprisonment.
	
	
	I am satisfied that a lesser sentence should be passed on Count 2. That should be, after taking into account the s.53(1) offence, a term of imprisonment of four years and nine months. I am satisfied that the existing degree of accumulation upon the Count 1 sentence should remain, so that the sentence on Count 2 should commence on 25 January 2015.
	
	
	In fixing a single non-parole period, I have regard to the need for the minimum term of imprisonment to reflect the objective gravity of the offending, and the need for specific and general deterrence, whilst taking into account, as well, the Applicant’s subjective circumstances including the need for rehabilitation. I am satisfied that the non-parole period to be fixed should be one of three years and six months commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 January 2018. The non-parole period will comprise about 62% of the total head sentence.
	
	
	The total effective term of imprisonment will comprise a head sentence of five years and three months commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 October 2019, with a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 January 2018. I am satisfied that this minimum term reflects the minimum period that justice requires that the Applicant should serve in custody for his offences (see [81]-[83] above).
	


Conclusion


	
	The Applicant has made good the first and second grounds of appeal, but not the third ground.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	grant leave to appeal against sentence;
	
	
	allow the appeal with respect to the sentences imposed on 8 August 2014;
	
	
	quash the sentences imposed on 8 August 2014;
	
	
	on Count 1, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for nine months commencing on 25 July 2014;
	
	
	on Count 2, taking into account under s.16BA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) the offence under s.53(1) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth), sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for four years and nine months commencing on 25 January 2015 and expiring on 24 October 2019;
	
	
	pursuant to s.19AB Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), fix a single non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 January 2018.

2784167,MM v R [2016] NSWCCA 235,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, MM, seeks an extension of time to bring an application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence for an offence of specially aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence contrary to s.112(3) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	A pseudonym (which does not utilise the Applicant’s correct initials) is used in this judgment to describe him because of evidence of the Applicant’s assistance to authorities. Other steps have been taken in the judgment to remove potential identifying features. This Court made a non-publication order with respect to the Applicant’s name at the hearing on 10 February 2016.
	
	
	Following a plea of guilty entered on 10 April 2014, the Applicant was sentenced on 15 May 2014 by Blanch J, the Chief Judge of the District Court, to a term of imprisonment of nine years commencing on 7 March 2013, with a non-parole period of six years, expiring on 6 March 2019.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Applicant relies upon Amended Grounds of Appeal, filed in Court on 10 February 2016, which identified the following grounds:
	


Conviction

1   The plea of guilty occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

Sentence

1   The admission of the statement of facts on sentence occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

1(b)   The failure to adduce evidence of the Applicant’s mental condition caused a miscarriage of justice.

2   The sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust.

Extension of Time and Leave to Rely Upon Sentence Ground 1(b)


	
	Having considered the affidavits of the Applicant’s solicitor, Bryan Dowe, affirmed 22 October 2015 and 2 November 2015, read in support of the extension of time application, I would grant the Applicant an extension of time to appeal against conviction and sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant sought leave at the hearing to add sentence Ground 1(b) to his grounds. The Crown was in a position to meet this ground at the hearing. The Applicant should have leave to rely upon sentence Ground 1(b).
	


The s.112(3) Crimes Act 1900 Offence


	
	The Applicant was committed for trial and thereafter entered a plea of guilty to the charge on an indictment at special sittings before the Chief Judge at country sittings of the District Court on 10 April 2014. The proceedings were then adjourned to 15 May 2014 in Sydney for a hearing on sentence. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, his Honour moved directly to sentence the Applicant by way of ex tempore remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant pleaded guilty on 10 April 2014 to an offence charged in the following terms (aspects of the charge have been deleted as they may serve to identify the Applicant):
	


“On 7 March 2013 at [XXX] in the State of New South Wales, you did break and enter the dwelling house of [the male victim] at [XXX] and did commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny of a handbag containing money and personal items of property of [the female victim], in circumstances of aggravation, namely that you were armed with an offensive weapon namely a hammer, and in circumstances of special aggravation namely you did inflict grievous bodily harm upon [the male victim].”


	
	The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of seven years is specified.
	


Facts of the Offence


	
	A document entitled “Statement of Facts on Sentence” was admitted in evidence, without objection, in the sentencing proceedings. The facts may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	On 6 March 2013, at about 10.00 pm, the female and male victims returned to their unit after an evening out. The female victim was then 41 years old and the male victim was 45 years old. The female victim was still awake at 12.15 am when she heard their dogs barking. She went to the door and saw the Applicant (then aged 35 years) on the back veranda.
	
	
	The Applicant said that he was armed and wanted to buy drugs, but the female victim told him she had none. The Applicant told her he had a gun and she believed him. The Applicant told her that he needed cash and asked to come inside.
	
	
	The female victim refused and closed the door saying that she would get the dogs. The Applicant smashed the door’s glass panel with a hammer then put his hands through the door to unlock it and entered.
	
	
	The male victim came into the kitchen and said “What are you doing mate?”. The male victim went to arm himself with a pole but the Applicant struck him to the head twice with the hammer, causing him to fall to the floor. The Applicant struck the male victim to the head five more times with the hammer as he lay on the ground.
	
	
	The female victim grabbed a knife and backed away. The Applicant told her he needed money and she gave him $25.00. The Applicant took her handbag containing $600.00 and a camera before he left.
	
	
	Police and ambulance officers attended. The male victim was taken to hospital with a fractured right clavicle, an open compound fracture to the right jaw which required surgical repair, two depressed skull fractures that resulted in a brain contusion and required insertion of a plate and mesh, and several wounds to his face and head that required suturing.
	
	
	Within hours, police arrested the Applicant on 7 March 2013 at his home where they found clothing worn and items taken during the offence. A camera and the female victim’s empty handbag were later recovered. The Applicant declined to participate in an interview with police.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Applicant was aged 35 years at the time of the offence. The sentencing Judge was informed that the Applicant has two children who live with their mother in rural New South Wales.
	
	
	The Applicant has an extensive criminal history including offences of break, enter and steal (1991), armed robbery causing grievous bodily harm and armed robbery with wounding (1993), indecent assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault (1996-1997), breach of parole (1998), aggravated robbery (1999), breach of parole (2003), steal from the person and common assault (2003), aggravated take and drive a motor vehicle whilst armed with a weapon and use offensive weapon to prevent lawful detention (2005), and robbery in company (2005).
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment for most of these offences including, for the 2005 robbery in company offence, a sentence of imprisonment for six years and nine months with a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on 24 July 2006.
	
	
	The Applicant was subject to parole at the time of the present offence. His parole was revoked and he served a period from 7 March 2013 to 1 June 2013 arising from his parole revocation.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge referred to the Applicant’s subjective features (ROS3):
	


“He was born in 1976, so he was only 13 at the time that his offending began and he has a number of convictions on his criminal record which all indicate a continuous course of criminality over a long period of time. 

The subjective circumstances of the case are that he comes from the Aboriginal community. He grew up in Newcastle and apparently began taking drugs and it is his drug addiction which led to the commission of the offence. It is quite clear in this particular case that when he went to the home, he went there demanding drugs. It was only when he did not get the drugs that he then sought to get the money obviously to buy drugs.”


	
	His Honour turned to the Applicant’s assistance to authorities (ROS3-4):
	


“A significant feature of this case is the matters referrable to s 23 of the Act, the assistance that he has given. I will not go into that in these remarks but there is a letter from the Crime Commission and there is also a letter from the police. It is perfectly apparent from both of those letters that the assistance he has given is of the highest order and has had some significant results. It also appears that he has indicated a willingness to provide further assistance in terms of giving evidence if needs be. 

Those factors lead to two results. One of them is that he has had to be housed especially within the prison system and, because he is housed in special circumstances, he is more confined. He has less access to courses and other activities within the gaol that might ameliorate his prison conditions. The second result is that when he is released, he is going to be vulnerable to repercussions from the assistance that he has given and special precautions will need to be taken for his rehousing and substitute identification for the foreseeable future once he is released from custody. Those ramifications of the assistance do need to be taken into account.”


	
	His Honour said with respect to the Applicant’s remorse and prospects of rehabilitation (ROS4):
	


“So far as the questions of remorse and rehabilitation are concerned, the assistance that he has given and will continue to give is assistance that in my view do indicate a degree of remorse and they also do indicate that he will have better prospects of rehabilitation largely because he will have to be relocated, renamed and significantly protected on his release.”

Other Findings of the Sentencing Judge


	
	The sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant had been committed for trial and entered a plea of guilty on 10 April 2014 in special sittings arranged at a country court to review matters listed for trial. His Honour accepted that the Applicant was “entitled to have a discount for that plea of guilty, although it did not come at the earliest opportunity and he would not be entitled therefore, to a 25% discount” (ROS2).
	
	
	Reference was made to victim impact statements placed before the sentencing court. His Honour observed that the male victim had “suffered significant injuries with lasting consequences so far as he is concerned and both of them have suffered from the trauma of having their home invaded and being the subject to such violent conduct” (ROS2-3).
	
	
	His Honour described the offence as “an extremely serious offence” with an aggravating factor being that it was committed whilst the Applicant was on parole for robbery.
	
	
	After addressing the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, the sentencing Judge returned to determine an appropriate sentence (ROS4-5):
	


“In terms of what all that translates into, in my view a starting point for the sentences here is a starting point of somewhere about the order of 14 or 15 years. That sentence should be reduced because of the plea of guilty. But significantly it should be reduced for the s 23 matters and in my view the level of reduction of his sentence should be one-third. 

On that basis, the sentence of what was something over 14 years comes down to something over nine years, and in terms of arriving at an appropriate sentence he should be given the benefit of odd months and in my view the total sentence, therefore, should be a sentence of nine years. 

That then leads to the question of what should be the non-parole period. In the ordinary course of events, the non-parole period would be 81 months in respect of a sentence of nine years. There are reasons in this case to vary the statutory ratio. Of course he is going to gaol for a long time. But of significance is rather the fact that when he is released from custody, his release is going to be a difficult thing to cope with and, because of that, there are special circumstances to reduce the non-parole period below that 81 months. In my view, an appropriate non-parole period in the circumstance would be 72 months or six years. 

The other question that needs to be addressed here is the question of when to start the sentence from. He has been in custody since 7 March 2013. His parole was revoked, but of course he could have been re-released to parole because he was very close to the end of his parole period at the time and in my view the appropriate starting point is 7 March 2013 rather than 1 June when his revocation ran out.”


	
	It will be seen that this Honour had regard to applicable discounts and made further adjustments, rounding periods downwards, before determining to backdate the sentence entirely to the Applicant’s date of arrest.
	
	
	For the purpose of s.23(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour indicated that the Applicant’s level of assistance had resulted in the reduction of the sentence by a period of five years, with half of that relating to past assistance and the other half to future assistance (ROS5).
	


Conviction Ground - The Plea of Guilty Occasioned a Miscarriage of Justice


	
	Before moving to determine this ground of appeal, it is necessary to say something about the hearing which proceeded before this Court.
	
	
	In support of this ground, the Applicant relied upon his own affidavit affirmed 20 October 2015 and an affidavit of his solicitor, Bryan Dowe, affirmed 14 January 2016. The Crown relied upon an affidavit sworn 18 December 2015 of Gemunu Kumarasinhe, the Applicant’s barrister in the District Court and an affidavit sworn 12 January 2016 of Stephen Charles Wright, the Applicant’s solicitor in the District Court.
	
	
	At the hearing, the Applicant, Mr Kumarasinhe and Mr Wright were cross-examined.
	


Applicable Principles on Appeal Against Conviction Following Plea of Guilty in the Sentencing Court


	
	The principles to be applied where a person seeks to challenge, on appeal to this Court, a conviction following a plea of guilty in the District Court were summarised in R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 312-313 [32]-[35]:
	


“32    This Court may quash a conviction entered upon a plea of guilty in the sentencing court if it is demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the Appellant is not permitted to withdraw the plea: R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36; R v Van (2002) 129 A Crim R 229; Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22 at [33]ff. 

33    The onus lies upon the Appellant to demonstrate that leave should be granted: R v Marchando (2000) 110 A Crim R 337 at 338 [4]; R v Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 at 536-537 [16]-[23]. The Appellant must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting leave to withdraw the plea: R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 at [39]; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at 46 [39]. An application to withdraw a plea of guilty is to be approached with caution bordering on circumspection: R v Liberti (1991) 66 A Crim R 120 at 122; R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377 at [48]. 

34    The plea of guilty itself is a cogent admission of the ingredients of the offence: R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 at [51]. Indeed, it has been described as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: Charlesworth v R [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [25]. 

35    A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person’s belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46.”


	
	In R v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273; 124 A Crim R 233, Ipp JA observed, at 238-239 [32], that there is no closed catalogue of circumstances that are capable of giving rise to such a miscarriage of justice and each case depends on its own circumstances.
	
	
	In Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; 184 CLR 501, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 510-511 [19]-[20] (footnotes omitted):
	


“19.    An accused is entitled to plead guilty to an offence with which he is charged and, if he does so, the plea will constitute an admission of all the essential elements of the offence. Of course, if the trial judge forms the view that the evidence does not support the charge or that for any other reason the charge is not supportable, he should advise the accused to withdraw his plea and plead not guilty. But he cannot compel an accused to do so and if the accused refuses, the plea must be considered final, subject only to the discretion of the judge to grant leave to change the plea to one of not guilty at any time before the matter is disposed of by sentence or otherwise. 

20.    The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered. But otherwise an accused may insist upon pleading guilty."" 


	
	In R v KCH, Ipp AJA (Sperling J agreeing) said at 247 [93]-[94]:
	


“93 I appreciate that in Maxwell v The Queen Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 511 that even the ‘desire to gain a technical advantage’ may result in a plea of guilty not being an admission of guilt. With respect, however, I do not understand a ‘technical advantage’ to apply to or include the situation where an accused person, without any undue or improper pressure, freely and voluntarily makes a decision to plead guilty to one offence, not because he believes that he is guilty, but because he thinks that this is a good way of avoiding the risk of being found guilty of other offences, or of receiving a reduced sentence, or of protecting his evidence with a view to bringing an appeal at a later stage. 

94    As long as the decision to plead guilty was made freely and voluntarily, the decision stands. This is the necessary corollary of the principle laid down in Maxwell v The Queen at 511 that if the plea of guilty is genuine, and the accused person knows what he is doing, he may, for “whatever reason” insist on pleading guilty.”


	
	In Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 129; 155 A Crim R 37, Howie J, after referring to Meissner v The Queen [1995] HCA 41; 184 CLR 132 at 157, said at 46 [36]-[37]:
	


“36    If, on the other hand, the advice was concerned with whether he should plead guilty despite his denial of the offence in order, for example, to obtain some advantage for himself then the focus of the proceedings might be different. Simply because a defendant is induced to plead guilty because of legal advice given to him, it does not follow that he should be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty even if others might disagree with the advice. This is because there will be no miscarriage of justice arising. The issue in such a case might focus on whether the plea of guilty was entered in the exercise of a free choice in the defendant’s own interests. Of course the fact that a person is induced into taking a course of action does not mean the person in acting on that inducement is not acting from a free choice. It is not every threat, inducement or pressure applied to a defendant that either requires or justifies a court in permitting the defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty: Sewell above at [34]. 

37    But if the plaintiff by taking the advice proffered to him, entered the plea of guilty as a result of the exercise of a free choice in what he believed to be his best interests at the time, and if, when he entered the plea, he understood that he was admitting his guilt of the offence to the court, it does not follow that a miscarriage of justice would arise by refusing the application simply because he maintains his innocence of the charge and has always done so, or because he now regrets taking the advice. As Dawson J stated in Meissner in the passage quoted above, a miscarriage of justice will normally only arise in that situation where the defendant did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it.”


	
	These passages from Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions were cited by this Court in Kennedy v R [2016] NSWCCA 114 at [56].
	
	
	The Applicant relies substantially on the decision of this Court in R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97; 122 A Crim R 310. Wood CJ at CL (Giles JA and Simpson J agreeing) referred to a number of authorities applicable to the factual circumstances of that case, and said at 314-315 [20]:
	


“The principles established by these decisions are now settled. As a consequence, the present appeal hinges upon three considerations: 

a)    whether the advice given to the appellant was or was not imprudent and inappropriate; 

b)    whether his plea was or was not attributable to a consciousness of guilt; and 

c)    whether the material before this court shows that there is or is not a real question about his guilt.”

Submissions of the Parties


	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that the material relied upon pointed to the Applicant having been given imprudent and inappropriate legal advice in connection with his decision whether to plead guilty to the offence. It was submitted that the effect of the advice was to procure the Applicant’s plea of guilty with an expectation that the sentence to be imposed for the offence would lie within an unrealistic range. The submission continued that the effect of the advice given to the Applicant was to impose inappropriate pressure on him in determining his plea. As a result, it was submitted that the Applicant was induced to plead guilty, irrespective of his guilt of the offence, and thus his plea was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was a real question about the guilt of the Applicant for the offence to which he pleaded guilty.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence disclosed that the Applicant chose to plead guilty, hoping to get a substantial discount on sentence (which he did) and a good result (which he believed he did not). It was submitted that there is no evidence that the Applicant was overborne, tricked, pressured or coerced by his lawyers to plead guilty. The Crown submitted that a failure to ultimately get the sentence which an offender hoped for, after pleading guilty, cannot amount to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Applicant’s account as to the length of sentence he was told that he may receive had an air of incredibility about it. This was a very serious offence under s.112(3) Crimes Act 1900 for which a substantial sentence was to be expected, even after a significant discount for the Applicant’s assistance to authorities. This was especially so as the Applicant was on parole for a robbery offence at the time of the commission of the present offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was the Applicant who approached the police seeking to offer assistance to the authorities and that this context supported the wish of the Applicant to plead guilty to this offence so as to obtain assistance on sentence arising from his co-operation.
	


Decision


	
	At the outset, it should be said that the legal representation of the Applicant in the District Court was far than ideal. The counsel and solicitor who appeared for him in that Court gave evidence which contained a number of internal inconsistencies, as well as inconsistencies between their own separate accounts.
	
	
	For the purpose of determining the conviction ground, it is not necessary to resolve every factual dispute arising from the evidence of the Applicant and his former counsel and solicitor. I will move to a number of findings of fact reached after considering the entirety of the evidence.
	
	
	On 25 July 2013, the Applicant provided written instructions to his legal representatives in which he stated that he understood he was charged with specially aggravated break and enter with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. He instructed his legal representatives to plead not guilty on his behalf and understood that the matter would proceed to a District Court trial.
	
	
	On 13 February 2014, the Applicant provided written instructions concerning the events giving rise to the charge. In those instructions, he said that prior to attending the house he had consumed a number of Xanax tablets and a quantity of vodka cruisers. He said that he had gone to the premises and knocked on the door. He said that the female victim came to the door and, as he spoke to her, the male victim attacked her and the Applicant then attacked him. He said that he picked up a hammer and, in the course of pushing the female victim inside, he broke the door. He admitted that he struck the male victim a number of times with the hammer. The Applicant said that he had caused damage to the door and would plead guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to the male victim. However, he said that there was no break and enter. He said that he was given a bag which the police later found at his place.
	
	
	When the matter came before the District Court, the Applicant pleaded not guilty to the charge under s.112(3) Crimes Act 1900 and a trial date was fixed for 12 May 2014.
	
	
	As noted earlier, the matter was listed, together with many others, at the special sittings at a country District Court before the Chief Judge of the District Court in early April 2014.
	
	
	By this time, the Applicant had approached police and was providing significant assistance to the New South Wales Crime Commission. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to outline the nature of that assistance. It is sufficient to observe that the sentencing Judge characterised the assistance as being “of the highest order” (see [24] above).
	
	
	Under cross-examination in this Court, the Applicant was asked (T7.23-43, 10 February 2016):
	


“Q. I want to ask you some questions about when you first started speaking to New South Wales Police or the Crime Commission about providing assistance. Can you remember how long that was before you actually entered this plea of guilty that you started giving assistance?

A. Probably about six months, something like that. Assist - yes, my memory is not very - but probably about six months after.

Q. And you made quite a large number of statements to New South Wales Police and the Crime Commission about a range of matters, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. When you started providing that assistance to the New South Wales Police and the Crime Commission, did you think that you would now plead guilty to these matters because you thought that you were going to get a discount on sentence and you thought that prior to meeting your barrister, Mr Kumarasinhe, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. So before meeting your barrister, you were already starting to think that you would plead guilty to these offences, is that right?

A. That’s right, yes.”


	
	I accept that the discussions which the Applicant had with his legal representatives concerned the prospect of pleading guilty to the s.112(3) offence. The Crown was not prepared to accept a plea of guilty to a lesser offence.
	
	
	The evidence concerning the discussions which took place is unsatisfactory, confusing and contradictory. However, I am satisfied that the Applicant and his counsel discussed possible sentences which may be imposed if he pleaded guilty to the s.112(3) charge. The Applicant was told (correctly) that he would receive a significant discount for his assistance to authorities with a further discount for a plea of guilty. I am satisfied that the discussion descended to the possible duration of a sentence. It should be kept in mind that the s.112(3) offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years.
	
	
	Under cross-examination, the Applicant was asked (T8.39-9.28, 10 February 2016):
	


“Q. I just want to ask you about your own thought process. It’s not uncommon, I imagine, for you when you’re charged with an offence to think about what sentence you might get. Did you think about that in this particular matter when you were charged, about what sentence you might get prior to speaking to Mr Kumarasinhe?

A. Yeah, I thought I’d probably get about eight years, eight or nine, yeah.

Q. You obviously appreciated that you were on parole at the time you committed this offence and you were certainly sentenced to a total sentence of about six years, nine months?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that why you thought, I’d get a bit more, I could get about eight years?

A. Yeah, that’s what I thought I’d do, that’s right.

Q. I’m interested then when you say that Mr Kumarasinhe said that you could get 18 months or two years whether you, yourself wondered, well that doesn’t sound right because I was thinking of eight years?

A. Yeah, that’s with the 50% off. I was thinking then if - that he was right, you know, with the 50% off the eight years I was thinking well I would, I probably would get out.

Q. Is it the case that if you’d got 18 months or two years sentence that you would have had no problem with pleading guilty?

A. Yeah.

Q. So really today your problem is that you’re not happy with the sentence you’ve received, it doesn’t concern you pleading guilty if you’d actually got a sentence that you would have been happy with, is that right?

A. Yeah, but in this - yeah, that’s one of them, yeah. Plus the circumstances behind what happened that night, it’s just not - yeah, everything doesn’t add up to what I believe happened. I’ve got a bad memory for what happened that night, I took a lot of pills but--.

Q. I’m just wondering [MM], whether it was actually the thought of the sentence that you were going to get or whether one of the reasons you’re pleading guilty is because you made this decision to assist the authorities and this was part of assisting the authorities that you’d also plead guilty and be sentenced to this matter. Am I wrong or right about that?

A. Yes, that’s right. That’s right.”


	
	I accept that the Applicant may have been informed by his counsel that a sentence in the order of eight years may have been imposed, but that counsel added as a rider that it remained a matter for the sentencing Judge. However, I do not accept that such a period was said to represent the possible undiscounted head sentence.
	
	
	I am not persuaded, given the maximum penalty, standard non-parole period, the very serious circumstances of the s.112(3) offence itself and the Applicant’s prior criminal history, that the Applicant’s counsel suggested that a non-parole period as low as 18 months or two years was possible. Even allowing for the unsatisfactory aspects of the Applicant’s legal representation, a period of this type would be fanciful to any experienced criminal lawyer as a potential sentencing outcome in this case. This was recognised by senior counsel for the Applicant before this Court (T58.4-9, 10 February 2016):
	


“RS HULME AJ: The inherent probabilities argue very strongly against him receiving advice of 18 months to two years.

GARTELMANN: It’s conceded that any such advice would have been fantastic. Therefore it makes it harder to think even the most ignorant or stupid counsel would have given it.”


	
	On 10 April 2014, the Applicant gave written instructions to his legal representatives to enter a plea of guilty to the charge of specially aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely inflicting grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	On that day, the Applicant appeared before the Chief Judge and, having heard the s.112(3) charge read out to him in open court, he pleaded guilty to the charge. It may be noted that the terms of the charge to which he pleaded guilty were expressed in greater detail than the summary form utilised in the instructions. I am satisfied, however, that the Applicant was aware of the elements of the charge to which he pleaded guilty, including the break and enter component as to which he had earlier indicated a denial.
	
	
	It should be observed, at this point, that the Applicant had disputed parts only of the allegation brought against him in instructions which he had given at an earlier time. This was never a case where the Applicant denied that he had been present at all at the scene of the crime. The areas of apparent controversy concerned matters of detail as to what occurred, although he admitted that he had attacked the male victim with a hammer in the severe fashion outlined. It should also be noted that the Applicant stated that he had consumed both a powerful restricted substance and a significant quantity of alcohol before attending the premises.
	
	
	The sentencing proceedings were adjourned from 10 April 2014 to 15 May 2014 at the Downing Centre in Sydney. During the course of the sentencing hearing, the sentencing Judge expressed his provisional view as to the appropriate sentence to be applied before factoring in the significant discount to which the Applicant was entitled for his assistance to authorities together with a 15% discount for the plea of guilty (T3, 15 May 2014 - AB52). Submissions were made on the question of sentence by the Crown and counsel for the Applicant and his Honour proceeded to pass sentence as indicated earlier in this judgment.
	
	
	I accept that the Applicant expressed dissatisfaction at the sentencing outcome in the course of a discussion which he had with his legal representatives in the cells later on 15 May 2014. This reflected his hope or belief that a lesser sentence should have been passed upon him in all the circumstances. I accept that the discussions which had taken place between the Applicant and his legal representatives at earlier times had contributed to this hope or belief on his part. That said, I accept as well that the Applicant was told that the sentence to be imposed would be a matter for the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Applicant well understood the charge to which he was pleading guilty in open court on 10 April 2014 and the elements of that charge. At an earlier time, the Applicant had given instructions to contest that charge, with those instructions being directed to some, but not all, of the elements of that charge.
	
	
	The focus of the Applicant’s interest was his desire to rely upon his assistance to authorities as a very substantial factor operating in his favour on sentence. In truth, it may be said that there was little else operating in his favour on sentence. He had a very poor criminal history and the present offence had been committed whilst on parole.
	
	
	The Applicant bears the onus of establishing a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting leave to withdraw the plea: R v Thalari at 312 [33]-[34].
	
	
	The Applicant pleaded guilty to the s.112(3) charge in open court, knowing the elements of the offence. The plea of guilty is a cogent admission of the elements of the offence: R v Thalari at 312-313 [34].
	
	
	The Applicant saw it as being in his interest to plead guilty to obtain the benefit of a reduced sentence. He was not subjected to force or pressure by his legal representatives. Keeping in mind the principles in Maxwell v The Queen, Meissner v The Queen and R v KCH, the Applicant made a free and voluntary decision to plead guilty to the s.112(3) charge.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the principles in R v Wilkes, when applied to this case, result in a conclusion favourable to the Applicant. It is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that each of the three principles in R v Wilkes applies in this case.
	
	
	The Applicant understood the elements of the offence to which he ultimately pleaded guilty. He had admitted some, but not all, of those elements in the past in instructions. He admitted, as well, that he had used significant quantities of a drug and alcohol prior to the events giving rise to the charge. It was his desire to rely upon his assistance to authorities and his plea of guilty on sentence.
	
	
	It has not been demonstrated that the Applicant’s plea was not attributable to a consciousness of guilt. Nor has it been shown that there is a real question about his guilt. I do not consider that the features relied upon, by reference to the statements of the male and female victims attached to Mr Dowe’s affidavit of 14 January 2016, are of any real assistance to the Applicant.
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated that his decision to plead guilty to the s.112(3) offence was the product of any undue or improper pressure. He freely and voluntarily made a decision to plead guilty because he thought that this would result in him receiving a reduced sentence by application of the discount for his assistance to authorities and his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The fact that the sentence passed was greater than he hoped or believed may be imposed does not give rise to a miscarriage of justice of the type which must be demonstrated, before this Court, will quash a conviction following a plea of guilty at first instance.
	
	
	Although I would grant the Applicant leave to appeal against conviction, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	


Sentence Ground 1 - The Admission of the Statement of Facts on Sentence Occasioned a Miscarriage of Justice

Submissions of the Parties


	
	Mr Gartelmann SC, for the Applicant, submitted that the Court should find that the Applicant had not read, or had read to him, the statement of facts tendered at the sentencing hearing. It was submitted that this failure gave rise to a miscarriage of justice, relying upon the decision of this Court in Loury v R [2010] NSWCCA 158.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the statement of facts was settled between counsel for the Applicant and the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions who appeared at the sentencing hearing. The fact that the statement of facts was not signed on behalf of the Applicant did not constitute a difficulty in its tender and use at the sentencing hearing. The statement of facts was tendered without objection at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the statement of facts constituted an unremarkable summary of the evidence of the offence. It was submitted that the statement of facts expanded upon each of the elements of the offence itself to which the Applicant had pleaded guilty. The Crown submitted that no miscarriage of justice had been established in accordance with this ground.
	


Decision


	
	I have rejected the Applicant’s conviction ground. The Applicant was aware of the elements of the offence to which he pleaded guilty in open court. The statement of facts provided a more detailed account of the offence by reference to the particular elements themselves. The Applicant was aware of the nature of the allegations made against him in support of each element.
	
	
	It is the case that the statement of facts made provision for signature on behalf of the Crown and the Applicant. This is a common procedure in preparation of a statement of facts for a sentencing hearing. The statement of facts here was signed only by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions for the Crown. No person signed on behalf of the Applicant. The circumstances of this case illustrate the practical importance of adoption of the statement of facts by signature on behalf of each party. However, the present ground of appeal does not turn upon that consideration.
	
	
	The Applicant was aware that the offence to which he pleaded guilty contained a number of elements:
	



	
	break and enter a dwelling house - he was aware that the Crown case was that he had smashed a hammer through the glass panel on the door and entered the house - this is what the statement of facts asserted;
	
	
	commit a serious indictable offence, larceny of a handbag containing money and personal items - the statement of facts alleged that he took the handbag which contained $600.00 in cash and a camera - the Applicant was aware of this allegation;
	
	
	in circumstances of aggravation, being armed with an offensive weapon, a hammer - the Applicant was aware that this was the Crown allegation;
	
	
	in circumstances of special aggravation, inflicting grievous bodily harm upon the male victim - the Applicant was aware of this allegation and admitted that he had used the hammer to inflict grievous bodily harm in this way.
	



	
	The circumstances of Loury v R are, in my view, distinguishable. That case involved a successful appeal against conviction where several factors were found to have contributed to a miscarriage of justice. The difficulties concerning the statement of facts in Loury v R were but one factor and are different to the present case.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, including the Applicant’s admission of the elements of the offence by his plea, I am not persuaded that the admission of the statement of facts occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	I would reject the first ground of appeal on sentence.
	


Sentence Ground 1(b) - The Failure to Adduce Evidence of the Applicant’s Mental Condition Caused a Miscarriage of Justice

Submissions of Parties


	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that the Court should find that the Applicant instructed his legal representatives that he had a psychiatric history, and that a report should be obtained for the purpose of the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	In support of this ground of appeal, the Applicant relied upon an affidavit of Bryan Dowe, affirmed 18 November 2015, which annexes a copy of a report dated 23 October 2015 of Dr Gerald Chew, forensic psychiatrist. The Applicant sought to rely upon this report to demonstrate that evidence concerning his mental condition ought to have been obtained, and that the failure to do so caused a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that psychiatric evidence of the type contained in Dr Chew’s report would have provided little assistance to the Applicant on sentence. It was submitted that no miscarriage of justice had resulted from the absence of psychiatric evidence.
	


Decision


	
	The evidence in this Court of the former legal representatives on this issue is, once again, unsatisfactory and confusing. I accept that there was some discussion between the Applicant and his legal representatives concerning a possible report being obtained. It was not the case that the sentencing hearing was to proceed to finality at the country court on 10 April 2014. It was to be adjourned to Sydney on 15 May 2014, so an opportunity existed for this aspect to be further explored.
	
	
	This Court has expressed resistance to efforts being made to rely upon a psychiatric report before this Court, when that material was not placed before the sentencing Court. The Court has accepted, however, that circumstances may exist which give rise to a miscarriage of justice in this context.
	
	
	The Court has emphasised that caution must be exercised in the admission of evidence of this type before this Court, with regard to be had, amongst other things, to the potential significance of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance: Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at 531 [121]. The decision of the High Court of Australia in Betts v The Queen [2016] HCA 25; 90 ALJR 758 has emphasised the restrictions upon this Court’s appellate function when psychiatric evidence, not tendered in the sentencing court, is sought to be placed before this Court.
	
	
	Dr Chew conducted a psychiatric assessment of the Applicant on 18 October 2015. He had not seen the Applicant before then. He had been provided with copies of Justice Health medical records concerning the Applicant for the period 2005 to 2013.
	
	
	Dr Chew noted that the Justice Health records disclosed a debate as to whether the Applicant had a primary psychotic disorder or not. A report in October 2008 from a Dr Elliott indicated that the Applicant did not have a primary psychotic disorder. In March 2011, Dr Bench, a psychiatrist, considered the Applicant’s history was more consistent with drug-induced psychosis than schizophrenia.
	
	
	Dr Chew concluded that the Applicant presented with a complex set of psychiatric symptomatology. Dr Chew diagnosed drug-induced psychosis, currently in remission in a controlled environment free from drugs. In addition, Dr Chew stated that the Applicant presented with a number of depressive and anxiety symptoms which were best encapsulated by the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder relating to childhood trauma.
	
	
	Dr Chew expressed the opinion that the Applicant’s mental state at the time of the offence may have contributed to his behaviour. From the history provided, the Applicant was suffering from increased paranoia related to amphetamine use and was also intoxicated with benzodiazepines. His increased paranoia caused him to travel to the country town where the offence occurred and the combination of this, and his intoxication, would have affected his judgment.
	
	
	The fundamental difficulty for the Applicant in this case is that evidence along the lines of that contained in Dr Chew’s report would have had little role to play on sentence. By the time of this offence, the Applicant had a criminal history for serious crimes of violence and dishonesty. His abuse of drugs was known to, and taken into account by, the sentencing Judge, including the role of drug abuse in the commission of the offence itself. The report of Dr Chew adds little to this picture.
	
	
	It is well recognised that the commission of serious offences whilst under the influence of drugs or alcohol, by way of self-induced intoxication, provides no assistance to an offender by way of mitigation: s.21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Even before the commencement of that provision, courts around Australia had consistently rejected the proposition that intoxication can mitigate the seriousness of an offence or reduce an offender’s culpability: R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120; 243 A Crim R 31 at 59 [220].
	
	
	The Applicant’s drug addiction would not assist him in mitigation of penalty: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at 385 [197], 386 [206], 391 [236], 397-398 [273].
	
	
	In my view, the report of Dr Chew would have provided no real assistance to the Applicant on sentence. There was no realistic basis upon which the Applicant could have called in aid, in a manner which was favourable to him, the well-known principles in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177].
	
	
	The fact that the Applicant was a drug user and that this had contributed to the offence was noted by the sentencing Judge. Given the Applicant’s history, there was no reasonable basis for a positive view as to his prospects of rehabilitation, apart from what flowed from his assistance to authorities. The sentencing Judge made favourable findings to the Applicant by reference to this feature of the case (see [25] above).
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated that the failure to adduce evidence on sentence of the Applicant’s mental condition caused a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	I would reject sentence Ground 1(b).
	


Sentence Ground 2 - the Sentence is Unreasonable or Plainly Unjust

The Applicant’s Submissions 


	
	Whilst acknowledging the seriousness of the offence in this case, Mr Gartelmann SC submitted that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust. He submitted that the starting point adopted by the sentencing Judge of a head sentence of 14 or 15 years did not accord with the level of seriousness of the offence itself.
	
	
	It was submitted that the finding that the offence was “extremely serious” was not warranted. In this respect, the Applicant submitted that in assessing the seriousness of a s.112(3) offence, the nature of the “serious indictable offence” involved is a relevant consideration: R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 at [27]; Maxwell v R [2007] NSWCCA 304 at [28]; Kelly v R [2007] NSWCCA 357 at [19]. Here, the serious indictable offence was larceny, which carried a maximum penalty of five years, thereby lying at the bottom level of the five-year threshold for a “serious indictable offence” under s.4 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	By reference to the circumstances of aggravation in s.105A Crimes Act 1900, it was submitted that the Applicant was armed with an offensive weapon and entered the premises knowing persons were present, but that no further additional circumstances were involved, with the use of corporal violence being inherent in the circumstances of special aggravation relied upon.
	
	
	Having regard to the range of conduct potentially constituting s.112(3) offences, it was submitted that the presumed nominal starting point for the sentence was excessive. It was submitted further that the resultant sentence was excessive when all the circumstances of the case are taken into account, including the utilitarian value of the plea and, in particular, the assistance to authorities which was of “the highest order”.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Applicant took the Court to a number of other sentencing decisions for s.112(3) offences. These were R v Chaaban [2006] NSWCCA 107; Milane v R [2006] NSWCCA 281; R v Baghadi [2008] NSWCCA 239; R v Van Rysewyk [2008] NSWCCA 130; Micklesson v R [2009] NSWCCA 61; R v Cheh [2009] NSWCCA 134; R v Dole; R v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 101; Srikantharajah v R [2012] NSWCCA 209; Aslett v R [2012] NSWCCA 235; Sheen v R [2012] NSWCCA 259; 215 A Crim R 208; R v GD [2013] NSWCCA 212; O’Grady v R [2013] NSWCCA 281; R v Little [2013] NSWCCA 288; Ngati v R [2013] NSWCCA 307; R v Robinson [2014] NSWCCA 12; Wootton v R [2014] NSWCCA 86; R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102; McDonald v R [2014] NSWCCA 127; R v Booth [2014] NSWCCA 156; Bungie v R [2015] NSWCCA 9 and De Jong v R [2015] NSWCCA 32.
	
	
	Although he acknowledged that the sentencing pattern disclosed by these cases could not be equated with the available sentencing range, counsel submitted that these cases may properly inform the Court’s assessment of the sentence imposed in the Applicant’s case: Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 253 CLR 58 at 71 [28], 74 [41].
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that this was a very serious example of a s.112(3) offence. It was submitted that this Court has stressed that home invasion offences will be treated seriously as they represent a breach of the right of every person to feel safe in his or her own home: Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [22].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the fact that the serious indictable offence pleaded was larceny did not undermine the characterisation of the objective seriousness of this offence as being “extremely serious”. It was submitted that the objective seriousness of a s.112(3) offence is determined by reference to all the circumstances of the offending, and the fact that the relevant indictable offence is larceny does not necessarily reduce the objective seriousness of the offence: R v Huynh at [27], [29].
	
	
	It was submitted that very serious violence was inflicted during the course of the offence, which was committed whilst the Applicant was on parole for an offence of robbery in company.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the circumstance of special aggravation that was pleaded was the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm. The offence involved the violent entry to the home of the two victims at night. Although the female victim was not physically harmed during the commission of the offence, she was confronted by the Applicant who told her that he was armed with a gun. The attack on the male victim was extremely violent.
	
	
	With respect to the cases relied upon by the Applicant, the Crown submitted that they did not demonstrate a range, nor did they fix an upper limit of sentence inhibiting the exercise of the sentencing discretion: Spark v R [2012] NSWCCA 140 at [50].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed was not unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


Decision


	
	This Court has observed that a very diverse range of offending may be accommodated within the terms of an aggravated offence under s.112(2), or a specially aggravated offence under s.112(3) Crimes Act 1900: Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [35].
	
	
	It is useful to set out the terms of s.112:
	


“112 Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence

(1)    A person who:

(a)    breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or

(b)    being in any dwelling-house or other building commits any serious indictable offence therein and breaks out of the dwelling-house or other building,

is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for 14 years.

(2)    Aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.

(3)    Specially aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (2) in circumstances of special aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.”


	
	It is also helpful to consider the terms of s.105A which defines “circumstances of aggravation” and “circumstances of special aggravation”. Section 105A provides:
	


“105A     Definitions

(1)    In sections 106–115A:

building includes any place of Divine worship.

circumstances of aggravation means circumstances involving any one or more of the following:

(a)    the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument,

(b)    the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons,

(c)    the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person,

(d)    the alleged offender intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on any person,

(e)    the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty,

(f)    the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed.

circumstances of special aggravation means circumstances involving any or all of the following:

(a)    the alleged offender intentionally wounds or intentionally inflicts grievous bodily harm on any person,

(b)    the alleged offender inflicts grievous bodily harm on any person and is reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to that or any other person,

(c)    the alleged offender is armed with a dangerous weapon.

(2)    The matters referred to in:

(a)    paragraph (c), (d) or (e) of the definition of circumstances of aggravation, or

(b)    paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition of circumstances of special aggravation,

can occur immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after any of the elements of the offence concerned occurred.

(2A)    For the purposes of paragraph (f) of the definition of circumstances of aggravation, if there was a person, or there were persons, in the place in relation to which an offence is alleged to have been committed at the time it was committed, the defendant is presumed to have known that fact unless the defendant satisfies the court that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that there was no one in the place.

(3)    The definitions in subsection (1) are not mutually exclusive.”


	
	Section 105A(3) makes clear that the definitions of “circumstances of aggravation” and “circumstances of special aggravation”  contained in s.105A(1) are not mutually exclusive.
	
	
	The Crown is entitled to rely on circumstances of aggravation (or special aggravation) other than those charged in the indictment: Marshall v R at [10]; Rossi-Murray v R [2009] NSWCCA 177 at [52].
	
	
	It is correct that a sentencing court should keep in mind the nature of the “serious indictable offence” involved in a s.112(3) offence. That element, of course, forms part of the basic s.112(1) offence. Although remaining a relevant factor on sentence, by the time one gets to a “specially aggravated offence” under s.112(3) of the Act, other features of the offence are bound to assume greater importance on sentence.
	
	
	In this case, several “circumstances of aggravation” existed:
	



	
	the Applicant was armed with an offensive weapon, a hammer;
	
	
	the Applicant knew that there were persons in the place where the offence was committed;
	
	
	the Applicant used corporal violence against the male victim - this is an aggravating circumstance distinct from the fact that grievous bodily harm was caused to the victim: Maxwell v R at [13].
	



	
	In addition to these circumstances of aggravation, the Applicant intentionally inflicted grievous bodily harm on the male victim so as to render the offence one of special aggravation.
	
	
	In determining the objective seriousness of a s.112(2) or s.112(3) offence, the sentencing court should have regard to the nature of the offences committed in the premises, the type of premises entered, the nature and value of property taken, damage to any property and the time of day when the offence occurred. The number of aggravating factors present, and the severity of them individually, and in combination, will also be relevant matters: Marshall v R at [37]-[39]; Maxwell v R at [26].
	
	
	The maximum penalty (25 years’ imprisonment) and standard non-parole period (seven years) for a s.112(3) offence are not formalities, but represent important yardsticks or guideposts created by the legislature for sentencing courts: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 372 [30]-[31]; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27], 133 [31]; Magaming v The Queen [2013] HCA 40; 252 CLR 381 at 396 [48].
	
	
	Section 112(3) constitutes a further example where the legislature has prescribed a maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years. The temporal gap between these two statutory guideposts has been discussed in the context of other offences. In Duncombe v R [2013] NSWCCA 271, with the concurrence of Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J, I said at [49]-[53]:
	


“49   In the case of offences under s.33 Crimes Act 1900, this Court has noted the wide gap between these two guideposts: R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [36]-[38]; Anderson v R [2008] NSWCCA 211 at [17]; R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [19]; Sproates v R [2009] NSWCCA 29 at [43]. 

50   In the context of the offence of possess pistol contrary to s.7 Firearms Act 1996, it has been said that a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of three years constitute ‘two irreconcilable standards’: R v Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32 at [38]; Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [84]-[85].

51   A similar comment was made concerning a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of four years, for car rebirthing contrary to s.154G Crimes Act 1900, where it was said that it was ‘difficult to reconcile’ these two periods: R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189 at [54]-[56].

52   A similar observation may be made concerning the respective periods of 25 and seven years for a s.33(1)(b) offence such as in this case. Concentration upon the standard non-parole period may serve to distract from the maximum sentence, in a manner which may operate in an unduly favourable fashion to an offender. The sentencing Judge in this case was alive to this consideration … .

53   Despite that wide gap, it is, of course, necessary for a sentencing court to have regard, and give appropriate weight, to both periods. Undue focus on the standard non-parole period may serve to distract from the proper role of the maximum penalty on sentence.” 


	
	Howie J addressed this topic in Maxwell v R, at [26], with respect to s.112(2) offences:
	


“The problem of applying the standard non-parole provisions in relation to a s 112(2) offence has been recognised by this Court: see Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24. The difficulty is derived firstly from the fact that the standard non-parole period specified is 5 years imprisonment as against a maximum sentence of 20 years and, secondly, by the breadth of the range of offences that may fall within the scope of the section. One of the relevant matters referred to in Marshall for determining where the objective seriousness of the offence lies is the number of aggravating features present.”


	
	The maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment indicates the seriousness with which an offence under s.112(3) is regarded. The offence carries the highest maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature short of life imprisonment: AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203; 225 A Crim R 481 at 489 [67].
	
	
	Where the special aggravating circumstance is the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm, it should be kept in mind that this is the mental element for murder if the victim died: AM v R at 489 [68]. This aspect serves to emphasise the gravity of s.112(3) offences of this type.
	
	
	It may be said that the setting of the seven-year standard non-parole period is intended to allow for the wide range of circumstances which may give rise to a s.112(3) offence. It remains important, however, that undue attention is not directed to the standard non-parole period with the risk of distracting proper attention being given to the maximum penalty. Both periods are important statutory guideposts.
	
	
	The combination of factors in this case may be characterised appropriately as an “extremely serious” s.112(3) offence.
	
	
	The Applicant attended the victims’ premises in the early hours of the morning. He told the female victim he was armed and wanted to buy drugs. She refused him entry and he smashed a hammer through the glass panel of the door and entered the house.
	
	
	The Applicant attacked the male victim to the head with the hammer. He struck the victim twice, and continued to strike him to the head another five times after he had fallen to the floor and was lying on the ground. The ferocity of this attack itself, and the serious injuries which were caused, represent a very important feature of the offence on sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant took the female victim’s handbag which contained cash and a camera. Although this aspect of the offence may be regarded as unremarkable, it would be wrong to focus on this aspect rather than considering the entire terrifying event, which included a sustained and ferocious hammer attack to the head of a man lying on the ground inside the house.
	
	
	The Applicant was on parole at the time of the offence and had a history of serious offences of violence. He was not a young offender. There was nothing available to the Applicant by way of mitigation, apart from the circumstances brought about by his assistance to authorities and his decision to plead guilty to the offence.
	
	
	I do not consider that the circumstances of the offences in the other cases relied upon for the Applicant (at [106] above) assist him to demonstrate that the sentence imposed in this case was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	There are features of these cases which serve to distinguish them from the present case. Only four of them concerned a circumstance of special aggravation involving infliction of grievous bodily harm. What the cases illustrate is the relatively wide range of circumstances in which s.112(3) offences can occur.
	
	
	The cases do not demonstrate a range of penalty, nor do they fix an upper limit of sentence inhibiting the exercise of the sentencing discretion: Spark v R at [50]. The cases serve to demonstrate that the Applicant received a substantial sentence, but not one which may be characterised as unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	The most experienced sentencing Judge in this case paid close attention to the circumstances of the offence itself, the Applicant’s poor criminal history, his history of drug abuse, the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole and the statutory guideposts constituted by the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period. In addition, his Honour had close regard to the factors operating in the Applicant’s favour by way of his assistance to authorities and his plea of guilty. The consequential positive aspects flowing from these steps, by way of contrition and improved prospects of rehabilitation, also operated in favour of the Applicant.
	
	
	It is true that the starting point adopted by the sentencing Judge was a substantial one. However, this was an extremely serious s.112(3) offence committed by an offender on conditional liberty with a history of committing serious crimes. I am not persuaded that consideration of the starting point adopted by the sentencing Judge supports a conclusion that the ultimate penalty imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to s.23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in reducing the sentence for assistance to authorities. In considering the present claim for manifest excess, it is necessary to keep in mind, as well, as a final and critical consideration, that a lesser penalty that is imposed under s.23 in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: s.23(3); Hutchinson v R [2014] NSWCCA 317 at [34].
	
	
	It has not been demonstrated that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was manifestly excessive. The sentence imposed was not unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	I would reject the second ground of appeal on sentence.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having regard to the grounds advanced for the Applicant, I would grant leave to appeal against conviction and sentence, but would dismiss the appeals.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	grant the Applicant an extension of time to 30 October 2015 to apply for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence;
	
	
	grant leave to the Applicant to appeal against conviction;
	
	
	conviction appeal dismissed;
	
	
	grant leave to the Applicant to rely upon Ground 1(b) on sentence;
	
	
	grant leave to the Applicant to appeal against sentence;
	
	
	sentence appeal dismissed.
	



	
	R S HULME AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Johnson J in this matter. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and generally with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	Four grounds are advanced in support of the claim that the Applicant’s conviction amounted to a miscarriage of justice. One was that he is not guilty, a second seems to be that he did not appreciate material parts of the sentencing proceedings and when he tried to say something he could not, a third was that his lawyers did not communicate to him the contents of the Statement of Facts relied on by the Crown, a fourth was that his plea of guilty was attributable to his being wrongly advised as to the likely sentence he would receive.
	
	
	There is no evidence which comes close to being persuasive of the first ground, even if one puts aside the Applicant’s plea. The same may be said of the second. What the Applicant wanted to say was not made apparent, nor is it clear on which of two separate days during which the matter was dealt with was it that the Applicant said he was prevented from talking. On the first of these days he pleaded guilty and on the second there were many separate occasions when one or other of the counsel and the judge spoke and there is nothing in the transcript to suggest the Applicant sought to interrupt or wanted to speak.
	
	
	His counsel and solicitor gave evidence contradicting the third and there is nothing in any of the evidence to provide a basis for preferring the evidence of the Applicant on the topic.
	
	
	According to the Applicant’s evidence in this Court, when originally charged he thought he would be sentenced to imprisonment for something of the order of eight or nine years. He was on parole at the time of the incident alleged and his previous sentence – for an offence of robbery in company – was for a period of six years and nine months. Previously he had been convicted of numerous offences of dishonesty and served at least seven sentences of imprisonment.
	
	
	Prior to pleading guilty to the offence with which this Court is concerned, the Applicant’s solicitor visited him in custody on a number of occasions. On one such occasion in 2013, aware that he was charged with aggravated break and enter, the Applicant informed his solicitor that he was not guilty of the charge because he had been invited into the victim’s home and did no “breaking” because he neither opened any door not smashed any window.
	
	
	Some support for this account is provided by two documents handwritten by the Applicant’s solicitor. The first, dated 25 July 2003 includes the following:-
	


I, …, understand that I am charged with specially aggravated Break and Enter with intent to inflict Grievous Bodily Harm.

I instruct my solicitor to plead NOT GUILTY on my behalf.


	
	The second, dated 13 February 2014, after recounting what the Applicant said occurred, includes the following:-
	


   I will plead guilty to recklessly causing GBH

   There was no B & E.


	
	At some stage the Applicant began to assist the authorities and commenced thinking of pleading guilty. After this he was visited by counsel who, according to the Applicant, said, “Just plead guilty, you’ll get 50% off” and “You’ll do 12 to 18 months” and on a later visit said, “You’ll do no more than two years”.
	
	
	On the morning of 10 April 2014, the first day of the sentencing proceedings, the Applicant’s solicitor prepared a third document which reads:-
	


I, …, instruct my legal advisers to enter a plea of guilty to the charge of Special Aggravated B & E commit serious indictable offence namely inflicting GBH on 7 March 2014. (sic)


	
	The Applicant has reading and writing difficulties and although all three documents are in the handwriting of the Applicant’s solicitor, they all bear the Applicant’s signature which, according to the solicitor was affixed after the documents were read to the Applicant.
	
	
	Later on 10 April 2014 the Applicant was arraigned on, and pleaded guilty to, the charge (aspects have been deleted as they may serve to identify the Applicant):-
	


For that he on 7 March 2013 at [XXX] in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of [XXX] at [XXX], and did commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny of a handbag containing money and personal items, the property of [XXX], in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was armed with an offensive weapon, namely a hammer and in circumstances of special aggravation, namely he did inflict grievous bodily harm on [XXX].


	
	It is an inevitable inference from the three letters of instructions that the issue of whether the Applicant’s offence involved breaking and entering was the subject of discussion between him and his legal advisers and serious consideration to the issue of breaking and entering was given by the Applicant. In light of this the balance of probabilities is heavily in favour of the conclusion that when the Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that included the words “did break and enter” he did so, conscious of these words.
	
	
	Given the Applicant’s record, the fact that the offence charged against him carried a maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of seven years, and the extent of injury to the male victim, the probabilities are also strongly against anyone giving the Applicant the advice he says he received to the effect that his sentence would not exceed two years.
	
	
	As the judgment of Johnson J makes clear the onus is on the Applicant to show that a miscarriage of justice will occur if he is not allowed to withdraw his plea. The matters to which I have referred, satisfy me that the Applicant has not discharged that onus.

2791044,R v Hamzy [2016] NSWSC 1512,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mohammed Hamzy (""the offender"") was arraigned on 21 June 2016 and pleaded not guilty to the following counts in the indictment:
	


1.   Wound Alex Ali with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on 8 October 2012 at Yagoona.

2.   Murder Yeyha Amood on 14 October 2012 at Greenacre.

3.   Wound ""Mr C"" with intent to murder ""Mr C"" on 14 October 2012 at Greenacre.

4.   In the alternative to Count 3, wound ""Mr C"" with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on 14 October 2012 at Greenacre.


	
	On 8 July 2016 the jury returned verdicts by which they acquitted the offender in respect of Count 1. He was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter (by excessive self-defence) in respect of Count 2. He was acquitted of Count 3 but found guilty of Count 4.
	
	
	The crime of manslaughter (ss 18 and 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) is one that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. That is also the maximum penalty for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act), which also has a standard non-parole period of 7 years. These are the statutory guideposts that I must bear in mind when assessing the appropriate sentences to be imposed in the light of all of the relevant facts and circumstances.
	
	
	This judgment on its own has no value as a comparator. It should be read along with R v Hamzy (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1514.
	


Facts


	
	The offender and a man who I will refer to as ""Mr C"" were associated as fellow members of a gang known as Brothers for Life. There was ill-feeling between the pair for reasons which were controversial in the trial.
	
	
	On Sunday 14 October 2012 they arranged to meet after the following exchange of text messages:

	It is particularly important to note that the offender conveyed to Mr C that he (the offender) was at his mother's place and Mr C, who had told the offender that he was with Yeyha Amood, said he would be there in five minutes.
	
	
	The offender's mother lived in a complex of townhouses, the entrance to which was on Greenacre Road, Greenacre.
	
	
	Mr C drove to the location in his Mercedes sedan which had the distinctive registration plates ""BFL"". Mr Yeyha Amood was in the front passenger seat. Mr C parked his car on Greenacre Road outside the townhouse complex.
	
	
	The offender was at his own home in Shannon Street, Yagoona with a number of Brothers for Life associates. He asked one of them, a man I will refer to as ""Mr G"", to ""take me to my mum's"". Mr G drove the offender there in a Lexus SUV.
	
	
	Both the offender and Mr C were armed with Glock pistols. The offender had bought his Glock from ""a friend"" a couple of months before. The offender was asked why he took the gun and he said he had been told that Mr C was going to shoot him and so he thought he would take one along ""just in case"". He agreed that he was ""going armed to meet a man who [he] expected to be armed"". He disagreed, however, with the Crown Prosecutor's characterisation of it being ""two men going to a gunfight"".
	
	
	If Mr C accepted what the offender had told him via text message that he was ""at my mums"", the offender's arrival by car would have come as a surprise to him. As the Lexus approached the townhouse complex on Greenacre Road, the offender directed Mr G to pull over beside the parked Mercedes. The offender had his gun ready. It was fully loaded. The Lexus was a little higher than the Mercedes and as it pulled up alongside, the offender, looking down towards the driver, said that he could see that Mr C had a gun. He also said that he saw Yeyha Amood in the car at that time.
	
	
	In relation to Mr C, the offender said:
	


""I seen his hands – I seen him and the gun in his hands straightaway because I was in a four-wheel drive, so I was pretty high, and I can see in the car, I can see – I was high, so I can see clearly what was in his hands.""


	
	He said that Mr C's hands were ""close to the steering wheel window area, between there"" and he moved his hands ""slightly towards my way to the right"". He said he was ""scared"" and that he ""reacted"". He believed that Mr C might shoot so he fired first.
	
	
	The offender discharged three rounds, wounding Mr C with the intention of causing him serious harm. A bullet penetrated Mr C’s upper right thigh and ended in his abdomen and another penetrated his ankle. However, tragically and unintentionally, the offender also fatally wounded Yeyha Amood with a bullet that passed through his right to left upper chest, through his lungs and heart. He died at the scene.
	
	
	Mr G proceeded to drive off but the offender continued to fire, eight times, back towards the front of the Mercedes.
	
	
	There was an issue in the trial about whether the driver’s window of the Mercedes was down, up or partially up. The jury obviously accepted that the offender believed that it was necessary to act in self-defence but they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his response was excessive. Before dealing with this issue about the window, which has a bearing upon the excessiveness of the offender’s response, it is first appropriate to say something about the credibility of those who gave evidence about it. It is convenient also to say something in this context generally about the rationale for the jury’s verdicts.
	


Rationale for verdicts


	
	Count 1, the shooting of Alex Ali at Yagoona on 8 October 2012, involved a dispute that the offender was the shooter. The Crown case depended upon the jury’s acceptance beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of a witness, “Mr O” whose credibility was seriously questioned. His evidence was that the offender had admitted to him that he had shot Alex Ali. The jury’s doubt as to that evidence is, in my respectful view, understandable.
	
	
	In respect of Count 2, there was no contest that the offender had shot at, and thereby wounded, Mr C and that he thereby intended to cause him grievous bodily harm. Whilst the shots were directed at Mr C, the accused was criminally responsible for one of the shots having fatally wounded Mr Yeyha Amood. As I have mentioned, the jury accepted that it was a reasonable possibility that the accused believed it was necessary to do what he did but were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his response was excessive.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that there should be a verdict of not guilty in respect of Count 3. This was because it had the essential element that the offender intended to kill Mr C but the Crown Prosecutor put quite squarely to the offender in cross-examination that he had only intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. It was on this basis that the jury acquitted the offender of Count 3 but found him guilty of Count 4. Consistently with the jury’s verdict on Count 2, it was on the basis that the accused’s response was excessive that the Crown eliminated self-defence in respect of Count 4.
	


Motive/credibility


	
	The Crown alleged that the motive for the shootings on both 8 and 14 October 2012 was that the offender had heard from Ms Salwa Adel, Mr C’s estranged wife, that Alex Ali and Mr C had been referring to the offender’s wife as a “slut” and a “gold digger”. This evidence was based upon the evidence of Mr O who claimed to have overheard a conversation between Ms Adel and the offender shortly before 8 October 2012. An issue in the trial was whether, as the Crown contended, certain text messages between Ms Adel and the offender were consistent with the offender being concerned about the supposed disparaging remarks being made about his wife.
	
	
	The defence case was that Mr C had become concerned that the offender was having an affair with Ms Adel. Accordingly the defence contention was that the text messages were consistent with Mr C being out to get the offender and that the relevant text messages involved concern being expressed by Ms Adel and the offender about that prospect.
	
	
	Given the jury’s acquittal of the offender on Count 1 and thereby the implicit rejection of the evidence of Mr O, it would be appropriate to have a doubt about his evidence of having overheard the conversation between Ms Adel and the offender. For myself, I would have had reasonable doubt about Mr O’s evidence as well. The manner in which he gave his evidence was not impressive but more significantly, his background, the circumstances in which he came to make his statement, and other matters (see summing up under “unreliable evidence”) mean that it would be very difficult to be satisfied of his reliability and truthfulness beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The principal issue in relation to Counts 2 and 4 was whether the offender believed it was necessary to act in self-defence. The Crown had available to it many good arguments to counter that proposition but obviously the jury did not accept them, at least to the extent that they were persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had disproved the subjective element of self-defence.
	
	
	I have heard and read submissions about the factual basis upon which I should assess the offences. I accept that matters adverse to the offender must be established beyond reasonable doubt and that matters favourable to him only need to be established on the balance of probabilities. Moreover, I must make findings of fact that are not inconsistent with the verdicts of the jury. That, of course, does not entail an attempt to divine the jury’s reasoning; simply that I must make findings consistent with the jury’s obvious acceptance of there being a reasonable possibility that the offender did believe that it was necessary to do what he did and their acceptance beyond reasonable doubt that his response was excessive.
	
	
	The submissions by counsel for the offender depend, to a large extent, upon my acceptance of evidence given by Mr C, Mr G, and the offender himself. I indicated during the course of the sentence hearing that I had serious misgivings about the credibility of each of them. The manner in which they gave their evidence was not impressive. Their explanations for significantly inconsistent prior statements were unsatisfactory. I gained the distinct impression that they were all doing their best to provide an exculpatory self-defence version no matter what they had said in the past.
	
	
	At one point in Mr G’s evidence when he was challenged by the Crown Prosecutor on a matter of detail he protested, “It happened three years ago”. But then, when pressed about an inconsistent statement he made on 23 July 2014, he claimed a number of times that his memory had improved since then. He sought to disavow evidence he gave at the committal hearing in March 2015 to the effect that when they were about 100 metres away from the offender's mother's home the offender brought out his gun and lowered the passenger-side window. He explained that his memory had improved since then as well. At one point he said that his memory now was ""excellent"".
	
	
	Mr C conceded that he was a man who was involved in serious criminal activity. He said he was a person who always carried a gun because he had a lot of enemies because of “rivalry” over “turf”. He claimed that the gun he had was one he had had for some time and he had used it before. He disavowed a statement he had made in October 2013 to the effect that he did not have a gun and that as the Lexus came alongside the Mercedes the offender stuck his arm out the window and started shooting. He blamed the content of the statement on leading questions asked by a detective to which he simply agreed.
	
	
	I am not prepared to act on the evidence of either of these men except where it is necessary to do so in order to maintain consistency with the jury’s verdicts. In part this means that I am not prepared to accept either of the competing reasons advanced by the parties for the animosity that was clearly felt between the offender and Mr C.
	


Excessive self-defence


	
	I return to the issue about the driver’s side window of Mr C’s Mercedes at the time the Lexus in which the offender was a passenger pulled alongside. There is no doubt that one of the shots fired by the offender pierced the window and shattered it because glass fragments from it were later found in the front and rear interior of the car. The position adopted by each of Mr C, Mr G and the offender was that the window was down. This obviously made more plausible their attempt to convey that Mr C was about to shoot at the offender. Mr C and the offender both struggled when confronted with the proposition that the window could not have been completely down. When asked a leading question in cross-examination, Mr C claimed to be uncertain how far open the window was. The offender suggested at one point that the window might have been “just a little bit up”. On the other hand, Mr G insisted that it was down.
	
	
	To maintain consistency with the jury's verdict it is necessary to accept that Mr C was armed with a gun and that the offender saw it. But given my acceptance that the driver's window of the Mercedes was either fully or partially closed, I do not accept that Mr C was about to fire at the offender. If he had been, it is remarkable that he did not discharge a single round to defend himself. I must accept that the offender believed it was necessary to fire his gun in self-defence, but on an objective assessment his actions in discharging his gun multiple times in these circumstances was a complete overreaction.
	


Seriousness of the offences


	
	It is necessary to restate some of the salient aspects of the facts to put in context my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. The offender took a loaded handgun to a planned meeting with Mr C with foresight that there could be a confrontation and he may have to use it. When he saw that Mr C was also armed with a handgun, the offender made a pre-emptive strike and fired 11 rounds in an excessive response to the threat he perceived. There is no dispute that he intended to cause really serious bodily harm when firing in the direction of Mr C. He knew Yeyha Amood was sitting next to him. It must be remembered as well that this occurred in a residential street on a Sunday afternoon. The offender's actions were utterly reckless and inherently dangerous.
	
	
	The fact that the offender believed that it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend himself reduces his crime from murder to manslaughter. It does not operate to further reduce the seriousness of that manslaughter.
	
	
	There is another aspect that should be mentioned although not strictly relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences. The offender said in his evidence:
	


""[H]e was pointing it towards me, a hundred per cent. I wouldn't have - I'm pretty sure anyone in my situation, at that time I really thought my life's in danger, so I let off the shots. And I think anyone in my situation that had that state of mind would do the same thing.""


	
	The offender's reference to ""anyone in my situation"" is concerning; the fact is that law-abiding people would never be in his ""situation"". That the offender was in that ""situation"" and that he felt it necessary to ""let off the shots"", 11 of them, was largely of his own making. The offender's self-righteous justification for his actions demonstrates a complete lack of insight into the gravity and criminality of his conduct.
	
	
	Manslaughter is an offence which can arise in an extremely wide range of circumstances and so speaking about where a particular case falls within the range is problematic. This case must, however, be regarded as one of considerable seriousness.
	
	
	The wounding of Mr C with intent offence is of moderate seriousness for an offence of its type. The injuries sustained were far from being as serious as they could have been; it seems that Mr C made an uneventful recovery. It is the fact that the offence occurred by way of a shooting with a handgun and the manner and circumstances in which it occurred that elevates its seriousness.
	


Personal circumstances of the offender


	
	The offender was born in 1985 so he was aged 27 at the time of the offences.
	


Criminal record


	
	He has a significant criminal record that disentitles him to the leniency that could otherwise be extended to someone with no record. It is also a matter that increases the weight that should be given to personal deterrence in the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	I will not refer to every entry in the record but I note that it commenced in the Children's Court in 2002 with five offences of assault that occurred when the offender was aged 16. For those offences he was placed on a bond with a condition that he not associate with his adult co-offenders.
	
	
	Six weeks after being placed on that bond and at the age of 17 he committed offences of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault. He was sentenced in the District Court when he was aged 19 and received a total sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Although the non-parole period expired on 28 December 2005, he was not released on parole until 28 December 2006. Possibly his poor gaol disciplinary record had something to do with that.
	
	
	The offender breached his parole in some unknown way and returned to custody to serve a period of 7 weeks before he was re-released on parole at the end of August 2007.
	
	
	At the age of 18 he committed three offences of stalking a law officer for which in March 2005, just before his 20th birthday, he was imprisoned for 6 months. This sentence was subsumed within the non-parole period for the above matter.
	
	
	The offender was dealt with for some driving offences and having custody of a knife in a public place in August 2009. He was fined and disqualified from driving. In April 2010 he committed an offence of possess/use prohibited weapon without a permit (a flick knife) for which he received a substantial fine.
	
	
	In April 2011 the offender committed an offence of driving whilst disqualified and in August of that year he was fined, disqualified and placed on a three year good behaviour bond. He was subject to that bond at the time of the index offences which is a significant aggravating factor. While awaiting the resolution of that matter, in July 2011 he committed offences of possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit (a ballistic vest) and possession, or attempting to possess, steroids. In October 2011 he was ordered to pay fines.
	
	
	In July 2012 the offender committed offences of possessing (.40 calibre) ammunition without holding a permit etcetera and possessing or attempting to possess a prescribed restricted substance. In March 2013 he received a substantial fine for the ammunition offence and was imprisoned for 3 months for the other offence. About a fortnight later on appeal, that sentence was reduced to a period of 57 days (31 January to 28 March 2013).
	
	
	Eleven days after the shooting of the deceased and Mr C, the offender was in possession of an unauthorised pistol. It was not the same gun as he had used on 14 October 2012 which was a Glock. This particular gun was a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol that had an obliterated serial number and a magazine loaded with 11 rounds of ammunition. He was charged with that matter on 31 January 2013 and held in custody until released on bail on 12 April 2013. He pleaded guilty in the District Court and was sentenced on 13 February 2015 to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months. The sentence was back-dated to commence on 26 August 2013. The non-parole period expired on 25 February 2015 but he remained in custody because he had been refused bail in respect of the current matter.
	
	
	The offender was charged with the October 2012 shootings on 7 November 2013 and has been in custody since. Ordinarily that would mean that the sentences to be imposed would be back-dated until then. However, within that period he served the majority of the 18 month non-parole period for the pistol possession offence of 25 October 2012. I have discretion as to when to commence the sentence I impose: it could be from the date of arrest; or from the date of expiry of that other non-parole period; or somewhere in between. The principle of totality guides such an assessment. Given the serious nature of the pistol possession offence and that it is entirely separate from the present matter it is appropriate that there be some partial accumulation. I propose to back-date the sentence to 26 August 2014.
	


Other subjective matters


	
	I do not have any reports about the offender's background. I was told via the written submissions of counsel that the offender is one of seven children. His father passed away through illness in 2010. His mother and siblings live in the south-western suburbs of Sydney. He is married to Ms Meltam Yarer. They do not have any children. That is all I know about him.
	


Offer to plead guilty


	
	I was told that in February 2015 the offender offered to plead guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Amood with the offence of shooting Mr C with intent to cause grievous bodily harm being taken into account. The Director of Public Prosecutions rejected that offer. In November 2015 the offender repeated the offer to plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence with an offence of reckless wounding of Mr C being taken into account but it was rejected as well. The offender then ran a case at trial in which he contended that he was not guilty outright on the basis that he acted in self-defence and that his response was not excessive. As it turned out, he was found guilty of the type of homicide that he had previously offered to plead guilty to. He was also found guilty of the offence which he had originally asked to be taken into account.
	
	
	Counsel for the offender submitted that he was ""entitled to receive the maximum discount for the utilitarian benefit of his offer to plead guilty"". Authority was cited in support of that submission which I have considered. (The discussion by Bell J in R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129 at [36]-[44] is particularly helpful.)
	
	
	On account of the offender's offer to plead guilty to manslaughter I will reduce the sentence for that offence by 25 per cent, given the offer was first made when proceedings were pending in the Local Court.
	
	
	There was no offer to plead guilty to the other offence but there was an offer to have it taken into account. It seems reasonable that the sentence for that offence should be reduced by 20 per cent.
	


Delay


	
	It was submitted that delay was a factor I should take into account in the offender's favour. I have mentioned that he was arrested and refused bail on 7 November 2013. Until 25 February 2015 he was serving the non-parole period for an unrelated offence. He has been in custody solely in relation to this matter for the past 20 months. His offers to plead guilty that I have mentioned are relevant to this subject as well. A trial was supposed to take place in October 2015 but had to be vacated because of the late disclosure of material by the Crown.
	
	
	It was submitted that the delay has been significant and that ""the offender has been in uncertainty as to his fate and for much of that time facing a charge of murder"". There is no evidence of precisely how the delay has impacted upon him but I am prepared to accept that he must have been in a state of uncertainty as to what the outcome of the proceedings might be, particularly when facing a charge of murder. The delay, in all of the circumstances, is not as substantial as is sometimes seen but it is a relevant matter and I have taken it into account.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	It was not submitted that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to reoffend. I can well understand that given the nature of the offending and the offender's previous history. To the contrary, the sentence I impose must for those reasons have a significant element of personal deterrence.
	
	
	I accept that the offender regrets the death of Yeyha Amood and I accept that he is remorseful in relation to it. But there is no suggestion that he is otherwise remorseful for taking a loaded handgun to what he appreciated was a potentially violent confrontation and using it in his perceived need to defend himself without thought as to the tragic consequences that might occur. I have earlier referred to his evidence about “anyone in his situation doing what he did”. There is no indication that he appreciates that he should never have been in that situation and there is nothing to indicate that he realises he never should be in the future. His lack of morality in this respect further confirms the need for a strong element of personal deterrence.
	
	
	The offender must be sentenced for the manslaughter of Mr Amood on the basis that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm, not to kill. The sentence will nevertheless reflect the fact that this was a serious example of such an offence. A man's life was feloniously taken in circumstances where he was not the intended victim and where it only occurred because of the offender's decision to take a loaded handgun to what he perceived could be a confrontation in which it may be necessary to use it. The offender bears a high level of moral culpability. It is a crime that warrants strong denunciation. General deterrence is also a significant consideration in a case where criminals have resort to handguns which end up being used with lethal consequences. There is also a need to recognise the substantial harm done to the victim and the community.
	
	
	It is necessary to also bear in mind that the offences were committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty; a bond to be of ""good behaviour"".
	
	
	The two offences for which sentence must be imposed have much in common but it is necessary to reflect the fact that there were two victims. The sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the totality of criminality for both so there must be a degree of partial accumulation.
	
	
	Mr Johnston SC submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but confined the basis of it to the potential partial accumulation of the two sentences I have to impose and also in respect of the sentence imposed in the District Court on 13 February 2015. I accept that submission.
	


Sentence


	
	For the manslaughter of Mr Yeyha Amood (Count 2) and the wounding of Mr C with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (Count 4) the offender is convicted.
	
	
	Count 4: sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 5 months. The total sentence is 5 years 8 months which will date from 26 August 2014.
	
	
	Count 2: sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years. That is a total sentence of 10 years 6 months which will date from 26 August 2015. The non-parole period will expire on 25 February 2023 when the offender will become eligible for release on parole.
	
	
	That is an overall sentence of 11 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 8 years 6 months.

		28 October 2016",2016-10-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2791113,R v MJ [2016] NSWDC 272,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Of recent times, more attention is being paid to the enormous problem of domestic violence in our community. It may be that offences of domestic violence have not been treated as seriously as they should have been in the past. In truth, such offences cause enormous harm, both to the individual victims of such offending and to the wider community generally. Women, and it is usually women, too often find themselves subjugated to the demands of their partners, who seem to regard it as entirely acceptable for them to control and manipulate someone with whom they are in a relationship through violent and degrading means.
	
	
	The offender MJ is now to be sentenced for a large number of domestic violence offences committed in the latter part of 2013 and the early part of 2014 when he was in a relationship with a young woman named DM. He pleaded not guilty to these offences, and he is not to be punished for doing so, but not surprisingly, given the strength of the case against him, he was found guilty by a jury on 27 November 2015 after a trial.
	
	
	In addition, he is to be sentenced for a number of more minor matters to which he pleaded guilty, such matters being related charges appearing on a s 166 certificate, and on two offences for which he received s 9 bonds, he having breached those bonds by the commission of these offences.
	
	
	As the Crown case unfolded, one thing was very clear. That was that the offender had a sense of entitlement and ownership over Ms M and that he blamed her for his violent behaviour. He manipulated Ms M, using violence and protestations of love. So effective was his manipulation that Ms M did not leave the relationship, even after being repeatedly beaten and raped. It was only after she received counselling that she saw the relationship for what it was, and was finally able to escape the offender.
	
	
	He is now to be sentenced for ten separate offences appearing on the indictment presented against him. They are of varying seriousness but all arise in the context of the relationship I have just described. Remarkably, some of those offences were witnessed by independent observers. Too often, offences such as I am about to describe occur behind closed doors and, too often, victims of such violence are not believed. Fortunately, so brazen were the offender’s actions that there was substantial support for Ms M’s evidence on a number of the counts I will now describe.
	
	
	Count 1 concerns an assault occasioning actual bodily harm which occurred when the offender and Ms M had driven to Dixon Beach. The assault was witnessed by a bystander, Mr Harten, who gave evidence about what he saw. Ms M said that while they were in the car the offender became angry with her after she asked him to repay some money that she had lent him. He told her, she said, to get out of the car and then he punched her in the face, splitting her lip. He then dragged her out of the car and drove away.
	
	
	Count 2 is clearly the most serious offence on the indictment. It occurred when the offender had sexual intercourse with Ms M without her consent. At some stage in the relationship, after they had just had consensual sexual intercourse, the offender became angry about her texting her daughter’s aunt Annalise. Her evidence was that he accused her of wanting to go out and sleep with someone else. She gave evidence that he was physically violent towards her, including by scratching at a tattoo that she had recently required, before he grabbed a breadknife, which he put up to her chest, and said that he was going to kill her, she said, in a low, deep, meaningful voice. He then seemed to calm down and let her go to the bedroom, where she put her underwear on, before the offender pushed her onto the bed, pinned her down and forced his penis into her vagina, having sex with her without her consent, until he ejaculated.
	
	
	This was a particularly degrading and humiliating abuse of Ms M by the offender. It is a very good example of the domination which he felt he was able to exercise over her. The offender is to be sentenced for an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, the circumstance of aggravation being that immediately before the sexual intercourse he threatened to inflict actual bodily harm upon Ms M by means of the knife.
	
	
	Count 3 occurred after the offender had been to a show called “Tits On Toast” at the Royal Hotel. In case the nature of such a show is not obvious from its name, it is a strip show performed at breakfast time. Ms M’s evidence was that when he got home he was angry at her because she had rung Aaron, her daughter’s father. He expressed his anger by showing her a photo on his phone of the stripper he had just been watching, which caused her to say, “You have the hide to go on about me but you are out there doing that stuff”; quite a reasonable response, one might have thought. She said that the offender became really angry again and he started to attack her by punching her in the face and in the body, and that he grabbed a coffee table and smashed it over. At one stage the table hit her hard on the shin, which caused it to bleed. Thus, the offender is to be sentenced for another offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	This was another offence where there was some independent support for what Ms M said. Her next door neighbour gave evidence that she had heard Ms M calling out, asking that police be called.
	
	
	The police did come, and Ms M made an initial complaint to the police. Quite clearly, the offender was concerned about this complaint having been made, because he began to put considerable pressure on Ms M, including, of course, threats of violence and actual violence, to persuade Ms M to write out a statutory declaration in which she asserted that her complaint to police was false.
	
	
	Count 5 is an assault which occurred as the offender and Ms M, together with her daughter, were coming back from Tanilba Bay. Ms M gave evidence that as she was driving the offender was telling her that she needed to do the stat dec so that he would not get locked up. She said that he was yelling at her and he punched her in the face, causing her to almost swerve off the road. She stopped the car and got out. She started to run away but had to return when he threatened to drive away, with her daughter with him. He continued to hit her once she got back into the car, hitting her around the head with his fist. This is an offence of common assault.
	
	
	Count 6 occurred soon afterwards as they were driving into Stockton. This is yet another incident where there was independent support. Ms M said that the defendant drove her in to an area near the water, that he was yelling at her, and so she got out of the car. He also got out of the car and kept punching her. She described what the offender did. “He kept booting me and he just kept booting me continuously and hitting me.” She heard someone call out, yelling, “Leave her alone. Leave her alone,” which apparently caused the offender to stop hitting her, run back to the car and drive away.
	
	
	That good Samaritan turned out to be a man named Peter Haggart, who gave evidence that he had heard a woman yelling out for help, as a result of which he picked up a big stick, ran to where the voice was coming from and saw a male get into a car and drive away. He took Ms M inside his home and, because the offender had taken Ms M’s phone and handbag when he drove away, Mr Haggart kindly gave her some money to get home.
	
	
	Count 7 occurred at Waratah Village in a context of the offender wanting Ms M to take the stat dec to Waratah police station and hand it in. The offender was yelling at her because she did not want to do what he was asking. When she told him that she did not want to hand in a false document, he threatened to hit her in the face with his fist, as a result of which she did in fact go to the police station and hand in the stat dec. This is another offence of common assault.
	
	
	Count 8 is the first of two offences which occurred at the Molly Morgan Motel at East Maitland. Ms M injured her ribs after the offender threw her onto the bed. This was after she had had an argument with the offender over him having a Facebook account, but him telling her that he did not want her to have Facebook and communicating with anyone on it. Later medical evidence revealed that Ms M was diagnosed with a musculoskeletal injury to her ribs. This is another offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Count 9 was the other offence at the Molly Morgan Motel. On this occasion the offender was anxious, agitated and angry, apparently because Ms M was not getting ready as quickly as the offender would have liked. He called her a “gronk” and began hitting her to the face with his fist. She grabbed a knife, which she swung in front of her, telling the offender to stay away from her, but that somehow he managed to get the knife off her and threw her around, saying he was going to kill her. She ran out the front door, where she noticed that the offender had cut her across the arm. She still has the scar on her arm, which she displayed while giving evidence.
	
	
	Through his counsel, the offender raised a defence of self-defence. This was clearly rejected by the jury. No doubt they accepted the Crown’s argument that, as the initial aggressor, all the offender had to do to prevent himself from being harmed was to cease acting aggressively. This is another offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Count 10 is an offence which occurred on the first night Ms M and the offender moved into a new home at Lemon Tree Passage. The offender became angry when he could not find something he was looking for. Ms M said that he ran at her and she could remember him strangling her. She said she felt like she was going to die. She also remembers him hitting her. This is another offence of common assault.
	
	
	Count 11 was another offence which occurred in the context of the offender’s concern that police might still take action against him for what Ms M had earlier complained about. While they were at East Maitland, he told her that she had to go to Waratah police station and complain that Senior Constable Candy was harassing her. When Ms M objected to this, the offender said, “No. You're fucking going to go in there. I’m not getting locked up.” She told him she did not want to be in a relationship with him anymore, and this made the offender really angry. He started to punch her in the face and kick her really hard. She put her hands out to stop him hitting her, and he kicked her on the hand, causing her to feel extreme pain straight away. Some teenagers ran over to assist her, but she told them to go, so that they did not get hurt themselves. She went to the Mater Hospital the next day, where she was diagnosed as having torn ligaments and a broken bone in her hand.
	
	
	That completes my description of the ten counts on the indictment.
	
	
	The matters arising on the s 166 certificate to which the offender pleaded guilty arise from the conduct of the offender which I have just described. He should not have been driving when he committed counts 1, 5 and 6 because he was a disqualified driver. Counts 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11 represent breaches of the AVO, not only because he was with Ms M in contravention of that AVO, but also because he assaulted her in the way I have described, as the jury found he had done.
	
	
	Finally, there are the two breaches of the s 9 bond. One is another offence of driving whilst disqualified. The other one is another offence of contravening an apprehended violence order. That one occurred when the offender, whilst in the company of police, contacted a person he should not have contacted. He did this by telling police he wanted to make a call to his Aunty Belle, but he did not really. He contacted the person with whom he was then in a relationship, JMc. While on the phone, he was heard to say:
	


“I’m fucking locked up in gaol. I’m fucking cold. I’m fucking hungry. You know what to do. Are you going to fucking help me or what? You fucking know what to do.”


	
	It was not innocent contact between the offender and the person in need of protection at all on that occasion.
	
	
	So those are the offences for which MJ must be sentenced.
	
	
	Let me deal with the impact of those offences on Ms M. Given the range of offences committed by the offender, it is no surprise to learn that the consequences for Ms M included both physical and psychological injury. She has nightmares, she has scars, she has ongoing pain in the hand, she has a lack of confidence, and she has difficulty showing affection; all directly resulting from the offender’s abuse of her. These are entirely foreseeable consequences which must be reflected in the sentence I impose.
	
	
	I should mention the maximum penalties at this stage. Each offence of common assault has a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. Each offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm has a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The offence of aggravated sexual assault carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of ten years. I have taken the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole period into account in determining the sentence to impose. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period for the sexual assault matter appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	I hope it will be obvious from my description of the offender’s crimes just how serious they were. She was assaulted in her home on occasions. Many of the offences of violence occurred in the context of the offender’s demands that Ms M withdraw a complaint she had made to police about the offender’s abuse of her. There are some disturbing similarities between the way the offender acted in this matter and the way he acted with a previous partner, demanding that she too help him get out of gaol after she had made an allegation of assault against him.
	
	
	A number of the offences occurred in the presence of Ms M’s daughter. At times she was pleading with the offender, saying things such as, “Stop hurting my mummy. Leave my mummy alone.”
	
	
	Many of the offences of violence represented breaches of an apprehended violence order, and demonstrated that the offender thought nothing of his obligations under that court order.
	
	
	Further evidence of the offender’s attitude can be found in the circumstance that the offender was on a bond to be of good behaviour after having been sentenced for driving whilst disqualified and, remarkably, breaching an earlier AVO relating to a previous partner. Even more remarkably, the offender was on bail at the time of these offences, having been charged with a number of offences committed against his previous partner, offences for which he was later convicted.
	
	
	I will, of course, note that given that I will be sentencing the offender for breaching the AVO on five occasions when I deal with the s 166 certificate, it is important that I do not double-count by also treating those breaches as aggravating circumstances on the relevant counts on the indictment.
	
	
	I have said this many times but it is worth repeating: Not all of us have the same choices in life. We make the choices which we make influenced by our backgrounds. In one particular respect, the offender’s background was severely damaging. His mother and his brother gave evidence before me today. They established quite clearly that the offender’s natural father, JJ, is a person who has caused enormous damage through his violent behaviour.
	
	
	The offender’s mother, RC, was married to JJ. Whilst pregnant with the offender, he left, but came back again. She largely raised her two sons, the offender and his brother TC, on her own. But JJ’s violent behaviour was a distinctive feature of the offender’s life. His father would come back to live with Ms C on occasions and would be violent towards her, to the offender and his brother. Fortunately, he eventually left Ms C for good, although his damaging involvement with the offender continued. But after he left, Ms C formed a relationship with a man named PC who became a stepfather to the offender and his brother. In contrast to JJ’s behaviour, Mr PC has been a valuable role model.
	
	
	The offender was diagnosed with ADD at about eleven, but then, sadly, spent some time with his father when he was about that age. His behaviour changed, as it would after spending time with his father in years to come. He began to use drugs. He began to mix with many undesirable elements. He used so many drugs that at one stage he was admitted to John Hunter Hospital suffering from a psychotic episode. Ms C believed that she had lost her son to drugs at that stage, but his behaviour improved. She saw three or four years when he was law-abiding and happy. In that period, the offender had a relationship and a son was born. He is now eight and lives with the offender’s mother. For a significant period, he was the sole father to his son. He was a good father. He did not take drugs and he cared for his son well.
	
	
	He suffered a setback in 2010 when he had a motorbike accident. That not only caused him a lot of pain but caused him to lose his job. His mother said he became disenchanted and became upset that he could not do what he wanted to do, and, worst of all, he began to see JJ again. Once again, he began to use illicit drugs and, once again, he went off the rails.
	
	
	The offender’s brother T spoke of the way JJ would relate to him, and I have got no doubt he acted in a similar way towards the offender. There would be a pattern of violence towards his sons, following which there were expressions of remorse and protestations of love, but they were only short lived before, once again, violence would erupt. It is remarkable how similar that behaviour described by TC matches very closely the behaviour described by Ms M.
	
	
	In the lead-up to the trial, the offender has achieved a large measure of rehabilitation in so far as his use of drugs and alcohol is concerned. He went to residential rehabilitation, firstly The Glen and then Benelong’s Haven. He passed and completed the programmes. He took over his stepfather’s aerial installation business and did a good job and, most importantly, of course, he was not using any illicit drugs leading up to the jury’s verdict, despite a couple of setbacks; one when his grandfather died and one when his unborn child died.
	
	
	So the offender was a person where domestic violence was a feature of his early life, but it is certainly not a case where the offender grew up thinking that such behaviour was normal and acceptable. As I have mentioned before, PC, the offender’s stepfather, appears to have been the exact opposite of JJ, providing a good role model for the offender.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I have to bear in mind that the choices which the offender made about his conduct towards Ms M could not have failed to be influenced by the offender’s father’s violent and disgraceful behaviour. He was the sort of person who would belittle Ms C, the offender’s mother, in the presence of her children. He would make unreasonable demands on her and become violent when those demands were not met. The offender saw this too when his father formed a new relationship. JJ would yell and hit and abuse the offender’s stepmother as well. The impression I get of JJ is that he is a very violent and disturbed man, even to the extent of burning his sons with a cigarette, demanding that they fight each other, and worse on occasions.
	
	
	The offender has spent a great deal of time with JJ over his teens and later years, all of which was damaging to the offender. Ultimately, however, when assessing the moral culpability of the offender, I come back to the idea of personal choice. The offender knew well how wrong his conduct was because he had seen his father behave that way towards his mother. I repeat what I said at the outset of these remarks on sentence. He was demanding towards Ms M and displayed a sense of entitlement. He blamed her for his outrageous criminal behaviour, when nothing could be further from the truth. He bears responsibility for what he did, and will be sentenced accordingly.
	
	
	Despite the rehabilitation that the offender appears to have achieved leading up to the jury’s verdict, there still is a need for specific deterrence. The offender’s history, and it is a history, of acting in a violent way towards partners is of great concern. True it is that he has not always done that; indeed, some of the people with whom he was in relationships with have spoken positively about him in references tendered to the Court today. But much more important than specific deterrence is, of course, general deterrence. Again, I go back to what I said at the beginning of these remarks on sentence. Offences such as these cause enormous harm, both to the individual victims concerned and to the community generally. Offenders who commit crimes such as I have described, particularly after they have been subject to apprehended violence orders, put in place to protect their partners from precisely such conduct, need to be given in sentences which will deter others who may be tempted to act in a similar way. Most fundamentally in assessing the relevant sentence to impose upon the offender is, of course, the objective gravity of what he has done.
	
	
	The references do speak of a different person to the one described in evidence by Ms M. That demonstrates how a person, the same person, can act differently on some occasions to other occasions. The references, of course, can only speak about what they see of the offender. What they do not see is what the offender does in private. There are other problems with some of the references too. One says that MJ is incredibly remorseful. This must be referring to something else other than the offences for which I must sentence him because he pleaded not guilty to those.
	
	
	A certificate suggested that he had successfully completed an anger management programme in October 2013. The fact that he would commit these offences so soon afterwards does demonstrate that rehabilitation is not guaranteed. That is not to devalue the substantial efforts that the offender has put into getting himself off drugs and improving the way he behaves. I will take into account not only the rehabilitation the offender has achieved but also the circumstance that he spent some period in quasi custody; 82 days at The Glen and 145 days at Benelong’s Haven. The sentences will be less than they would otherwise have been to reflect that quasi custody.
	
	
	There are no special circumstances in this case. That is not to say the offender will not benefit from a period of supervision on parole, but I have not found special circumstances for two reasons. Firstly, the period of eligibility for parole which I will announce is sufficient to deal with the needs for the offender to be supervised and, secondly, the non-parole period I will shortly announce is the least which adequately reflects the objective gravity of his conduct.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence. Were I not to do so, I would have imposed the following sentences. For the drive whilst qualified the subject of the s 9 bond, imprisonment for six months; for the contravene apprehended violence order matter the subject of the s 9 bond, imprisonment for one year. For the matters on the 166 certificate, sequences 12 and 20 were drive whilst disqualified matters, six months imprisonment on each; sequence 9, the breach of an AVO related to count 5, one year imprisonment; sequence 25, breach of the AVO related to count 7, one year imprisonment; sequence 1, breach of the AVO related to count 9, eighteen months imprisonment; sequence 7, breach of the AVO related to count 10, fifteen months imprisonment; and sequence 5, breach of the AVO related to count 11, eighteen months imprisonment.
	
	
	As I have sentenced MJ for three matters for driving whilst disqualified, I should also announce at this stage that he is disqualified from driving on each of those matters for two years, to be served accumulatively.
	
	
	I will now turn to the offences on the indictment and the sentences I would have imposed had I not imposed an aggregate sentence. Count 1, two years imprisonment; count 2, ten years imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven and a half years; count 3, two years imprisonment; count 5, fifteen months imprisonment; count 6, fifteen months imprisonment; count 7, twelve months imprisonment; count 8, two years imprisonment; count 9, two and a half years imprisonment; count 10, eighteen months imprisonment; and count 11, three and a half years imprisonment.
	
	
	I impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of ten and a half years with a head sentence of fourteen years to date from 22 October 2015. This means that MJ is eligible to be released to parole on 21 April 2026.

		09 November 2016",2016-05-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2800952,Romolo v R [2016] NSWCCA 240,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: On 2 August 2016, I joined in orders of this Court granting leave to appeal but dismissing an appeal brought pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) by Marco Romolo (the applicant). The appeal was against the refusal of Judge Lakatos SC to order a permanent stay of a criminal trial in the District Court of New South Wales. The following are my reasons for doing so.
	


Background


	
	The background of the matter was not disputed between the parties, and may be shortly stated.
	
	
	The applicant is charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug (methamphetamine), by joint commission of the offence, contrary to s 307.1 and s 11.2A(1) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The applicable maximum penalty is imprisonment for life.
	
	
	In a nutshell, the Crown case is that 5,939 grams (4,691.8 grams pure) of the prohibited drug in question were imported into Australia whilst contained in a number of boxes. The Crown case is also that the applicant implicated himself in the offence, chiefly by repeatedly contacting the courier company that imported the boxes and enquiring about them, and using the name of the false addressee whilst doing so.
	
	
	By way of a letter of 19 February 2014 sent by his solicitors to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (the CDPP), the applicant has indicated that much of the Crown case would not be disputed by him at trial. It was also indicated, however, that an important part of his case would be that, as a result of a meeting he had with a man at City Gym in East Sydney, he believed that he was involved in the importation of steroids, not cocaine. If the Crown were unable to disprove that proposition beyond reasonable doubt, then the mental element of the offence of intention or recklessness with regard to the prohibited drug would not have been proven, and the applicant would be entitled to an acquittal.
	
	
	The matter was listed for trial on 16 November 2015. Early that morning, it was discovered that the motor vehicle of the applicant’s mother, which was parked in a secure car park, had had a number of projectiles fired into it. As well as that, found in a mailbox near to her home was a note which read: “IF YOU TALK OR DROP NAMES IN COURT THIS WILL BE COMING FOR YOUR FAMILY”. Accompanying the note were two live rounds of ammunition.
	
	
	As a result of that event, the applicant is adamant that he will not provide the name of the man whom he claims he met at the gym to any person in authority. That includes in the witness box; or to his solicitor (in order, for example, to facilitate a subpoena relating to any corroborative material with regard to that person); or indeed in support of an application to receive physical protection from the police.
	
	
	The restriction that those circumstances have placed upon the applicant – in particular, with regard to naming the putative interlocutor in the witness box – led to the application for a permanent stay of the trial, on the simple basis that the applicant could not receive a fair trial according to law.
	


Primary judgment


	
	The matter came before his Honour on 27 July 2016. In a judgment that was delivered ex tempore but is no less cogent for that fact, his Honour recounted the undisputed background of which I have given a thumbnail sketch; summarised the essential submissions of senior counsel for the applicant; analysed the relevant authorities; summarised the submissions of the Crown; canvassed a number of possible procedural solutions to the problem that his Honour accepted existed; and ultimately determined that the trial should not be stayed. The penultimate paragraph of the judgment is as follows:
	


However, the balancing of the competing considerations on the one hand and the fairness of the accused’s trial, allowing him to put a proper defence and the undoubted public interest which the Courts have expressed in the prosecution of serious crime, I consider if the accused chose to give evidence but not name names or perhaps to a lesser extent gave evidence in closed court – although as I said there are riders to that proposition – that both those mechanisms would allow him to put his substantive defence before a jury. Not everything he might wish, but certainly his substantive defence before the jury with a significant explanation as to why he could not be more forthcoming. The Crown has indicated in any event, that she would not press in any cross-examination, the accused to name any names, given the circumstances.

The application


	
	The applicant promptly sought leave to appeal, and had the matter listed urgently before us due to the imminence of the trial.
	
	
	The following grounds of appeal were notified by the applicant and maintained before us:
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred by failing to have regard to the prejudice suffered by the Applicant in circumstances where the relevant person was not named.

Ground 2: His Honour erred by finding that a closed court would allow the Applicant to put his substantive defence before the jury.

Ground 3: His Honour erred by failing to grant a permanent stay.

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant accepted that the charge is a serious one. He also submitted that threats of this nature are relatively rare. He reiterated that the nub of the defence case, founded as it is on the belief of the applicant about the enterprise in which he had involved himself, in a practical sense calls upon the applicant to give evidence. He submitted that, unless the person at the gym can be named by the applicant, his credibility will undoubtedly be called into question by the jury. And if that person is unable to be properly investigated (by way of subpoenas and the like), a search for important corroborative evidence (for example, a criminal record, or perhaps a documented tendency to inveigle unsophisticated people into assisting with the importation of prohibited drugs, mistakenly believing that they are assisting with the importation of some far less serious contraband) would be unable to be properly undertaken by the lawyers for the applicant.
	
	
	Senior counsel emphasised that the primary judge had accepted, as a finding of fact, the genuineness of the threat.
	
	
	He separately submitted that any direction to the jury intended to ameliorate the circumscribed position of the applicant could very well impermissibly intrude upon its function as tribunal of fact.
	
	
	He concluded by submitting that there should not be a trial at any cost. Here, the cost will either be the possible infliction of death, or the presentation of a defence case that is inevitably restricted, and as a result very likely to fail in raising a reasonable doubt about the necessary mental element.
	
	
	In short, he submitted that, in all the circumstances, it was an error for his Honour to refuse to permanently stay the trial.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that leave should not be granted, because no error had been demonstrated in the judgment of his Honour. It was said that, contrary to the principle that the jurisdiction of this Court is founded upon identification of error at first instance, the applicant had simply sought to repeat the submissions that had not found favour before the primary judge.
	
	
	It was submitted that one may accept that the threat is real, and that the applicant feels pressured and circumscribed as a result. But there are many ameliorative steps that could be taken. They include the applicant giving evidence in a closed court, or referring to the person without giving his name, or using a pseudonym for him, or seeking protection for himself and his family from the police. And in any event, to the extent that the applicant was prepared to involve himself with criminals who were, on his admitted understanding, engaged in the business of importing steroids illegally, it was said that the regrettable problems that have developed are very much of his own making.
	
	
	In short the submission was that the applicant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. A permanent stay of a pending serious criminal charge is very much a remedy of last resort. In all the circumstances, it was said that no error has been shown either in the reasons of his Honour, or in the result.
	


Determination


	
	Before setting out my response to each of the three grounds, it is convenient to recount a number of propositions that I consider are relevant to applications for a permanent stay of a serious criminal charge founded upon threats of violence.
	
	
	First, it is well-known that a permanent stay is an extraordinary remedy, and indeed a remedy of last resort. It is true, as Leeming JA said at [1] in TS v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 174, that the granting of such a stay is not an example of a court declining to exercise jurisdiction, but rather an example of it decisively doing so. Still and all, the effect of such an order is that a charge sought to be brought by the executive (in the form of the CDPP) is unable to be determined in that part of the judicature in which the Constitution or the legislature has invested jurisdiction. And the practical effect is that an accused person is granted a permanent immunity from prosecution. That abnegation of the usual constitutional arrangements of this country, combined with the extraordinary practical outcome, means that the remedy must be reserved to truly exceptional cases: see Dupas v The Queen (2010) 241 CLR 237; [2010] HCA 20 at [18].
	
	
	Secondly, I do not accept the fundamental submission of senior counsel that it is rare for threats of violence to be made against persons involved in the criminal justice system. To the contrary, regrettably violence and the threat thereof permeate the context in which that system operates. For example, it is notorious that prisons are violent places in which paedophiles are at risk of serious harm or death: for a recent example see Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330. It is also notorious that young men are vulnerable to sexual predation in prisons. And yet those facts do not mean that the criminal justice system simply throws up its hands and refuses to exercise its criminal jurisdiction and imprison persons pursuant to the laws created by Parliament. Rather, the system does its best to resist violence and the threat thereof. Indeed, far from giving in to violence, reducing violence is one of the primary and inherent purposes of the criminal justice system itself.
	
	
	Thirdly, it is notorious that persons who are called by the prosecution to give evidence against an accused person are very often under real pressure not to do so. It is not uncommon for persons who have been subpoenaed to give evidence in criminal trials to fail to attend, for them to be arrested pursuant to a bench warrant, and thereafter for them to be incarcerated until they have given their evidence. Nor is it uncommon for persons to refuse to give evidence in such circumstances, thereby exposing themselves to conviction for contempt and incarceration. Nor is it uncommon for persons to contradict their previous statements in circumstances in which one may suspect that they have been pressured to do so. Nor is it unheard of for a person who could give exculpatory evidence on behalf of an accused person, inculpatory of another, to refuse to do so, and to take active steps in order to avoid being compelled to do so.
	
	
	All of those are well known aspects of the real world in which the criminal justice system operates. And yet, in none of those circumstances – including the unavailability of a witness who may exculpate an accused – do the courts simply put an end to proceedings by way of a permanent stay.
	
	
	Fourthly, the criminal justice system operates subject to threat in other ways as well. It is notorious that trials are sometimes conducted in New South Wales in circumstances where malefactors may seek to disrupt them. It is also the fact that measures sometimes need to be taken to protect the anonymity and security of juries.
	
	
	In short, it is difficult to accept that, merely because a seemingly sincere threat of violence has been made against the applicant and his family, it would be appropriate for him to be granted a de facto permanent immunity in relation to a serious pending charge, bearing in mind all of the other ways in which the criminal justice system sets its face against threats of violence.
	
	
	Fifthly, as his Honour said, the entitlement to a fair trial is not an entitlement to a perfect trial. Almost every criminal trial conducted in New South Wales is an imperfect one. For example, prejudicial evidence will very often be placed before a jury by way of a slip by counsel, or by witnesses refusing to answer direct questions directly. Separately, the evidence able to be obtained in resistance to a prosecution will very often be limited or negligible, not least because of the passage of time between the alleged offence and trial in the case of certain allegations. Exculpatory evidence may be unavailable to an accused person for countless reasons; yet again, that fact by no means leads of itself to a permanent stay.
	
	
	Sixthly, the position adopted by the applicant is an understandable one. And I accept that all of the proposed remedies have their drawbacks. Having said that, the use of a pseudonym or a generic reference to the alleged man at the gym is said to be unsatisfactory, as it will not permit the lawyers for the applicant properly to investigate that person. A closed court is said to be unsatisfactory, because persons could readily infer that inculpatory evidence is being given about them from the closure of the court itself. The applicant is not prepared to receive protection from the authorities, because that would require him to be completely frank with police about the reason why he needs that protection, including naming the person, and he will not do so.
	
	
	As I say, one can accept all of that. But there comes a point at which, whilst accepting that no option is perfect (whether on its own or combined with others in the suite of options), nevertheless one comes to the view that the applicant must simply make his decisions on the basis of the options open to him. Yet again, people caught up in the criminal justice system – including completely innocent ones – are sometimes placed in the invidious position of needing to decide whether they will accept police protection and, in extreme circumstances, start their life again by way of an altered identity, or decline that protection and run the risk of harm or death.
	
	
	In short, seen in the context in which the criminal justice system operates, the threats made to the applicant and his family are to be deplored; I do not accept that they are exceptional, let alone unique.
	
	
	Having set out the general principles that I believe apply to this matter, I turn to determine the particular grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1


	
	I repeat Ground 1 for convenience:
	


His Honour erred by failing to have regard to the prejudice suffered by the Applicant in circumstances where the relevant person was not named.


	
	This ground may be dealt with shortly. A reading of the judgment shows that his Honour was well aware of the prejudice that would be suffered by the applicant if the person whom he claimed he had met at City Gym were not to be named. So much is apparent from the following extracts from the judgment.
	
	
	First, his Honour noted the potential prejudice when recounting the submissions of the applicant at p 62 of the Appeal Book:
	


… if the threats are real, as Mr Thangaraj [senior counsel for the applicant] contends they are, it would result, in effect, in the absence of a crucial witness or crucial evidence supportive of the accused’s case.


	
	Secondly, his Honour observed the potential prejudice when discussing the options available to the applicant at p 64 of the Appeal Book:
	


The second possibility is the accused gives evidence and does not name persons. The risk, as Mr Thangaraj [senior counsel for the applicant] argues in summary, is that the defence is weakened because of any inability of the defence to adduce evidence supportive of the proposition that the co-offender or co-accused was indeed a criminal.

…

The fourth [option] is that the accused does not give evidence. As I say, accepting at face value the defence of this accused, in my view, if through no acts of his own this accused is prevented from speaking up in his defence in the way his counsel suggests he wishes to do so, that would be a fundamental defect in this trial.


	
	Thirdly, his Honour considered the potential prejudice when balancing the competing factors in his final determination at pp 64-65 of the Appeal Book:
	


… In my view, ultimately I consider the accused would not be deprived of a fair trial if he gave evidence and did not name the persons involved… I accept that on one view if a person or persons were named and identified there could be more powerful evidence supporting the defence.

…

I consider if the accused chose to give evidence but not name names or perhaps to a lesser extent gave evidence in a closed court… that both those mechanisms would allow him to put his substantive defence before a jury.


	
	Because these extracts show that his Honour manifestly had regard to the subject matter that founds the ground, I consider that this ground should be rejected.
	


Ground 2


	
	I repeat Ground 2 for convenience:
	


His Honour erred by finding that a closed court would allow the Applicant to put his substantive defence before the jury.


	
	Again, I consider that this ground can be dealt with shortly. A reading of the judgment shows that his Honour was well aware of the arguments for and against closing the court. Indeed, his Honour referred explicitly to the potential for that course of itself to lead to the malefactors believing (correctly or otherwise) that the applicant was in the process of implicating them. At p 64 of the Appeal Book, his Honour said:
	


The risk, according to Mr Thangaraj, and there is some merit in this submission if I might say, is that the persons who might be the subject of the disclosure could send agents to the Court in order to listen to the evidence which the accused might give, and they are confronted with a closed court, would automatically assume there was to be a disclosure of their identity. Once again, if one follows that logic through, there is clearly a risk of injury or death still remaining.


	
	The availability of this ameliorative step was canvassed in the judgment, and its advantages and disadvantages weighed up. His Honour considered the fairness of the trial of the accused; the ability of the accused to put forward a proper defence; and the disadvantages outlined above in relation to the inferences that may be drawn from closing the court. His Honour contrasted this to the public interest in the prosecution of a serious crime, and the principles of open justice, and determined that the applicant could still put his substantive defence before a jury if he gave evidence in a closed court.
	
	
	As well as that, what his Honour actually said about the topic at p 65 of the Appeal Book is this:
	


However, the balancing of the competing considerations on the one hand and the fairness of the accused’s trial, allowing him to put a proper defence and the undoubted public interest which the Courts have expressed in the prosecution of serious crime, I consider if the accused chose to give evidence but not name names or perhaps to a lesser extent gave evidence in closed court – although as I said there are riders to that proposition – that both those mechanisms would allow him to put his substantive defence before a jury. Not everything he might wish, but certainly his substantive defence before the jury with a significant explanation as to why he could not be more forthcoming. The Crown has indicated in any event, that she would not press in any cross-examination, the accused to name any names, given the circumstances.


	
	To my mind, his Honour was saying that, if the applicant gave evidence in a closed court, recounted the alleged meeting about steroids at City Gym, but did not name the person with whom he met, adopting that course would put the substantive defence of his mistaken belief in the nature of the items imported before the jury. That statement is objectively correct, as is his Honour’s appreciation that that would not be the entirety of the evidence that the applicant could give.
	
	
	I do not accept that his Honour approached this issue erroneously, or determined it erroneously. This ground should therefore be rejected.
	


Ground 3


	
	It is clear that this ground focuses on the outcome at first instance, not the process of reasoning that led to it, in accordance with the last leg of House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40. Yet again, I believe that, in light of the overarching principles to which I have referred, it can be determined shortly.
	
	
	I determine no error at all in the outcome of this matter at first instance. To the contrary, I would have regarded any other outcome in the circumstances that I have outlined as being wrong, and liable to correction on appeal.
	
	
	It follows that this ground should also be rejected.
	


Orders


	
	It is for the above reasons that I joined in the following orders when judgment was reserved:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	N ADAMS J: I agree with Button J.

		31 October 2016",2016-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2800972,Seckold v R [2016] NSWDC 274,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against a sentence passed by Magistrate George sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 20 November 2015.
	
	
	The appellant was charged that on 3 October 2015 at Potts Point he did have in his possession a prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine. The appellant pleaded guilty to that offence. The amount of methylamphetamine found in his possession was 0.44 grams. Under the taxonomy of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act the small amount of methylamphetamine is one gram, the indictable quantity is five grams, the commercial quantity is 250 grams and a large commercial quantity is 500 grams. The amount found in the appellant’s possession clearly is at the bottom of the range. Even on that taxonomy it clearly would only be appropriate for personal use.
	
	
	3 October 2015 was a Saturday. The offence occurred at around 2.52am so that the offence should be seen as having occurred on a Friday night. The appellant was then living in North Sydney and he had gone to Kings Cross with some acquaintances. He had visited a nightspot called “Candys” and had temporarily left the nightspot but when he attempted to re‑enter he had some interaction with security guards. Police who were nearby observed the appellant to yell at the security guards and push one of them on the chest. The appellant then turned and began to run eastwards on Bayswater Road but was followed by the police and tackled to the ground after it was alleged that he failed to heed a police instruction to stop.
	
	
	Whilst the appellant was still on the ground police noticed him pull with his right hand out of the pocket of his trousers a clear resealable bag containing a small amount of white “granular substance” which the appellant attempted to throw away. Police then handcuffed the appellant, arrested him and cautioned him in relation to what he had just attempted to throw away. The appellant then admitted to the police that it was “speed”. When asked how he came by that the appellant said that he had found the substance in the toilets of Candys nightspot but the appellant agreed in his oral evidence today that that was a “fairy story” and that he had been given the substance sometime previously by some acquaintances whom he now admits to have been a negative influence upon him. Formal testing of the drug ascertained it to be 0.44 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The appellant had no prior conviction for any offence. Magistrate George imposed a fine of $500. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for two years and or a fine of $2,200. The appellant asks me to deal with him under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The appellant at the time of the offence and at the current time is 20 years old. As already said, he has no criminal conviction and he came before the Local Court and he comes before this Court as a young man of prior good character. He attended St Pauls Grammar School, a campus of the Cranbrook School on the Hawkesbury, and completed the School Certificate there. He then undertook an apprenticeship as an air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanic. At the time he committed this offence the appellant was still an apprentice but has subsequently completed his apprenticeship and is now a qualified tradesman.
	
	
	The appellant’s family home is on the Bells Line of Road at Kurmond. His mother provided a reference. In it, after speaking of her son as being a loyal son, as being respectable, kind and caring, and extremely thoughtful she said this:
	


“When Lachlan told me about his offence I was in disbelief, this is completely out of character for him as he prefers spending time with his family and close friends, rather than partying and going to nightclubs.

Lachlan has always been taught to tell the truth and accept responsibility for his actions and as a result has pleaded guilty [to] this charge.”

The appellant’s then team leader with his then employer, the employer to whom he was indentured and his current employer since his obtaining his qualification, said this:

“Over the three years Lachlan has been employed..., he has demonstrated himself to be a reliable, responsible, and punctual individual and is a very conscientious and diligent worker. Lachlan has demonstrated time and again, his commitment by ensuring all tasks asked of him are completed in a timely manner and to a high standard.

I consider Lachlan to be a person of good character and am pleased to provide this reference for him.”

I have omitted between those two paragraphs another paragraph in which Mr Marson related his being advised by the appellant of the charge which he was facing and of his intention to plead guilty to it.


	
	In his letter to the Local Court the appellant referred to his foolishness and his deep concern about the impact a conviction might have on his current employment and his future career opportunities. He concluded his letter with this paragraph:
	


“I am a hardworking individual and am not particularly outgoing. Peer pressure in an alien environment caused a lapse in my judgment and I realise that this is a mistake that has the potential to carry a heavy burden.”

The appellant admitted in cross-examination that he had been given this substance by a friend about 12 months previously. He had used it on four occasions previously and it had given him a “buzz”. He took some on the evening of the offence to give himself Dutch courage to enhance his approach to a young lady. He agreed that the “peer pressure” to which he referred in his letter was a reference to a person and others who had given him the drug and he attested on oath that he has now broken off those associations.


	
	Everything in the current case points to a hardworking, well behaved, well‑intentioned young man who acted foolishly under negative peer pressure and has now learnt the error of his way. The Crown’s only concern expressed to the appellant in cross-examination is whether a s 10 order may be insufficient penalty for the appellant’s keeping this substance in his possession over a protracted period and using it from time to time until caught out by the police.
	
	
	If the appellant had merely been handed the substance at the nightspot on the evening in question to “try it” when he was intoxicated, as he clearly was by alcohol on this evening, one could understand a s 10 dismissal. However, in the circumstances this calls not for a s 10 dismissal but for an order requiring the appellant to enter into a good behaviour bond so that he realises that he must continue in his current resolve never to commit another offence, to have, so to speak, the Court overseeing his behaviour over the next year to make sure he conforms with the desire and intention he expressed in his oral evidence today.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the conviction recorded and the sentence passed by the Downing Centre Local Court on 20 November 2015.
	
	
	Lachlan Ross Seckold, under s 10 over the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without proceeding to a conviction but having regard to your good character and age, I am satisfied that it is expedient to release you on a good behaviour bond. I order that you be released on a good behaviour bond for a period of one year from today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at [redacted], or
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of this Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.
	



	
	Do you understand all that, Mr Seckold?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: To be of good behaviour means you have to obey the law. All right.
	
	
	BALDEO: May it please the Court.
	
	
	JOVANCEVIC: Please the Court.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The police asked the magistrate to make a drug destruction order, was that made?
	
	
	BALDEO: That was made on the last occasion. Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: All right. I reiterate the drug destruction order.

1
         
 The accused Soosainathan s/o Dass Saminathan (“the accused”) was charged with the offence of murder.
 
 Under s 302 of the Penal Code, this is a capital offence.
 
 The murder was allegedly committed between 12am and 6.14am of 5 August 2002 at the accused’s flat at Blk 629 Hougang Avenue 8 #09-82 (“the Flat”).
 
 The victim was a six-month old Indonesian female infant by the name of Anjeli Elisaputri (“the baby”).
 
 The time of 6.14am was the time the police had sent a patrol car in response to a telephone call.
 
 The patrol call arrived at Blk 629 at 6.24am.
 
2
         
 It was not disputed that the baby’s body was found by the police at about 7.40am of 5 August 2002 in a bin at the bottom of a rubbish chute connected to the Flat and that it was the baby’s mother Widiyarti Binte Kartanom (“Widiyarti”) who had called the police.
EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION
3
         
 The prosecution relied on several witnesses including Widiyarti and her boyfriend Jalil Bin Hameed.
 
 I will first summarise the general lay evidence for the prosecution.
General lay evidence
4
         
 Jalil, an Indian national, came to Singapore illegally in 2001 (NE 459).
 
 In Singapore, he came to know Widiyarti when he was working at a Malay foodstall in Hougang (NE 460).
 
 Widiyarti, an Indonesian, was then working as a domestic maid.
5
         
 Jalil and Widiyarti fell in love, and Widiyarti became pregnant with Jalil’s baby.
 
 This was the baby.
 
 Widiyarti stopped working and returned to Jakarta on 24 August 2001.
6
         
 Widiyarti returned to Singapore on 1 September 2001 to meet Jalil.
 
 After Jalil was arrested by the police for an immigration offence a few days later, Widiyarti went to Batam, Indonesia (NE 172).
 
 Widiyarti gave birth to the baby on 22 January 2002.
7
         
 Although they never went through any marriage ceremony, Jalil and Widiyarti regarded each other as husband and wife.
 
 Widiyarti even obtained a false marriage certificate in Batam stating that she is married to Jalil.
8
         
 In April 2002, when the baby was about three months old, Widiyarti brought the baby to visit Jalil in Singapore, who was then released on a special pass after having served a sentence for his immigration offence.
 
 He did not have any money to go back to India and was provided a job.
 
 Widiyarti brought the baby to Singapore to visit Jalil on four other occasions between April and August 2002, including 4 August 2002 (NE 273).
9
         
 In order to maintain Widiyarti and the baby in Batam, Jalil breached the conditions of the special pass and ran away to look for other jobs that could give him a higher income. Jalil would then forward some of the money he had earned to Widiyarti through his landlady and later through the accused whom he had come to know.
 
 Jalil would pay the accused for his travel expenses to Batam. Jalil’s last place of work up to the time of the death of the baby was a roti prata stall in C Place Food Court at No 2 Corporation Road.
10
       
 On 4 August 2002, at about 11am, Widiyarti and the baby arrived at the World Trade Centre, Singapore.
 
 Widiyarti took a taxi and brought the baby to Blk 629 Hougang Ave 8.
 
 At the void deck of the block, Widiyarti contacted the accused.
 
11
       
 Subsequently, Widiyarti met up with the accused and he brought Widiyarti and the baby to the Flat.
 
 Widiyarti and the baby would stay at the Flat or the flat of a friend of the accused whenever they came to Singapore to visit Jalil (NE 176).
 
 Up to 4 August 2002, the accused was very fond of the baby having bought Pampers, diapers and toys for her and taking her for walks.
12
       
 On 4 August 2002, at 3.26pm, the accused called the handphone of another person by the name of Joseph to reach Jalil.
 
 The accused informed Jalil that Widiyarti and the baby were at the Flat.
 
 Jalil told the accused to let them stay at the Flat and he would go over to the Flat later that night.
 
 Jalil said he then spoke to Widiyarti and told her that he would meet her and the baby later that night (NE 472).
 
 Jalil’s intention was to collect the salary that Joseph owed him first and then meet up with Widiyarti and the baby.
 
 Widiyarti denied that she had spoken to Jalil at about that time (NE 399).
13
       
 According to Jalil, when he approached Joseph for his salary, Joseph said he could only pay him on the following day.
 
 So Jalil changed his plan about going to the Flat that night.
14
       
 At about 7pm and/or 8pm, Jalil called the accused’s handphone and informed him and Widiyarti that he was not going over to the Flat that night i.e 4 August 2002.
 
 Both Jalil and Widiyarti denied that they had quarrelled that night over money or over his not caring for Widiyarti and the baby.
15
       
 At about 11.30pm, while Widiyarti and the baby were sleeping in the guestroom of the Flat, the accused unlocked and opened the door of the guestroom.
 
 He took the baby away from Widiyarti who was taken by surprise.
 
 Before Widiyarti could do anything, the accused took the baby to his bedroom and closed his bedroom door but Widiyarti did not attempt to open the accused’s bedroom door.
 
 The key to the guestroom was subsequently found by the police in a storeroom of the Flat.
16
       
 Soon after, Widiyarti heard the baby crying loudly in the accused’s bedroom.
 
 She knocked on the accused’s bedroom door and asked for the return of the baby.
 
 However, the accused did not open his bedroom door or respond to Widiyarti’s plea.
17
       
 Soon thereafter, the baby’s cries stopped and Widiyarti heard the sound of toys in the accused’s bedroom and the sound of patting like the accused trying to put the baby to sleep.
 
 Widiyarti also heard the baby making some sound like she was playing with her saliva.
18
       
 On 5 August 2002, between 12am and 5am, Widiyarti waited in the living room outside the accused’s bedroom.
 
 At about 2 plus or 3am, she knocked again on the door of the accused’s bedroom but there was no response.
 
 She then tried to peep into the accused’s bedroom from the kitchen toilet but could only see the light in the bedroom.
 
 At about 3am, Widiyarti heard the opening and closing of the accused’s bedroom door once.
 
 She presumed that the accused had opened the door to check on whether she was asleep or not.
 
 She said she had dozed off until about 5am (NE 205).
 
 She did not notice the accused leaving the Flat or anyone else coming into the Flat between 12am and 5am.
19
       
 At about 5 plus in the morning, Widiyarti opened the main door of the Flat.
 
 She stood outside and brought along a newspaper as she was bored.
 
 She saw a female neighbour leaving for work and wanted to speak to her but this neighbour had left.
 
 At about 6am, Widiyarti then returned into the Flat.
 
 She knocked on the door of the accused’s bedroom.
20
       
 When the accused opened the door, Widiyarti asked the accused for the baby and the accused said that the baby was sleeping.
 
 However, Widiyarti did not see the baby on the bed in his bedroom.
 
 Instead, she saw the mattress of the bed covered with a brown bed-sheet and two pillows with blue pillow slips.
 
 She also noticed a black haversack placed on top of a stool in front of the bedroom toilet.
 
 The bag appeared bulky.
 
 Widiyarti continued to ask for the baby and eventually the accused replied that someone had taken the baby away.
 
 Widiyarti then scolded the accused and became panicky and the accused then suggested that they go and make a police report.
 
 He came out of his bedroom, locked the door to his bedroom and left the Flat.
21
       
 Widiyarti did not follow the accused because she knew he could not be trusted.
 
 She shouted the baby’s name and went to a flat next door to seek help.
22
       
 Gan Ai Lan (PW 16), a tenant staying in unit #09-84 testified that she was awakened at past 6am on 5 August 2002 by the sound of the ringing doorbell to her flat.
 
 When she opened the door, she saw Widiyarti.
 
 She testified that Widiyarti told her in Malay words to the effect, ‘Help, help, my child is missing’.
 
 She observed Widiyarti rubbing her hands appearing nervous.
 
 However, Gan Ai Lan told Widiyarti that she could not help and she closed the door on Widiyarti.
23
       
 Widiyarti then returned to the Flat.
 
 She took her passport, the baby’s photo and an Indonesian passport (Exhibits P255 and P256) with her.
 
 The Indonesian passport bore the name and particulars of one “Sifenies Simon” (“the smuggled passport”).
 
 Widiyarti had brought the smuggled passport from Batam to Singapore to see if Jalil could use it to go to Batam.
24
       
 Widiyarti then went to the void deck of Blk 629, Hougang Ave 8 and called the police from a public telephone.
 
 Thereafter, she tore and threw the smuggled passport into a blue rubbish bin as she feared the police would question her about it.
 
 While waiting for the police to arrive, Widiyarti saw the accused coming down from another staircase of Blk 629, Hougang Ave 8, and walking away from the block.
 
 She called the police a second time as she was getting impatient.
25
       
 When the police arrived at about 6.24am, Widiyarti informed Cpl Siti (PW 17) about what had happened.
 
 Widiyarti then brought Cpl Siti and other officers to the Flat.
 
 When they reached the Flat, they noticed that the metal grille gate was locked with a padlock.
 
 Widiyarti recalled that when she left the Flat earlier, she did not lock the metal grille gate with the padlock.
 
 Widiyarti unlocked the padlock as she had the key to it.
26
       
 Upon entering the Flat, the police officers searched for the baby.
 
 The police officers could not search the accused’s bedroom because his bedroom door was locked and Widiyarti did not have the key to the accused’s bedroom door.
 
 Widiyarti then provided the police officers with the accused’s handphone number.
 
 Sgt Pek then used his handphone to call the accused, but there was no response.
 
 However, a short while later, the accused called Sgt Pek on his handphone, and Sgt Pek identified himself and told the accused to return to the Flat.
27
       
 Shortly after, at about 6.45am, the accused came back to the Flat.
 
 There was some inconsistency between the evidence of Widiyarti, Cpl Siti and Station Inspector (“SI”)
 
 Varen Chew Hwee Huan (PW 20) as to whether Widiyarti had asked the accused about the baby when he came back and his reply.
28
       
 The accused was told to unlock and open the door of his bedroom and he did.
 
 The police officers searched his bedroom.
 
 They could not find the baby.
 
 Neither did they find the brown bed-sheet on the accused’s bed which Widiyarti had seen earlier.
 
 However a blue bed-sheet was lying loose on top of the bed.
 
 When the police asked for the black haversack that Widiyarti had previously seen, the accused took out an empty black haversack from the wardrobe in his bedroom.
 
 Widiyarti noticed that the stool on which the haversack had been placed had been moved.
29
       
 At about 7.10am, SI R Venubalan (PW 22) arrived at the Flat with SC
 
 N. Bashiruddeen (PW 21).
 
 SI Venubalan searched the accused’s bedroom and found a blood stain (marked “D” and seen in Photo P47), on the wall near the bedroom window and a crumpled black adhesive tape (marked ‘HA 43’ [Exhibit P214]), on the compressor of the air-conditioner just outside the window of the bedroom. 
 
 SI Venubalan noticed that there were some blood stains on the crumpled black adhesive tape (marked ‘HA 43’ [Exhibit P214]).
 
 He suspected that the baby might have been injured or already dead.
 
 He thus gave instructions to his officers to search for the baby, and the search included looking at the rubbish chute serving the Flat.
 
 Other blood stains were also found in the accused’s bedroom (marked “A” and “B”, see Photo P44 and P45).

 At about 7.40am, SC Bashiruddeen found the baby in a rubbish bin below a rubbish chute that was connected to the Flat.
 
 The baby was wrapped in a green towel (marked ‘HA 32’ [Exhibit P203]) and covered in the brown bed-sheet (marked ‘HA 31’ [Exhibit P202]) which Widiyarti claimed to have seen earlier at about 6am before she went down to call the police and throw away the smuggled passport.
 
 I would elaborate that the brown bed-sheet, which is seen in Photo P17, is a bed-sheet with a reddish brown criss-cross pattern with a green floral design.
 
 Widiyarti denied that the brown bed-sheet was given to her by the accused on 4 August 2002 (NE 427 and 428).
31
       
 The baby was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedic, Goh Li Huang (PW 9) at 8.08am.
 
 At about 10.55am, Dr Gilbert Lau (PW 23), a Forensic Pathologist, conducted a preliminary examination of the body of the baby at the scene i.e below the block of flats at Blk 629.
 
Evidence on Jalil’s whereabouts in the night of 4 August and early morning of 5 August 2002
32
       
 Jalil’s evidence was that he and two others Raghavan and Joseph left the roti prata stall where he worked and went to Boon Lay at past 7pm of 4 August 2002.
 
 Joseph is the same person mentioned in paras 12 and 13 above.
 
 Raghavan also worked at the same roti prata stall.
 
 They returned from Boon Lay to their stall at about 11pm (NE 473 to 475).
 
 Shortly thereafter, another co-worker Manikandan also came back to their stall.
 
 They then bought chicken rice at a stall next to theirs and ate.
 
 Thereafter Raghavan and Manikandan prepared curry for their stall while Joseph and he were watching television.
 
 Manikandan then went to sleep followed by Raghavan.
 
 Joseph and Jalil were playing video games till about 2.30am when they went to sleep (NE 483).
 
 At 5.30am, Manikandan and Jalil woke up to begin operating their stall.
33
       
 Jalil’s evidence was corroborated to a large extent by Raghavan (PW 31) who had given evidence earlier.
 
 Raghavan confirmed that he, Joseph and Manikandan were working at the same roti prata stall.
 
 On 4 August 2002, he, Jalil and Joseph went to Boon Lay from the stall, which was not operating that day, which was a Sunday.
 
 They returned to the stall at about 10 or 10.30pm.
 
 They, together with Manikandan then ate at the stall next to their stall.
 
 Thereafter, at about midnight, Raghavan prepared curry for their stall.
 
 Then Jalil, Joseph and Manikandan were playing games at a coin machine nearby.
 
 He joined them and subsequently went to sleep at about 1am at a staircase landing nearby.
 
 The other three persons joined him at the sleeping area about half an hour later.
 
 When he woke up at about 8.30am or 9am, the other three persons were already awake and working at the stall.
34
       
 Jalil’s evidence was also corroborated to a large extent by another witness Mdm Khatijah Beevee d/o Mohamed Hussain (PW 40).
 
 She and her husband operated a Malay food stall at C Place Food Court.
 
 She referred to one “Khalil” but identified Jalil as “Khalil” (NE 541).
 
 According to Mdm Khatijah, Jalil come to her stall at about midnight of 4 August 2002 to buy four plates of chicken rice.
 
 After serving him, she and her husband left their stall and returned at about 1.30am.
 
 She saw Jalil, and the other three persons I have mentioned, watching VCD at their stall.
 
 At about 2am, she saw all four of them going over to the game machine section of the food court.
 
 She then saw them again at about 3am at the same section.
 
 Thereafter, she presumed they had gone to sleep.
 
 At about 6am, she saw Jalil and one of his co-workers starting to prepare their stall for business.
Toxicology examination
35
       
 Dr Danny Lo Siaw Teck (PW 8) of the Health Sciences Authority found chlorpheniramine 0.45 µg/ml i.e microgrammes per millilitre and traces of diphenhydramine in the blood of the baby.
 
 A sample of liver tissue of the baby was found to contain chlorpheniramine 1.7 µg/ml.
 
36
       
 According to him, chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine obtainable through prescription.
 
 It is an active ingredient in many cold remedies such as Contact, Decolgen, Milidon and Panaflu.
 
 The therapeutic level of chlorpheniramine was reported to be 0.017 µg/ml of either serum or blood for adults (NE 27) and the toxic level was reported to be 20 to 30 µg/ml.
 
 The side effects of chlorpheniramine include drowsiness and dizziness.
 
 He was unable to say what the effect of 30 times the normal adult therapeutic level in a six-month old baby would be although he accepted it was possible that it could kill such a baby (NE 28).
37
       
 Diphenhydramine is also an antihistamine obtainable through prescription.
 
 It is found in many cough and cold remedies such as Benadryl and Allerin.
38
       
 Dr Singam S B (PW 14) was a medical officer at Hougang Polyclinic.
 
 Her evidence was that the accused had gone to Hougang Polyclinic for consultation on three occasions.
 
 On the third occasion on 17 June 2002, he had consulted her for cough and cold lasting two days.
 
 He was prescribed, inter alia:
(a)
       
 Tablet Chlorpheneramine 4mg three times a day,
(b)
       
 Diphenhydramine 10ml three times a day.
39
       
 Dr Azman Bin Osman (PW 24) was a medical officer with Life-Link Clinic & Surgery in Serangoon North Avenue 1.
 
 He said that he had seen the baby on 9 June 2002.
 
 She had had a fever, cough and running nose for one day.
 
 She was treated symptomatically with paracetamol and promethazine.
40
       
 Widiyarti’s evidence was that she did not give the baby any medicine on 4 August 2002.
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (“DNA”) Evidence
41
       
 Dr Jasmine Heng (PW 35) of the Health Sciences Authority gave DNA evidence.
42
       
 The baby’s DNA profile was found on the crumpled adhesive tape, marked ‘HA 43’ (Exhibit P214), recovered from the compressor of the air-conditioner outside the window of the accused’s bedroom.
 
 However, no DNA profile of the accused was found on that crumpled tape.
43
       
 A light brown towel, marked ‘HA 33’ (Exhibit P204), hung near the window of the accused’s bedroom, contained blood stains of the baby (in two areas) and of the accused (in one of the two areas).
44
       
 The two pillows recovered from the accused’s bedroom, marked ‘HA 40’ and ‘HA 41’ (Exhibits P211 and P212), contained blood stains.
 
 There were blood stains on two areas of ‘HA 40’.
 
 The baby’s blood was found in both areas and the accused’s blood was found in one of the two areas.
 
 The baby’s blood was also found on ‘HA 41’.
45
       
 In Dr Heng’s report, she said she was not able to confirm that the four stains found in the accused’s bedroom and marked ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘D’ (‘A’ having two stains, see Photo P44) were blood.
 
 In her oral evidence at NE 292, she said the exhibits showed very little stain and while they showed positive in the screening test for blood, she was not able to do a confirmatory test.
 
 She went ahead with DNA extraction from these stains but the amount was insufficient to obtain a DNA profile.
Evidence on various items
46
       
 Dr Tay Ming Kiong (PW 35) an analyst with the Health Sciences Authority also gave evidence.
47
       
 From his report and evidence:
(a)
       
 The crumpled black adhesive tape (“the crumpled tape”) found on the compressor of the air-conditioner outside the accused’s bedroom, marked ‘HA 43’ (Exhibit P214), matched a roll of black adhesive tape (“the roll of tape”), marked ‘HA 50’ (Exhibit P221), found on the first shelf of a row of shelves in the accused’s bedroom.
 
 It also matched black particles found on a pair of foldable scissors, marked ‘HA 52’ (Exhibit P223), on the said first shelf.
 
 It was therefore consistent to say that the foldable scissors had been used to cut the roll of tape and/or the crumpled tape.
(b)
       
 Two red fibres and a white fibre found on the crumpled tape were consistent with having come from the baby’s red dress which was found in the bin with the baby’s body.
(c)
       
 The material of an off-white glove on the said first shelf, marked ‘HA 51’ (Exhibit P222), was similar to the material of another off-white glove on the second shelf of the same row of shelves, marked ‘HA 55’ (Exhibit P226).
(d)
       
 Metallic particles found on each glove were found to contain similar elemental composition to metallic particles found on the other glove and on the crumpled tape.
 
 Furthermore, the metallic particles from the crumpled tape and the two gloves were found to have similar surface textures.
48
       
 Thus, the prosecution submitted that the evidence of Dr Tay would lead to the conclusion that the pair of foldable scissors was used to cut the crumpled tape and the roll of tape.
 
 The two gloves were worn and used in the cutting.
 
 The crumpled tape had come into contact with the red dress of the baby either directly or indirectly as might occur if gloves were used to touch the red dress and then the crumpled tape.
49
       
 According to Dr Tay, a yellow earring, marked ‘HA 53’ (Exhibit P224), which was found on the top of the row of shelves in the accused’s bedroom was similar in material, density and design to a earring, marked ‘HA 54’ (Exhibit P225), found on the baby’s right ear.
Evidence on knots
50
       
 Lim Chin Chin (PW 38), an analyst from the Health Sciences Authority, gave evidence on the knots which tied the baby and knots found in the Flat.
 
 She was of the view that the overall manner in which the baby was tied, as shown in Photo P65 to 67, suggested that the person who tied the baby was experienced in tying (NE 373).
Evidence of Operation Manager of previous employer of the accused
51
       
 The accused was previously employed by Mammoet Singapore Pte Ltd (“Mammoet”) as a rigger in October 1997.
 
 Mammoet dealt with crane rental, engineered heavy lifting and multi-modal transport.
 
 According to Mr Lee Hoong Cheong (PW 26), an Operation Manager of Mammoet, the accused’s duties involved lashing and tying the lattice boom of cranes.
 
 The accused was required to climb and not be afraid of heights and the accused would have gained knowledge in various methods of tying and slinging ropes.
 
 In 1998, the accused was involved in an industrial accident and sustained fractured ribs after which he was given light duty till he resigned.
Forensic Evidence
52
       
 As I have mentioned, Dr Gilbert Lau was the Forensic Pathologist who had conducted a preliminary examination of the baby’s body at the scene. He estimated the time of death to be between 3am and 5am of 5 August 2002 (NE 113).
 
 However, he accepted that the time of death could have been at about 6am of 5 August 2002 (NE 114).
 
 He also conducted an autopsy subsequently on the next day.
53
       
 He found the wrists and ankles of the baby bound together in a hogtie behind her back, with a white ligature, with multiple discoid bruises on her forehead, face and chest.
 
 Her lips were also bruised and the frenulum of the upper lip was lacerated.
 
 The hymen was completely torn down to the fourchette and there was some bruising in the lower part of the vagina just above the torn hymen.
54
       
 In Dr Lau’s opinion, the baby had been sexually abused.
 
 As for the suggestion by Defence Counsel, Mr Subhas Anandan, that when Widiyarti had been bathing the baby, her hand and fingers could have slipped so that her fingers penetrated into the baby’s vagina sufficiently to completely tear the hymen, this drew a strong response of disbelief from Dr Lau who described the suggestion as “really preposterous” (NE 108).
 
 Furthermore, when Widiyarti was on the witness stand, Mr Anandan did not ask her whether such an incident had occurred.
 
 Neither did the defence call any expert to refute Dr Lau’s views.
55
       
 I would add that Dr Lau’s opinion of sexual abuse was based both on the vaginal penetration and the hogtying of the baby.
 
 Although the case before me was his only experience in examining a six-month old infant hogtied in the same manner which the baby was, I did not think it diluted the weight to be given to his evidence.
 
 He had done about ten autopsies of victims who had been hogtied, although not in exactly the same manner and not of the same age.
 
 I would not have expected to find many victims in Singapore of the same tender age as the baby hogtied in the same manner.
56
       
 In the circumstances, I concluded that the baby had been sexually abused.
57
                
 
In Dr Lau’s opinion, the discoid bruises on the forehead, face and chest of the baby were consistent with the application of fingertip pressure to these parts of the body.
 
 These, together with the conjunctival, infraorbital and pulmonary petechial haemorrhages suggested an element of mechanical asphyxia, possibly by way of smothering.
 
 However, this was not the cause of death although it might have rendered the baby unconscious (NE 98 to 99).
58
                
 
In Dr Lau’s opinion, death was due to a severe head injury caused by a fall from a height, with primary impact upon the top of the head.
 
 In his view, the fall was more likely to have been caused by the baby having been thrown down a rubbish chute from a height like the nineth floor of a block of flats rather than having been dropped from an unknown height within the Flat (NE 93 to 96).
59
       
 In the course of the trial, the prosecution elaborated that it was relying on s 300(b) or (d) of the Penal Code for the offence of murder. 
 
 Section 300(b) and (d) state:
300.
     
 Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder -
(b)
     
 if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused;
(d)
     
 if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death, or such injury as aforesaid.
60
       
 It was not disputed that should I find that the accused had dropped the baby’s body down the rubbish chute from the Flat, the prosecution would have proved its case.
    
EVIDENCE OF THE ACCUSED
61
       
 The Defence made a submission of no case to answer.
 
 After I had ruled that there was a case to answer, the accused elected to give evidence.
 
 He was the only witness for the defence.
 
 I summarise his evidence below.
62
       
 He said his relationship with Widiyarti was like brother and sister (NE 630).
 
 He said that there was no quarrel or animosity between Widiyarti and him or Jalil and him.
63
       
 However, he also said that on 4 August 2002 when Widiyarti came with the baby to Singapore, he had asked her and she had told him that she had come with another male person.
 
 She had asked him to allow this man to stay at his flat but he had refused and she was a little angry (NE 635, 639).
64
       
 The accused claimed that the brown bed-sheet (seen in Photo P17 and in which the baby was found wrapped) was provided by him to Widiyarti on 4 August 2002.
 
 He had also provided her with a white bed-sheet with blue lines and coloured boxes (see NE 640, para 8 of SI Varen Chew’s statement and Photo P51).
 
 Likewise a towel found hanging on a raffia string in his bedroom (seen in Photo P35) and black tape was also given to Widiyarti that day (NE 640, 735 and 736).
65
       
 He said Jalil called twice in the evening of 4 August 2002.
 
 For the first call at around 7pm, Jalil told him that he was not able to come to the Flat and asked him to pass the message to Widiyarti but he asked Jalil to speak to her himself.
 
 He then passed Jalil’s call to Widiyarti and it appeared as though there was some misunderstanding between them as Widiyarti raised her voice and appeared irritated (NE 642 and 643).
 
 The accused said Widiyarti told him that she had already brought a passport for Jalil to go to Indonesia.
66
       
 For the second call at around 8pm, the accused simply passed Jalil’s call to Widiyarti.
 
 Widiyarti spoke angrily and after that she asked him (the accused) whether Jalil had a girlfriend (NE 643).
67
       
 At about 11pm, Widiyarti went to the guestroom to feed the baby.
 
 Thereafter, he went into the guestroom and took the baby with Widiyarti’s permission.
 
 The door to the guestroom was open (NE 713) and the baby was sleeping (NE 645).
 
 He said he took the baby away to his bedroom because Widiyarti was depressed and angry and he told her to calm down and to watch TV (which was in the living room).
 
 He would take the baby with him and did so (NE 645).
 
 The accused said he did not lock his bedroom door and he went to sleep at around 11.45pm.
68
       
 Then at around 12.30am (of 5 August 2002), Widiyarti and a man came and took the baby.
 
 The man looked like Jalil (NE 648).
 
 I will refer to this alleged man as “Mr X”.
 
 The accused claimed he had told the police that Mr X looked like Jalil (NE 661 and 669).
 
 In cross-examination, he said that he initially thought Jalil was Mr X but, by the time Widiyarti and Mr X had brought the baby to the guestroom, he had concluded that Jalil was not Mr X because Jalil would wake him up even if he was sleeping (NE 721 to 724).
 
69
       
 According to the accused, the baby was sleeping on one of the pillows in his bedroom and Widiyarti took the baby along with the pillow.
 
 The accused was feeling sleepy and tipsy.
 
 The baby started to cry and he saw the baby being taken to the guestroom and the door thereof was then closed.
 
 As the baby was still crying, he got up, went to the door of the guestroom and told Widiyarti that the baby was still crying.
 
 He was concerned that the police would come if the crying did not abate.
 
 Widiyarti replied, “All right, all right”.
 
 The TV in the living room was still switched on and the main door to the Flat was open.
 
 He closed the main door and switched off the TV.
 
 He heard the noise of the baby being pacified and about 20 minutes later, the baby stopped crying.
70
       
 At about 1.30am or 1.45am, Widiyarti came in and switched on the light of the toilet attached to the accused’s bedroom.
 
 She took the towel that was hanging on the raffia string in his bedroom and put it in a pail.
 
 She hung a green towel back in its place.
 
 She then opened the window in his bedroom and looked out.
 
 Then she meddled with things which were on shelves in his bedroom although he did not know what she did exactly.
 
 Her things were also on the shelves in his bedroom (NE 738).
 
 She then proceeded to his wardrobe, pulled out a drawer and did something.
 
 Lastly, she took away a towel on the floor near his bed which he had used to wipe his feet.
 
 She had asked him whether she could take away the towel and he had agreed.
71
       
 At about 2.30am, the accused heard the sound of the lock to the metal grille gate of the Flat being opened.
 
 He got up, came out of his bedroom and saw Widiyarti leaving the Flat with Mr X.
 
 He did not get a good look at Mr X.
 
 Widiyarti was carrying the baby and told him that she was just going down for a short while.
 
 The accused then went to the guestroom because he wanted to know whether Mr X’s belongings were there as he had not given any permission for Mr X to stay in the Flat.
 
 He saw Widiyarti’s bag and the baby’s bag in the guestroom.
  
 He then closed the main gate and main door to the Flat and went back to his bedroom to sleep.
 
 He said he did not lock or close the door to his bedroom (NE 657).
72
       
 At about 5am, he heard knocking at his door.
 
 He said he got up and opened the door, although he had earlier said he had not closed it (NE 657).
 
 When he opened the door, Widiyarti was there and asked for the baby.
 
 He told her that she and Mr X had taken the baby and asked why she was then asking for the baby.
 
 Widiyarti repeated her question and he told her not to get agitated and suggested that both of them go and report the matter of the missing baby to the police.
 
 As Widiyarti appeared to be looking for her slippers, he went out of the Flat first and told her that he would wait for her at the sixth floor which had a lift landing.
 
 In the meantime, Widiyarti kept calling out the name of the baby.
 
 When he was at the sixth floor, a lift came and he let it pass without going in.
 
 He then went into the next lift which came, after calling out for Widiyarti twice.
 
 When the lift reached the first floor he sat on the steps of a staircase nearby.
 
 After waiting for about 20 minutes, he went back up to the Flat.
 
 He saw the gate was opened but did not go in.
 
 He called out to Widiyarti but received no response.
 
 He then locked the gate and went down again.
 
 He said that when he went down again, he did not see Widiyarti although he was looking for her.
 
 He then headed towards a police station and on the way there, he received a call on his handphone from the police.
 
 When he answered the call, the police told him to return to the Flat.
73
       
 When the accused returned to the Flat, he was questioned by the police.
 
 He said he told the police that someone who looked like Jalil had come with Widiyarti and taken the baby (NE 661 and 669).
 
 The police asked him to open the door to his bedroom and he said it was open.
 
 However, when the police tried to open the door, it was locked.
 
 He then opened it.
 
 Once the door was open, Inspector Venubalan went straight to the accused’s bed, threw the two pillows that were on it onto the floor, lifted the mattress and looked underneath it.
 
 The police also overturned the mattress (NE 661 and 667).
 
 There were two pillows in his bedroom but he said one of them came from the guestroom.
 
 He claimed that when he left his bedroom to go to the police, there was only one pillow left in his bedroom (NE 662).
 
 He said there was a bloodstain on one pillow and the police took it and asked him why there was a blood stain on it.
 
 He asserted that the pillow which had been taken by Widiyarti earlier was the one which had the bloodstain (NE 664).
 
 He also asserted that he was surprised when he saw the pillow which Widiyarti had taken was back in his bedroom and he told the police about it (NE 664).
74
       
 The accused said that the police also overturned a pail with clothes in it and there was a towel with bloodstains on it.
 
 He told the police about the bloodstains.
 
 The police also opened the window in his bedroom and found a scotch tape behind the air-conditioner.
 
 This was the crumpled tape that I referred to earlier.
 
 The police then told him to put the clothes back into the pail.
 
 He said he told the police that he wanted to wash his hands but they refused to let him do so.
75
       
 The accused added that he had learned about the tying of knots not only when he was working at Mammoet but also when he was working at PSA before that (NE 705).
SUBMISSION FOR THE DEFENCE
76
       
 The closing submission for the defence focussed on the law regarding circumstantial evidence with some submission on the facts. However, Mr Anandan said that he was also relying on his submission regarding no case to answer in so far as it was still applicable to his closing submission.
77
       
 The defence stressed that Widiyarti was the prosecution’s main witness and her evidence should not be believed.
 
 This was a person who had admittedly smuggled a passport into Singapore for Jalil to leave Singapore for Batam and who had obtained a false marriage certificate in Batam.
 
 The defence also submitted that Widiyarti had used a second passport for herself in order to deceive Singapore Immigration because she had to leave Singapore, using her first passport, when she became pregnant with the baby.
 
 It seemed to me that even if, for the sake of argument, Widiyarti had sought to deceive Singapore Immigration by the use of her second passport, this did not add anything material to the case before me in view of the other matters mentioned above.
 
 It was already clear that Widiyarti was prepared to commit an offence or offences for the sake of Jalil or the baby, a point which the defence sought to exploit.
 
 She had also become pregnant while working in Singapore as a maid, contrary to the conditions of her work permit.
78
       
 The defence also submitted that Widiyarti was a scheming person in view of the above matters and also the fact that she had not told Jalil that she had had another child in Jakarta and had not intended to disclose this to him until he arrived in Batam.
 
 It surmised that when he went to Batam, using the smuggled passport she had brought for him, he would feel indebted to her.
79
       
 The defence submitted that Widiyarti had not been on good terms with her landlord in Batam and had left the landlord’s house there.
80
       
 Also, Widiyarti was no longer using a handphone and the defence submitted that her explanation that it had been sent for repair should not be believed.
 
 It submitted that she was already in a financially tight situation and that was why she was no longer using a handphone.
 
 I did not accept the submission about the handphone because Jalil corroborated Widiyarti’s evidence that her handphone had been spoilt.
 
 There was no reason for him to lie about this small point.
81
       
 The defence pointed out that the accused was supposed to bring money to Widiyarti from Jalil before 4 August 2002 but did not leave Singapore on the advice of his lawyers in Singapore as he had made a claim for his industrial accident.
 
 The money was then handed over to Jalil’s friend one Amir, who, however, did not go to Batam.
 
 The defence submitted that when Widiyarti came to Singapore on 4 August 2002, this must have been for the purpose of getting money from Jalil.
 
 Thus, when Jalil had said he was not coming to see Widiyarti on the same night of her arrival, she was angry and upset.
82
       
 The defence submitted that Widiyarti’s evidence was not credible because when the accused took the baby away at about 11.30pm on 4 August 2002, she
“(a)
     
 did not immediately seek help from the neighbours or the police,
(b)
       
 continued to wait outside the room.
 
 She was “bored”, opened the front door of the house, sat in front of the corridor, was reading a newspaper and was watching television,
(c)
       
 at no point was alarmed or worried.”
(see para 30 of Defence Submission at Close of Prosecution Case.)
83
       
 The defence also submitted that the time when Widiyarti and Mr X left the Flat at about 2.30am of 5 August 2002 with the baby coincided with Dr Gilbert Lau’s estimate of the time of death (see para 23 of Defence Submission at Close of Prosecution Case).
84
       
 Furthermore, on the morning of 5 August 2002, the accused had suggested seeking the help of the police when he was questioned about the baby.
 
 Instead of following the accused, Widiyarti returned to the Flat to take the false passport with her, and went downstairs to destroy it, before seeking the help of the police.
85
       
 The defence also suggested in submission that Widiyarti might have been suffering from post-natal depression (see para 22 of Defence Submission at Close of Prosecution Case).
 
 However, I disregarded that submission as it was made as an afterthought.
 
 No such suggestion was made to Widiyarti nor did the accused allude to that.
86
       
 The defence then sought to rely on Widiyarti’s evidence that the accused had asked her whether she had come to Singapore (on 4 August 2002) with a man because the accused had said he had been informed that she had been seen with a man then.
 
 This was to bolster the accused’s version that in the middle of the night, Widiyarti had come to the accused’s bedroom with a man and taken the baby away.
87
       
 The defence also sought to make much out of paragraph 5 of a statement by SI R Venubalan.
 
 In the first sentence of para 5, SI Venubalan said:
5.
        
 At about 7.30 am, 
based on some information provided by the complainant
 [i.e Widiyarti], I gave instruction to SC Bashiruddeen and Cpl Teh through the radio set to search all the rubbish chutes of Blk 629, Hougang Ave 8, especially the rubbish chute that is shared by units number 82 and 84. …

 In cross-examination, Mr Anandan suggested that the information provided by Widiyarti to the police must have included a suggestion from her that the police search the rubbish chute from the Flat.
 
 The implication was that she made this suggestion because she knew that the baby’s body was there.
 
 However, SI Venubalan denied that she had told him to search the rubbish chute of the Flat (NE 83 and 85).
  
 Widiyarti also denied she had told the police to check the rubbish chute (NE 431).
 
 Notwithstanding the denials, Mr Anandan pursued this suggestion in his closing submission.
89
       
 Indeed, Mr Anandan went one step further in his closing submission.
 
 He submitted that Widiyarti did not throw the smuggled passport into the rubbish chute of the Flat because she knew that the baby’s body was there and would be eventually found.
 
 He urged me to take this into account although he did not cross-examine Widiyarti on this.
 
 Having considered this submission, I did not give much weight to it as there could have been other possibilities.
 
 For example, it was clear that Widiyarti did not want the smuggled passport to be found and linked to her.
 
 She knew she was going to report the matter of the missing baby to the police and if there was a search, she would not have wanted the smuggled passport to be found at the end of the rubbish chute connected to the Flat.
 
 Alternatively, while she remembered the smuggled passport, her evidence and that of the neighbour Gan Ai Lan demonstrated that she was in an anxious frame of mind.
 
 It might not have occurred to her to throw the smuggled passport down the rubbish chute.
 
 Also, she had then decided she was going down to the first floor to call the police from a public phone and she could have similarly decided then that she might as well dispose of the smuggled passport when she was at the first floor.
90
       
 Furthermore, while Widiyarti may have reason to lie as to whether she had told the police to search the rubbish chute, I saw no reason to disbelieve SI Venubalan on this point.
 
 Besides, even if Widiyarti had told the police to search the rubbish chute, this would have been equivocal.
 
 It did not necessarily mean that she knew that the baby had been thrown into the chute.
 
 I was of the view that the defence was making too much out of the first sentence of para 5 of SI Venubalan’s statement.
91
       
 The defence stressed that there was no reason for the accused to kill the baby.
 
 He had in the past played with her and bought things for her.
 
 However, the defence accepted that the absence of a motive was not a defence in law.
 
 The defence also submitted that even if, for the sake of argument, the accused had sexually abused the baby, there was no reason to kill her as she was too young to tell on him.
SUBMISSION FOR THE PROSECUTION
92
       
 The prosecution accepted that there was no direct evidence of the crime and that Widiyarti was its main witness.
 
 The prosecution submitted that as between Widiyarti and the accused, the former’s evidence was credible whereas the accused’s was not.
 
 For example, the accused’s evidence as to how the police had thrown items about in his bedroom was not credible.
 
 More importantly, the accused had lied about the identity of Mr X in various statements he had given the police, a point which I will come back to later.
 
 Furthermore, there was other evidence.
93
       
 The prosecution submitted that the baby’s blood contained two types of medicine or drugs which Dr Singam had prescribed to the accused about one and a half months before the death of the baby (see para 38 above).
 
 Although the accused claimed that he had given one of the drugs to Widiyarti to use and she had put this into an Eye-Mo bottle, he conceded during cross-examination that he had never seen Widiyarti giving the baby the medicine from the Eye-Mo bottle (NE 703 and 704).
 
 It was submitted that this contradicted Mr Anandan’s suggestion to Widiyarti during cross-examination that there were times when she would give the medicine to the baby (NE 414).
 
 It was further submitted that there was no evidence of any Eye-Mo bottle on the day in question (NE 845).
94
       
 In addition, the medicine in the Eye-Mo bottle must have been diphenhydramine which was in liquid form.
 
 The accused’s evidence about how he had give one of the drugs to Widiyarti still did not explain how the other drug chlorpheniramine came to be found in the baby’s blood.
95
       
 There was DNA evidence that the blood of the accused and/or of the baby was found on various articles in the accused’s room and on the crumpled tape on the air-conditioner outside.
 
 The prosecution stressed that there was also evidence of other bloodstains marked A, B and D in the accused’s bedroom, while,
  
 on the other hand, there was no evidence of any bloodstain in the guestroom (see para 60 and 61 of Prosecution’s Closing Submission).
96
       
 The prosecution also relied on the evidence of Dr Tay Ming Kiong as I have set out in paras 47 to 49 above.
97
       
 There was also evidence of the accused’s knowledge and experience with knots and the tying of things.
MY CONCLUSION AND REASONS
98
       
 It is not necessary for me to regurgitate the various cases cited to me regarding circumstantial evidence.
 
 The principles expressed were not disputed.
 
 However, each case must depend on its own facts.
99
       
 From the telephone records and other evidence before me, it appeared that there was one telephone conversation between the accused and Jalil in the afternoon of 4 August 2002 and two telephone conversations between the accused and Jalil in the evening of 4 August 2002.
 
 In all the three calls, Jalil spoke to Widiyarti also.
 
 To this extent, the evidence of Widiyarti about having spoken to Jalil once only in the evening of 4 August 2002 was not correct.
100
     
 As for the allegation that Widiyarti was unhappy with Jalil for not planning to come to the Flat that night, I accepted that she was unhappy about this but not to the extent that they quarrelled over it.
 
 Both of them denied any quarrel and they had hardly any time to discuss their evidence before the trial as Jalil was arrested on 5 August 2002 (NE 457) and thereafter did not speak to Widiyarti (NE 488 to 489).
101
     
 As for the presence of Widiyarti in the guestroom at the time the accused took the baby away, this was not disputed when Widiyarti was giving evidence.
 
 The accused gave similar evidence to this effect in evidence-in-chief (NE 645 line 4).
 
 However, when he was cross-examined, he said that Widiyarti was in the living room watching TV at the material time (NE 713 to 714).
 
 I did not know why the accused gave different evidence at this time.
 
 Suffice it for me to say that I was of the view that Widiyarti was in the guestroom when the accused took the baby. However, the baby was already sleeping.
 
 There was no bona fide reason for the accused to take the baby at such a late hour. Initially he suggested that the reason for taking the baby was that he wanted Widiyarti to calm down (NE 715 line 8).
 
 Then, he said it was his habit to bring the baby to his bedroom (NE 715 line 12).
 
 I did not accept those reasons because it was not as though the baby was crying and Widiyarti was becoming more and more upset because of Jalil and the baby or the baby was awake and the accused wanted to play with the baby.
102
     
 On the other hand, I did find part of Widiyarti’s evidence, if it was to be believed, unusual.
 
 Although she was surprised to see the accused taking the baby away to his bedroom, she did not object and did not try to open the door of the accused’s bedroom.
 
 She was also prepared to wait for the baby in the living room for five to six hours without insisting for the baby to be returned to her.
103
     
 Be that as it may, what was more significant was that the accused did take the baby into his bedroom at about 11.30pm of 4 August 2002.
 
 This was not disputed.
 
 Therefore, the evidential burden shifted to the accused to establish that at about 12.30am of 5 August 2002, Widiyarti and Mr X came to his bedroom whereupon Widiyarti took the baby away, although the legal burden remained always with the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
 The accused’s position and evidence as to the identity of Mr X was therefore important.
104
     
 As I have mentioned, when the accused was giving evidence, his position was that Jalil was not Mr X and he had already reached this conclusion when the baby was allegedly taken from his bedroom to the guestroom.
 
 However, this was not his position prior to his giving evidence.
105
     
 SI Venubalan had interviewed the accused twice.
 
 The second time was also in the morning of 5 August 2002, but after the baby’s body had been found.
 
 Paragraph 12 of SI Venubalan’s statement stated:
Subsequently, I returned to Soosainathan’s unit and conducted a further interview of Soosainathan.
 
 Soosainathan admitted that he had taken the baby from the mother (i.e. the complainant), who was staying in the next room, the previous night, and has placed the baby on his bed.
 
 He claimed that he used to do that often.
 
 He further added that in the middle of the night, he heard some noises and when he opened his eyes, he vaguely saw the complainant with another male person taking the baby away.
 
 He said that he did not bother as 
he thought the male person was the complainant’s husband
.
 
 Moreover, he claimed that he had been drinking earlier and was too tired to get up.
[Emphasis added]
106
     
 When the penultimate sentence was drawn to the accused’s attention during cross-examination, he denied that he had informed SI Venubalan that he had thought that Jalil was Mr X.
 
 He also denied that SI Venubalan had asked him who Mr X was (NE 757).
 
 Yet SI Venubalan was not challenged about this sentence when he was cross-examined.
 
 Secondly, it was unlikely that SI Venubalan would have failed to ask about the identity of Mr X when the accused had mentioned that Widiyarti and a man had taken the baby away from his bedroom.
107
     
 The accused also gave a statement pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code to ASP Ang Bee Chin in the evening of 6 August 2002 after a charge of murder was read out to him.
 
 ASP Ang was assisted by an interpreter.
 
 The accused’s s 122(6) statement read:
I did not commit this offence at all.
 
 There was a quarrel between the husband and wife over the phone.
 
 I spoke to the husband Jalil over the phone and he said that he would either come back in the evening or at night or the next morning.
 
 He wanted me to tell this to his wife.
 
 I told him to tell this to his wife directly.
 
 I passed the phone to his wife and there was a quarrel.
 
 It was regarding some money problems.
 
 I overhead the wife saying that if he did not want to look after the baby, then she would.
 
 At about 12.50 a.m on 6 August 2002, the wife came into my bedroom and took the baby away.
 
 
Jalil came together with her.
 
 Jalil comes to my house without anyone knowing whenever his wife comes here.
 
 Jalil is an overstayer
.
[Emphasis added]
108
     
 When the first of the last three sentences I have emphasized were drawn to the accused’s attention, he said that when he had mentioned Jalil’s name, he was confused.
 
 However, at trial, he was initially unable to give a satisfactory answer for his confusion.
 
 Eventually he said that he made that assertion because he was in a hurry.
 
 He claimed he was suffering from diabetes and was sleepy and the police had informed him to respond quickly and he did so.
 
 Yet, he accepted that when the police asked him who took the baby away, the question was asked in a calm manner (NE 682 to 685).
 
 Secondly, when the prosecution took the accused through each of the sentences in his s 122(6) statement, which sentences were prior to his assertion about Jalil, the accused accepted that those sentences/responses were not given in confusion.
 
 Thirdly, the accused had not simply mentioned Jalil’s name.
 
 In his s 122(6) statement, he went on to elaborate as to how Jalil had at times come to the Flat without anyone knowing and that Jalil was an overstayer.
 
 He said he was in a hurry when he gave such elaboration so that he could go and sleep (NE 686 to 688).
 
 Yet, it was not suggested to ASP Ang or the interpreter that the accused had given any of his responses in the statement in a hurry.
 
 In my view, the accused’s identification of Jalil was not a slip of the tongue or given in confusion or in a hurry.
 
 It was a deliberate assertion to defend himself.
109
     
 It was not disputed that the reference to “12.50am on 6 August 2002” in the s 122(6) statement was to a wrong date as the accused’s reference was intended to be 5 August 2002.
 
 The interpreter who interpreted his statement to ASP Ang said that the accused mentioned the date of 6 August 2002.
 
 I accepted this evidence because the interpreter was unlikely to know whether the date should be 5 or 6 August 2002 and since the accused was giving his statement on 6 August 2002, he probably inadvertently mentioned 6 August 2002.
 
 Be that as it may, that inadvertent error did not mean that the accused was confused when he identified Jalil as the man who had come with Widiyarti to take the baby away i.e Mr X.
110
     
 I would add that when evidence was being given for the prosecution, the questions from Mr Anandan were consistent with the position that Jalil was Mr X or might be Mr X.
 
 For example, after it had been earlier established through Raghavan’s evidence that Jalil had been with his co-workers during the night of 4 August 2002 until about 2.30am of 5 August 2002, Mr Anandan was still suggesting to Jalil, during cross-examination, that he could have taken a taxi to the Flat after 2.30am and then subsequently returned to his place of rest before 5.30am (NE 533 to 534).
111
     
 It was clear to me that after the close of the prosecution case, the accused realised that the evidence was against any suggestion that Jalil was or might be Mr X and so when the accused took the stand, he changed his position.
 
 Mr X became someone who looked like Jalil, but was not Jalil.
112
     
 I also found it implausible that while the accused claimed that he had refused an earlier request from Widiyarti to allow a man to stay at the Flat, the accused did not bother to find out the identity of Mr X when Mr X came to his bedroom and returned to the guestroom in the middle of the night.
 
 The accused’s evidence was only that thereafter he went to the guestroom to tell Widiyarti that the baby was crying as he was afraid that someone would complain to the police about the noise.
 
 He did not ask Widiyarti who Mr X was (NE 734).
113
     
 Moreover, although the defence submitted that the time when Widiyarti and Mr X left the Flat with the baby, i.e 2.30am, coincided with Dr Gilbert Lau’s estimated time of death, the defence did not elaborate as to how the baby’s body ended up in a rubbish bin at the end of the chute connected to the Flat.
 
 There was no evidence that the baby was brought back to the Flat after 2.30am.
 
 True, Widiyarti or Mr X could have gone to the rubbish bin on the first floor and dumped the baby’s body there, assuming that the rubbish bin was not kept in a locked enclosure at the bottom of the block of flats.
 
 However, it was Dr Lau’s evidence that the cause of death was the impact on the baby’s head and it was more likely that the baby had been dropped from the nineth floor down the rubbish chute rather than merely having been dropped from an unknown height somewhere in the Flat (NE 96).
 
 To my mind, this suggested that the baby’s head injuries were not likely to have been caused by the baby having been simply dumped into the rubbish bin while the assailant was at the first floor.
114
     
 In the circumstances, I did not accept the accused’s evidence that Widiyarti and a man had come to his bedroom at about 12.30am and taken the baby away.
 
 I was also of the view that the accused had fabricated this evidence because he was guilty.
 
 In any event, there was other evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused.
115
     
 The baby’s blood contained two types of medicine which were among the medicine given to the accused one and a half month’s earlier.
 
 As the prosecution had submitted, the accused’s evidence did not satisfactorily explain how these two types of medicine, especially the chlorpheniramine, came to be found in the baby’s blood (and liver) if the accused had not administered them to the baby.
 
 I would add that as regards the chlorpheniramine, the accused had initially said that Widiyarti had taken some of his medicine (NE 702) but then said he was not sure whether she had taken the tablets (NE 703).
 
 Furthermore, the large doses of chlorpheniramine found in the baby’s blood and liver also demonstrated that whoever had fed the baby the medicine did so for some reason other than to address some illness which the baby was suffering from.
 
 It was clear to me that the large doses were administered to keep the baby quiet for a sinister reason.
116
     
 Thirdly, there was the evidence of the baby’s blood found on articles and some blood on places in the accused’s bedroom.
 
 As regards the latter, I disregarded the evidence from the police and Dr Jasmine Heng regarding A, B and D in the accused’s bedroom because, ultimately, Dr Heng could not confirm that they were spots of blood and, more importantly, whose blood they were.
117
     
 As regards the evidence of the baby’s blood on the pillows in the accused’s bedroom, the accused had said that Widiyarti had taken one of the pillows to the guestroom.
 
 When he returned to the Flat in the morning of 5 August 2002, after responding to a call from the police, his bedroom was not supposed to be locked but he had to open it for the police as it was in fact locked.
 
 He then saw two pillows in his bedroom and he noticed a blood stain on one of the pillows.
 
 The impression given from his evidence was that Widiyarti had cleverly returned the pillow she had taken from his bedroom, while he went down to wait for her to go to the police with him.
 
 However, the baby’s blood was found on both pillows, not just one.
 
 The accused’s evidence could not explain why this was so, unless the baby had been assaulted in his bedroom.
118
     
 I also noted that in his evidence-in-chief, the accused had asserted that the blood stain he had noticed on one pillow was on the pillow which Widiyarti had taken (NE 664).
 
 However, in cross-examination, he could not identify which pillow it was (NE 753).
 
 He tried to cover this up by alleging that the police threw the pillows and the mattress onto the floor when they came into the bedroom (NE 752 to 754).
 
 I did not believe that the police had done so.
 
 They would not have tampered with a potential crime scene.
 
 Moreover, this point was never pursued by Mr Anandan when various police officers were on the witness stand.
 
 In my view, the accused had belatedly fabricated this evidence.
 
 For the same reasons, I was also of the view that the accused had fabricated his evidence as to how the police had allegedly overturned a pail with clothes in it and then told him to put the clothes back into the pail.
119
     
 Furthermore, the accused’s blood was also on one of the two pillows as I have mentioned (see para 44 above).
120
     
 Moreover, the towel found hanging on a raffia string in the accused’s bedroom i.e ‘HA 33’ (Exhibit 204) was stained with blood in two areas.
 
 The DNA evidence showed the blood on one area to be from the baby and the accused and the blood on the other area to be that of the baby’s (see para 43 above).
 
 Although the accused said that Widiyarti had thrown a towel on the raffia string into a pail and replaced it with another in the middle of the night, his evidence did not explain why his blood was found on the towel which Widiyarti had purportedly placed on the raffia string.
 
 I would add that the accused had said that Widiyarti had placed a green towel on the raffia string but the towel found hanging there was beige in colour (or light brown) but not green.
 
 When this was pointed out to him, he said it was light green (NE 691 and 692).
121
     
 It was clear to me that the accused’s evidence as to how Widiyarti had come into his bedroom and replaced the towel on the raffia string, meddled with items on the shelves in his bedroom and took away a towel lying near his bed were also fabricated this time to address the DNA evidence and the evidence of Dr Tay Ming Kiong which I have set out in paras 47 to 49 above.
122
     
 There is, however, one observation I should make.
 
 The prosecution had stressed that while there was evidence of blood stains in the accused’s bedroom, there was no such evidence in the guestroom.
 
 This was not entirely accurate.
 
 Dr Jasmine Heng’s report revealed that a foldable mattress marked ‘HA 59’ (Photo P51) which was in the guestroom had blood and semen stains from Widiyarti and Jalil respectively (see p 8 and 12 of her report which are p 78 and 82 of the PI Bundle).
 
 However, as she was not questioned about them and no submission was made about them, I need say no more about these stains.
 
 It remained true that no blood stain from the baby was found in the guestroom.
123
     
 As for the brown bed-sheet which the baby’s body was found to be wrapped in, the accused’s evidence was that he had given this bed-sheet to Widiyarti as well as a white bed-sheet with blue lines and coloured boxes (see again NE 640, para 8 of SI Varen Chew’s statement and Photo P51).
 
 However, the photographs of the accused’s bedroom showed that his mattress did not have a bed-sheet covering it although the pillows had pillow slips.
 
 There was only a light blue bed-sheet lying loose on top of the mattress (see Photo P25).
 
 The accused had informed SI Varen Chew that the light blue bed-sheet was used by him as a blanket (see para 8 of SI Varen Chew’s statement) but during the trial he did not explain why his mattress had no bed-sheet covering it when he had bed-sheets in his Flat or why he had provided Widiyarti with two bed-sheets.
124
     
 The accused’s experience in tying was another factor which corroborated the other evidence for the prosecution.
125
     
 As regards the argument that the accused’s suggestion to report the matter to the police demonstrated his innocence, I accepted the prosecution’s submission that the accused’s suggestion was a ploy to get Widiyarti out of the Flat so that he could return and throw the baby away.
126
           
 
First, if the accused had really wanted the police to investigate the matter, he and Widiyarti would not have needed to go to a police post or station.
 
 A single telephone call would have sufficed.
 
 Indeed that was what Widiyarti did.
 
 Secondly, if the accused had really wanted to go with Widiyarti to report the matter, he would have waited for her instead of leaving the Flat alone.
127
           
 
I also accepted Widiyarti’s evidence that when she asked the accused for the baby at about 6am of 5 August 2002, he had told her that the baby was sleeping and then that she had taken the baby away (with Mr X).
 
 When she kept on asking for the baby, he had simply suggested that they report the matter to the police.
 
 Her evidence on his responses was consistent.
 
 In any event, even on the accused’s evidence, there was no suggestion that he was even slightly alarmed that her questions were implicating him.
128
     
 In the circumstances, I accepted the prosecution’s submission that after Widiyarti had left the Flat to call the police and to dispose of the smuggled passport, after failing to get help from a neighbour, the accused had returned to the Flat and thrown the baby down the rubbish chute.
 
 That was why the brown bed-sheet on the mattress in the accused’s bedroom which Widiyarti had noticed at about 6am was missing when the accused later opened the door to his bedroom on the instructions of the police.
 
 I was aware that the above conclusion would mean that the baby was killed at about 6am of 5 August 2002 which is outside the period of 3am to 5am which Dr Gilbert Lau had estimated to be the time of death.
 
 However, as I have said in para 52 above, Dr Lau accepted that the time of death could be about 6am.
129
     
 As for the argument that the accused had no reason to kill the baby even if he had sexually assaulted her, I did not find this argument persuasive.
 
 There were bruises on the head, face and chest of the baby which were quite visible even from the photographic evidence.
 
 The accused must have known that questions would be asked about the bruises and it was likely that eventually the sexual abuse would be discovered.
130
     
 There is one other matter I should deal with.
 
 The defence submitted that I should draw an inference that various statements given by the accused to the police on 15, 16, 17, 19 and 26 August and 2 September 2002 i.e after his s 122(6) statement was recorded, were consistent with his oral evidence because the prosecution did not use any of such statements to impeach the accused’s credit or to show that he was inconsistent.
 
 On the other hand, the prosecution submitted that I should not draw such an inference because the contents of the statements were not before me and the defence’s submission was mere conjecture.
 
 The prosecution submitted that there were possibilities other than that advocated by the defence:
(a)
       
 first, the statements contained an admission by the accused but the prosecution chose not to use it, or
(b)
       
 second, the statements did not contain such an admission but were sufficient to impeach the credit of the accused but the prosecution chose not to impeach, or
(c)
       
 third, the statements did not contain such an admission and also could not be used to impeach the credit of the accused and so the prosecution could not use them.
131
     
 I found the views of Justice Kan Ting Chiu in CC 47 of 2002, PP v Ng Beng Siang & others helpful, although that was a case under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 At paras 45 to 56, Kan J said:
45.
       
 All the statements were admitted in evidence in the course of the prosecution’s case.
 
 There were other statements of the accused which the prosecution did not tender in evidence.
 
 Defence counsel informed me that they did not have them.
 
 The prosecutor confirmed that they were not supplied.
 
 Several reasons were given, (i) that there was no obligation to do so, (ii) that the statements were retained so that they could be used to impeach an accused’s credit if he were to depart from them, (iii) that they are not furnished because an accused may tailor his defence according to his statements, and (iv) that the statements may be supplied if an accused disclosed his defence first.
46.
       
 In the end, counsel for the prosecution and the defence resolved the matter between themselves and the statements were supplied.
 
 The circumstances of the resolution were not disclosed to me.
47.
       
 An accused person’s access to his statements is a matter of some importance.
 
 When the issue is raised the same authorities are usually cited in argument - 
Kulwant v PP
 
[1986] SLR 239
 which dealt with an application for pre-trial discovery of statements rather than disclosure in the course of a trial, and 
Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 185
 where it was held that such statements should be furnished to an accused person after he has given his evidence.
 
 Having dealt with this issue on several occasions I believe that there is room for further consideration in this matter.
48.
       
 The statements requested for were the accused’s own statements, not statements of the prosecution witnesses or of his co-accused.
 
 An accused person is obliged under s 32 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code to make them.
 
 These statements are often referred to as “investigation statements”, “s 121 statements” or “long statements”.
 
 If an accused person has a good memory and if he is aware of the importance of such statements, there is nothing to prevent him from making a note from memory of the statements taken from him.
 
 He can recount at his trial what he remembers of his statements.
49.
       
 An accused has a legitimate interest to know and be reminded of what he has told in his statements, so that he can obtain proper advice thereon as to the course of action he should take, or he may wish to refer to them in his evidence.
50.
       
 Should he be refused the statements so that they can be used to impeach his credit?
 
 In many cases where an accused who is refused his statements makes his defence no action is taken to impeach his credit.
 
 In my experience, impeachment applications are made in a small minority of such cases.
 
 Thus in the majority of cases, this reason for refusing the statements eventually does not stand.
51.
       
 That reason is also not applied consistently.
 
 In practice, the prosecution would furnish an accused person with cautioned statements recorded from him.
 
 Cautioned statements may be used for impeachment in the same way as investigation statements.
 
 If the former is furnished, there is no reason why the latter should not.
52.
       
 Likewise, an accused may tailor his defence to his cautioned statements as he would his investigation statements, and if that is not a ground for refusing to furnish cautioned statements, it should not be a ground for refusing to furnish the investigation statements.
53.
       
 There is another point to be considered.
 
 This is that when a reasonable request is made, it should be considered with an open mind.
 
 Unless there are reasons to believe that granting of a request will lead to abuse, it would be unreasonable to deny it on the ground that it may lead to abuse.
54.
       
 I am also uncomfortable about the requirement that the accused discloses his defence to the prosecution first if he wants to have his investigation statements.
 
 There is no obligation for an accused to disclose his defence to the prosecution.
 
 That position was abridged slightly by s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code whereby an accused is warned and advised to state his defence after he has been charged, lest his defence be less likely to be believed if he withheld it till his trial.
 
 This was a limited change as the accused is not compelled to make a statement, and he is not liable to punishment if he elects not to give one.
55.
       
 Against this background, the request that an accused discloses his defence is a radical step which must be given serious consideration.
 
 Where is the authority for it?
 
 How is the defence to be disclosed - by counsel or a signed statement by the accused?
 
 How detailed must it be?
 
 What is the evidential nature of such a disclosure?
 
 If such requests are to become part of the prosecution practice, they should be clearly provided for by law, in the way that s 122 was enacted to enable cautioned statements to be recorded.
 
 It should not be left to be dealt with on an 
ad hoc
 basis.
56.
       
 Another issue was raised, whether statements should be admitted in evidence when they are supplied.
 
 Such statements would be admitted if the accused or the prosecution wants them to be admitted.
 
 If no one wants them, there is no necessity for such statements to be admitted in evidence for no purpose.
 
 This is how cautioned statements are dealt with, and the same practice should apply to investigation statements.
 
 If an accused who had received his statements decides not to introduce them in evidence, there is no reason to make him do it.
132
     
 So, before me, the prosecution had decided not to use the statements in question.
 
 If the defence had considered that those statements might have been helpful to the accused, then the defence should have requested the statements from the prosecution.
 
 If the prosecution should refuse the request, then the defence should have applied to the court to direct that such statements be made available to it.
 
 If the court should give such a direction, then it was for the defence to decide whether to use the statements or not after it received them.
 
 If the court should decline to give such a direction but left it to the prosecution to decide whether to let the defence have those statements, then it would be open to the defence to submit that an inference favourable to the accused should be drawn, although a bare submission like that would probably carry little weight.
133
     
 Here, the defence did not ask the prosecution for the statements or apply to court for them.
 
 On my part, I would be inclined to encourage and, if necessary, direct any prosecution to let the defence have such statements in response to such a request or application unless, as Kan J said, there are reasons to believe that to do so would lead to abuse.
134
     
 I was also of the view that in the case before me, the prosecution should have responded positively to the defence’s submission by offering to let the defence have the statements, even though there was no specific request for them, and, if the defence wanted them, then leaving it to the defence to decide what use, if any, it would make of them, and then respond thereto.
 
 This would be preferable to relying on the three possibilities advocated to me.
135
     
 Be that as it may, the defence’s submission was a bare one, even if I were to put aside the point that it did not request or apply for the statements.
 
 The accused did not say which part of his oral evidence had been earlier disclosed by him in those statements and neither did his counsel.
 
 I was of the view that it would be unsafe for me to infer that every material aspect of his oral evidence could be found in those statements in the circumstances, especially since his oral evidence about Mr X had already contradicted his earlier statements to the police and his 122(6) statement as well as his position before he gave evidence, as demonstrated through his counsel’s questions to the prosecution witnesses, including Jalil.
136
     
 Moreover, even if, for the sake of argument, those statements contained the same allegations as the rest of the accused’s oral evidence on other matters aside from Mr X, they were not necessarily true.
 
 They had to be considered in the light of the evidence for the prosecution.
 
 As I have said, the prosecution did not rely solely on Widiyarti’s evidence.
 
 There was other evidence which I have set out above.
 
 To recapitulate briefly, there was evidence of the chlorpheniramine in the baby’s blood and liver, the DNA evidence of the accused’s blood on one pillow and, more importantly, the baby’s blood on both pillows, as well as the accused’s and the baby’s blood on the beige towel on the raffia string in his bedroom.
 
 There was the accused’s mattress without a bed-sheet covering it and the brown bed-sheet wrapped round the baby.
 
 There was evidence about the accused’s experience in tying.
137
     
 In the circumstances, I was drawn irresistibly to the conclusion that the accused had committed the crime for which he was charged.
 
 Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted and sentenced the accused accordingly.

2816723,Bird by her next friend Bird v Connell [2016] NSWDC 276,"Judgment

The application before the court


	
	The plaintiff, by notice of motion filed on 26 August 2016, seeks leave pursuant to s 109 Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Act”) to extend time for commencement of these proceedings to the date of the statement of claim filed in these proceedings, namely 17 May 2016 (a delay of approximately 50 weeks, as the claim had to be filed by 30 May, 2015).
	
	
	The plaintiff relies upon the following material:
	



	
	The affidavit of Sandra Lynne Bird, her mother, who is also her tutor, and who was injured in the same accident; and
	
	
	The affidavit of Ms Tolini Kakala, who has been the solicitor with carriage of these proceedings at PK Simpson & Co Solicitors since 4 January 2016.
	



	
	These witnesses were not cross-examined (Brierley v Ellis (2014) 67 MVR 282 at [22] – [28]).
	
	
	The defendant opposes the application.
	


The circumstances leading to the claim


	
	The plaintiff, who was born on 26 July 2004, was a passenger in her mother’s car on 30 May 2012. Her mother, who is also her tutor, suffered what she called “significant injuries” (paragraph 7 of her affidavit), which included operative treatment to her neck on 23 October 2013.
	
	
	Prior to the accident, the plaintiff had already been diagnosed with a generalised anxiety disorder and ADHD, and was receiving treatment from a psychologist and a paediatrician. According to the plaintiff’s mother, the plaintiff started seeing the psychologist again for treatment in relation to the subject accident on or about 31 January 2014 (affidavit, paragraph 14). Her behavioural problems are set out in a long series of reports. They are significant and include learning disabilities and confronting social disabilities, such as stealing.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s mother brought a claim on her own behalf which has since been resolved. As is set out below, the plaintiff’s mother did not realise that the plaintiff, who suffered no physical injuries at the time, had suffered any additional psychological injury. She “mentioned” these problems to the plaintiff’s paediatrician after the accident. The paediatrician listed a series of problems the plaintiff was having in a report dated 10 October 2013 which makes no reference to the impact of the car accident, although the plaintiff’s mother’s neck operation is referred to. It was not until 20 January 2014 that the paediatrician referred her back to the psychologist that the plaintiff had been seeing before the accident.
	
	
	The psychologist who saw the plaintiff, Dr Crncec, provided a report to the plaintiff’s general practitioner, Dr Barrett, on 31 January 2014. Dr Crncec noted he had first seen her in 2011 – 2012 and that there were now more issues in relation to learning and social skills difficulties, as well as “significant aspects of anxiety that form part of [the plaintiff’s] presentation”, as the plaintiff was “reportedly a very nervous passenger in the car following an accident she was involved in with her mother in 2012”.
	
	
	A report from the paediatrician dated 13 March 2014 noted that the plaintiff was “anxious in the car and lifts and less so in the train” but does not refer to the motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff’s mother consulted PK Simpson, who were already acting on her own behalf, and a claim form was completed by her for the plaintiff on 14 March 2014.
	
	
	The paediatrician signed the claim form. Thereafter, the paediatrician’s notes refer to receiving the NRMA’s request for her records on 13 June 2014 and payment by the NRMA on 30 June 2014. Other references to the accident are brief, such as her note that on 13 May 2014 Dr Crncec had recommended “walking up to where the accident was but they have yet to do it” as “she got anxious when her mother discussed visiting the accident site and opposed it”. On 20 March 2014 the plaintiff was taken to Nepean Hospital following seizures. An EEG performed on 27 March showed no epileptiform discharges or electrical seizures. There were subsequent seizures. There is no suggestion that this condition is related to the accident. Her brother had had seizures as well.
	
	
	The medical certificate had been filled out by the plaintiff’s paediatrician on 4 April 2014 but the claim form was not lodged until 2 June 2014. On 11 June 2014 the NRMA requested a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay in lodgement of this form and denied liability.
	
	
	On 9 July 2014, a solicitor employed by PK Simpson Solicitors named Christine Le saw the plaintiff’s mother in conference and prepared a statutory declaration for her (see paragraph 30 of the statutory declaration and the certificate which follows it). On that same date the NRMA sent the paediatrician’s notes to another solicitor employed by PK Simpson named Catherine McKay.
	
	
	On 6 August 2014 the NRMA sent a section 81(1) notice admitting liability for the claim. According to paragraphs 14 and 15 of Ms Kakala’s affidavit, PK Simpson Solicitors was obtaining “medical treatment records and clinical reports” but these had already been obtained by the NRMA. The only new step the plaintiff’s solicitors took was that on 27 November 2014, a file note was created by “the solicitor who then had carriage of the matter, giving instructions for a medico-legal report to be obtained from an appropriate child psychologist” (paragraph 16) and an appointment with Dr Abu-Arab was arranged for 4 May 2015, which the mother did not attend because she did not receive “a letter confirming the appointment details”. None of these documents are attached.
	
	
	The NRMA sent a “without prejudice” offer for past medical expenses, on the basis that no treatment had been requested and the plaintiff had been seeing a psychologist before the accident. This letter was sent to the client on 26 May 2015, but the covering letter is not attached.
	
	
	The limitation period was about to expire on 30 May 2015. PK Simpson solicitors made an appointment with Mr Glancey, psychologist, for 31 July 2015 but the plaintiff’s mother said she could not attend his Campbelltown office. A second appointment for 14 August 2015 was cancelled by her on 10 August 2015 because of the plaintiff’s school commitments. No fresh appointment with Mr Glancey was arranged.
	
	
	The affidavit material does not reveal the name of the persons to whom this information was communicated, or the file notes or correspondence with Mr Glancey. The solicitor with carriage of the matter, Ms McKay, had left the firm in June. The name of the solicitor who took over the file after she left is not revealed, and no documents or information of any kind about that solicitor’s activities for the period June to November 2015.
	
	
	There was a flurry of activity on 1 and 2 December 2015. On 1 December 2015 the plaintiff’s mother was contacted to arrange an appointment with Dr Glancey, which took place on 12 January 2016. On 2 December 2015 a solicitor at PK Simpson Solicitors applied for an exemption from CARS, which was granted by CARS the following day. According to the plaintiff’s mother, she did not discover that Ms McKay had left the firm until December 2015, but she does not say which solicitor she dealt with.
	
	
	On 4 January 2016 Ms Kakala, solicitor, took over carriage of the claim, briefed Mr Petrie (who had a conference with the plaintiff’s mother on 28 January 2016), served Dr Glancey’s report on 16 February 2016 and arranged an informal settlement conference on 10 March 2016. According to the plaintiff’s mother’s affidavit:
	


“25. At the informal settlement conference I was advised for the first time that Charley’s claim would be considered out of time as proceedings had not been commenced within 3 years from the date of her accident.

26. I do not recall being advised about the need to prosecute a claim within 3 years.

27. My own CTP matter was being handled by PKS and at no stage do I recall a limitation issue being raised in relation to my matter or [the plaintiff]. My CTP claim settled at an informal settlement conference on 26 May 2015…”


	
	After the claim did not settle, section 85A particulars were served on the NRMA on 14 March 2016. The provisions of s 85A prevent the plaintiff from commencing proceedings until two months have elapsed. The statement of claim was filed on 17 May 2016.
	


The relevant statutory provisions and principles of law


	
	Section 109 of the Act provides:
	


“109 Time limitations on commencement of court proceedings

(1) A claimant is not entitled to commence proceedings in respect of a claim more than 3 years after:

(a) the date of the motor accident to which the claim relates, or

(b) if the claim is made in respect of the death of a person-the date of death, except with the leave of the court in which the proceedings are to be taken.

(2) Time does not run for the purposes of this section from the time that a claim has been referred to the Authority for assessment and until 2 months after a certificate as to the assessment or exemption from assessment is issued.

(3) The leave of the court must not be granted unless:

(a) the claimant provides a full and satisfactory explanation to the court for the delay, and

(b) the total damages of all kinds likely to be awarded to the claimant if the claim succeeds are not less than 25% of the maximum amount that may be awarded for non-economic loss under section 134 as at the date of the relevant motor accident.

(4) Subsection (3)(b) does not apply to a claimant who is legally incapacitated because of the claimant’s age or mental capacity.

(5) The Limitation Act 1969 does not apply to or in respect of proceedings in respect of a claim.”


	
	The following should be noted:
	



	
	Section 109(2) provides that time does not run while the claim is referred to CARS and until two months after a certificate is issued. In the present case, the plaintiff’s exemption certificate was issued on 3 December 2015, only one day after the application on 2 December 2015. In any event, as the 3-year limitation period had already expired prior to the application for exemption, s 109(2) did not operate to extend the time by which proceedings had to be commenced.
	
	
	The plaintiff is not required to establish the 25% threshold referred to in s 109(3)(b) as she is a minor.
	



	
	Section 66(2) of the Act provides:
	


“(2) In this Chapter, a reference to a full and satisfactory explanation by a claimant for non-compliance with a duty or for delay is a reference to a full account of the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the claimant, from the date of the accident until the date of providing the explanation. The explanation is not a satisfactory explanation unless a reasonable person in the position of the claimant would have failed to have complied with the duty or would have been justified in experiencing the same delay.”


	
	The issue for determination is whether the plaintiff has failed to provide a “full and satisfactory” explanation for delay in the commencement of proceedings until 17 May 2016. The parties each referred me to Walker v Howard (2009) 78 NSWLR 161 as to the relevant test.
	
	
	Briefly stated, it is necessary to examine whether the whole of the explanation is one which the reasonable person in the position of the claimant would or would not have been justified in experiencing. I specifically note three factors to take into account in these proceedings:
	



	
	The court’s special concerns for plaintiffs under a disability, whether cognitive (as was the case in Walker v Howard) or, as here, where the plaintiff is a minor as well as suffering from significant mental issues.
	
	
	The approach the court should take where the delay in question has been the delay of the legal practitioner rather than the applicant for leave (Smith v Grant (2006) 67 NSWLR 735; Brierley v Ellis at [37] – [57]).
	
	
	A reasonable person could experience a delay where there was a delay in onset of symptoms, or those with the care of the person under disability was “either unaware of her symptoms or… unaware of their full extent” (Figliuzzi v Yonan [2005] NSWCA 290). The nature of the plaintiff’s injuries was not immediately apparent and the defendant concedes that this is a significant feature in relation to any delay prior to liability being admitted. The plaintiff submits that this is a significant feature up to the time Mr Glancey’s report was obtained.
	


“Full and satisfactory” explanation


	
	The question of what is a “full” explanation is explained in Dijakovic v Perez (2015) 71 MVR 334 at [15] – [17] as follows:
	


“[15] An explanation is “full and satisfactory” within s 66(2) if it satisfies two requirements. These were explained by Meagher JA (Basten JA and Simpson J agreeing) in Karambelas v Zaknic (No 2) (2014) 69 MVR 127; [2014] NSWCA 433 at [16] (Karambelas).

[16] First, it must include a full account of the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the claimant, from the date of the accident until “the date of providing the explanation”. In the case of late proceedings under s 109(1) that is the date on which the explanation is first provided. Here, Mr Dijakovic’s explanation comprised a combination of affidavit evidence and his oral evidence before the primary judge. Thus he had to explain the period between 21 October 2009 and 30 May 2014.

[17] The purpose of the requirement that the explanation be full, and the necessity to set out fully “the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the claimant”, is so that the court can evaluate all of the reasons for the delay and decide whether they are full and satisfactory: Mancini v Thompson [2002] NSWCA 38 at [46]. (Mancini). It is for this reason that it has been said that the applicant for leave cannot “pick and choose” the information to be given relevant to the delay and which the court has to decide is “satisfactory”: Mancini at [46].”


	
	The question of what is a “satisfactory” explanation is set out in Lyu v Jeon [2012] NSWCA 446 at [22] – [25]. Meagher JA explained the requirement for the explanation to be “satisfactory” in circumstances where, as is the case here, it is not easy to determine the extent to which the characteristics of the person in question are to be attributed to the “reasonable person”:
	


“[22] In Diaz v Truong, Giles JA said (at [42]) of the equivalent provision in s 40(2) of the Motor Accident Act 1988:

The standard of a reasonable person in the position of the claimant failing to comply with a duty is understandable. The standard of a reasonable person in the position of the claimant being “justified in experiencing” a delay is more obscure. Experiencing something normally means being subjected to it, the object of acts or omissions by another or others. What is meant by being justified in experiencing a delay? It must mean that the reasonable person in the position of the claimant would have been subjected to the delay and the subjection to the delay would have been justified. The hypothetical experiencing of delay must have the quality of a justified experiencing of delay.

That elucidation of what being “justified in experiencing” a delay means is not controversial: see Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53; 215 CLR 643 at [7], [73]; Buller v Black [2003] NSWCA 45 ; 56 NSWLR 425at [46], [94], [100]; Walker v Howard esp at [96]–[97], [101]–[102].

[23] As Allsop P explained in Walker v Howard (esp at [64], [68], [69], [90], [97]), the test so expressed is a construct for the making of the evaluative judgment or assessment as to whether, given the claimant’s position, the delay which occurred was reasonably justifiable; that question to be answered by asking whether a reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have experienced that delay. It requires that characteristics and circumstances of the claimant be taken into account when applying the objective standard. In some cases it will not be easy to determine the extent to which the characteristics of the person in question are to be attributed to the “reasonable person” because those characteristics may not sit comfortably with the notion of the “reasonable person”. The present is not such a case.

[24] Two further matters are, however, relevant in the present context. First, as Gleeson CJ observed in Russo v Aiello (at [5], [7]), what will constitute justifiable delay on the part of a reasonable person in making a claim is to be considered in the light of the legislative purposes of the MAC Act. See also [74] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. Those purposes include encouraging the early investigation, assessment and resolution of claims so as to advance the interests of claimants in having prompt treatment and rehabilitation, and in having the prompt payment of lost earnings; and so as to advance the interests of insurers in more accurately predicting claims frequency and formulating premiums. The Act seeks to achieve these objects by the imposition on both claimants and insurers of time limits and obligations to act expeditiously: see also Walker v Howard per Allsop P at [90].

[25] Secondly, as Gleeson CJ also observed in Russo v Aiello at [7]:

… what the Act requires is justification for delay; not demonstration that the delay caused no harm. … the focus of the statutory concept of a satisfactory explanation is upon justifying delay, rather than excusing it. It is one thing to say that conduct is justified by reference to the way in which a reasonable person in the position of a claimant could have been expected to behave. It is another thing to say that delay ought to be excused because it caused no identifiable harm to an insurer. It is the former, not the latter, question that is raised for consideration.”


	
	The principal problem in these proceedings is that the plaintiff is a minor with significant disabilities. Her mother, who is her tutor, suffered serious injuries in the accident, is a single parent on a pension, and has been not only the carer for the plaintiff but also for an older child with similar disabilities. Additionally, the question of what is “reasonable” needs to take into account that much of the explanation is the incompetence and dilatoriness of the solicitors the plaintiff consulted.
	


Conduct of persons other than the plaintiff


	
	The question of the approach to take in cases where the plaintiff is a minor was first referred to in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Blackburn v Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd (2004) 61 NSWLR 632. In Smith v Grant, Basten JA observed:
	


“[61] The second matter to which Hodgson JA drew attention in Blackburn (at 654 [56]) was the suggestion that the characteristics of a “reasonable person in the position of the claimant” might leave out of account tender years, or perhaps brain damage. His Honour expressed no concluded view on that question although he thought it “unlikely that the legislature intended to promote legal proceedings by a child against its uninsured parent”. Similarly, in this case, nothing was said to turn upon the particular characteristics of the claimant, nor was it suggested that any particular characteristics should be excluded from the equation. Like Hodgson JA, I would reserve this question to a case in which it arises. A cautious approach is required because the test is one which is not restricted to this legislation. For example, s 5F of the Civil Liability Act 2002 refers to an “obvious risk” in relation to negligence proceedings, as a risk that in the circumstances “would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of” the person who suffers harm. Further, there is a considerable jurisprudence, to which the Court was not taken, no doubt because it was not directly relevant in this case, dealing with the concept of constructive knowledge in the area of limitation provisions: see, for example, Adams v Bracknell Forest Borough Council [2005] 1 AC 76. Lord Hoffmann noted, in relation to s 14(3) of the Limitation Act 1980 (UK) (at 86 [33]):

Section 14(3) uses the word ‘reasonable’ three times. The word is generally used in the law to import an objective standard, as in ‘the reasonable man’. But the degree of objectivity may vary according to the assumptions which are made about the person whose conduct is in question … The breadth of the appropriate assumptions and the degree to which they reflect the actual situation and characteristics of the person in question will depend upon the reasons why the law imports an objective standard.”


	
	Allsop P analysed this issue in Walker v Howard (at [95]-[96]), concluding:
	


“[95] As is perhaps evident, the above line authorities is not without difficulties in reconciliation. The most recent authorities: Figliuzzi and Smith, both relying significantly on what was said in Russo v Aiello, take the test of satisfactoriness in the second sentence of s 66(2) as the operative standard: that is, it is not merely necessary, but it is sufficient. I agree with that conclusion. The two sentences in s 66(2) are a composite whole. Though the second sentence is expressed as “not satisfactory unless” rather than “satisfactory if”, reading the section as a whole the objectified standard in the second sentence is intended, in my view, to be the operative test of satisfactoriness.

[96] Respectfully, I cannot agree with Hodgson JA and Foster AJA in Diaz that the focus in the second sentence is only upon the acts or omissions of the claimant. It is the whole explanation — the full explanation contemplated by the first sentence against which the question is to be asked whether the reasonable person in the position of the claimant would or would not have been justified in experiencing.”


	
	His Honour concluded (at [106]) that “the acts and omissions of all relevant persons should be canvassed in the explanation to allow the court to make an evaluation”.
	
	
	The facts in Walker v Howard were similar, in that the plaintiff (an adult) was under a disability because of his injuries, and the solicitor who from time to time gave advice and his family members did not in fact occupy any kind of official position to do so. Campbell JA noted at [126]-[127]:
	


“[126] An incapable person cannot sue in court except by a tutor (UCPR 7.14), and Mr Howard had a tutor from the time of commencement of the proceedings. It is unnecessary to consider the extent, if any, of the legal authority a tutor acquires to bind the incapable person merely in consequence of having himself or herself appointed tutor (Haines v Leves (1987) 8 NSWLR 442 at 449–51; Ex parte Davis (1901) 1 SR (NSW) (L) 187; ss 75, 76 Civil Procedure Act 2005; Arabian v Tufnall and Taylor Ltd [1944] KB 685), as the time that is relevant to the present application came to an end no later than when the proceedings were commenced. It is true that s 66(2) MAC Act talks of conduct “from the date of the accident until the date of providing the explanation”, but s 66(2) is a quasi-definition that is intended to apply in several different types of circumstances. The relevant delay in the present case is delay in commencing proceedings, bearing in mind that under s 109(2) time does not run during a particular period after a claim has been referred to the Authority. Events after the proceedings were commenced do not bear upon that particular delay.

[127] During the whole of the time until the proceedings were commenced the action that Ms Wales, Ms McInerney and Mr Day were taking in the interests of Mr Howard was action that they had no legal authority to take in a way that would bind him. Had they had legal authority and responsibility to enforce his legal rights their action (and inaction) might possibly in law have been treated as his action — though any question of the extent to which the actions and inactions of a properly appointed agent affects the running of time under s 109 should be left for a case in which it arises. What matters for present purposes is that when they had no authority to act as his agent that simple equation of positions cannot be made. That they tried, sporadically and within their financial limitations, to help Mr Howard is part of his position, but it is likewise part of his position that they had neither legal power nor legal obligation to do so, every bit of assistance that they gave him was in the nature of a gift, and they were free to cease helping him at any time.”


	
	Young JA, describing the test as being to a degree “smoke and mirrors” (at [135]), concluded (at [148]-[152]):
	


“[148] It would seem to me on first principles that if one has a person with disabilities, such as a child with parents or guardians, or an incapacitated person who has a manager, guardian or committee, that there is identity with that person who has a legal duty to act in the best interests of the incapable person. However, is the situation different where the incapable person does not have anybody who is legally bound to so act?

[149] This question must be approached by reminding oneself of the object of the exercise. That is, to measure the delay experienced by this claimant with the delay that would have been experienced by the hypothetical reasonable person. How can one do this unless one places the hypothetical reasonable person not only in the shoes of the claimant but also with his abilities and disabilities and in his home surrounded by his or her friends and relations?

[150] In my view it is virtually impossible to construct a model of a reasonable or ordinary person for the purpose of assessing comparable experience of delay unless one does take into account factors like a person’s friends and relations and their (limited or unlimited) capacity and ability and willingness to assist.

[151] Obviously there are other ways of looking at the problem and, indeed, when one takes those sorts of characteristics into account, one weakens the objective test which the legislature plainly intended should be applied. My earlier comments on objective tests mean that I am not overly concerned about this. Further, one may otherwise get a false result as the primary judge pointed out, why should the assistance of impecunious relatives and an unpaid solicitor put the claimant in a worse position than a brain-damaged plaintiff with no such assistance.

[152] The delay has to be considered by having a full account of what brought it about, including the conduct of the claimant and others. One then has to take that into account and say, if that delay in the circumstances of that activity or non-activity had occurred in the case of a reasonable person with no funds who is brain damaged and with relatives of limited means, would the same or greater delay have been experienced?”


	
	The particular problem of children whose claims are not brought within time has been more recently discussed by Rothman J in Zraika (bnf Zraika) v Walsh (2011) 60 MVR 17 at [28]-[30] as follows:
	


“[28] The test is an objective one, namely, whether a reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have been justified in experiencing the delay (Walker at [64], [108] and [134]), but the position of the claimant includes the legal or physical disability under which the claimant suffers, (Walker at [64], [97] and [107]).

[29] Even if, contrary to the authority in the Court of Appeal by which I am bound, and to which reference has been made, the reasonable person in the claimant’s position was a term that did not take account of the physical disabilities suffered by the claimant, there would be little or no difference in the circumstances of this case, where the claimant is now eight and a half years old, as already stated. At the conclusion of the three-year limitation period the claimant was two years and eight months of age. The period for which explanation is required is the period from the date of accident until the date upon which leave is sought to commence the proceedings, and, as again already stated, in this case includes the period during which the plaintiff was unborn.

[30] Nevertheless, it is not the tutor or the legal advisors that are even fictionally the “reasonable person” to which the Act refers, but their conduct forms, usually, part of the circumstances to be taken into account when considering whether the delay was justified: Walker at [100] and [150].”


	
	Mr Guihot submitted that this approach went further than Walker v Howard, but I consider that these are the same principles, merely differently expressed.
	
	
	In the present case, as is set out below, there is no documentation or evidence from the tutor as to why her claim proceeded and was settled, while her daughter’s claim never proceeded past the stage where the defendant admitted liability. She asserts that she only knew of the limitation period in March 2016; if that evidence is accepted, there is an explanation up to the date of filing of the statement of claim by reason of service of the s 85A particulars. The relevant evidence is set out in more detail below.
	


The conduct of the solicitor with carriage of the proceedings


	
	It is not uncommon, in cases such as the present, for the explanation to be the incompetence or dilatoriness of the solicitor in conducting the proceedings diligently and/or advising about limitation issues. In Smith v Grant, Basten JA stated, at [32] – [33]:
	


“[32]…Thus, the test of whether an explanation is satisfactory, requires consideration of whether “a reasonable person in the position of the claimant … would have been justified in experiencing the same delay”. That would appear to view the matter from the position of the claimant, and not the claimant’s solicitor. Accordingly what is relevant is any explanation given by the solicitor to the claimant, or, in the absence of explanation, a delay of a kind which might induce a reasonable person in the position of the claimant to seek an explanation.

[33] As noted above, the insurer contended that the conduct of a claimant must be taken to include the conduct of her authorised agent, namely the solicitor. To an extent that contention should be accepted. Thus the claimant seeks to rely upon steps taken by her solicitor and, indeed, his omissions. Those are objectively identifiable matters which may form part of a full explanation. However, for reasons given below, it does not follow that an assessment of whether the explanation is satisfactory or not, requires any normative judgment about the conduct of the solicitor (see at 749 [60]). That being so, it follows that an explanation may be a “full explanation” without exploring the blameworthiness, or otherwise, of the solicitor.”


	
	As is set out below, there are long gaps in the conduct of these proceedings which are never explained, and almost no documents produced from the file. The solicitor(s) with conduct for the period June – December 2015 are unknown.
	
	
	Mr Guihot submitted that, while the court might determine that the plaintiff’s age and medical problems might be sufficient for the “satisfactory” test, the failure of the plaintiff’s tutor and solicitors to provide key documents and explain long periods of inaction meant that the explanation could not be “full”.
	


“Full” explanation


	
	The defendant raised a series of issues in relation to the absence of documents and information.
	


(a) Absence of documents relating to knowledge of the limitation period


	
	The only explanation by the plaintiff’s mother, her tutor, as to her knowledge or belief concerning the three-year limitation period is the statement that she was told about this on 10 March 2016, ten months after the limitation period had expired.
	
	
	In her affidavit, the plaintiff’s mother refers to receipt of “some introductory letters” from the plaintiff’s solicitors, but these have not been provided. There are no documents in relation to the advice the plaintiff’s mother was given by the solicitors Catherine McKay and Christine Le in March and June 2014 concerning the lodgement of the claim for and the NRMA response in June 2014. There are no documents in relation to the plaintiff’s mother’s conference with Mr Petrie of counsel on 28 January 2016 or of the conversation she had with Ms Kakala on 10 March 2016, when she finally learned of the limitation period.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s mother asks the court to accept this evidence uncritically in circumstances where she does not produce the introductory letters or give details of the explanations and/or advice of Ms Le.
	
	
	In Smith v Grant, the plaintiff had not provided any statement about knowledge of the limitation period. As Basten JA noted (at [34] – [38]), it was necessary to know what to make of that absence of information. Basten JA did not consider it fatal, although these matters could have been more directly stated. The key was that the plaintiff depended on her solicitor’s legal advice and (at [37]) left it up to him, in circumstances where the plaintiff thought that the matter had excellent settlement prospects. The plaintiff’s tutor would certainly be entitled to think so here; there was an admission of liability, her own case was settled and there was expert medical evidence in the form of treating doctors’ reports.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s mother is a single parent who at all relevant times has lived in Housing Commission accommodation. She has one other child, whose complex medical history (since he suffered from Asperger’s Sydrome and seizures) meant she had a very difficult life. The plaintiff had been receiving treatment for a range of problems which I will not describe but which must have added to her mother’s difficulties.
	
	
	The absence of so much documentation is a significant gap and would falls well short of a full explanation unless the incompetence of PK Simpson Solicitors is taken into account. I am satisfied that PK Simpson did not adequately explain these issues to the plaintiff’s mother. She saw her own claim being progressed and did not understand that the limitation period in her daughter’s claim had been allowed to pass. To answer the question posed by Young JA in Walker v Howard, I am satisfied that a reasonable person with no funds who is brain damaged and with relatives of limited means, would have experienced the same or perhaps an even greater delay.
	


(b) Absence of affidavits or information about the conduct of the proceedings from the lawyers with carriage of the matter up until December 2015


	
	Independently of the absence of documentation about the plaintiff’s mother’s knowledge of the limitation period, there is a lack of documentation generally in relation to all aspects of the history of the solicitors’ conduct of the plaintiff’s claim.
	
	
	There is no affidavit from Ms McKay, the solicitor who first took instructions and filled out the claim form on 14 March 2014 and who had carriage of the proceedings until her departure in June 2015, after the limitation period had expired. Ms Le clearly provided advice in July 2014 about the claim being late in relation to the six-month period (see paragraphs 25 – 26 of the mother’s statutory declaration), but that advice has not been provided. No correspondence or file notes authored by Ms McKay are provided apart from three short letters seeking medical records and then forwarding these to the NRMA in July -September 2014.
	
	
	Another solicitor, Christine Le, contacted the mother about the section 81(1) Notice and witnessed the statutory declaration in 2014, but any advice she gave the plaintiff’s mother is undisclosed. No correspondence or file notes are provided in relation to this solicitor, and she is not mentioned in the chronology or affidavits.
	
	
	There is even less information about the unnamed “new solicitor” who had carriage of the claim from June to December 2015, except for the statement that “there appears to have been little activity on the file” (paragraphs 21 – 22 of Ms Kakala’s affidavit). No correspondence or file notes are produced. In particular, no correspondence with Mr Glancey about the missed appointments was produced. Mr Glancey addressed his report of 5 February 2016 to Ms McKay, although she had left the firm in June 2015. I note that over the same period the plaintiff’s mother was unaware that Ms McKay had left the firm.
	
	
	Ms Kakala appears to have taken over carriage of the matter in December 2015 at the earliest. However, she did not tell the plaintiff about the limitation period until 10 March 2016, in the course of an informal settlement conference. No documents to support this are produced.
	
	
	It is hard to credit the mother’s explanation of not knowing the three-year limitation period when she had not only brought and settled her own case, but had completed a statutory declaration in relation to the lateness of the lodgement of the claim. How is it possible that she did not notice the fact that her daughter’s claim was not being conducted alongside her own, and what was her understanding of limitations on motor vehicle claims at the time Ms Christine Le helped her fill out the statutory declaration? Ms Kakala’s affidavit is entirely silent as to any role Ms Le played and, as noted elsewhere, none of the file notes or introductory correspondence referred to in the affidavits have been attached.
	
	
	In Smith v Grant, Basten JA, allowing an appeal in circumstances similar to the present, observed:
	


“[60] Accordingly, the weight of authority under the Motor Accidents Act in this Court favoured the view that if a claimant could reasonably rely upon the conduct and advice of his or her solicitors, although it was negligent, such reliance could provide a satisfactory explanation for delay in commencing proceedings. That is consistent also with the approach revealed in Khoury v Linfox Australia Pty Ltd (at [22]) (Beazley JA, Tobias JA agreeing) in relation to the Motor Accidents Compensation Act.”


	
	As is set out above, I am satisfied that the reliance of the plaintiff’s mother on the advice of her solicitors, although it was negligent, could provide a full as well as a satisfactory explanation for her failure to ensure the same solicitors, in their action for her daughter, delayed the commencement of proceedings.
	


The explanation about delays in seeing doctors


	
	Although the plaintiff was already seeing a psychologist who was qualified to provide a diagnosis, a decision was made to retain a medico-legal expert and “on 27 November 2014, there is a file note from the solicitor who then had carriage of the matter” giving instructions to obtain such a report from “an appropriate child psychologist” (affidavit of Ms Kakala, paragraph 16). That file note is not produced, and neither is the letter to Dr Abu-Arab, or any correspondence with him concerning the plaintiff’s failure to attend.
	
	
	According to Ms Kakala’s affidavit, the mother failed to keep an appointment for the plaintiff with Dr Abu-Arab because she did not receive the letter detailing the appointment date. None of this material is attached, and none of the material about the subsequent retaining of Mr Glancey and the reasons for the two missed appointments and the final successful appointment is attached.
	
	
	The total absence of documents from the plaintiff’s file, the reference to unnamed solicitors and the unexplained delays in performing these tasks are unexplained other than by the incompetence of the solicitors. For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that a reasonable person in the place of the claimant would not have understood any of these requirements for specialist reports and would have been reliant upon the solicitors.
	


The failure to seek a CARS exemption until 2 December 2015 and failure to commence proceedings until May 2016


	
	The plaintiff’s failure to apply to have the claim exempted from CARS until 2 December 2016, which could have been done at any time after the insurer admitted liability on 6 August 2014, is unexplained. The claim was required to be exempted as a mandatory exemption under s 92(1)(a) of the Act (in accordance with Clause 8.11.13 of the Claims Assessment Guidelines). It was a straightforward application to make; in fact, the plaintiff’s application of 2 December 2015 was approved the following day.
	
	
	The importance of seeking the exemption certificate is that it was not possible to commence court proceedings until the certificate had been issued. When the certificate was issued, the plaintiff was (subject to satisfying s 109(3)) entitled to commence proceedings. However, the plaintiff did not do so until May 2016.
	
	
	Mr Petrie submitted that the reason for this was the two-month statutory bar on commencing proceedings after providing particulars, which occurred on 14 March 2016 (see ss 82(1)(b) and 85A). The reason for the delay in serving the particulars was that the plaintiff’s solicitors could not do so until they received Mr Glancey’s report. However, the reason for seeking a medico-legal report from Mr Glancey when the plaintiff already had a treating psychologist who had had the benefit of treating her both before and after the accident was never explained.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the reasons for not seeking a CARS exemption after liability was admitted are sufficiently full if one assumes incompetence of the solicitor.
	


“Satisfactory” explanation


	
	The explanation must be both full and satisfactory, and different factors and evidence may be relevant for each part of the test.
	
	
	However, in a case such as the present, the plaintiff’s young age and pre-existing problems are compounded by the difficulties of the tutor, a single parent struggling with serious injuries of her own and with a long history of having to care for the plaintiff and another child with cognitive disability problems.
	
	
	Each of the areas identified by Mr Guihot as requiring a full explanation also requires a satisfactory explanation. For the same reasons set out in relation to the fullness of the explanation, I am satisfied that these explanations are satisfactory, in that a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff would have been justified in experiencing the same degree of delay, having regard to the high degree of dependence and vulnerability of both the plaintiff and her tutor.
	
	
	The plaintiff has accordingly demonstrated a full and satisfactory explanation in accordance with the requirements of s 109 of the Act.
	
	
	I briefly note Mr Guihot’s submissions in relation to prejudice.
	


Prejudice


	
	No claim of actual prejudice was made.
	
	
	While the only prejudice claimed is presumptive, Mr Guihot submitted that it was significant. The plaintiff suffered from a wide range of pre-existing problems and the difficulties of untangling the skein of causation, especially given the effluxion of time, should be taken into account. However, the relatively recent report of Dr Glancey confirms that these are issues which can be addressed without significant difficulty.
	


Costs


	
	The inadequacies of the plaintiff’s affidavit material and the nature of the explanation of the delay are such that an order for costs in favour of the defendant should be made. I have granted liberty to restore in relation to costs in the event that any order is sought by the plaintiff’s tutor or by either party.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant to s 109 Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW), extend time for commencement of these proceedings to the date of the statement of claim filed in these proceedings, namely 17 May 2016.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs.
	
	
	Liberty to restore in relation to costs.
	
	
	Exhibits retained for 28 days.

2816805,Li v R [2016] NSWDC 275,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against severity of a sentence passed by her Honour Ms Viney, sitting in the Local Court at Hornsby on 2 November 2015.
	
	
	The appellant had been charged with an offence contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The formal charge was that on 9 April 2015 at Chatswood she did intentionally or recklessly destroy property, namely a motor vehicle, registered number NN22LL, the property of Lei Gao. Her Honour imposed a fine of $800 and ordered the appellant to pay compensation of $3,806. That compensation has in fact been paid by the appellant to the Registrar and the Registrar has forwarded it to the victim, Mr Gao, who has acknowledged receipt of the full amount of compensation. The facts of the matter are disturbing. Mr Gao drove his vehicle into the Westfield Chatswood car park at 11.50am on 9 April 2015. That was proven by the tender of a parking ticket that had been issued by the proprietor of the car park to Mr Gao. Mr Gao was driving a bright blue Ford Falcon XR6 Sedan. It would appear that the appellant had already entered the same car park driving a grey Ford Focus hatchback, registered number AQ73LC. A dispute arose between Mr Gao and the appellant, Mrs Li. The police facts before me appear to have been largely based on a statement taken by the police from Mr Gao. The police facts continue thus:
	


“A dispute arose over a parking space. Mr Gao parked his vehicle in one space. The appellant alighted from her vehicle and approached Mr Gao. She knocked on the driver’s side window of his vehicle and said words to the effect of, ‘Why did you take my spot? It’s my spot”.

Mr Gao remained in his vehicle but replied to the appellant thus:

“Because you were flashing your left-hand indicator waiting for another person to leave and then you suddenly saw the people leaving on this side. You can’t just do whatever you want and take a different spot because they are leaving earlier than the spot you were already waiting for”.

The appellant said, “I’ve been waiting for her for a really long time and you can’t just take my spot”. According to what the appellant told police when she was initially interviewed Mr Gao said to her, “I don’t care”. According to the appellant Mr Gao gave her “the finger” meaning I assume that he made a rude gesture with either his index or long finger.


	
	I do not know what Mr Gao said about the appellant’s allegation. In any event it is clear that the appellant returned to her motor vehicle and Mr Gao alighted from his vehicle and headed towards the shopping centre. Mr Gao believed that the appellant was staring at him and he became nervous, concerned that the appellant might harm his car. He recorded the time, 11.57am, and the registration number of the appellant’s vehicle on his telephone and then entered the shopping centre. Documentary evidence before the Local Court indicated that Mr Gao obtained a receipt from a shop within the shopping centre indicating a payment of $200 made at 12.02pm on that same day. Video footage available also indicated that Mr Gao entered the store in question at 11.51am and left the store at 12.02pm the same minute within which he made payment to the shopkeeper. Mr Gao then returned to his vehicle.
	
	
	As he was returning to his vehicle he saw the appellant walking down the offside of his vehicle from its rear to its front holding something in her left hand. Mr Gao believed that the appellant was scratching the stainless steel part of her key along the offside of his vehicle. He yelled out to the appellant, “What are you doing?” And according to Mr Gao the appellant ran away from the entry into the shopping centre from which Mr Gao was entering the car park.
	
	
	Mr Gao inspected his vehicle. He saw a deep scratch down to metal which went from the middle of the rear offside passenger door to the middle of the front offside door. He then inspected the nearside of the vehicle and found another deep scratch down to metal on the middle nearside rear passenger to the back quarter bumper bar.
	
	
	Mr Gao made attempts to find the appellant but was unsuccessful. He contacted the police. Using the registration number that he had recorded on his telephone the police were able to identify the owner of the registered vehicle and were then able to deduce that the person who may have been driving the vehicle was the wife of the registered owner. There became no dispute about that. Police inspected Mr Gao’s vehicle and noted large deep scratches on both the nearside and the offside of the vehicle. Photographs of the damage were put before the Local Court. Constable Claire Taylor of the Chatswood Police believed the scratches were fresh because of fine dust and paint flecks still remaining around the scratches. CCTV footage from the car park also shows that the car did not bear those scratches at the time that it was driven into the car park by Mr Gao.
	
	
	The police did not attempt to interview the appellant without the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter. An interview was conducted with the appellant and her husband on Friday 10 April 2015. However, on 9 April the appellant had briefly spoken with the police who asked her whether they could inspect her car key. The statement of Constable Taylor says this:
	


“The accused handed me her car key and I tapped it onto a white bit of paper, dark flecks fell onto the piece of paper. Sergeant Craig Wotherspoon was present when I did this and saw the flecks. As the accused did not speak English that well I did not want to ask further questions without organising an interpreter.”

On 10 April 2015, the police delivered a statutory demand to the appellant’s husband under the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 s173 and he admitted that his wife, the appellant, was the driver of his motor vehicle at about 12.05pm on 9 April 2015.


	
	There was a formal record-of-interview conducted with the appellant which was electronically recorded. The ERISP was in evidence, I assume, in the Local Court as it has been placed in evidence before me. The appellant admitted interaction with the owner of the other vehicle, Mr Gao, and complained about his “giving me the finger” and of how rude Mr Gao was towards her. However, when she was asked whether she scratched his car with her key there was no invoking her right against self-incrimination but rather an outright denial, that denial was maintained in the interview. It is relevant, in my view, to consider that because it goes to a question of remorse and contrition.
	
	
	The appellant was given a court attendance notice which appears to have been first returnable at Hornsby Local Court on 10 June 2015. The appellant entered a plea of not guilty on 24 June 2015. The matter was eventually set down for hearing on 2 November 2015 when the learned magistrate found the appellant guilty and imposed the sentence which the appellant now seeks to have set aside and replaced with an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In particular, the appellant asks me to make an order under s 10(1)(b) and requiring her to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for what, through her counsel she submits, ought be a lengthy period of time, a period of time greater than one year.
	
	
	At the time of the offence, the offender was 32 years old. She is now 33 years old. She came to Australia sometime in 2010 from China with her husband. As a requirement of her visa she has been studying spoken and written English at TAFE. She has completed certificates I and II and is yet to finish certificate III. When she completes that certificate she wishes to undertake childcare studies in order to be a child carer. Her letter to the court which is exhibit 2 continues thus:
	


“Before coming to Australia, I was a secretary in Huawei and I was working with Yue Yan in Shanghai with children with disabilities for two years. Yue Yan was created after the Sichuan Earthquake in China in 2008. After the earthquake, there was a lot of children with disabilities.

Because of my work with children in China, I hope to continue that and hope to one day work in childcare in Australia.

To do childcare, I will need to pass my children check and they will look at my criminal history and my conviction. I am really worried.

I am also worried that the Department of Immigration may also look into my visa. I am now a permanent resident.

I also have a daughter. She is three and a half. I have been trying to finish my [Australian Migrant English Program] and look after her.

I promise this will never happen again.”

The appellant has no criminal history in Australia. There is nothing to suggest that she has any criminal record in her native land and I find it likely that if she had a criminal record in her native land that she would not have been permitted to travel to Australia and obtain permanent residence. The appellant, accordingly, came before the Local Court and comes before this Court as a lady of prior good character.


	
	She is endeavouring to better her skills in spoken and written English for which she is to be congratulated. She now has a child who was clearly born in this country and would, by that fact, automatically be an Australian citizen. I am aware that sometimes the Department of Immigration takes into account a person’s criminal record in determining whether to admit that person to permanent residence or to citizenship and sometimes the existence of a criminal record is a cause for the Department of Immigration to revoke a visa which might include permanent residence. However, in this Court’s experience the crime which would engender or enliven such a decision would be a crime of some moment, in particular, crimes involving serious personal violence or serious fraud. I am completely unaware of any case in which a person has been deported from this country for recklessly damaging property and the extent of the damage being $3,806. Bearing in mind that the appellant has a child who is an Australian citizen, it appears to me highly unlikely that she would be liable to be deported or have her immigration status reassessed by the Department of Immigration and, therefore, it appears to me that her fear about such a change is not well founded. However, it is not up to me to act on my knowledge but rather on the appellant to put before me evidence which would justify my taking into account her subjective fear which does not, to me, appear to be objectively based.
	
	
	In R v Mauger [2012] NSWCCA 51 Harrison J, with whom Beazley JA (as she then was) and McCallum J concurred, said this commencing at [30]:
	


“30. The Crown pointed out that there was authority for the proposition that the existence and terms of entry restrictions imposed by foreign countries on international visitors was not an appropriate matter for judicial notice: United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International [1982] 2 NSWLR 766 at 801. Despite this, and the sparse state of the evidence on the topic, her Honour found that the ""consequences of his actions have the capacity to destroy his career and to prevent him from travelling overseas"". The Crown contended that the nature or extent of any restrictions upon the respondent's ability to travel to the USA were not supported by the evidence and his ability to travel to other counties was irrelevant and should have been given no, or very little, weight.

31. I agree. It does not seem to me that generalised prognostications about the respondent's ability to travel overseas unsupported by clear evidence could properly be matters that fell within what is contemplated by the words ""any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider"". It may be different if the sentencing judge were confronted with evidence to suggest that a particular offender faced the loss of his livelihood as the result of travel restrictions upon convicted persons, or that he faced the prosect of the loss of the ability to visit, or return to, family overseas, in which circumstances some definite and enduring hardship or disruption could be demonstrated or confidently predicted. This is not the case here. In my view her Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried to the extent that she proceeded to a conclusion that no conviction should be recorded in a way that was based on such matters.”

Where the Court’s experience suggests that a subjective belief by an appellant is not well grounded, it is incumbent upon the appellant to put before the Court evidence which would support any fear subjectively held that a conviction might interfere with things such as an appellant’s status as a resident in this country or visitor to this country, or, indeed, that might interfere with the appellant’s ability to obtain employment in the future.


	
	I can readily accept that to do child care work the appellant would have to obtain a licence, permit, permission, or the like from a person who was identified by learned counsel for the appellant as the Children’s Guardian. I can readily accept that if a person has been found guilty, for example, of a child sexual assault or a crime of violence against a child that it would be extremely improbable that such a person might obtain a licence, permit or permission to engage upon child care work. However, nothing has been put before me to suggest that it would be inimical to the appellant’s ability to obtain a child care permit, licence or permission when there had been a conviction recorded for relatively minor criminal damage. When I say “minor damage” I am referring to the extent or the monetary cost of repairing the damage.
	
	
	The appellant has promised the Court that she will not re-offend. I accept that the promise is genuine. However, other than paying the compensation ordered to be paid, the appellant has not shown in any way how this offence might never again occur. In essence, the appellant became angry because she did not get her way as far as the parking place was concerned and she then deliberately damaged the victim’s vehicle in protest at not obtaining her own way. This is an act prompted by, in essence, selfishness and showing a complete lack of respect for the rights of others. This was clearly a premeditated crime.
	
	
	A crime contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act was considered in Hoffenberg v The District Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 142. The applicant in that case had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the charge under s 195(1)(a). He was placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. He appealed to this Court. The gravamen of his complaint was not that he had been put on a bond but that he had been convicted. His appeal was dealt with by the Blanch CJ of DC. His Honour dismissed the appellant’s appeal. There is no right of appeal from this Court which had heard an appeal from the Local Court in a criminal matter. The only way to go to the Supreme Court from the decision of Blanch CJ was to seek prerogative relief. The applicant in that case sought an order in the nature of certiorari. The applicant was refused.
	
	
	The charge in Hoffenberg’s case was recklessly destroying or damaging property, namely a glass shopfront window of premises in Oxford Street, Bondi Junction. The premises were described as “Jews for Jesus”. It would appear that the applicant had been charged with other offences but no convictions in that regard were recorded. Initially the applicant had urinated on the door of the premises. He then went away with a co-offender and found a brick and returned with the brick to the shopfront and threw the brick through the window. McClellan CJ at CL said this:
	


“19. The appeal to the District Court was heard by the Chief Judge who declined to accept the applicant’s submission. In the course of considering that submission, his Honour gave careful consideration to the circumstances of the offence including whether or not it was motivated by religious intolerance but concluded that it was not. Having excluded that issue his Honour considered the nature of the offending and concluded that the applicant had acted deliberately. His Honour said:

‘The question then comes down to one of whether or not it was a deliberate act and how far it was caused by his intoxication.

[...]

It clearly was a deliberate act. He was urinating on the door. The magistrate has not convicted him in respect of those matters but has convicted him on the one matter. The reason for doing that obviously was because this act was regarded as a deliberate act of vandalism and there is no doubt about the fact that it was because he and his co-offender walked away. When he found the brick they went back there to the very same premises and smashed the window.’

20. His Honour indicated that because the applicant had engaged in a deliberate act of vandalism, in his opinion the offence would normally result in the recording of a conviction. However, prior to arriving at his decision the Chief Judge considered the particular circumstances of the applicant and the consequences that might flow to him if the conviction was maintained, including any impact upon his future university studies in engineering because of his desire to complete his degree in America. His Honour recognised that a conviction would raise difficulties for the applicant in some jurisdictions although it would not be an absolute bar to him completing his degree or obtaining employment. His Honour weighed these matters and concluded that:

‘in all those circumstances it would not be appropriate to exercise a discretion’.

His Honour dismissed the appeal and confirmed the orders made by the magistrate.”

After quoting the terms of s 10 his Honour went on to say this:

“25. Accordingly, pursuant to s 10(3), his Honour was required to consider “the trivial nature of the offence.” When considering that issue his Honour, in my view correctly, considered whether the applicant’s actions were deliberate, in the sense of considered, pre-meditated or deliberated upon. His Honour took the view, as he was entitled to do, that a deliberate act of vandalism placed the nature of the offence beyond the trivial and may, depending on all the circumstances, deny an offender the benefit of an order pursuant to s 10.”

His Honour went on to find that there was no error in the Chief Judge’s “deliberative process” and accordingly there was no jurisdictional error, and accordingly the application to the Court of Appeal for certiorari was dismissed.


	
	Here there was a confrontation between the appellant and Mr Gao when Mr Gao was still in his vehicle and the appellant was outside. The appellant left Mr Gao’s vehicle as did Mr Gao. When he had disappeared the appellant returned to Mr Gao’s vehicle and commenced to damage it. This clearly was a premeditated, planned, vengeful act. There was no suggestion of any spontaneous act of retribution in a fit of rage by the appellant, but rather the act of leaving the scene of the complainant’s vehicle, returning to her own, and then after the victim had left his vehicle returning to it and damaging it to punish the victim for what the appellant perceived to be an interference with her own entitlement. Factually the same consideration as that arose in the mind of the Chief Judge in Hoffenberg arises in the current case.
	
	
	Unfortunately both road rage and car park rage are increasingly prevalent in the community. Both general deterrence and specific deterrence need to be enforced.
	
	
	Until the time of her conviction the appellant had no remorse and no contrition. It has been submitted on her behalf that she has shown remorse by paying the compensation. That is at least some indication of the change of mind, but the remorse may well be remorse that she has been convicted and found to have acted in a criminal fashion, rather than true remorse, remorse for the damage that she did to Mr Gao’s property, and the distress that that damage caused him, and the inconvenience that it subsequently caused him in having to obtain quotes and have his car repaired. In other words I am not persuaded that there is real victim empathy in this case.
	
	
	There is no evidence which supports the appellant’s fears of this conviction’s interfering with either her ability to remain a resident in this country, or to aspire to become a citizen of this country, nor to support her fear that a conviction may somehow prevent or impede her working with children in the future.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of the Court’s discretion under s 10. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

2816810,New South Wales Crime Commission v Tran [2016] NSWSC 1526,"Judgment


	
	By summons which I grant leave to file today, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex parte, seeking restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in certain property of the defendant, Dinh Hung Tran. Other orders under s 12(1), ss 22, 28A and 22AA of the Act were also there sought. The orders pressed were for restraining orders under s 10A and orders under s 12(1).
	
	
	The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 27 October 2016 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission’s Director (Financial Investigations) and an authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
	
	
	The property sought to be restrained is identified in a schedule to the summons as real property located at Bankstown, registered in Dinh Hung Tran’s name, as well as vehicles registered in that name and funds held in Westpac accounts in that name.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Dinh Hung Tran had engaged in serious crime related activity or activities within the definition of a “serious crime related activity” in s 6 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, namely, cultivate prohibited plant (cannabis) contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	Mr Spark there also gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold that suspicion. It rested on a consideration of documents obtained by employees of the Commission, including a court attendance notice and facts sheet created by Detective Scard; questions which Mr Spark posed to the detective and responses which he gave; as well as searches conducted of the records held in the COPS database, which showed that on 30 September 2016 Dinh Hung Tran had been charged with the offence dealt with in the Facts Sheet, which was annexed to the affidavit.
	
	
	Mr Spark had also had regard to information obtained as the result of searches conducted of the LPI, Veda and, RMS databases in relation to the property of Dinh Hung Tran, as well as information provided by Westpac as to bank accounts held in that name.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in relation to real estate very quickly; to dispose of motor vehicles; or to backdate forms notifying the RMS of disposal of such a vehicle; and to dispose of funds held in bank accounts, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Dinh Hung Tran is apparently involved, that notice should not be given of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed.
	
	
	In this case I am satisfied that the material relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation, the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, I have concluded that it was also appropriate to make the other orders sought.
	
	
	I have reached those conclusions on a consideration of the material relied on, including what was disclosed in the Facts Sheet, as to which Mr Spark deposed that he believed in the truth of its contents.
	
	
	That document indicated that Dinh Hung Tran was arrested and charged following an investigation into copper theft in an industrial area, during which a vehicle came to police attention, parked at night outside a large industrial shed, from which sounds of movement were detected. On entry a large structure was found and a strong smell of cannabis detected. A number of males present attempted to flee. Dinh Hung Tran was one of those pursued and arrested. A large, sophisticated hydroponic cannabis operation was found inside the structure, with some 566 plants later seized from what proved to be a sophisticated growing environment there discovered. Power had been diverted around the meter board, with stolen energy being used to supply 6 large rooms equipped with growth lamps, fans and filtration devices. Water was also being supplied to the pot of every plant. The estimated total value of the plants seized was in excess of $2 million. Cannabis heads were also found on some 30 square metres of drying rack.
	
	
	Dinh Hung Tran was charged with a cultivation offence, but it was expected that the amount of cannabis would be found to exceed the commercial quantity with the result that a charge of supply prohibited drug would then also be laid against him.
	
	
	All of these matters, I am satisfied, provided a proper basis for the making of the orders sought.
	
	
	On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex parte. In coming to that view, I had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permits an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days’ notice.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought, as well as ordering that the Commission serve a copy of this judgment on Dinh Hung Tran.

2816811,The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2016] NSWSC 1524,"Judgment


	
	The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police seeks forfeiture and other orders under s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in respect of cash the subject of orders made earlier in these proceedings under that Act.
	
	
	In February 2016 Davies J made orders under ss 19 and 38 of the Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to the cash, in which two interested persons were identified, Christopher Patino and Benjamin James Faulkner. They had been convicted of offences under s 400.9.1 of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), of dealing with money or property reasonably suspected to be the proceeds of crime having a value of $100,000 or more; s 307.5.1 of the Schedule, of being in possession of a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug; and under s 307.1 of the Schedule, of importing or exporting a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. (see Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police dated 10 February 2016 [2016] NSWSC 56).
	
	
	In April 2016 Hall J made further consent restraining orders, as well as a custody and control order (see Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (Supreme Court (NSW), 13 April 2016, unrep). The application for forfeiture orders was adjourned.
	
	
	At the hearing on 27 October, forfeiture orders were sought in respect of cash seized by the Australian Federal Police in November 2011 namely, $AUD138,450 seized at Cabramatta and $AUD320.00 seized at Wetherill Park, plus interest earned thereon.
	
	
	I am satisfied that all of the requirements for the making of the forfeiture orders sought have been satisfied.
	
	
	Firstly, all of the restraining orders made in these proceedings have now been in force for at least 6 months (s 49(1)(b)).
	
	
	The other requirements of s 49 were addressed in an affidavit sworn by Mr Paterson, a special member of the Australian Federal Police, who deposed to the basis of his belief that the cash the subject of the forfeiture application was the proceeds of one or more indictable offences (s 49(1)(c)).
	
	
	On that evidence it is apparent that the money the subject of the application was seized as the result of an investigation commenced in October 2011 into the importation of cocaine and methamphetamine, which resulted in large quantities of those drugs being located in a tractor grapple bucket which arrived at Sydney International Airport. The ensuing investigation into the consignment resulted in the identification and arrest of Mr Patino and Mr Faulkner in November 2011. A search of a residence at Cabramatta, where both Mr Patino and Mr Faulkner had resided, resulted in seizure of various items, including large bundles of cash, while search of a warehouse at Wetherill Park located the cash totalling $320.00. Mr Patino and Mr Faulkner later entered pleas of guilty to the various offences for which they were sentenced.
	
	
	Mr Paterson’s belief rested on these matters and on the absence of any lawful explanation for the seized cash, which, he believed, had been derived from the unlawful importation and sale of border controlled drugs and was used or intended to be used in connection with such importation.
	
	
	Mr Paterson also described the steps which were pursued to identify and notify persons with an interest in the proceedings, of the various orders being pursued. On 25 January 2016, Mr Patino advised that he had no objections to the orders and that he had no interest in the money the subject of this application. He has not responded since served with notice of the restraining orders earlier made in the proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Faulkner was represented at the February hearing before Davies J, when an application for exclusion in respect of $3,000 of the seized cash was foreshadowed. In April he consented to restraining orders in respect of that $3,000. He was later given advice of the forfeiture application, but has also not appeared to oppose it.
	
	
	On the evidence no other person with an interest in the cash the subject of the proceedings have been identified, or advised the Australian Federal Police of any interest in that cash. Nor has any application under s 49(3) been made in these proceedings, in respect of any part of that cash, for its exclusion from the forfeiture order sought.
	
	
	Accordingly, s 49(3) takes effect, with the result that the Court need not be satisfied of the matters specified in s 49(1)(c). In all of those circumstances, I am satisfied that the Court’s power to make the forfeiture order sought must now be exercised.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I order that:
	


Forfeiture Orders

1   Pursuant to Section 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (Act), the property specified in Schedule One is forfeited to the Commonwealth.

2   Pursuant to Section 49 of the Act, the property specified in Schedule Two is forfeited to the Commonwealth.

Other Orders

3   Pursuant to section 69(2) of the Act, the Plaintiff and the Commonwealth have leave to deal with the forfeited property immediately.

4   Any orders be entered forthwith.

SCHEDULE ONE

The total cash sum of AUD$138,450.00 seized by members of the Australian Federal Police on 4 November 2011 at X/X XXXXXX Street, Cabramatta NSW and deposited into the AFP Trust Account with the Reserve Bank of Australia on 30 May 2014, together with any interest earned on that amount.

SCHEDULE TWO

The cash sum of AUD$320.00 seized by members of the Australian Federal Police on 4 November 2011 at XX-XX XXXXXX Road, Wetherill Park, NSW and deposited into the AFP Trust Account with the Reserve Bank of Australia on 30 May 2014, together with any interest earned on that amount.

: The appellant was charged in the subordinate courts with three counts under s 58(b) of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36) of failing to pay contributions to the Central Provident Fund (`CPF`) for the month of January 1998 in respect of three of its employees within the period prescribed by reg 2(1) of the CPF Regulations 1987, namely, 14 days from 1 February 1998. The appellant was convicted as charged, and was fined $1,500 on each charge. It was also ordered to pay arrears of $3,199 to the CPF Board and the costs of prosecution, which were fixed at $6,500. I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against its conviction and sentence, and now give my reasons.
 The background facts 
 
 
 
The appellant is a company involved in the business of providing computer products. It commenced operations in April 1997, when it took over the business of Arts Niche Cyber Distribution (`Arts Niche`), a sole proprietorship owned by one Kho Siaw Hwie (`Kho`). Kho, who represented the appellant in this appeal, was at all material times in charge of the management of the company and was also responsible for paying the wages of its staff. The other director of the company, Saw Chaik Lee, was merely a `sleeping` director.
The appellant first began to experience financial difficulties in July 1997 when a number of its business ventures fell through. By September 1997, its prospects were, according to Kho, very bleak. At the time of the trial, the company was still in existence, but had ceased operations and no longer had any employees working for it.
In the court below, it was not in dispute that the appellant had not paid any CPF contributions for the month of January 1998 in respect of Ong Bee Yan (`Ong`), Wan Wai Kay (`Wan`) and Aw Kok Chun (`Aw`), who were alleged to be its employees at the material time. The only issue before the trial judge was whether Ong, Wan and Aw were in fact employees of the appellant in January 1998 within the meaning of the CPF Act for CPF contributions to be payable.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The prosecution`s case, in essence, was that Ong, Wan and Aw were all employees of the appellant at the material time. These three witnesses gave evidence to this effect at the trial.
 Ong`s evidence
Ong testified that she joined the appellant as an administrative assistant on 17 June 1997, with a starting salary of $1,680. She was given two salary increments between July and October 1997, first to $1,800 and then to $2,000. Her duties had included recording leave taken by the company`s staff and changes in the company`s stock. She had also dealt with the issuing of pay cheques for staff salaries. She had prepared these pay cheques on Kho`s instructions by filling in the names of the payees and the amounts payable on the cheques before letting Kho sign them; she had never filled in cheques pre-signed by Kho.
Ong told the court that she had been paid her salary regularly from June to October 1997. Her pay cheque for November 1997, however, had been dishonoured. During cross-examination, she denied that this cheque had been pre-signed by Kho and that she had filled it in and presented it for payment without his knowledge.
Ong stated that in December 1997 and January 1998, she likewise failed to receive her salary from the appellant despite having asked Kho for it on several occasions. Eventually, she decided to leave the company. She handed in her letter of resignation in January 1998, and her last day of work was on 21 February 1998. She had not been dismissed by the appellant in November 1997; neither had she ever received a letter of termination from the company. She also denied Kho`s allegations that she was guilty of `moonlighting` and misusing the appellant`s confidential information whilst in its employment.
 Wan`s evidence
Wan`s evidence was that he started working for Kho at Arts Niche in August 1995. When the appellant was incorporated, he joined it as a systems specialist. Although there was no written contract of employment between him and the company, he had been employed by the latter at the material time.
Wan testified that the appellant had not paid him any salary since November 1997 and had stopped paying contributions to his CPF account since September 1997. He had received a pay cheque for November 1997 from Kho, but had been told not to present it for payment as the company had no funds to honour the cheque. For December 1997 and January 1998, he had not received any pay cheques at all. Although Kho had given him cash amounting to a few hundred dollars during those months, these sums were simply `something like pocket money`, and did not constitute payment for work which he had done for the appellant on its projects.
Wan also told the court that he had never been sacked by Kho or questioned about any impropriety or mismanagement on his part. Although some of the appellant`s employees had been dismissed in the second half of 1997, he was not one of them and had never received a letter of termination from the company. In fact, Kho had asked him to stay on with the company. Furthermore, although some of the appellant`s stock had been found to be missing, this had nothing to do with him. He had left the company`s employment only on 21 January 1998, approximately one month after he handed in his letter of resignation to Kho on 29 December 1997. He gave as the reason for his resignation the appellant`s failure to pay his salary since November 1997.
 Aw`s evidence
Aw testified that he joined the appellant on 1 October 1997 as a systems engineer. He had received his salary for October and November 1997, but had not been paid from December 1997 onwards. The appellant had not paid the contributions to his CPF account for the months of October 1997 to February 1998 either.
Aw stated that in February 1998, he decided to resign from the appellant`s employment unless he was paid his arrears in salary. He had never been dismissed by the company, whether in October 1997 or subsequently; neither had he received a letter from the company terminating his services. He was also not guilty of any misconduct whilst he was employed by the appellant. He had tendered his `Letter of Notification` to Kho on 24 February 1998, and his last day of work had been on 28 February 1998. On that day, he had received a cheque for $500 from Kho in respect of work done on the `Orchidville` project. He had signed a note acknowledging his receipt of this sum `in capacity of subcontractor [sic]` at Kho`s request. Kho had informed him that the appellant could not pay him as an employee as it was being investigated by the CPF Board at that time, such that `all payments were to go to CPF first`; instead, it could only pay him as a sub-contractor.
 The appellant`s defence 
 
 
 
The appellant`s defence, in contrast, was that Ong, Wan and Aw were no longer its employees in January 1998. At the trial, Kho gave evidence on the appellant`s behalf in support of this line of argument.
In respect of Ong and Wan, Kho testified that he had told them to leave the appellant`s employment in September 1997. He gave two reasons for his doing so. First, the company was in financial difficulties at that time and its future prospects were bleak. Second, and more importantly, he suspected that Ong and Wan, amongst other staff, were guilty of misconduct. Much of the evidence implicating them was said to have been recovered during a `lockout` carried out by the appellant in December 1997, during which its staff were kept out of their offices and its premises searched.
The allegations of misconduct against Ong and Wan covered four main areas. First, Kho stated that he suspected Ong and Wan of being involved in `moonlighting` activities. The basis of his suspicion in Ong`s case was her alleged poor performance at work. Kho told the court that he was not satisfied with Ong`s supervision of Wan on matters relating to stock control. He also considered that she had not kept proper records of the appellant`s stock, the leave taken by its staff, and the disbursements of petty cash. In Wan`s case, Kho suspected him of `moonlighting` due to his failure to achieve the appellant`s target of making 15 sales calls per day, his failure to submit sales forecasts regularly, and the presence of numerous namecards in his office which were not reflected in his sales reports.
Second, Kho alleged that Wan had failed to bring to his attention the misuse of computer facilities by Andrea Gan, one of the appellant`s staff. Andrea Gan had apparently installed unauthorised software into her computer at the office and used it for her own personal purposes. Kho stated that this incident had taken place in December 1996, but Wan did not report it to him until March 1997, when he tendered a written `Statement of Investigation`.
Third, Kho asserted that Wan had failed to keep proper records of the appellant`s stock. He highlighted in particular Wan`s failure to record the company`s T-loan of equipment worth $1,380 to Nanyang Polytechnic in the stock books.
Fourth, Kho told the court that Ong and Wan were suspected of collaborating in making unauthorised payments to students who were on part-time attachment with the appellant, contrary to the company`s policy. Ong was also suspected of releasing cheques without his authorisation. To substantiate his claim that such unauthorised payments had been made, Kho pointed to the fact that on 24 November 1997, a cheque for $5,000 drawn on the appellant`s account with Keppel Bank had bounced. He explained that the appellant`s practice was to leave in its bank accounts only such funds as would be needed to cover cheques intended to be released. The balance in the appellant`s Keppel Bank account in November 1997 before the cheque for $5,000 was presented for payment was $4,876.40. According to Kho, if no unauthorised payments had been made, that cheque would have been cleared. On this reasoning, the fact that the cheque was returned meant that a sum of some $123.60 had been released without his authorisation. The pay cheques which Ong and Wan claimed they had been given for their November 1997 salary were said to be unauthorised cheques as well. In support of this contention, Kho stated that Arthur Yao, one of the directors of the appellant`s sister company (`AM5`), had paid a sum of $10,000 into the appellant`s Keppel Bank account in December 1997 to cover pay cheques for AM5`s staff, as the practice was for both the appellant`s and AM5`s staff to be paid from that bank account. The appellant thus had a balance of $10,895.47 in its Keppel Bank account after Arthur Yao had paid in the $10,000. Kho claimed that there would not have been sufficient funds left in the account to cover Ong`s November salary after AM5`s staff had been paid, and thus, he could not have authorised the release of her pay cheque for that month. The fact that Ong`s cheque subsequently bounced on 9 December 1997 was said to be proof that she had slipped in a cheque for her own salary without prior authorisation. Kho alleged that the unauthorised cheques had been released as a result of Ong filling in cheques which he had pre-signed and issuing these cheques. He relied on her records of cheques issued by the appellant, in which certain cheques were described as `blank`, to back up his assertion that she had received such pre-signed blank cheques.
Kho testified that when Ong and Wan were given notice in September 1997 to leave the appellant`s employment, both of them pleaded to be allowed to stay on. He told them that if they stayed on with the appellant, it would be on a `by-project` basis, by which he meant that 
 
somebody pays a company for a service or goods received, the company will split the gross profit among the staff in a consultative manner, meaning I will disclose to the staff the gross profit, and we would jointly decide how to split. The company is not in the sharing, and merely welfare token. ... The ex-staff who took up this project ... are not doing this in the company`s premises, and they are not performing their duty as prescribed by the employment or service contract... [sic]
 
 
 
According to Kho, Ong and Wan agreed to work on a `by-project` basis after October 1997. He conceded that no letters of termination were served on them, but explained that this was because he was concerned that their job prospects might be jeopardised if it was known that they had been served with written notices to quit. He added that it was not his policy to issue his staff with letters of termination unless they were guilty of serious misconduct, such as stealing from the appellant or causing major injury to its reputation.
In the case of Wan, Kho also appeared to suggest that he had never been employed by the appellant at all as he had not signed a new service agreement when the company was incorporated in 1997. Paradoxically, he went on to assert that 
 
Wan was employed on a month-to-month basis with the company, because there wasn`t a contract between the company and Mr Wan. ... Every month I pay the salary and CPF, there is no contract, therefore I can terminate anytime.
 
 
 
In respect of Aw, the appellant`s defence was that Aw had been recruited in August 1997 to replace Wan and had started work on 1 October 1997. Owing to the appellant`s poor business at that time, Kho had informed Aw orally at the end of October that he would be transferred to AM5. Aw had however indicated that he was `not aspired` [sic] for the type of work which he would have to do at AM5, and had agreed that November 1997 would be his last month in the appellant`s employment. As in the case of Ong and Wan, Aw was not given any written notice of termination of his employment; neither was there a written record of Kho`s offer to transfer him to AM5. According to Kho, Aw was no longer an employee of the appellant after November 1997. Instead, he only worked for it on a `by-project` basis, such as assisting it with the `Orchidville` project at Suntec City.
 The decision at first instance 
 
 
 
The trial judge was not convinced by Kho`s allegations that the appellant had terminated the employment of Ong and Wan due to their misconduct.
In respect of Ong, the trial judge held that the mere fact that some of the cheques issued by the appellant had been recorded as `blank` cheques ([lowbar] 19, supra) did not point to the conclusion that these cheques were pre-signed blank cheques which had been given to Ong. She suggested that the cheques could, for instance, have been unused cheques. Since Ong had not been cross-examined on her records of the cheques issued by the appellant, the trial judge considered that no meaningful inferences could be drawn from this piece of evidence. As for the fact that Ong`s pay cheque for November 1997 had bounced on 9 December 1997, the trial judge held that this did not constitute proof that the cheque had been released without Kho`s authorisation. This was because it was not only Ong`s cheque which had bounced. Four other pay cheques issued to AM5`s staff had also been returned on the same day. The trial judge found that all of these cheques had bounced as they had been presented for payment on 8 December 1997 before Arthur Yao deposited the $10,000 into the appellant`s Keppel Bank account. Besides, based on her calculations, the total amount of the cheques, including Ong`s cheque, came up to $10,620.90. The trial judge pointed out that if the $10,000 had been deposited before the cheques were presented for payment, the balance in the account ($10,895.47) would have been sufficient to cover all the cheques. She was thus not satisfied that Ong was guilty of wrongdoing, as a result of which her employment with the appellant had been terminated.
With regards to Kho`s allegations against Wan, the trial judge considered that they had been successfully rebutted by Wan`s evidence. Wan testified that he had never been involved in `moonlighting` activities whilst he was employed by the appellant. He had not been able to achieve the appellant`s target of 15 sales calls per day as he had to carry out both sales and technical duties and was thus unable to devote all this time to his sales work. He admitted that he had not included all the sales calls which he made in his sales reports, but stated that this was because the reports did not reflect calls made to potential customers who had shown little or no interest in the appellant`s products. Similarly, with regards to the namecards found in his office, Wan explained that not all of these names had been listed in his sales forecasts as he had either deleted them when they proved to be dead-ends or overwritten them when he generated new reports. In respect of Andrea Gan`s misuse of computer facilities, Wan asserted that he had informed Kho orally of this incident in December 1996. He had subsequently produced a written report on the incident in March 1997 at the latter`s request in light of a suit brought by Andrea Gan. As for Wan`s alleged misappropriation of the appellant`s stock, the trial judge noted that Wan had denied his involvement in such misconduct. She also found that Wan was a credible witness, notwithstanding the apparent inconsistency in his evidence as to whether he had ever received cheques pre-signed by Kho. Wan initially testified that he had never been given any pre-signed cheques. Instead, he had to fill in cheques in Kho`s presence, which the latter would then sign. He later conceded, however, that he had on some occasions filled in pre-signed cheques, but pointed out that he had done so on the spot in Kho`s presence. The trial judge held that there was no real discrepancy in Wan`s evidence on this issue as the cheques had been completed in Kho`s presence in both instances, regardless of whether Kho signed the cheques before or after Wan filled them in. Wan had never received pre-signed cheques which he subsequently filled in without Kho`s knowledge. She took the view that Wan appeared to honestly and genuinely believe, when he testified that he had filled in pre-signed cheques in front of Kho, that his evidence was not at odds with his earlier statement that he had never received pre-signed cheques. She thus held that Wan`s credibility as a witness was not shaken by this apparent discrepancy in his evidence.
In the case of Aw, the trial judge likewise rejected the appellant`s defence that his employment with the company had been terminated in November 1997 after he declined a transfer to AM5 and that he had subsequently worked for it on a `by-project` basis. She considered that the absence of a written notice of termination rendered Kho`s version of the material events unconvincing, and was not persuaded by his explanation that he had refrained from issuing Aw with a letter of termination in order to protect the latter`s future job prospects.
The trial judge also found the appellant`s defence on the whole to be either `inherently incredible` or inconsistent with its own version of the facts. For instance, Kho`s evidence that he was dissatisfied with Ong`s performance at work sat uneasily with the fact that the appellant had given her two salary increments within only approximately four months of service. Although Kho claimed that the company had increased Ong`s salary in order to `buy her loyalty`, the trial judge dismissed this explanation as a weak attempt to justify facts which were inconsistent with its defence. Similarly, she found Kho`s allegations that Wan had been performing poorly at his work and was suspected of impropriety unconvincing, since the appellant had given him a bonus of $2,000 as recently as August 1997. As for Kho`s contentions in respect of Aw, the trial judge rejected his assertion that Aw had agreed to work for the appellant on the `Orchidville` project on a `by-project` basis from December 1997. This was because Kho had earlier indicated in his examination-in-chief that Aw was not keen to assist in this project as he felt that `fetching people to take pictures of orchids ... is not in the line with his career [sic]`.
Thus, the trial judge held that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant in January 1998. Accordingly, she found the appellant guilty as charged.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The appeal against conviction
 
The appellant`s appeal against its conviction was based, in essence, on the premise that the trial judge erred in her finding of fact that Ong, Wan and Aw were its employees in January 1998. Although there were also numerous allegations directed at the trial judge`s assessment of the witnesses` credibility in the course of this appeal, I regarded these as part and parcel of the appellant`s challenge to her finding of fact.
 Whether Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant at the material time
It is trite law that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong ( 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 ). As I observed in 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
 : 
 
[i]t is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses. An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge`s decision, must not merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong ...
 
 
 
Where the trial judge`s findings of fact are based on his assessment of the witnesses` veracity and credibility, the appellate court will be even more reluctant to overturn his findings: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 .
Applying the above principles to this appeal, I was satisfied that the trial judge`s finding that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant at the material time within the meaning of the CPF Act was not plainly wrong, and should be upheld. I reached this conclusion based on a consideration of the appellant`s arguments on appeal in respect of each of these three witnesses.
 (i) The position in respect of Ong
The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in holding that Ong was still in its employment in January 1998 as she had committed wrongful acts which had led to her dismissal. Ong`s misconduct was said to include, in particular, the unauthorised release of her cheque for her November 1997 salary. The appellant pointed out that there were in fact six, and not five, pay cheques released in respect of that month`s wages, and that the total amount of these six cheques exceeded the balance in its Keppel Bank account at the relevant time. It was thus argued that Ong`s cheque could not have been an authorised cheque.
The appellant also submitted that the trial judge erred in finding Ong to be a credible witness. It reiterated its view that the reference in the company`s records to some of the cheques issued as `blank` cheques indicated that Ong did receive pre-signed cheques, and was therefore not telling the truth when she testified that she had never been given cheques pre-signed by Kho. The appellant further alleged that there was a discrepancy between the evidence of Ong and that of Wan on the issue of pre-signed cheques. Ong`s denial that she had received pre-signed cheques was said to be inconsistent with Wan`s admission that he had previously filled in such cheques, which discrepancy, it was contended, the trial judge overlooked in assessing Ong`s evidence.
I found no merit in the above arguments. Admittedly, contrary to the trial judge`s observations, six pay cheques were released in respect of the wages for November 1997, and the total amount of these cheques ($11,737.50) did exceed the balance in the appellant`s Keppel Bank account after Arthur Yao had deposited the $10,000 into the account ($10,895.47). This error on the trial judge`s part did not, however, detract from her finding that there was no proof that Ong`s pay cheque had been released without authorisation. As the trial judge rightly pointed out, it was not Ong`s cheque alone which had bounced. Four other cheques presented for payment on the same day as her cheque had also been returned ([para ] 24, supra). In light of the appellant`s statement of account from Keppel Bank for the month of December 1997, the trial judge was right to conclude that these cheques had been returned because they had been presented for payment before the $10,000 was deposited into the bank account. Indeed, Kho himself admitted in his examination-in-chief that this was the case. Thus, contrary to the appellant`s reasoning, the fact that Ong`s pay cheque for November 1997 had bounced did not show that she was guilty of wrongdoing in the form of releasing her own pay cheque without authorisation.
The totality of the evidence in the present case also negated the appellant`s allegations of impropriety on Ong`s part. The trial judge rightly observed that many of these allegations were incredible and inconsistent with the appellant`s own version of the material events. For instance, if Ong had truly been suspected of misconduct, it was odd for her to have been given two salary increments within her first four months of service with the appellant ([para ] 27, supra) and at a time when, according to Kho`s evidence, she had already been given notice to leave the company. It was also strange that Kho did not do anything when he discovered that Ong had released her November 1997 pay cheque. If this cheque had genuinely been an unauthorised cheque, one would have expected Kho to either order Keppel Bank to stop payment of the cheque or make a police report. Kho however failed to take any action until 17 March 1998, some three months after the cheque had been presented for payment, when he wrote to Keppel Bank asking it to stop payment of the cheque. During cross-examination, Kho failed to give a satisfactory reason for his delay in writing to the bank. His explanation that he did not lodge a police report as 
 
I took a live and let live process ... I am a kind person. I am a Buddhist and I believe in pardon, generosity ...
 
 
 
was also unconvincing, and did not advance the appellant`s case that Ong was guilty of wrongdoing whilst in its employment.
As for the appellant`s contention that Ong was not a credible witness, this argument was a non-starter. The trial judge was right in holding that a `blank` cheque is not the same as a pre-signed cheque ([para ] 24, supra). The reference to `blank` cheques in the appellant`s records of cheques issued was not a sound basis for doubting Ong`s assertion that she had never received pre-signed cheques. Furthermore, contrary to the appellant`s view, I did not find Wan`s evidence that he had previously filled in pre-signed cheques inconsistent with Ong`s evidence on this issue. Wan only admitted that he had been given pre-signed cheques to complete in Kho`s presence; he did not state that Ong had been given such cheques as well. Wan`s evidence on this point was therefore not at odds with Ong`s evidence.
Thus, given the lack of satisfactory proof of any wrongdoing on Ong`s part, coupled with her credibility as a witness, the trial judge did not err in finding that the former was not guilty of misconduct whilst she was in the appellant`s employment. Furthermore, since no termination letter was ever issued to Ong and since the appellant failed to adduce evidence to show that she was working for it on a `by-project` basis after October 1997, the irresistible inference was that she had never been dismissed by the company, and was still its employee in January 1998. The fact that the appellant conducted a lockout of its staff in December 1997 ([para ] 15, supra) did not go towards establishing that Ong was no longer employed by it by that time as the lockout could have been targeted at other staff who were suspected of wrongdoing. For these reasons, I agreed with the trial judge`s finding that Ong was an employee of the appellant at the material time.
 (ii) The position in respect of Wan
Where Wan was concerned, the appellant likewise contended that the trial judge erred in finding that he was its employee in January 1998. The appellant`s case was that Wan had been guilty of wrongdoing, including failing to keep proper records of the company`s stock, which had resulted in his dismissal. It was submitted that Wan`s account of the events leading up to his resignation from the company should not be believed as the latter was not a credible witness. In particular, as in Ong`s case, the appellant alleged that there were discrepancies in Wan`s evidence on the issue of pre-signed cheques. The appellant also reiterated its view that Wan had never been employed by it to start with as he had not signed a service agreement with it after its incorporation.
Taking each of the appellant`s contentions in turn, I was of the view that Wan`s failure to keep proper records of the company`s stock did not constitute satisfactory proof of the alleged wrongdoing on his part. Although Wan had omitted to record the appellant`s T-loan of equipment to Nanyang Polytechnic in the company`s stock books, his mistake did not appear to be as serious as Kho made it out to be, not least because the loan was documented in other records from which the equipment in question could be traced. It was therefore highly unlikely that this error on Wan`s part would have led to his dismissal by the appellant. Moreover, as the trial judge rightly observed, the fact that the appellant paid Wan a bonus of $2,000 in August 1997 ([para ] 27, supra) was at odds with the allegations of misconduct made against him. Equally, if there had truly been impropriety on Wan`s part, it was inconceivable that the appellant would have retained him to work for it on a `by-project` basis after October 1997 as Kho asserted. I thus found the appellant`s assertion that Wan had been guilty of wrongdoing, as a result of which he was dismissed by the company in October 1997, untenable.
I also rejected the appellant`s argument that Wan was not a credible witness. Although there was an apparent discrepancy in Wan`s evidence as to whether he had received pre-signed cheques, the trial judge had taken this factor into account in assessing his testimony and had concluded that this inconsistency did not affect his credibility as a witness ([para ] 25, supra). Furthermore, in light of the line of questions put to Wan on the issue of pre-signed cheques during cross-examination, it was likely that he thought of `pre-signed cheques` as cheques which Kho had signed and which he had later filled in without Kho`s supervision or knowledge. He might not have perceived of cheques which Kho had signed and which he had then completed under Kho`s directions as being `pre-signed cheques` as well. On this view, Wan`s initial assertion that he had never received pre-signed cheques was not, in substance, at odds with his subsequent assertion that he had filled in such cheques in Kho`s presence. There was therefore no basis for interfering with the trial judge`s decision that Wan was a witness of truth.
As for the lack of a written contract of employment between Wan and the appellant, this factor did not advance the appellant`s case that Wan was not its employee at the material time since an `employee` for the purposes of the CPF Act includes a person engaged under an oral contract (s 2 of the Act). Besides, if Wan had never been employed by the appellant, it was odd for the latter to have issued him with a letter on 17 July 1997 confirming his status as its employee. Admittedly, this letter was written to help Wan secure a housing loan. Nonetheless, its very existence militated against the appellant`s contention that it had never employed Wan after its incorporation.
Accordingly, since the evidence adduced by the prosecution pointed to Wan being an employee of the appellant, which evidence the trial judge rightly found to be more credible than Kho`s evidence, and since there was no satisfactory proof of the alleged wrongdoing on Wan`s part which had led to his dismissal, the trial judge`s finding that Wan was still employed by the appellant in January 1998 was right on the facts of this case.
 (iii) The position in respect of Aw
In respect of Aw, the appellant relied on his note dated 28 February 1998 acknowledging his receipt of the $500 for work done on the `Orchidville` project ([para ] 13, supra) as evidence that he was no longer in its employment in January 1998, since he was ostensibly being paid for his services as a sub-contractor, and not as an employee, at that time. The appellant also contended that the `Letter of Notification` which Aw tendered to Kho on 24 February 1998 ([lowbar] 13, supra) was not a letter of resignation, but was simply a letter stating that the former would continue to work for the company if he received his arrears in wages for December 1997 and January 1998.
I rejected both of these arguments. The note dated 28 February 1998 did not detract from the trial judge`s finding that Aw was employed by the appellant at the material time, as it related only to the payment which Aw had received in respect of the `Orchidville` project. The note merely stated that Aw had worked on that project as a sub-contractor, and did not in any way suggest that Aw was not carrying on all other aspects of his work in his capacity as the appellant`s employee. Besides, it appeared from Aw`s evidence that the note was drafted in the above manner as the appellant was being investigated by the CPF Board then and could not pay him as its employee ([para ] 13, supra). On this view, the note did not establish that Aw was not the appellant`s employee at the material time.
As for the appellant`s contention with regards to Aw`s `Letter of Notification`, this was in fact counter-productive to its stance that Aw was no longer employed by it in January 1998. I regarded the `Letter of Notification` as Aw`s letter of resignation. This was because Aw had given evidence to this effect. Moreover, he testified that he had drafted the letter in this manner to avoid the use of the term `resignation`, as he would have had to pay damages pursuant to his service agreement if he had resigned within the first 24 months of his employment. On this interpretation of the `Letter of Notification`, the fact that Aw tendered his resignation letter only on 24 February 1998 would be a clear indication that he was still an employee of the appellant in January 1998. Besides, even if, as the appellant asserted, the `Letter of Notification` was not a letter of resignation, it nonetheless pointed to the conclusion that Aw was still employed by the company at the material time given the express reference in it to his continuing to work for the latter.
 (iv) Counsel`s failure to put the appellant`s defence to the prosecution`s witnesses
Apart from the above considerations which supported the trial judge`s finding of fact that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant in January 1998, the repeated failure of the appellant`s lawyers to put significant portions of the appellant`s case to the prosecution`s witnesses at the trial was a further factor which lent weight to her judgment due to the operation of the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 
[1893] 6 R 67
.
In 
 Browne v Dunn 
 (supra), Lord Herschell LC stated (at pp 70-71) that: 
 
it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit. ... it will not do to impeach the credibility of a witness upon a matter on which he has not had any opportunity of giving an explanation by reason of there having been no suggestion whatever in the course of the case that his story is not accepted.
 
 
 
To this principle, the House of Lords added two qualifications. First, Lord Herschell indicated that there would be no need to raise such a matter in cross-examination where it is 
 
perfectly clear that [the witness] has had full notice beforehand that there is an intention to impeach the credibility of the story which he is telling.
 
 
 
Second, Lord Morris suggested that cross-examination would be unnecessary where 
 
a story told by a witness [is] of so incredible and romancing a character that the most effective cross-examination would be to ask him to leave the [witness] box.
 
 
 
The above principles, also referred to as the `rule in 
 Browne v Dunn 
`, have since been formulated into the maxim that 
 
[a]ny matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief` (
 Cross & Tapper on Evidence
 (8th Ed, 1995) at p 319; 
 Phipson on Evidence
 (14th Ed, 1990) at para 12-13).
 
 
 
It must however be remembered that 
 
[a]lthough the general proposition is that testimony not subjected to contradiction in cross-examination may be treated as unchallenged and thus accepted by the opposing party, the court is still entitled to reject such testimony ... A careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence must still be undertaken to determine the cogency and weight of such testimony. [ 
Liza bte Ismail v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 454
 .]
 
 
 
Furthermore, counsel`s failure to cross-examine the opposing party`s witness may, in appropriate cases, be remedied by recalling that witness for questioning ( 
Reid v Kerr
 
[1974] 9 SASR 367
), especially where such omission has been inadvertent ( 
R v Wilson
 
[1977] Crim LR 553
).
In the present case, much of the appellant`s defence was not put to the prosecution`s witnesses during cross-examination. For instance, Kho`s assertion that the pay cheques which Ong and Wan obtained for November 1997 were unauthorised cheques ([para ] 19, supra) was never put to either of these witnesses. Aw was not asked about Kho`s purported offer to transfer him to AM5 in October 1997; neither was the appellant`s interpretation of his `Letter of Notification` put to him. In their closing submissions at the trial, the appellant`s lawyers contended that whilst some aspects of the appellant`s case had not been expressly put to the prosecution`s witnesses, the questions which the latter had been asked during cross-examination had already laid the foundations for the defence`s line of argument. In that sense, the rule in 
 Browne v Dunn 
 had been complied with. Counsel further suggested that the omission to put the relevant matters to the prosecution`s witness could be rectified either by the prosecution recalling its witnesses for cross-examination or by the trial judge exercising her discretion to so order.
I was not persuaded by the above submissions. Contrary to counsel`s contentions in the court below, the rule in 
 Browne v Dunn 
 was breached at the trial. It could not be said that the evidence of the prosecution`s witnesses was `so incredible and romancing` (per Lord Morris) that cross-examination was unnecessary. It was also not the case that the prosecution`s witnesses already had prior notice of the defence`s intention to impeach their testimonies (per Lord Herschell). As Hunt J pointed out in 
 Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
 44 ALR 607 at 630, it must be made clear to the witness whose evidence is to be impugned not only that his evidence is to be challenged, but also how it is to be challenged. In the present case, Ong, Wan and Aw had no inkling of how their accounts of the material events were going to be disputed. For instance, the appellant`s means of showing that Ong`s November 1997 pay cheque had been released without authorisation by relying on the fact that the cheque had bounced was never put to Ong during cross-examination. In these circumstance, cross-examination of the prosecution`s witnesses could not be dispensed with.
Furthermore, the breach of the rule in 
 Brown v Dunn 
 in the court below could not have been remedied by recalling the prosecution`s witnesses for cross-examination. Although the trial judge had the discretion to do so under s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), this discretion is to be exercised sparingly ( 
Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 276
 ). In the present case, counsel`s omission to put the appellant`s defence to the prosecution`s witnesses at the trial did not appear to have been inadvertent. For instance, when counsel questioned Ong about the records which she had kept of cheques issued by the appellant, she could easily have asked her what the reference to `blank` cheques meant, in the process of which she could have put it to the latter that `blank` cheques referred to pre-signed cheques. In light of the line of questioning which counsel pursued, her failure to raise this point did not seem to be an unintentional omission. Besides, there were too many instances of counsel`s failure to put the appellant`s case to the prosecution`s witnesses for such omissions to be deemed inadvertent. Given this fact, coupled with the self-contradictory and inherently incredible nature of the appellant`s defence (see, inter alia, [para ] 35, 41 and 45, supra), it would not have been appropriate for the trial judge to exercise her discretion to recall the prosecution`s witnesses for cross-examination had such an application been made before her.
Thus, in light of the breach of the rule in 
 Browne v Dunn 
 at the trial, the trial judge rightly accepted the prosecution`s case that Ong, Wan and Aw were employed by the appellant in January 1998 in lieu of the appellant`s defence that they had left its employment by the end of 1997. This in turn provided an additional basis for upholding the appellant`s conviction.
Consequently, since the trial judge`s finding of fact that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant at the material time was not plainly wrong and was well-supported by the evidence adduced in the court below, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
Turning to the appellant`s appeal against the sentence imposed on it, it is well settled that an appellate court will not interfere with the sentence passed by a trial judge unless it is satisfied that the trial judge has made a wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentencing, has erred in appreciating the materials placed before him, has passed a sentence which is wrong in principle, or has imposed a sentence which is manifestly excessive ( 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
 
[1986] SLR 126
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 129
 ). In the present case, the trial judge did not err on the first three of these grounds. The sole question to be decided was whether the sentence which she imposed was manifestly excessive. Since the appellant had previously been convicted of the offence under s 58(b) of the CPF Act, under the second limb of s 61(1) of the Act, it could be sentenced to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for each of the charges brought against it. The trial judge ordered the appellant to pay a fine of $1,500 for each charge as she considered the multiplicity of offences, the appellant`s reasons for non-payment and its defaulting on payment of CPF contributions twice within a short period of less than a year (from April 1997, when the company was incorporated, to February 1998) to be aggravating factors. Given these aggravating factors, coupled with the fact that the fines imposed were well within the statutory maximum, I considered that these fines, although slightly on the high side, were not manifestly excessive. I thus upheld the sentence passed by the trial judge.
I also upheld the trial judge`s order that the appellant should pay the costs of prosecution in the court below pursuant to s 401(1) of the CPC. The court has a wide discretion to order costs under this section. In exercising its discretion, the court is entitled to take all the circumstances into account, including the strength of the prosecution`s case, the accused`s knowledge of this, and his conduct of his defence. In particular, where the accused loses his case and the court is of the view that his defence has been conducted `extravagantly and unnecessarily`, he may be ordered to pay some of the costs which he has caused the prosecution to incur ( 
Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 930
  at 937). One way of determining whether the accused`s defence has been conducted `extravagantly and unnecessarily` would be to consider whether the line of defence mounted has advanced his case: 
Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar Singh
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 349
 . On this analysis, the appellant`s defence at the trial was extravagant and unnecessary since, being spurious in many aspects, it did not serve to advance the appellant`s case that Ong, Wan and Aw were no longer its employees in January 1998. The trial judge`s order that the appellant should pay the costs of prosecution was thus justified.
I further ordered, pursuant to s 262(1) of the CPC, that Kho should pay the costs incurred by the Public Prosecutor in respect of this appeal. Section 262(1) has been framed in very wide terms and leaves the question of costs and the manner in which costs should be assessed entirely to the High Court ( 
Wee Soon Kim Anthony v PP
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 372
 ). In this context, the principles governing the court`s exercise of its discretion under s 401(1) of the CPC ([para ] 55, supra) are equally applicable. It must be emphasised, however, that whilst the strength of the Public Prosecutor`s case against an appellant on appeal would be a relevant factor in deciding on an award of costs under s 262(1) by analogy with 
 Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew 
 (supra), just as 
 
... an accused person should not be made to bear the costs of prosecution simply because he chooses to claim trial even though the prosecution`s case is strong. [
 Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar Singh
, supra at [para ] 39.]
 
 
 
so an appellant should not be ordered to pay the costs of an appeal simply because his case on appeal is a weak one. Instead, he should be ordered to pay such costs only if he conducts his appeal `extravagantly and unnecessarily` (
 Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew 
, supra). In the present case, the arguments which Kho relied on to challenge the trial judge`s decision were devoid of merit. They consisted largely of unfounded attacks on the trial judge`s integrity and baseless allegations that the appellant had been denied a fair trial. These arguments did not in any way advance the appellant`s case that the trial judge erred in finding that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the company at the material time. Accordingly, I held that Kho had conducted this appeal `extravagantly and unnecessarily`. In light of the arrogance and the disrespect for the trial judge which Kho displayed in the course of the appeal, I considered it appropriate to order him, as opposed to the appellant, to pay the Public Prosecutor`s costs in respect of this appeal, which I fixed at $5,000.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the above reasons, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against its conviction and sentence. I also upheld the trial judge`s order that the appellant should pay the costs of prosecution, and further ordered Kho to pay the costs incurred by the Public Prosecutor in this appeal.

The principal cause of action in this case is a claim for passing-off in respect of the get-up for the display and sale of 3g super glue in tubes. For good measure, claims for infringement of copyright and registered trademarks were tacked on. The principal relief sought was a perpetual injunction. For good measure an inquiry as to damages or an order for account of profits was added.
 The passing-off claim 
 
 
 
the plaintiffs, a Singapore company, is an offspring of a Japanese company called Alpha Techno Ltd (`Alpha Techno-Japan`). When this suit was brought, Alpha Techno-Japan had for some time been manufacturer of super glue in small tubes, not unlike toothpaste tubes one finds in airplanes and hotels. There was one difference, however. the screw cover of the glue tube was long and conical. Twelve of the tubes were mounted on a hangable rectangular display card with perforations to form 12 sections, each tube to be sold individually. This would enable each section with a tube to be torn off with ease. Each section was called a `tube-card`. The pack of tubes and the display card constituted the `SG-12 get-up`. The 12 tube-cards formed the bottom two-thirds of the display card. The top one-third was devoted to advertisement.
The SG-12 get-up was described as follows: 
 
The centre piece of the get-up was a small tube containing 3g glue. On the surface of the tube appeared the trademark `ALTECO` and a yellow square on a white background with the words `SUPER GLUE` in red lettering. The tube was attached to a rectangular card (`the tube-card`) with a pin and sealed in transparent plastic. The tube-card was black with the words SUPER GLUE in red in a yellow square in the centre of the card. The trademark ALTECO appeared at the top left hand of the tube card. On the reverse side of the tube card appeared various instructions on how to use the glue. The tubes were mounted on three vertical and four horizontal rows - that is 4 x 3 making 12. On the display card was printed the picture of a hand squeezing the tube of glue. In addition there were four coloured boxes. On each individual box there appeared pictures of a cup and saucer, a toy car, a handbag and belt. Further there appeared on the surface of the display card next to the blue background on a black background on the other top half the words SUPER GLUE in yellow lettering and the following phrases in small white lettering:
 
 
 
`For PLASTICS-METAL-WOOD-RUBBER-PAPER & LEATHER`
 
 
 
`Cyanoacrylate adhesive`
 
 
 
`NET.3g`
 
 
 
`ALTECHO CHEMICAL PTE LTD`
 
 
 
It was further asserted by the plaintiffs that the SG-12 get-up was produced and used in Singapore by Alpha Techno-Japan before 1990 and for six years prior to the action (1996) by the plaintiffs. According to them the get-up when it first made its advent was unique. For the six years before the action (1996), they had substantial local and export sales to Asean, Africa and Middle-East countries. They gave a tabulation of their sales during that period as follows:

In addition the plaintiffs said that they spent money on promoting the glue by advertising the SG-12 get-up. In the result they acquired a substantial and valuable goodwill in the business relating to the manufacture and sale of glue in the SG-12 get-up. They further claimed to be owners of Registered Trademarks Nos 5117/93 and 5118/93 in respect of the tube-card, and also the owners of the copyright in the SG-12 get-up pursuant to assignments from Alpha Techno-Japan.
The plaintiff went on to aver that the defendant, a lady by the name of Chong Yean Wah, passed off glue in tubes as that of the plaintiffs or as being connected or associated with the plaintiffs`. It was further asserted that their registered trademarks and copyright were infringed by the defendant. The thrust of their case in short was that she had copied and used their SG-12 get-up to palm off her glue in tubes as those of the plaintiffs. The defendant carried on her trade under the trade name `Yamayo Stationery Manufacturer`.
 The passing-off claim 
 
 
 
on that premise the plaintiff sought an injunction to restrain the defendant, her servants and agents from dealing with her glue in respect of the alleged passing-off, infringement of registered trademarks and infringement of copyright. The plaintiffs gave the following particulars in support of their allegation that the defendant was a wrong-doer. 
 
Particulars of Passing-Off
 
 
 
 
(i) The defendant has made and/or sold and still makes and sells glue in a get-up similar to the plaintiffs` SG-12. 
 
(ii) The similarity between the infringing get-up and the plaintiffs` SG-12 get-up amounts to a misrepresentation by the defendant in the course of trade to prospective customers of her (sic), such as retailers or shopkeepers, or ultimate purchasers of the glue that her glue is that of the plaintiffs` or is connected to or associated with the plaintiffs. 
 
(iii) The similarity is sufficient to deceive ultimate purchasers or cause them the mistaken belief that the defendant`s glue in the infringing get-up is that of the plaintiffs` or is connected to or associated with the plaintiffs. 
 
(iv) The deception or mistaken belief of the ultimate purchasers is particularly acute overseas where the rate of literacy is low and therefore the get-up of the glue plays an important part in deciding which glue to buy.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs then set out particulars of several display cards of the defendant bearing the trademark `Yamayo`. They attached a coloured photocopy of one such display card to the statement of claim. I shall write more about this later.
 The infringement of registered trademarks claim 
 
 
 
Secondly, the plaintiffs said that they were the registered proprietors in Singapore of two trademarks. The first was No 5117/93 in Class I in respect of adhesive substances used in industry. The other was No 5118/93 in Class 16 in respect of adhesive for stationery. The subject matter of both trademarks was the same. Both registrations were effective from 8 July 1993 for 10 years. The defendant, it was alleged, had infringed trademarks in respect of the get-up and caused confusion and deception of the public. I shall write more about this later.
 The infringement of copyright claim 
 
 
 
Thirdly, the plaintiffs asserted that they owned the artistic copyright in the work identified as SG-12 get-up for Singapore. The plaintiffs derived their copyright by virtue of an assignment on 22 August 1994 from the original owner, Alpha Techno-Japan. The plaintiffs further said that the defendants infringed their copyright by reproducing the get-up and by advertisements. I shall write more about this later.
 The defences 
 
 
 
The defendant made a series of denials. Indeed, denials were the principal plank of her defence. She said that the SG-12 get-up was not distinctive or peculiar to the plaintiffs and would not admit that Alpha Techno-Japan had used the SG-12 get-up in Singapore. She said also that not all those products bearing the trademark `Yamayo` were hers. Those with the trademark `HI-TECH` on the tube and `Made in Japan` at the back of the tube-card were imitations of her own get-up. Her only positive case was that a design similar to the SG-12 get-up was first created and published not by Alpha Techno-Japan but by a company by the name of Gordon Brothers Co Ltd of Taiwan in 1987, two years before the alleged creation by Alpha Techno-Japan. The defendant had in Singapore a design similar to the plaintiffs` SG-12 get-up. Further, the get-up was common to the trade and she gave a list of other eight products she intended to rely on. Several positive points the defendant proposed to advance in her submissions were not pleaded. Elementary rules of justice and convenience require a defender to specifically plead and place on record before trial all matters which make the plaintiffs` claim not maintainable. The defendant must not cast about for points as the plaintiffs` case develops and then spring surprise points in closing submission. Regrettably, the defendant did not adhere to this rule of essential justice.
 The plaintiffs` evidence 
 
 
 
The evidence of the plaintiffs was that the SG-12 get-up was first used by the plaintiffs` parent company in Japan, that is by Alpha Techno-Japan. The plaintiffs` first witness, Mr Koichiro Nogami, asserted in his evidence that the SG-12 get-up was conceived by him sometime in late 1985 or early 1986. Alpha Techno-Japan had since 1983 been selling the 3g glue tubes in a single card (`the SG-2 get-up`). Imitators from Taiwan made it tough for them. So, to save costs, he came up with the novel idea of selling the same tube of glue by a composite card exhibiting a pack of 12 tubes in a spread out display. However, because the SG-2 get-up had already acquired a reputation he decided to retain the same tube-card design but in a much larger pack of 12 tubes. This would also save costs as less card or paper was needed. His input was conveyed to the marketing people who worked closely with a design agency (`Fujita Sangyo`) to come up with the SG-12 design. The predominant purpose of the SG-12 get-up was, therefore, to distinguish Alpha Techno-Japan`s product by a striking display. In my view they did an admirable job of it. Nogami`s evidence was as clear as it was compelling on that score as well as on other points. The veracity of his evidence could be seen from the fact that the SG-12 get-up retained many of the features of the established SG-2 get-up such as the hand holding a black and white glue tube, the flash with the words `Super Strong`, the words `SUPER GLUE` in bold red letters with a yellow line against a black background and the other words in white lettering. Artistically, yellow and red leap to the eye from the strong black background. As a piece of commercial artwork and catchy advertisement it was unimpeachable.
Nogami also said that the SG-2 get-up was created in 1983 and the SG-12 get-up in 1986. The year 1989 for the SG-12 get-up in the copyright assignment document was an error and it was corrected to 1986. The fact that it was a mistake was corroborated by documents showing the existence of the SG-12 from 1986 onwards. His evidence was unimpeached. I accepted his evidence as a reflection of the truth that Alpha Techno-Japan was the originator of the SG-2 get-up in 1983 and the SG-12 get-up in 1986.
The second witness of the plaintiffs, Mr Tan Kia Siong [commat] Jackson Tan, said in his evidence that the plaintiffs, Alteco Chemical Pte Ltd of Singapore, started manufacturing glue in Singapore in the SG-12 get-up in January 1990 and the first sales in Singapore were in July 1990. from then the plaintiffs had made use of the SG-12 get-up in local and export sales. The sales figures as set out in [para ] 4 established that the plaintiffs had substantial goodwill and reputation in the SG-12 get-up from 1990.
In so far as Singapore was concerned, the plaintiffs sold their product in the SG-12 get-up to their exclusive distributor Mopi Pte Ltd (`Mopi`) up till 1991 and later to other trade purchasers such as Rexim, Tong Kah, Kim Tat Seng, T H Industrial Supply and Tongyu. Between 1990 and 1995, sales improved tremendously.
The plaintiffs also advertised the SG-12 get-up in Singapore and overseas. According to Jackson Tan, these were not the only advertisements. The distributor Mopi had also advertised. In addition the SG-12 get-up display cards were displayed in shops themselves. This was the best advertisement.
 The defendant`s evidence 
 
 
 
The defendant said in her affidavit that she started the use of her get-up (`Yamayo get-up`) in 1993 and then at the trial changed it to 1992. She also said that her limited company Yamayo Chemical Pte Ltd (`Yamayo Ltd`) had been using the get-up in 1991. Whichever date is taken, it was a date after the plaintiffs had established their goodwill and reputation in Singapore from early 1990.
The defendant did not deny that her first get-up might have been copied from the plaintiffs` SG-12 get-up. Although she went over it with a fine-tooth comb and came up with some differences in the minor details of her get-up and the SG-12 get-up. But she never seriously challenged that her `design` was similar to the SG-12 get-up. Indeed, in attempting to challenge Alpha Techno-Japan`s and the plaintiffs` ownership of the SG-12 get-up, she asserted in her defence, perhaps unwittingly, that her design was similar to the SG-12 design. Thus she has been caught in her own trap, hoist by her own petard on the issue of similarity. She said Yamayo Ltd first used the get-up in 1991. Yamayo Ltd is a company of which the defendant was a director in charge of its management and a one-third shareholder. Her husband, KF Wang (a Taiwanese), was the general manager. She claimed that she had no local sales although she manufactured her product in her get-up in Singapore. Hers was essentially an export trade.
The defendant said that her former employee, Patrick Tan, designed her Yamayo get-up. She sprung this for the first time at the trial notwithstanding that two affidavits were filed by her knowing very well that the history of the origin and use of her get-up were material to the case. Patrick Tan was not called. The defendant further said Patrick Tan derived the Yamayo get-up from another card obtained from Taiwan sometime in 1991. This also came up only at the trial. The defendant further said that Yamayo Ltd took the idea for the Yamayo get-up from advertisements of similar products in Taiwan. She exhibited an advertisement of a KUDOS get-up by Wan Hsiung.
It would be convenient to dispose of the infringement claims and then move on to the passing-off claim, and I shall consider the copyright claim first.
 Copyright 
 
 
 
The SG-12 get-up without the glue tubes to my mind is unquestionably an artistic work conferring copyright. It was the work of a hand of art and not the product of pedestrian labour. in this case Alpha Techno-Japan engaged a design agency in Japan, Fujita Sangyo, to create a get-up, and a printer to printset it for mass production. It would be preposterous to even suggest that what a design agency created after being commissioned to create and what others so eagerly copied was not a piece of artistic work. The copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Ed) defines `artistic work` as a drawing whether the work is of artistic quality or not. Alternatively, any work of artistic craftmanship is `artistic work` within the meaning of that expression as used in the Copyright Act.
 Copyright ownership issue
In her closing submission the defendant raised an issue as to whether Alpha Techno-Japan were in the first place the owners of the copyright in the SG-12 get-up. She had not raised the ownership issue expressly in the pleadings. The Copyright Act by s 130 provides in effect that if a defendant does not put in issue the question of the plaintiffs` ownership of the copyright, there shall be a presumption that the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright in question. This provision being procedural applies to all actions commenced in Singapore irrespective of where the copyright was created.
In addition, O 18 r 8 of the rules of court provides that 
 
a party must in any pleading subsequent to a claim plead specifically any matter
 
 
 
 
(a) which he alleges makes the claim not maintainable, or 
 
(b) which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise.
  
 
 
The combined effect of those two provisions makes it plain and patent that if the defendant intended to raise an issue as to the plaintiffs` ownership, she ought to have done it specifically. It means that she should have explicitly put the plaintiffs` and Alpha Techno-Japan`s ownership in issue. Her failure to do so entitled the plaintiff to throw the book at her. Nonetheless, I shall deal with the ownership issue because the plaintiffs led some evidence on the question of ownership of the copyright. It was not in dispute that a Japanese copyright is valid in Singapore.
The defendant relied on s 30(2) of the Copyright Act. It provides that `the author of an artistic work shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting in the work`. She put forward the theory that Fujita Sangyo was the author. Alpha Techno-Japan, in other words, was not the author and, therefore, not the owner of the copyright in the SG-12 get-up, with the result that the plaintiffs could not found a claim on it. I could not agree with that contention for the reasons that follow.
For openers, s 30 of the Copyright Act does not apply to copyrights created outside Singapore because the provision cannot have extraterritorial operation. But since the defendant did not squarely put ownership in issue but merely denied the plaintiffs` assertions, the plaintiffs did not plead and produce evidence of Japanese law on the point. So I have to decide the issue on the basis of Singapore law. The section does not define the word `author` which became part of the glossary of copyright law at the primitive stage of copyright law when copyright was recognised only in writing. At that time it meant a writer of books albeit it was later extended to a maker or originator of artistic work who was an individual. It was intended to protect the interest of the writer if he legitimately laid claim to copyright. But times have changed. So has the temper of the law. This is an age where artwork is often a result of teamwork and computer graphics. Often, and particularly in cases where an agency is commissioned to do a get-up or advertisement, the author has absolutely no interest in the get-up or advertisement. Given that scenario, it is often difficult, if not impossible, for an individual `author` to make a claim to copyright or identify him. This is conspicuously so when a corporate or unincorporated body undertakes to materialise an idea into an artistic work or computer graphics. the individual(s) art worker(s) are not identified or identifiable.
In this case, it was Nogami who conceived of the SG-12 get-up in its abstract form. He then conveyed it to the marketing personnel of Alpha Techno-Japan. They worked closely with the design agency, Fujita Sangyo. The word `agency` means that Fujita Sangyo was not a single person. When the agency handed over the finished product they had no profit to reap from its use. Their only interest was their fee. The work then had to be print-set for a prototype and then mass printed. That was how the SG-12 get-up was conceived, materialised and put into the production line. The finished product with the tubes would be completed in the manufacturer`s factory. In those circumstances it would be impossible to identify a single person who could lay a claim to the copyright of the final work. In the result, common sense and the principles of common law as well as equity (constructive trust) combine to hold that the only `author` who could lay a rightful claim to copyright in the final product was Alpha Techno-Japan. They were the ones who made the arrangements and paid for the creation of the get-up. That would be the modern meaning to the word `author`. In the law of passing-off the term `trader` is widely interpreted to include a person engaged in a professional, artistic or literary occupation. Likewise, having regard to the purpose of copyright law, the term `author` should be widely interpreted to include the only person whose interest it was intended to protect. In the result Alpha Techno-Japan was the originator and commissioner and therefore the author of the SG-12 get-up. In those circumstances it would be preposterous for Fujita Sangyo to claim copyright in the get-up. This court would not grant Fujita Sangyo an injunction to restrain Alpha Techno-Japan from using the get-up to market the product without the leave and licence of Fujita Sanygo. The intention of the parties is the only determinant of ownership. Common law would imply such an intention as an implied term. Equity would imply a constructive trust against Fujita Sangyo.
In this regard 
Harold Drabble v Hycolite Manufacturing Co
 
[1928] 44 TLR 264
 is eminently instructive. Harold Drabble Ltd, advertising agents, and Mr Harold Drabble, their managing director, brought the action against Mr George Edward Heyl (t/a the Hycolite Manufacturing Co) and the Morning Post Ltd, for an injunction to restrain the defendants from infringing the plaintiffs` copyright in an advertisement prepared by the plaintiffs to advertise the goods of the Hycolite Manufacturing Co by inserting such advertisement in the 
 Morning Post 
 without the plaintiffs` consent.
The action raised the question whether the copyright in the advertisement belonged to the agent who prepared it, or to the person who commissioned it. It was decided by Astbury J that there was no original literary work. even if there was such a work the plaintiffs had by contract rendered it impossible for the court to grant any injunction to restrain the defendants from publishing the advertisement. The report accurately and aptly extracts from the decision the following legal proposition: 
 
Where an advertisement agent prepares an advertisement on instructions and information given to him by the advertiser, the Court will, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, draw the inference that it was the intention of both parties that the copyright in the advertisement should belong to the advertiser.
 
 
 
The only inference I could make on the facts of this case is that it was intended by both parties that Alpha Techno-Japan was the author and owner of the copyright in the design. The purpose of the artwork was such that the agency could derive no profit or royalty from it. Fujita Sangyo was legally bound to hand it over to Alpha Techno-Japan and transfer the title to the latter. Alpha Techno-Japan, accordingly, was entitled to the ownership, use and benefit of it.
 The copyright infringement issue
The defendant then argued that no infringement in Singapore was proved and sprang the surprise submission that her get-up was substantially different from the SG-12 get-up. This contention was diametrically opposite to what she had asserted in her defence: `The defendant is the proprietor in Singapore of a design similar to SG-12 design`. The proper conclusion to be derived from that statement in the defence was that her design infringed in Singapore the copyright of Alpha Techno-Japan and the plaintiffs because of the simple fact that it was similar to the plaintiffs` get-up. In addition, and in any event, it is my finding that taken in totality the defendant`s design was substantially similar to SG-12 design and that hers was got up in Singapore well after the plaintiffs` made its advent in Singapore. I shall amplify on this.
The appropriate test for infringement of copyright that can be extracted from decided cases is as follows: 
 
Infringement is imitation of an original work. In respect of infringement it is the quality rather than the quantity of material that is important. Imitation, therefore, need not be exact in the mathematical sense. There is infringement if either the whole of the subject of the copyright is reproduced or if a substantial part of such subject is reproduced, a question of fact. In determining whether there is reproduction, the Court is entitled inter alia to take into account whether the alleged infringement comes so near the original as to suggest the latter to the mind of the people seeing it. In the latter event, if it is also shown or can properly be inferred that the defendant has directly or indirectly appropriated the result of the plaintiffs` labour in producing the work in which he is entitled to copyright, infringement is clearly established. Appropriation is a question of fact. Finally, in determining the issue of infringement each work is taken in totality and the effect it would have in the perception of the ordinary consumer at a given time and place. See 
Antocks Lairn Ltd v I Bloohn Ltd
 
[1972] RPC 219 at 222
 and 
Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd
 
[1964] 1 WLR 273
 at p 276.
 
 
 
Applying the above test, if one, particularly an illiterate person or one who could not read English, saw the plaintiffs` get-up and saw the defendant`s get-up a few day later, he would be bound to mistake the defendant`s product for the plaintiffs. The defendant`s Yamayo get-up was a substantial duplication in terms of size, shape, colour and content. Taken in totality there was virtual reproduction and that was infringement. The infringement took place in Singapore as it was put together in Singapore and the uttering emanated in Singapore.
 Infringement of trademark 
 
 
 
Now I deal with the claim based on infringement of trade mark. The trade mark, rather the trade marks, comprised a black rectangle with a yellow square within it. It was the tube-card without the tube. The square was bordered with a red line. The word `ALTECO` appeared at two places. Alpha Techno-Japan obtained the registration of the trademarks, and then on 22 August 1994 assigned them to the plaintiffs. The registration related back to 8 July 1993. The plaintiffs` rights with respect to the trademarks therefore began only on 22 august 1994.
The defendant never opposed the registration. Having slept for almost five years, she suddenly woke from her deep slumber and sought to challenge the registration of the trade marks on the grounds that: 
(a) A design similar to the SG-12 get-up was first created and first published by Gordon Brothers Industrial Co Ltd of Taiwan in 1987, which was two years before Alpha Techno-Japan. 
(b) The SG-12 design was similar to her own design.
This basis of the challenge failed to weigh with me altogether. On this, there was clear evidence for me to make the following findings: The registrations were in respect of colour limitation. The colour combination leapt to the eye and was most distinctive. There could be no doubt that the Registrar of Trade marks formed the same view when deciding to register the mark. When the trademarks first appeared in Singapore there was no one else in Singapore with a similar mark. It follows, therefore, that in Singapore the plaintiffs` side had a lead and theirs were the only marks for their kind. In the circumstances no question of commonality can arise.
As to the question of infringement the essential features of the trademark were blatantly copied by the defendant and therefore constituted clear infringement by her. To use the appropriate term of art the trademark used by the defendant so closely resembled that of the plaintiffs as to be calculated to deceive potential customers. Further, the defendant`s assertion that her product was not marketed in Singapore, assuming it to be true, carried no weight. if, however, human senses determine that there is an infringement of the mark in the country where the legitimate trademark is registered, the fact that the infringing article has not left Singapore does not afford a defence to the defendant. More so if the plaintiff is also an exporter. This is because the cause of action is completed by the act of infringement. The purpose of the trade mark Act is directly to protect the trade mark and its owner, and indirectly domestic as well as export trade. It is of fundamental importance that the legitimate export trade of this trading nation is given adequate and proper protection. See

 Passing-off - some general observations 
 
 
 
The adjudication of the passing-off claim will follow in the footsteps of Lord Mansfield: extract the essential principles of law and then apply them to the facts. it would be salutary to start with some general observation on the law of passing-off. The law of passing-off was conceived in the 18th century in the day of Lord Mansfield when trade was the mother of money. The law was settled in the early 19th century in the day of Lord Eldon, who readily granted injunctive relief in trade mark cases to suppress competing deceivers filching authentic traders` marks and customers. The court of equity was also prepared to prevent deceivers who stole other traders` customers by representing their goods or businesses as those of the honest traders. Protection of legitimate traders by that time became one of the primary functions of the court of equity. Equity developed the injunctive remedy and the ancillary remedy of the accounts for profits in order to protect the trader who expended money and labour to develop his trade as well as the public who developed a faith in the goods of such a trader. Since then equity has played an important role in the metamorphosis of the law of passing-off and the granting of injunctions in intellectual property cases.
 Defining `passing-off` 
 
 
 
The concept of passing-off was stated succinctly a century and a half ago by Lord Langdale MR in 
Perry v Truefitt
 
[1842] 49 ER 749
 at p 752: 
 
A man is not to sell his own goods under the pretence that they are the goods of another man.
 
 
 
A decade and a half later Lord Cranworth restated it lucidly thus in 
Farina v Silverlock
 
[1856] 43 ER 1214
 at p 1216: 
 
Anyone who has adopted a particular mode of designating his particular manufacture, has a right to say, not that other persons shall not sell exactly the same article, better or worse, or an article looking exactly like it, but they shall not sell it in such a way as to steal his trade-mark, and make purchasers believe that it is the manufacture to which that trade-mark was originally applied.
 
 
 
In recent times Lord Oliver, Lord Jauncey, Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser have all expounded their erudition of the conception in different diction. Nourse LJ notably said in 
 Consorzio Del Prosciutto Di Parma v Marks & Spencer plc 
 (`
 Parma Ham 
`) [1991] RPC 351 (CA) at p 368 that although the speeches of Lord Diplock and Lord Frazer in 
Warnink v Townend & Sons
 
[1979] AC 731
 were of the highest authority, in his experience, they did not give the same degree of assistance in analysis and decision as the classical trinity of essentials which constituted the conception. Nourse LJ stated the classical trinity in simple syllables: 
(1) a reputation (or goodwill) acquired by the plaintiff in his goods, name, mark etc. 
(2) a misrepresentation by the defendant leading to confusion (or deception), causing 
(3) damage to the plaintiff.
I propose to guide myself by the classical trinity of Nourse LJ.
The central feature of a cause of action founded on copyright and registered trademark is infringement. That is not so in a passing-off action. In a passing-off action the central theme is deception or misrepresentation. The other two, though essential, are of ancillary importance. The cause of the action may arise from an imitation of the name, mark, get-up or direct misrepresentation by words. In addition, to the concise classical trinity, there is a galaxy of peripheral case-law which has added flesh and blood to that conception.
 Peripheral principle No (1): the meaning of `goodwill` 
 
 
 
In one sector of the galaxy the pronouncement in the last century that `the claimant must actually have commenced business before he can claim good` that, however, is no longer an inflexible rule today. It is notably so when the authentic producer seeks the equitable remedy of an injunction and account of profits. If trading is insisted on, it would make an ass of the law, for a rogue trader could foil and frustrate at will the efforts of a manufacturer who expends huge amounts of money in erecting the get-up of a product and an institutional advertisement before the actual start of business. The rival may imitate that get-up with impunity and launch his sales before the legitimate trader and thereby defeat a passing-off action on the ground that the originator has not acquired goodwill by actual trading. In present times, in cases whenever a demand has been created by advertising, and better still if there are actual sales, the law will recognise it as sufficient reputation spawning potential goodwill and grant an injunction, and add to it the ancillary remedy of account of profits: see 
Turner v General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd
 
[1929] 42 CLR 352
, 
WH Allen & Co v Brown Watson Ltd
 
[1965] RPC 191
 and 
CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 550
 . Further, the question of whether there is acquisition of reputation and goodwill will be determined by common sense current at the time of decision. Subject to that gloss, trading, however short it may be, is sufficient to establish goodwill. See 
 Sheraton Corp of America v Sheraton Motels Ltd 
 [1964] RPC 202 and 
Stannard v Reay
 
[1967] rpc 589
. In the result, where there has been no trading, the appropriate remedy is an injunction and, if the circumstances warrant, an order for account of profits. Where there has been actual trading and therefore actual goodwill, the appropriate remedies are an injunction to restrain future passing-off and an inquiry as to damages.
 Peripheral principle No (2): damage 
 
 
 
On the question of damage the correct law is as follows: 
 
Proof of damage is not in every case essential to enable the plaintiff to maintain his action, for if he shows that the defendant is acting so as to pass off goods as those of the plaintiff which are not the plaintiff`s it will generally be assumed that the plaintiff is thereby prevented from selling as many of the goods as he otherwise would; while even if there is no direct loss of sales (as where plaintiff and defendant are not in direct competition) the confusion between the two suppliers puts the plaintiff`s goodwill at risk. There is indeed some authority for the proposition, that any unauthorised appropriation of or profit from another`s business goodwill or professional reputation or business goodwill, inasmuch as it deprives the plaintiff of the opportunity to exploit his goodwill himself if nothing else. But this doctrine is by no means firmly established, and where the plaintiff is not a trading business especially, he may well be required to establish a likelihood of actual financial loss from the defendant`s actions. Thus it has been held that the assumption of a name, or an address, similar to the name or address of the plaintiff, without malicious intent, although it may cause annoyance and inconvenience to him - for instance, by delaying his letters - is not actionable unless it is shown to be calculated to injure him in his business. No action lies at the suit of any private person for deception practised upon the public, unless it incidentally causes, or is calculated to cause, damage to him as an individual; if this is not the case, the wrongdoer can only be punished through the criminal law, or in a civil action on information brought in the name of the Attorney-General. In a passing-off action the court is not concerned with the truth or falsity of statements in the defendant`s advertisements except so far as they tend to induce the belief that the defendant`s goods or business are the plaintiff`s.
 
 
 
Additionally 
 
erosion of distinctiveness is a form of damage to goodwill which may be sufficient to maintain an action, provided the damage is actually caused by the misrepresentation.
 
 
 
See 
 Kerley`s Law of Trade mark and Trade Names 
 (12th ed, 1986) and 
First Supplement
 
[1994] at para 16
-04.
In equity, that is when injunctive remedy is sought, it is unnecessary to prove actual damage. It is sufficient if the likelihood of damage is established. The court can infer the likelihood of damage in appropriate circumstances. Where the defendant`s goods compete with the plaintiffs` in the same market both domestic and export, the likelihood of damage will be readily inferred.
 Peripheral principle No 3: exporting the instruments of deception 
 
 
 
Now I move on to an important facet of the law of passing-off. It concerns sales for export to, or passing-off in, foreign markets. In such cases, the tort can be viewed from three distinct aspects: (i) exporting the finished product; (ii) exporting the instruments of deception; and (iii) committing the palming off in a foreign territory with no linking-act in the country of origin.
In the first case, the passing-off occurs when a local competitor exports the spurious goods to a foreign market where the palming off will be done by the importer in that country. In such a case the commission of the tort is complete within the territory since the finished product is ready for export. Such form of passing-off may be refrained by injuncting the supply and export of the goods from the territory. the law of the place where the palming off will be perpetrated is utterly irrelevant.
 Passing-off by exporting instruments of deception 
 occurs when the instruments of deception are sold to a middleman calculated to assist a deception in a foreign market. Here, the finished product makes appearance not within the territory but in the foreign country. Once again, the foreign law is irrelevant because the supply of the instruments of deception is a tort on its own. what will happen in the foreign country is ignored in determining whether the tort has been committed.
 Foreign passing-off 
 occurs when production and palming off occur in a foreign country and nothing happens in the land of the forum. In such a case, as all the factors are foreign, foreign law becomes very material. It must be shown by the claimant that it is actionable by the law of the country where the palming-off takes place. The proposition of private international law that foreign law is prima facie presumed to be same as the law of the forum does not apply.
Normally, items (i) and (ii) are combined and treated as one category. This places an unnecessarily difficult hurdle for the plaintiff to overcome. My taxonomy alleviates the difficulty and is conducive to clear thought. Be that as it may, the spring source of the principle governing items (i) and (ii) was the following statement by Lord Watson in 
R Johnston & Co v Archibald Orr Ewing & Co
 
[1882] 7 App Cas 219
 at p 231: 
 
no man, however honest his personal intentions, has a right to adopt and use so much of his rival`s established trade-mark as will enable any dishonest trader, into whose hands his own goods may come, to sell them as the goods of his rival.
 
 
 
On all three items there is a useful analysis and statement of the law both by counsel and Forster J in 
John Walker & Sons Ltd v Henry Ost & Co Ltd & Anor
 
[1978] RPC 489
.
 Peripheral principle No 4: protecting get-up 
 
 
 
In the beginning the protection was in respect of name and mark because it was in respect of those two factors that the legitimate trader had developed his reputation and goodwill. With the passing of time, the manufacturer-trader invented the concept of get-up to advertise and flourish his goods with the view to expanding his market both territorial and extra-territorial. The principal objective of erecting a given get-up at one level is to identify, distinguish and create a favourable `image` of the product and its manufacturer. At another level its purpose is to advertise - that is to say to attract, inform and persuade people and thus create and expand goodwill. That being its purpose, the creation of a get-up inevitably must combine art, consumer psychology and advertisement techniques. In the circumstances, where a manufacturer places importance to the get-up of this product, the name and mark are not its predominant features. The get-up itself becomes the predominant feature of the product. It must, nonetheless, be kept in mind that what the consumer pays the price for is not the get-up but the product; the function of the get-up is to develop the reputation of the product not the get-up itself.
Thus in the landmark get-up case, 
William Edge & Sons Ltd v William Niccolls & Sons Ltd
 
[1911] AC 693
 (HL), the get-up of the product in the shape of the product itself (laundry blue with a stick in it) was held to have identified the plaintiffs` goods. In another landmark case the get-up of lemon juice in the form of life-sized, lemon-shaped plastic containers was held to have given a trading reputation to the product.
Tavener Rutledge v Specters Ltd
 
[1959] RPC 83 and 355
 (CA) is a good parallel to the present case. sweets were sold in the get-up of decorated tins. An action was brought against the defendant who also sold sweets in a colourable imitation of the get-up. The action was launched on the basis of passing-off, infringement of trademark and infringement of copyright. The claim succeeded on all three counts
 Peripheral principle No 5: the test for misrepresentation 
 
 
 
Much of what has been said on the test for infringement of copyright applies to passing-off. In addition I would repeat here what I said in 
Ken Ken Food Manufacturing Pte Ltd v Wong Hiong Wah
 
[1996] AIPR 113
: 
 
In deciding whether there was an illegitimate imitation of a product one must look at the get-up as a whole. Where there were a number of features, their cumulative and predominant effect and not individual features should be considered. It was useless to compare the points of similarity one by one. What must be looked at as the most important consideration was what caught the eye generally. Colours in a get-up may constitute an important part of it.
 
 
 
In the appropriate case, the following test laid down in 
MI & M Corp & Anor v A Mohamed Ibrahim
 
 
[1964] MLJ 392
  FC may afford an alternative approach: 
 
The test to be applied is whether a person who sees the one trade mark in the absence of the other trade mark and in view only of his general recollection of what the nature of the other trade mark was, would be liable to be deceived and to think that the trade mark is the same as the other of which he has a general recollection. This recollection test is to be applied having regard to the sort of people who would buy the goods and the circumstances in which they buy.
 
 
 
There are bound to be differences between the genuine and spurious get-up. But a passing-off case is not to be decided by looking for subtle difference which one does not ordinarily see or recall.
 The decision 
 
 
 
The defendant proposed to resist the claim for passing-off on the grounds that: the plaintiffs did not have sufficient goodwill in the SG-12 get-up, there was no misrepresentation by her, there was no proof of damage and there was delay. I reject all the arguments. I shall take them in stages. What follows should be understood in the context of the law I have outlined.
The defendant was unable to convincingly deny the fact that the plaintiffs` get-up was copied by her. I find without any reserve that the defendant did substantially imitate the plaintiffs` SG-12 get-up. For this purpose it did not matter whether the copy was direct or from another copy. Filching from a filcher is filching a fortiori.
The defendant said some of the imitations relied on by the plaintiffs were not hers. I will assume that those `Yamayo` get-ups with `HI-TECH` and `made in Japan` indorsement were not hers. To my mind what matters is that the get-up that was admittedly hers was admittedly similar to the plaintiffs`.
As to commonality of the get-up at the material time, in so far as Singapore was concerned, no one other than the plaintiff was using the SG-12 get-up. The defendant said there were many others doing so in Taiwan, but in so far as Singapore was concerned there were no other filchers. The defendant did not produce any evidence of use by any other party of the SG-12 get-up in Singapore. As a matter of fact the get-up was therefore not common to the glue in tube trade in Singapore.
In asserting that there were many get-ups similar to the SG-12 get-up and therefore the SG-12 get-up was common to the trade, she was begging the question. The issue was whether the SG-12 get-up was distinct and whether it was the fore-runner in Singapore. Taiwan was another story because according to the plaintiffs, the Taiwanese themselves were imitators of the SG-2 and SG-12 get-ups. The defendant asserted the plaintiffs` get-up was common to the trade in Singapore without proving that the others were not imitators of Alpha Techno-Japan`s SG-12 get-up. Her purported proof was postulated to depend on the conclusion that they were all around at the same time. The plaintiffs` proof was otherwise, namely that their get-up was the fore-runner in the market.
The defendant produced a brochure of Gordon Brothers, more particularly a product numbered S-88 and by the testimony of Lu Shao Hung from Taiwan tried to show that the SG-12 get-up was not distinctive of the plaintiffs. S-88 was a get-up, however, similar not to SG-12 but to the SG-2 get-up. One compares apples with apples and not oranges. The SG-2 get-up was in the market from 1983 and according to Nogami, the Taiwanese were imitating his art and it was to fight them that he came up with the SG-12 get-up. And it was to fight a follower of Taiwanese imitators of the SG-12 get-up that this action was brought.
The defendant also said in court that she discontinued the use of the Yamayo get-up in 1993 but surprisingly she still continued to advertise the deceptive get-up right up to February 1996. Her explanation was that she was too lazy and it cost too much money to change the slides for the advertisements. I found it hard to believe that for three years after she had allegedly stopped using the deceptive get-up, she still continued to advertise it. She said she would produce the invoice of the artwork agency for the change of design but in the end produced the invoice of the printer which did not show any change of design in 1993. It followed therefore that the defendant continued to manufacture and sell glue in the deceptive get-up.
The defendant also said that though the Yamayo`s get-up, both the old and new, were made in Singapore she did not however sell them in Singapore and therefore there was no passing-off. But to sue a defendant for the tort of passing-off it is sufficient if the manufacturing and exportation took place in Singapore. In any event she did not produce all the evidence in relation to sales. There was evidence of some sales in the Singapore market. That was enough for the plaintiff to succeed. The rest goes to quantum.
Given the similarity in the get-ups, there can be no argument as to the likelihood of damage. In fact, the plaintiffs` have proved that they have suffered damage in so far as Singapore was concerned as well as overseas sales. Whilst the loss may not be entirely attributable to the defendant, the use and continued use by the defendant of her get-up whether old or new was unquestionably likely to cause damage to the plaintiffs.
The defendants` last ditch defence was that the plaintiffs were guilty of delay. This point was not pleaded. It was not pursued in her affidavit evidence-in-chief. The plaintiffs` witnesses were not cross-examined on it. In short it was not investigated at the trial by me. It was a sort of Parthian shot as it was only raised in the closing submission. I should, therefore, reject it out of hand. The plaintiffs, however, answered it in their submission by drawing my attention to the relevant facts. Time ran only after the discovery of her wrongful acts. As she herself said her principal her principal market was overseas. The plaintiffs discovered her sales in Singapore and overseas only in 1995. In September 1995 their instructed solicitors to write to her. Notwithstanding the letter she decided to resist the plaintiffs` claims. In the circumstances they had to assemble the evidence and seek the necessary advice. In these circumstances the commencement of the action in March 1996 was entirely justified.
Finally, the defendant argued that deception had not been proved. In law it not necessary to establish actual deception. Likelihood of deception is sufficient and it may be inferred from the circumstances of the case. The circumstances of this case clearly support such an inference. For instance, likelihood of deception will be inferred if it shown that the plaintiffs` distinctive name, mark or get-up has acquired a reputation in a given market and there is substantial similarity suggesting a common source. The defendant relied on the facts of the 
 R Johnston v Archibald Orr Ewing 
 case which concerned the use of different names for the same class of goods. that was a case of the past century. I am required to decide this case not by the law and trade practices that obtained at the dusk of the 19th century but the law and practices that obtain at the dawn of the 21st century. I hold that the defendant most clearly misrepresented her goods as those of the plaintiffs. For all these reasons the following consequences shall follow: she shall be restrained as prayed, there shall be an inquiry as to the damages and shall be mulcted in costs.
Outcome:
Plaintiffs` claims allowed.",1999-07-13 00:00:00,SG High Court
2833879,R v Jeremiah [2016] NSWCCA 241,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The respondent Moromi Jeremiah pleaded guilty in the District Court on 30 June 2016 to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company contrary to s 59(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The Crown appeals against inadequacy of the sentence imposed by his Honour the late Judge Farmer SC, on the ground that the learned judge failed to accumulate the sentence to any extent upon a term of imprisonment which the respondent was already serving when the sentence under appeal was imposed.
	
	
	On 25 September 2013 the respondent had committed offences of common assault, aggravated entering of a dwelling house whilst armed, with intent to commit an indictable offence, and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He had been arrested for that group of offences on the day they were committed and was on remand in custody awaiting trial from then until 28 August 2015. On the latter date he was convicted of those offences and sentenced for them by his Honour Judge Cogswell SC.
	
	
	The assault which was the subject of the sentence now under appeal was committed against a fellow inmate at Parklea Correctional Centre on 22 October 2014 during the above-mentioned period of remand in custody. When the respondent was sentenced for the offences of 25 September 2013, the least serious of those charges, the common assault, was taken into account on a Form 1. On the two other counts he was sentenced to concurrent terms each comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years 6 months. The non-parole periods were ordered to commence on the date of arrest and to expire on 24 March 2017.
	
	
	The sentence now under appeal, for the assault of 22 October 2014, was imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year 1 month to commence 1 January 2016 and to expire 31 January 2017 with a balance of term of 5 months to commence 1 February 2017 and to expire 30 June 2017. These expiry dates are as entered on the court’s electronic record, JusticeLink, and they accord with the commencement date and duration as pronounced by his Honour at the conclusion of his Remarks on Sentence. However the Remarks, in error, refer to the expiry of the non-parole period as 28 February 2017. This slip may be ignored.
	
	
	The effect of his Honour’s orders is that the whole of the non-parole period for the offence of 22 October 2014 is concurrent with the non-parole periods for the group of offences committed on 25 September 2013, which expire on 24 March 2017. Of the 5 month balance of term imposed by his Honour, the first 7 weeks, approximately, from 1 February 2017 would be redundant as a period of release on parole because that period would also be concurrent with the last stage of the previously imposed non-parole periods for the earlier offences. The remaining 3 months 7 days of the respondent’s balance of term from 25 March 2017 to 30 June 2017 would be concurrent with the first part of the balance of term of 2 years 6 months which the respondent is already required to serve under his Honour Judge Cogswell SC’s sentence for the earlier group of offences.
	
	
	As a result of the adoption of these commencement dates, the very serious assault for which the respondent was sentenced by his Honour Judge Farmer SC has for all practical purposes gone unpunished. The principle of totality requires the Court to consider whether an aggregation of sentences to be imposed is a “just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved”: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307 – 308; [1997] HCA 26; Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63; [1988] HCA 70; R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [15]. The imposition of an entirely concurrent term by the learned sentencing judge produced an outcome which is unjust and inappropriate. It fails to recognise or to reflect that the circumstances in which this assault against a fellow inmate took place were different from and unconnected with the circumstances of the prior offences. The Remarks on Sentence do not reconcile the concurrence of the sentences with the disparate character and occasion of the respective offences. The Remarks are silent as to any justification his Honour may have seen for concurrency and backdating.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that his Honour faced an “evidential vacuum” when deciding upon totality, concurrence and accumulation. It was said that this arose from failure of the Crown to tender the Remarks on Sentence of his Honour Judge Cogswell SC. The Court does not consider that the absence of Judge Cogswell’s Remarks deprived the learned sentencing judge of a basis for finding facts relevant to his decision on the appropriate extent of concurrence. The bare fact that the assault of 22 October 2014 occurred inside Parklea Correctional Centre after eleven months of the respondent’s remand, whereas the earlier offences had all been committed outside the prison before his arrest, was sufficient to support a conclusion that the assault in custody for which he was to be sentenced involved entirely separate and unrelated criminality. The Crown made clear in its submissions that this consideration warranted accumulation. If the respondent wished to contend that the detailed circumstances of the offences for which his Honour Judge Cogswell SC passed sentence had a bearing upon the appropriate degree of accumulation then he bore an evidential burden to introduce additional evidence.
	
	
	On the hearing of the appeal each party was asked whether Judge Cogswell SC’s Remarks were to be tendered for consideration in the event of the Court upholding the appeal and moving to resentence. Neither the Crown nor the respondent tendered the Remarks.
	
	
	Accompanying the need to reflect total criminality is the Court’s concern to maintain public confidence in the administration of criminal justice. The concurrence ordered by his Honour, if allowed to stand, would undermine that confidence and give rise instead to a perception that a person who has committed a serious offence has escaped effective punishment: Regina v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36] – [37]; Pannowitz v R [2016] NSWCCA 13 at [40]. A case such as the present involves an especially important factor relevant to general deterrence which must be taken into account in determining whether concurrence of any degree (and, if so, what degree) will be consistent with the imposition of a sufficient penalty overall. Namely, the sentence must effect sufficient general deterrence to demonstrate that violence and disorder between prisoners in custody will not be tolerated by the courts: R v Fyffe [2002] NSWSC 751 at [33]; R v Hoskins [2004] NSWCCA 236 at [62] – [63]; R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [56].
	
	
	This consideration was stated in these terms by Barr J in R v Fyffe at [33]:
	


“It is particularly important that courts impose sentences calculated to deter the commission of offences in prison. Officers who administer prison communities are entitled to expect that inmates will be deterred from offending. Equally, inmates serving their sentences as best they may are entitled to as much protection as the courts can afford them.”


	
	Far from providing general deterrence, the fully concurrent sentence under appeal conveys the impression that an inmate may do as he wishes whilst serving his term, without material consequence. To give practical effect to the penalty to be imposed, to reflect the culpability of the offender for the discrete offence of 22 October 2014 and to provide both the general and specific deterrence which the case demanded, the sentence should have been fully accumulated on the non-parole period for the 25 September 2013 offences. The sentence appealed from is manifestly inadequate by reason of its concurrence with the pre-existing term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Full accumulation of the sentence in this case would be consistent with the legislative policy underlying s 56(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That section provides that where a convicted inmate commits an offence against the person while serving a sentence of imprisonment yet to expire, his sentence for the offence committed in custody is to be consecutive upon the pre-existing term, unless otherwise ordered. The respondent was not a “convicted inmate” at the time of the assault. Section 56 does not apply to him. But the full accumulation which the Court on this appeal considers appropriate is certainly not in tension with the objectives of s 56.
	
	
	The respondent argued that the sentence his Honour imposed had a “sensible structure” because the State Parole Authority would have to consider his release to parole under the sentence for the assault sometime before 31 January 2017. It was said the Authority would be able at that time to take into account the relationship between the concurrent sentences and the seriousness of the underlying offending. It is not apparent to what end the Authority might apply that consideration. The short answer to the submission is that the possibility of the Parole Authority considering the matter is irrelevant. The objectives of specific and general deterrence had to be achieved by the sentencing judge’s decision, through denunciation of the crime reflected in an appropriately measured punishment. A decision of the State Parole Authority in exercise of its discretion at a later time is no substitute for a proper sentence.
	
	
	His Honour ordered that the sentence for Loto, one of the co-offenders who took part in the assault in company within the prison on 22 October 2014, should commence on 12 January 2016, which made it wholly consecutive upon the longest non-parole period he was serving under a sentence imposed on 1 December 2014 for unrelated offences. Under that earlier sentence he was subject to a balance of term of 2 years 9 months from 12 January 2016. The learned sentencing judge was aware that “his eligibility for parole had been put back to November” 2016. That does not alter the fact that the sentence for his part in the assault on 22 October 2014 was (correctly) made wholly consecutive. His Honour would not have been able to date the sentence imposed from a commencement later than 12 January 2016, notwithstanding that Loto’s custody up to November 2016 may have been referrable to refusal of parole under the other sentence: s 55(2) and (4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	As this Court has found error in the sentencing judge’s discretionary decision, the question remains whether, notwithstanding that finding, the Court should exercise its residual discretion not to intervene: CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales (2015) 256 CLR 356; [2015] HCA 9 at [34], [66]. The onus is on the Crown to persuade the Court to intervene. It relied upon four considerations. First, the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence was not caused by the Crown. Secondly, there was no delay by the Crown in instituting the appeal or serving the Notice of Appeal. Thirdly, there is no evidence before the Court from which it may be inferred that resentencing would affect the respondent’s progress towards rehabilitation. Fourthly, resentencing would not result in an unjustifiable sense of grievance arising from comparison with sentences received by the respondent’s co-offenders.
	
	
	In urging that the Court should exercise its residual discretion not to alter the sentence passed by his Honour, the respondent relied, first, upon an affidavit in which he deposed to subjective circumstances such as physical abuse as a child, illness of family members and the fact that he assumed responsibilities of fatherhood at a young age when he was not prepared for them. These matters had not been adduced before the sentencing judge and were contained only in an affidavit prepared for and read on the appeal. This Court would not permit such evidence to be adduced belatedly for consideration upon resentencing where, as here, a decision had been taken not to adduce it in the sentence proceedings. As this subjective material could not bear upon the resentencing exercise, should it be undertaken, so too it could not be relevant to whether the Court in its discretion should refrain from interfering.
	
	
	Secondly, it was argued that any degree of accumulation upon the respondent’s sentence for the 26 September 2013 offences would constitute “tinkering”. That is, minimal adjustment of the penalty would be contrary to the principle that a sentencing judge should be allowed as much discretion as possible and that his or her decision should not be interfered with to a trivial extent. It was argued that having regard to the constraints of parity with the penalties for the respondent’s co-offenders the Court would only be considering “the extension of the respondent’s sentence by perhaps three months and we say that that falls foul of the principle against tinkering”. Both premises of this argument are mistaken. Having regard to the full accumulation applied in respect of Loto, parity with the co-offenders would not constrain this Court, upon resentence for the assault, to a limit of three months accumulation from the expiry of the non-parole period imposed for the 25 September 2013 offences. Further, even three months accumulation would be a period of full-time custody solely referable to the assault and that, relative to no effective penalty at all, could not be described as “tinkering”.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was argued that in the sentence hearing:
	


“The Crown didn’t put a case for accumulation being greater than or equal to Mr Loto and Mr Nogowako. So the respondent didn’t at first instance put forward a subjective case which might have been relevant to that topic. The offender at first instance didn’t put forward a subject (sic) case to ameliorate or to explain, or to excuse, conduct attaching to the earlier offences.”


	
	The Court does not accept that the respondent’s decision not to call evidence of subjective circumstances in the sentence hearing could have been in any way affected by the conduct of the Crown case. The Crown clearly submitted to the learned sentencing judge that generally, as a matter of principle, the fixing of a commencement date for the sentences for each of the co-offenders with respect to the assault of 22 October 2014 should be such as to result in some additional penalty for that offence. Whether the degree of accumulation for the respondent would be greater than that for Loto would be entirely a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	If the Crown’s stance had a bearing upon the extent and nature of the evidence the respondent would call, the respondent could plainly see what that stance was. The respondent had no basis for assuming, at an earlier stage of the sentence proceedings, that the Crown would adopt a position different from that which it did adopt. Further, evidence of subjective circumstances tendered “to ameliorate or to explain, or to excuse, the conduct attaching to the earlier offences” would have been irrelevant in the sentence proceedings. Whatever such circumstances might have been, the earlier offending had been unrelated to the assault on 22 October 2014 and the question of accumulation could not have been approached by seeking to re-litigate factors in mitigation of the penalty which his Honour Judge Cogswell SC had imposed.
	
	
	The Court accepts that the considerations relied upon by the Crown are compelling. There is no substance in the respondent’s arguments in support of the Court exercising its residual discretion. The sentence under appeal by the Crown must be quashed and the respondent must be resentenced.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offence which is the subject of the present appeal will be apparent from the following summary of the facts. The victim was a fellow inmate of the respondent named Athanasiadis. Shortly after 9:36 am on 22 October 2014 the victim emerged from his cell and entered a common room. He commenced conversation with two prisoners named Aukuso and Loto. Loto assumed a fighting posture towards the victim and the victim moved away. At about 9:40 am Loto walked out from the cells carrying a sandwich press. Shortly afterwards Aukuso tried to pull the victim towards the cells but the victim backed away and returned to a table in the common room. Aukuso followed him and at 9:43 am struck the victim’s head with his hand, briefly held his neck in a headlock then walked away.
	
	
	Next, from a standing position behind the victim, Loto approached and struck him hard to the left side of his head with the sandwich press. This caused the victim to slump onto the table. Loto then dropped the sandwich press and punched the victim to his head. Another prisoner, Ngowoka, came up to the victim and punched him in the head. At this point the respondent approached the victim from behind, put both arms around him and pulled him to the ground. He then stomped on the victim’s head. The respondent was dragged away from the victim by Aukuso. The respondent struggled and a Corrective Services officer also tried to restrain him.
	
	
	Yet another prisoner, Nikua, then approached the victim and kicked him. This was followed by the respondent again stomping on the victim. Soon afterwards Correctional Services officers regained control of the situation. The victim was escorted out of the common room. He was transferred to Westmead Hospital where he was found to have sustained a fracture to the base of his thumb. He underwent surgery for that injury and remained in hospital for 2 days before being discharged back to Parklea. He had also sustained a minimal displacement fracture to the base of his skull which was managed conservatively. The victim was released from custody on 31 October 2014 and moved interstate. He apparently received no further treatment for his injuries.
	
	
	No motive has been established, on the part of any of the assailants, for the attack on this victim. The respondent did not give evidence before the learned sentencing judge. His conduct can fairly be assessed as a vicious, unprovoked and cowardly attack, in company, on a man who had been rendered vulnerable by two circumstances. First, the victim was imprisoned together with the respondent and consequently had no ability to avoid contact with the respondent and his co-offenders in the first place or to disengage and remove himself once conflict began. Secondly, he was vulnerable at the time the respondent seized him and dragged him to the floor because he had been stunned by the blow delivered to his head by Loto wielding the sandwich press. He had also received a punch to the head from each of Loto and then Ngowoka. It is obvious that by the time the respondent stomped on his head he was passive and unable to defend himself, stunned by repeated blows to the head and lying on the ground.
	
	
	A significant aspect of the seriousness inherent in a charge under s 59(2) is that the assault is committed in company. Where a group of men make an attack upon a single victim the latter will usually have no chance to defend himself adequately, will be at risk of sustaining severe injury and will likely only suffer worse if he resists because of the probability of being overwhelmed. The objective seriousness of this particular instance was heightened by Loto’s cowardly attack from behind with a blunt weapon, capitalised upon by the respondent almost immediately after.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of an assault committed by stomping on a victim’s head has been remarked upon in this Court: AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203; (2012) 225 A Crim R 481; Wainwright v R [2016] NSWCCA 19.
	
	
	The respondent’s plea of guilty to this charge was entered in the District Court, not at the first opportunity. The learned sentencing judge considered that he was entitled to some discount for his plea but did not specify how much he allowed. From the procedural history it would appear no more than 10% would have been appropriate. Whilst the Crown was saved the trouble and expense of a trial, the charge appears to have been unanswerable. The whole episode was captured on closed-circuit television. Eyewitness accounts could have been given by Corrective Services officers.
	
	
	As far as the respondent’s subjective circumstances are concerned, his criminal record is appalling for a young man, only 19 years of age when the subject offence was committed and only 21 years at the date of this judgment. Up to 22 October 2014 the respondent had accumulated numerous convictions in the Childrens Court, from age 14 years, for larceny, breaking and entering, affray, resisting police officers, stalking and intimidating, common assault, robbery in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Then came the offences of 25 September 2013 of entering a dwelling house armed and in company with intent to commit an indictable offence and intentionally causing grievous bodily harm, for which he was sentenced by his Honour Judge Cogswell SC.
	
	
	Interspersed throughout his record are instances of breaches of bonds and supervision orders and failures to appear. He has to this point entrenched himself as a violent offender with no respect for the law or for law enforcement authorities. He is not entitled to any lenience in sentence for the assault on his fellow inmate.
	
	
	His custodial history is also extremely poor. It shows repeated institutional misconduct and defiance of authority and of the law. There are 7 instances of fighting and assaults between 13 July 2014 and 22 April 2016. He has failed a urine test, damaged and defaced his cell, disregarded Corrective Services officers’ directions and been in possession of an offensive weapon. The assaults referred to were on other inmates. The offensive weapon was a shiv, an improvised knife blade. He has assaulted and abused correctional officers in the course of resisting searches.
	
	
	It has been mentioned that in the sentence proceedings before his Honour Judge Farmer SC the respondent chose not to advance any subjective material. He tendered no personal history or background information. There were no character references. He did not express remorse with respect to this offence nor did he do or say anything to indicate remorse, implicitly. In the absence of any such information and having regard to his criminal record his prospects of rehabilitation appear extremely poor. This is to some extent qualified by his affidavit read on the appeal deposing to his enrolment in courses and recently improved co-operation in gaol.
	
	
	In resentencing the respondent, parity with the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders for their part in the assault of 22 October 2014 must be considered in more detail. His Honour sentenced Loto to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months and balance of term of 5 months. His Honour considered Loto’s part in the group attack upon the victim more serious than the respondent’s part. We do not agree. Whilst Loto struck first, from behind with a weapon, the respondent’s actions were equally cowardly because he acted when the victim was already impaired by earlier blows. Stomping on the man’s head, then stomping on him again after a brief interruption of the attack due to the attendance of Corrective Services officers, was no less severe a form of assault than Loto striking him with a blunt weapon.
	
	
	A subjective case was presented to the learned sentencing judge in respect of Loto but we do not consider that it provided any basis for substantial differentiation in penalty between him and the respondent. On the assumption that his Honour applied a 10% discount for Loto’s guilty plea, the discounted overall sentence for Loto would have been 1 year 10 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months. We consider this to be at the limit of the available scope for leniency for his offence. On resentencing the respondent upon this Crown appeal he should be treated equally with Loto. Accordingly, after allowing the 10% discount, his sentence should also be a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months and a balance of term 5 months.
	
	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon Moromi Jeremiah on 30 June 2016 for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 22 October 2014 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof Moromi Jeremiah is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months to commence on 25 March 2017 and to expire on 24 June 2018 and a balance of term of 5 months to commence on 25 June 2018 and to expire on 24 November 2018.

		02 November 2016",2016-11-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2834060,Ejaz v Roads and Maritime Services [2016] NSWCATOD 136,"REASONS FOR DECISION


	
	On 24 November 2015 Roads and Maritime Services refused an application by Mr Sabir Ejaz for authorisation to drive taxi cabs. That decision was affirmed on 11 December 2015 after Mr Ejaz sought internal review. The reason for the refusal was because Roads and Maritime Services could not attest that Mr Ejaz is a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi cab.
	


Background


	
	Mr Ejaz was issued with a taxi driver authority on 18 September 1992. On 21 December 1993 he was charged by NSW Police with indecent assault as a result of a complaint made by a female passenger in a taxi driven by Mr Ejaz on 2 December 1993. The matter was heard at Hornsby Local Court on 14 February 1994 and Mr Ejaz was found guilty. He was ordered to enter into a self-recognizance in the sum of $1,000 and placed on a two-year good behaviour bond.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz’s taxi authority was cancelled on 18 February 1994. His appeal to the District Court against the conviction for indecent assault was dismissed on 15 December 1994.
	
	
	Prior to the current application, Mr Ejaz had applied for a taxi authority on three occasions – in 2006, 2009 and 2013. He was refused on each occasion. In 2013 he sought review of the refusal by this Tribunal and the decision of Roads and Maritime Services was affirmed by the Tribunal on 10 April 2014.
	


The current application


	
	Mr Ejaz is aggrieved by what he believes is poor treatment of him by Roads and Maritime Services and wishes to seek damages for pain and suffering caused by this treatment. As explained to Mr Ejaz at the hearing, that is not a matter the Tribunal can deal with in this application. This application is confined to whether Mr Ejaz meets the requirements of the legislation to be issued with a taxi authority.
	
	
	Section 33 of the Passenger Transport Act 1990 relevantly provides:
	


33   Authorities

(1)  RMS may, by the issue of authorities under this Division, authorise persons to drive taxi-cabs, subject to and in accordance with this Division. A person authorised under this Division is referred to in this Part as an “authorised taxi-cab driver”.

(2)  A person who drives a taxi-cab is guilty of an offence unless the person is an authorised taxi-cab driver.

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.

(3)  The purpose of an authority under this Division is to attest:

(a)  that the authorised person is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab, and

(b)  that the authorised person is considered to have sufficient responsibility and aptitude to drive a taxi-cab:

(i)  in accordance with the conditions under which the taxi-cab service concerned is operated, and

(ii)  in accordance with law and custom.

(4)  ….

(5)  ….


	
	The issue in this case is whether the Tribunal can attest that Mr Ejaz is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab.
	


The applicant’s case


	
	Mr Ejaz states that he was placed on a good behaviour bond of two years some 23 years ago and has had no further convictions since that time. He believes that this is evidence of his good character and reputation. Mr Ejaz has also provided evidence that he had no criminal convictions in Pakistan before his arrival in Australia in about 1989. He states he has worked in the hospitality and security industries since his 1994 conviction dealing with a wide variety of people and there have been no problems with his behaviour. Mr Ejaz has worked as a security guard since about 2007 and holds the relevant licence.
	
	
	In March 2008 the NSW Commission for Children and Young People ordered that Division 2 of the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998 is not to apply to Mr Ejaz in respect of the conviction in February 1994 for indecent assault. At the hearing Mr Ejaz said that he has not worked with children and the certificate was obtained for the purposes of a previous application for a taxi driver authority.
	
	
	In this and the previous applications for an authority Mr Ejaz provided certificates in relation to a number of courses he has attended and successfully completed since 1995 to May this year. The courses are relevant to his work in hospitality and security. Mr Ejaz states that since his conviction in 1994 he has had a good employment record.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz also provided a number of references. He had previously provided references from employers and landlords covering the period 1994 to 2012. In support of this application he provided more recent references.
	
	
	The receptionist at the Campbelltown Catholic Club states that Mr Ejaz has been a valued member of the Club since 2009. She reports that he has not been involved in any altercations, is kind and shows respect to other patrons and staff members. Mr Ejaz worked as a security officer at Coles until 2015. A reference from his supervisor states, among other things, that Mr Ejaz is of “excellent moral character and behaviour”. He also received a certificate of appreciation from his employer, Wilson Security, for his work with Coles. Another reference from Woolworths Limited states that Mr Ejaz has worked as a security guard at the Masters Head Office for the past five months and that he has performed his duties well and with a cheerful manner.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz also provided references from two neighbours who have known him since 2004 and 2005 respectively. Both state that he is respected and of high moral character. Mr Ejaz stated that the references from his employers and neighbours reflect his good character since the time of the conviction in 1994.
	
	
	When questioned at the hearing it became apparent that none of the referees are aware of his previous convictions. Mr Ejaz said that they did not need to know about it.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz also provided a report by a psychologist, Ms Daisy Sequeira, dated 8 October 2016 in which she stated that Mr Ejaz seems to be psychologically stable and his distress is related to his ongoing issues in obtaining a taxi driver authority. Mr Ejaz said he has seen Ms Sequeira about four times.
	


The 1994 conviction


	
	Mr Ejaz admits that he was convicted of indecent assault in 1994. The allegations made by the complainant in that case were that Mr Ejaz was the driver of a taxi she got into at about 2:30am on 2 December 1993. She claimed that, while she was looking for change to pay the taxi fare, Mr Ejaz climbed through the gap in the front seats into the back of the cab. He put his left arm around her and rubbed her right leg with his right hand. Mr Ejaz then grabbed hold of the complainant’s right hand and moved it towards his crotch. The zipper of Mr Ejaz’s pants was undone and his penis was exposed.
	
	
	The police questioned Mr Ejaz on 21 December 1993 and he was subsequently charged with indecent assault. Mr Ejaz subsequently appeared in court and stated he was innocent of the charge but gave a different version of events to the court to that which he had given police. He claimed that he was treated unfairly by police and, because of his lack of English skills and the fact he had no interpreter, agreed to things he did not say or do. He was, however, found guilty and, as noted above, was unsuccessful on appeal.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz has maintained since his conviction that he was innocent. He told a psychiatrist in October 1996 that he had been wrongly charged and convicted. In his applications for a taxi driver authority he has disclosed the conviction but has stated that he was wrongly convicted. He again stated before the Tribunal that the incident did not happen in the way alleged by police. The psychologist report by Ms Sequeira referred to above states that Mr Ejaz told Ms Sequeira he was wrongly accused.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz has given different versions of what occurred on 2 December 1993 on a number of occasions: to the police when interviewed; to the court; and in statements made in support of his 2009 application for a taxi driver authority.
	
	
	Furthermore, lawyers engaged for the purposes of his 2013 application for a taxi driver authority, as instructed by Mr Ejaz, gave another version of those events in a letter to Roads and Maritime Services in July 2013. Mr Ejaz has also given different accounts of whether or not he was represented in the court proceedings, at times implying that he was not able to present his case because of lack of legal representation or poor representation.
	
	
	When cross-examined before the Tribunal, Mr Ejaz gave no cogent explanation for the differences and discrepancies in his accounts over time other than to state that he had been confused when the police questioned him and that the events did not happen as the police alleged.
	


Earlier offence


	
	On 11 February 1994, a few days before the indecent assault charge came before the Local Court, Mr Ejaz was convicted of fail to behave with civility towards a passenger on the basis of sexual innuendo. He was fined $150 and ordered to pay court costs.
	
	
	The existence of this conviction, although it was referred to in the transcript of the hearing on 14 February 1994 before the Local Court on the indecent assault charge, went unnoticed in relation to Mr Ejaz’s applications for a taxi driver authority in 2006, 2009 and 2013. It only came to light during the hearing before the Tribunal in relation to the 2013 application. Mr Ejaz did not refer to the conviction on any of his applications for a taxi driver authority.
	
	
	When asked at the hearing of the current application why he had not disclosed or referred to this offence in previous applications, Mr Ejaz said he couldn’t remember if he had mentioned it or not. He also stated that the incident was the result of a misunderstanding and that the sexual topic was a discussion on a radio talk back show rather than a conversation directly by him with a female passenger in the taxi. This account of the conviction is repeated in the psychologist report prepared by Ms Sequeira.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz said he had no legal representation and did not know why the matter went as far as it did resulting in a conviction. He also stated that he only mentioned the main offence and letters from Roads and Maritime Services also only referred to that incident and not the earlier one.
	
	
	Other than what appears in the transcript of the indecent assault court proceedings against Mr Ejaz and his own evidence, there is no further evidence of the nature of this offence before the Tribunal. The respondent informed the Tribunal there is no FACTS sheet in relation to the matter.
	


The respondent’s case


	
	The respondent states that Mr Ejaz drove a taxi for a very short time before he came to notice for two offences of a sexual nature and that these offences occurred in a taxi cab.
	
	
	The respondent acknowledges that in 2008 Mr Ejaz obtained a certificate from the then Commission for Children and Young People which permitted him to work with children and that he has held a security guard licence since about 2007. These were obtained despite the conviction for indecent assault. The respondent states that the former has been overtaken by more recent legislation and may no longer be relevant. In relation to the security guard licence which requires the holder to be a fit and proper person, the respondent states that while Mr Ejaz may be a fit and proper person to be a security guard, he is not a fit and proper person to be issued with a taxi driver authority. The respondent submits that whether a person is fit and proper to hold a particular licence depends on the purpose for which the licence is held.
	
	
	The respondent referred to a number of cases which have dealt with issues similar to those before the Tribunal in this matter. The respondent submitted that the Tribunal could not attest that Mr Ejaz is of good repute and a fit and proper person to drive a taxi. It was stated that Mr Ejaz has two convictions both of which are directly related to his taxi driving. Mr Ejaz has not shown any remorse and has not accepted his convictions. Mr Ejaz seemed to have blocked the first conviction from his mind and has denied that the second more serious offence of indecent assault occurred.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that there is very little evidence before the Tribunal of Mr Ejaz’s good repute as those who have spoken favourably of him have done so without knowledge of his history. The respondent acknowledges the considerable amount of time that has elapsed since the last offence but states this is tempered by Mr Ejaz’s denial of responsibility for his past actions. The respondent states that Mr Ejaz has simply not dealt with the issue and the Tribunal cannot be comfortable that he would not behave in the same way again.
	
	
	The respondent notes the report provided by Ms Sequeira in which she refers to Mr Ejaz’s anxiety and low mood but states that his history as given to her is based on his statements that he was wrongly accused. The respondent states that Mr Ejaz has not provided any psychological report which indicates that he would not act in the same way again if he were permitted to drive a taxi.
	


Consideration


	
	At issue is whether the Tribunal can “attest” that Mr Ejaz is of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be a taxi driver. In Director General, Transport New South Wales v AIC [2011] NSWADTAP 65 the Appeal Panel stated at [12] that by using the word “attest” the Parliament has sought “to emphasis the idea that the conferral of an authority involves a declaration of public trust”.
	
	
	The Appeal Panel went on to say that the expression “good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person” is meant “to be expansive in scope allowing for a broad range of personal attributes to be assessed, and for consideration to be given to the person’s general standing in the community, especially among those who know the person well and are fully informed as to any matters of concern”. The Panel then discussed the concepts of “good repute” and “fit and proper” (at [13]): “repute” goes to the public estimation of the person while “fit and proper” goes to such matters of character “as to whether the applicant is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him or her to be safely accredited to the public without further inquiry”.
	
	
	In Re T and the Director of Youth and Community Services [1980] 1 NSDWLR 392 Wadell J stated when discussing the meaning of “good repute”:
	


A person's reputation, in fact and in law, is to be found in the estimate of his moral character entertained by some specific group of people, such as those who live in the neighbourhood of his residence, those who work with him or those with whom he associates in his occupation or profession . . . Evidence of conviction for a criminal offence is, however, admissible as evidence, indeed, most cogent evidence of bad reputation.


	
	A criminal history is not, however, evidence of bad repute, but does create a presumption that the person has, among those who know of that history, a bad reputation. It puts the onus on the person to establish their good reputation: Loye v Director General, Department of Transport [2000] NSWADT 145 at [29].
	
	
	Mr Ejaz maintains that he was wrongly convicted and claims that the incidents did not occur in the way portrayed to the court in relation to the two convictions. As noted above, Mr Ejaz has given varying accounts of events in relation to the indecent assault charges over time. He was, however, convicted after a full hearing before the Local Court at which he was legally represented and his appeal was unsuccessful. He has not presented any additional cogent evidence to the Tribunal than that which was before the Court. Similarly he has not presented any additional evidence to the Tribunal in relation to the earlier conviction. I therefore accept the facts on which the convictions were based.
	
	
	In Saadieh v Director General, Department of Transport [1999] NSWADT 68 the Tribunal stated:
	


[T]here are a number of factors that need to be taken into account in determining a person’s suitability and fitness to obtain a taxi authority. These factors include:

­ the nature, seriousness and frequency of any criminal offences for which the applicant has been arrested or convicted;

­ the nature, seriousness and frequency of any complaints made against the applicant;

­ the applicant’s driving record;

­ the applicant’s reputation in the community; and

­ the likelihood that the applicant will re-offend, be the subject of further complaints or commit further traffic offences.

In assessing the last factor, several considerations are relevant. These include: the length of time since the offence/s were committed or the complaint/s made; the circumstances in which those offences or complaints occurred or are alleged to have occurred; whether the applicant admits responsibility for the offences or complaints and shows genuine remorse; the efforts the applicant has made to rehabilitate himself or herself during that time and; any change in the applicant’s circumstances such as increased support from friends, family or professional service providers.


	
	Mr Ejaz has been convicted of two offences, both of a sexual nature and both involving female passengers while he was the driver of a taxi cab. The indecent assault conviction was described by the Magistrate when giving judgment as a “very, very serious offence”.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz does not accept that his behaviour has led him to being convicted on two occasions for sexually related offences. He is aggrieved by his treatment and now the focus of his grievance appears to be against Roads and Maritime Services as a result of their refusals of his applications to be permitted to once again drive a taxi. Indeed the emphasis in the report by Ms Sequeira is on this grievance rather than him coming to terms with his own actions or assessment of future risk.
	
	
	Mr Ejaz has provided no evidence that he has accepted or come to terms with his behaviour and the fact of the convictions. Of concern is that the two offences occurred within a relatively short time of each other. Of most concern is that Mr Ejaz over a period of many years did not reveal the existence of the earlier conviction and, when it came to light, professed to have not remembered it and then questioned its validity. It is highly unlikely that a person would forget such a conviction, particularly as this conviction appears to be his first encounter with the court system. The fact that it too was of a sexual nature, although not involving any suggestion of physicality, is of great concern.
	
	
	I am mindful that the offences occurred some 23 years ago and that Mr Ejaz has had no further convictions since that time. He has sought to improve himself through a range of courses and has been gainfully employed. I have no doubt that the references from his employers are genuine and he is a good employee. He has successfully obtained a security licence. I consider, however, that, while Mr Ejaz may be regarded as a fit and proper person to hold a security licence, different considerations may apply to a taxi driver authority. Similarly, I place little reliance on the certificate obtained in 2008 enabling him to work with children.
	
	
	I place little weight on the references supplied by Mr Ejaz which go to his reputation and whether he is of good character. None of these persons was made aware by Mr Ejaz of his convictions because, in his view, they had no need to know. There is therefore very little evidence before the Tribunal of good repute.
	
	
	The conduct engaged in by Mr Ejaz while he was a taxi driver and which occurred in the taxi he was driving is not conduct which can be found to be acceptable. The fact that he continues to deny the incidents took place and maintains he was wrongly convicted, combined with his failure to disclose the earlier conviction, reveals that Mr Ejaz has not come to terms with his past and has not taken any steps to rehabilitate himself. Despite the considerable time that has now elapsed since his convictions, these matters do not instil any confidence that he would behave appropriately in relation to all passengers. I therefore, on the basis of the evidence before me, cannot attest that Mr Ejaz is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab.

2834101,Robinson v RMS [2016] NSWDC 277,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an application under s 28(3) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 by a successful respondent in an appeal under that Act for costs against the unsuccessful appellant. The appellant, Mr Garry Robinson, I shall refer to hereafter as the motorist. The respondent to the appeal is Roads and Maritime Services to whom I shall refer hereafter as RMS.
	
	
	On Sunday, 7 December 2014 the motorist was driving his motor vehicle, a silver Subaru panel van, registered number BIX 09E, on Macpherson Street, Mosman. On that section of Macpherson Street, between Montague Road and Ourimbah Road, an RMS speed camera detected the motorist’s car being driven at 60 kilometres per hour in a zone where the speed limit was 50 kilometres per hour. There is no dispute that not only was the motorist the owner of the Subaru panel van, but he was also its driver at the relevant time. The offence is alleged to have occurred at 11.11am.
	
	
	On 12 December 2014 the Office of State Revenue sent a penalty notice to the motorist imposing a penalty of $109. The notice issued on 12 December 2014 was due to be paid by 9 January 2015. The motorist sent a lengthy letter of two and a half pages to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) on 4 January 2015. On 29 January 2015 the SDRO advised the motorist that the penalty notice had, in its view, been properly issued and requested the motorist to pay the penalty of $109. A reminder notice was sent on 30 January 2015 requiring payment on 27 February 2015.
	
	
	The reminder notice caused the motorist to send a further one and a half pages contending that his original objection was valid and enclosing a statutory declaration, again advancing his reasons why the original penalty notice had not been correctly issued. The statutory declaration contains these allegations:
	


“The claim by SDRO was denied as it was completely unsubstantiated and SDRO were directed to provide within 28 days a sworn affidavit and supporting documentation substantiating that the Speed Measuring Device that had been used to allegedly record the speed of my automobile on 7 December 2014 conforms to the National Measurement Act 1960 (Cth) in respect of its use for making measurements for any legal and monetary purpose, or that SDRO had any lawful claim against me, or that I committed any crime or offended/broke any law.

As SDRO, being fully aware of the terms of my objection, failed to provide any documentary evidence in support of their claim within the time period specified, they have defaulted in respect of their claim and have admitted and agreed to the terms of the objection tendered, notwithstanding any unsubstantiated denials that may be made by them that the speed measuring radar device does not comply with the National Measurement Act 1960 when used for any legal purpose.”


	
	On 2 March 2015 SDRO advised the motorist that it was unable to reconsider his second request for a review of the penalty notice. A court attendance notice was served on the appellant on 12 March 2015 requiring him to appear before the Downing Centre Local Court on 28 April 2015. The court attendance notice provides the following information:
	


“Date & Time of Offence: 07/12/2014 11:11:59am

Place of Offence: Macpherson Street, Mosman

Short Particulars: Camera recorded speeding offence - exceed speed limit - ten kilometres and under detected by an approved speed measuring device and recorded by an approved camera recording device within the meaning of the Road Transport Act 2013.

Speed Travel (kilometre): 60 km/h; Speed Limit (km); 50 km/h; Direction of travel: Towards camera;

Cross Streets: Between Montague Road and Ourimbah Road; Vehicle registration: BIX 09E.

Statutory Provision Describing Offence: Road Rules 2014 r 20.”


	
	The Court Attendance Notice eventually came on for hearing before Mr W Pierce LCM, at the Central Local Court on Friday, 31 July 2015. The motorist represented himself and the RMS was represented by Mr Wosniak. The case for the RMS was purely documentary. There was a certificate issued under s 257 of Road Transport Act 2013 and under s 221 of Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 certifying that the motorist was the registered operator of motor vehicle registered number BIX09E, the certificate fully describes the important question.There was a certificate under s 137 of The Road Transport Act 2013 certifying that the REDFLEX SPEED Infringement Detection system was an approved traffic enforcement device, that is approved for speed measurement, providing the serial number of the device, providing its location on McPherson Street Mosman and providing its code. That certificate bears the date 9 September 2014. There was a certificate under s 138(2) by an appropriate inspection officer certifying that on 3 December 2014 at 10.58am he carried out an inspection of the approved traffic enforcement device and it was found to be operating correctly by examination of the detection and recording systems. That date of course was four days before 7 December 2014 which was the time the offence charged against the motorist. There was also a certificate under s 257 The Road Transport Act 2013 specifying details of the motorist’s licence. There was a certificate pursuant to s 257(2) of the Road Transport Act 2013 annexing photograph A and the data printed on it which formed part of records kept by the RMS. The certificate also states that the series of 32 letters, numbers or symbols on the photograph following the words “security indicator” had been produced by a certain algorithm. The certificate also stated that the earlier two assertions of fact appear in or could be calculated from records kept by the RMS. There were then 5 photographs of the vehicle in question travelling along McPherson Street Mosman showing the time and the date that the vehicle was photographed and its speed at the relevant time. Also placed before the Local Court was a survey plan of McPherson Street and connecting streets in the area near Middle Harbour Public School indicating where signs were, what the signs were and where there were traffic lights and other things indicating the position of cameras and speed control devices.
	
	
	The only evidence called by the appellant was from himself. Essentially the appellant gave evidence of an expert nature, or attempted to, which was not entitled to give. His contention was that the RMS’s speed camera, to use shorthand, did not comply with the National Measurement Act 1960 of the Commonwealth that there was an inconsistency between State and Federal law. The learned Magistrate interrupted the appellant and told him this:
	


“Sir, some two or three or four years, whatever it is, ago - I lose track of time - the “State government introduced changes to the law which prevent a defendant in cases like these challenging the accuracy of the machine or its readings. Are you with me? So if, as seems likely from what you were saying, you are seeking to suggest that wires nearby might have interfered with electro-magnetic radiation or whatever, that would require -that can be done, but only if you have a qualified person, that would require - that can be done, but only if you have a qualified person, which in most cases would mean an electrical engineer or somebody with similar qualifications to give evidence for you. Otherwise, you are not permitted to take account of evidence from an unqualified person, such as yourself, on an issue like that.”

The motorist then sought, as I understand it, to tender something that he printed out from the internet but its tender was properly rejected. Essentially that was the end of the evidence of the appellant. He was convicted on the documentary evidence, there being no expert evidence to contradict anything certified by the various certificates tendered by or on behalf of the RMS.


	
	The magistrate imposed a fine of $109 which is the same as the original penalty amount and gave the motorist 28 days in which to pay that amount. The RMS then applied for costs and the appellant then relied on article 15 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which he quoted:
	


“No-one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed, nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time when the criminal offence was committed.”

Any lawyer knows that that enshrines the principle against retrospective criminal legislation. However, the motorist relied upon it as indicating that the ordering of costs again him was the imposition of a heavier penalty. That is simply not an arguable position. The purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made. The purpose of a costs order is not to punish the person against whom it is made: Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 543, 562-3, 567; Ohn v Walton (1995) 36 NSWLR 77 at 79, 84; Director General of Department of Agriculture v Temmingh [2003] NSWSC 598.


	
	His Honour ordered the appellant to pay costs in the sum of $1,771 and pointed out that if the appellant wished for time to pay he could make an application to the Registrar of the Local Court.
	
	
	The appellant then commenced proceedings under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and the original notice of appeal filed on 21 August 2015 was an appeal limited to the making of the costs order in the proceedings in the Local Court.
	
	
	The appeal was first listed before his Honour Judge Toner on 28 October 2015. Initially there was no appearance by or on behalf of the motorist and the appeal was dismissed and the orders of the Local Court were confirmed and his Honour made an order that the motorist pay to the RMS costs in the sum of $900 being the costs of the appeal. Later, after Mr Wozniak who had appeared for the appellant was excused, the appellant appeared in person and his Honour vacated the orders that he had made earlier that day. His Honour noted that the appellant wished to appeal against not only the costs order but his conviction. His Honour adjourned the matter to 16 November 2015, adjourned that is both the original appeal and the application for leave to appeal against conviction.
	
	
	On 16 November 2015 the matter came before his Honour Judge Berman. His Honour granted leave to the appellant to bring an appeal against his conviction. He then stood the matter over to 8 February 2016. On that day this appeal came on for hearing before me.
	
	
	No amended notice of appeal was actually filed. However, it became clear that the appellant again wished to argue about the alleged non-compliance of the RMS speed camera with the Commonwealth legislation although he had no evidence of an expert nature to support that contention, had not filed any notice of motion seeking leave to adduce evidence that was not adduced in the Court below, and, insofar as he maintained that the State legislation was inconsistent with the Commonwealth legislation, had not given any notice to the Attorney General of this State, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Australia or indeed to the Attorneys General of the other States of the Commonwealth. All of this was explained to the motorist. In particular a Mr Wozniak was kind enough to refer me to decisions from other jurisdictions which supported his contention that there was no inconsistency between the State legislation and the Commonwealth legislation. He referred me to the decision of Vanstone J in Anastasiou v The Police [2013] SASC 112 and to Kuipers‑Lloyd v The Police [2013] SASC 137, a decision of David J. He also referred to the decision of my Queensland colleague, McGill DCJ in Crabbe v The Queensland Police Service [2013] QDC 122. Mr Wozniak suggested that the most succinct statement the legal principles was contained in a decision McGill DCJ. I read that decision and I concur with the submission that Mr Wozniak made. I read parts of Crabbe to the motorist in order to draw to his attention the fact that if he wished to argue against the reasoning of the District Court of Queensland and the reasoning of the two judges of the Supreme Court of South Australia he would find that at least the Attorney General of this State and perhaps the RMS itself would engage Senior Counsel to argue against the propositions which he sought to advance.
	
	
	Eventually, the appellant, after being given time to consider his position, and knowing that if he wished to proceed further time beyond 8 February 2016 would be required in Court, decided not to proceed with his appeal against conviction. He proceeded with this appeal against sentence but for reasons which I gave on 8 February 2016 that appeal was dismissed.
	
	
	The RMS then sought costs of the appeal. That application was made, if my recollection be correct, at about 4.30pm on 8 February. I suggested to the parties that I would deal with the matter on the following morning but that was not convenient for Mr Wozniak. The appellant told me that he did not wish to appear again in Court and that the matter could proceed without his being present in Court. For the convenience of Mr Wozniak I then adjourned the matter till today commencing at 2pm.
	
	
	Again, the RMS has been put to considerable expense on an appeal which was initially limited to the making of the costs order but which was sought to be expanded to an appeal against the conviction, a conviction which was properly recorded in the Local Court by the learned magistrate and about which the appellant was given advice by Magistrate Pierce, advice by Mr Wozniak informally, and then informal advice in open Court by me.
	
	
	The case, with the utmost respect to the motorist, was just not arguable and much time and effort has been wasted initially by the appellants being late to Court on 28 October 2015, then seeking leave to argue against the merits of his conviction which was granted by Breman J but eventually originally abandoned when he realised the almost insurmountable obstacles which he would have to traverse in order to seek to have the original conviction set aside.
	
	
	Throughout the motorist was not legally represented. At the time of the offence the appellant was 43 years old. The transcript in the Local Court proceedings indicates that he was born in England and came to Australia some little time ago. His accent when arguing before me was clearly that of an Englishman. He was first issued a driver’s licence in New South Wales on 5 October 2006. He described himself as a self-employed fitness trainer. It would appear that he has no qualifications in the law. That having been said the motorist might best be described as the best English “bush lawyer” that this Court has come across for some considerable time. However there is nothing that ought prevent the RMS recovering the costs wasted by the position taken by the motorist. If the motorist had taken legal advice early he probably would have been advised to pay the penalty notice which was not the admission of any criminal liability. It might attract the loss of a few points from his driver’s licence but that and a payment of $109 would have been the end of the matter.
	
	
	Unfortunately the matter only ends today. Mr Wozniak, an accredited specialist in this area of law and a very experienced solicitor has estimated that he has spent 1,150 minutes in defending the motorist’s appeal on behalf of the RMS. That does not include any time spent today. He rounded that figure off as being 19 hours which is a rounding down. The hourly rate at which he charged is, for a person in Mr Wozniak’s position, modest but in keeping with his contracted retainer with the RMS. There is nothing to say that the sum proposed by him as shown on MFI 1, a typewritten copy of which he handed up this afternoon which I annexed to MFI 1, is other than the real costs incurred by the RMS in defending the motorist’s appeal. The total amount claimed is $6,118.
	
	
	I order the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs, the sum of $6,118.
	
	
	And do you need any further reasons Mr Wozniak?
	
	
	WOZNIAK: No your Honour. Pursuant to s 72 of the same legislation your Honour needs to put a time period and the normal time is 28 days your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, is it, right.
	
	
	WOZNIAK: Section 72 your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I order that the appellant pay those costs within three months of today’s date.

2834164,Beckett v R [2016] NSWDC 280,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentence passed by his Honour Judge Henderson, the Chief Magistrate of this State, sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 16 February 2016. The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge that on 23 January 2016, at Potts Point, she did assault Walid Ahmad. There was no averment that the appellant caused the victim any actual bodily harm.
	
	
	The offence occurred outside The World Bar in Bayswater Road, Potts Point. The appellant and her boyfriend, Mr Kieran Hurt, were standing in a queue, seeking to enter the premises The victim, Mr Walid Ahmad, was employed by a security service, to act as a security guard at The World Bar, and to enforce the responsible service of alcohol. Mr Ahmad walked along the queue and noticed that Mr Hurt was unsteady on his feet. One of the reasons Mr Ahmad was walking along the queue, was to ascertain if any persons were too intoxicated to be admitted to the premises and to tell them to move on. Not only was Mr Hurt unsteady on his feet but Mr Ahmad determined that he was slurring his speech and he became verbally aggressive when Mr Ahmad spoke to him.
	
	
	Mr Ahmad told Mr Hurt that he was too intoxicated to enter The World Bar and that he had to leave the queue and that he was not to remain within 50 metres of the entrance to the premises. The manager of the Bar, approached Mr Hurt and Mr Ahmad and reiterated the advice that Mr Ahmad had given to Mr Hurt. There was then a verbal argument. When Mr Ahmad and the manager started ushering Mr Hurt away from the queue, Mr Hurt hit the victim in the chest with his elbow, causing him pain.
	
	
	At about the same time, the appellant told Mr Ahmad that Mr Hurt was her boyfriend and that he was to leave him alone. Mr Ahmad then started explaining to the appellant why Mr Hurt was being dealt with in this manner. Mr Hurt then swung one of his arms and hit Mr Ahmad with a closed fist, punching him in the jaw, causing him pain. After that, Mr Ahmad tried to prevent Mr Hurt from committing a further assault upon him by grabbing him but then the appellant, using an open palm, slapped Mr Ahmad a number of times on the back of the neck, and on the shoulders and over his ribs, using both hands. The appellant and the victim then fell to the ground, and, although the police facts indicate that the Crown case was that the current appellant kicked the victim in the left side of his chest, that is very hard to accept as physically happening, and the learned Chief Magistrate noted that there was a factual dispute about that. I do not approach this matter on the basis that the appellant kicked Mr Ahmad, which as I said, appears to me to have been physically inconsistent with the facts that were admitted.
	
	
	The appellant told the Chief Magistrate she was intoxicated at the time of this offence, and that she had been drinking since 1pm, that is between 1pm and 11.45pm. Her drinking was because she had been at an “event”. She did not offer intoxication as an excuse at all which is the appropriate thing to concede because that it what the law provides. His Honour ordered the appellant to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The appellant appeals against the severity of that sentence.
	
	
	I am asked to impose instead a bond under s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Indeed, I have been encouraged by Mr Carey, who appears for the appellant, to impose a bond, for longer than one year, if I grant the appellant the benefit of s 10.
	
	
	This is alcohol fuelled misbehaviour in a public piece. This is alcohol fuelled behaviour in the late hours of a Saturday night when the appellant sought to take more liquor by entering the World Bar, licensed premises, in the company of her intoxicated boyfriend. Under the law of this State, acting out of character because of intoxication, is no excuse and is no mitigating factor. Indeed, at common law, the fact of being intoxicated was said to be an aggravating factor and it is often taken to be so.
	
	
	I accept that, given her age and background, and her aims and aspirations in life, that the appellant will not commit an offence of the like nature again. However, although specific deterrence is not called for, general deterrence certainly is called for. Alcohol fuelled misbehaviour at a public place is to be visited with condign punishment. In Pattalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 171, Hoeben CJ at CL said at [23]:
	


“Over recent years, the incidence of such offences, particularly when associated with the excessive consumption of alcohol, have been all too frequent. Such offences are a cause for grave disquiet and the community is understandably angry and frustrated at their occurrence. Regrettably, it is now notorious (as his Honour recognised), that a single punch can not only cause catastrophic injuries but also death. For offences of this kind, the community has the rightful expectation that judicial officers would impose meaningful penalties.”

In that case, the appellant had been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The maximum penalty for that was imprisonment for five years if dealt with on indictment. My colleague, Judge Berman sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for two years and fixed a non-parole period of 12 months. That offence occurred at 3.25am on a Saturday morning in 2010. The victim had left a nightclub in Pitt Street, Sydney and stood outside waiting for friends still inside the club to join him. About the same time, the offender and an unknown male, walked out of the club and turned and faced the victim. The offender then punched the victim in the face with a closed fist. The punch struck the victim on the left side of his face, knocking him to the ground. These offences are sometimes called “coward punch” offences but in the matter of Pattalis the victim only sustained actual bodily harm.


	
	In the current matter there is no suggestion of any actual bodily harm, let alone grievous bodily harm. However, the fact remains, the appellant committed an offence in a public place in circumstances where she was intoxicated and coming to the “defence” of another intoxicated person who needed no defending because he had been guilty of an offence of assaulting the security guard himself. The appellant joined in the assault on the security guard. A melee could easily have arisen. Offences of this nature require meaningful punishment to deter any one who might think to act likewise and who might drink sufficient alcohol to disinhibit themselves and to behave in the manner that the appellant did.
	
	
	The appellant’s concern is that at the time that she stood for sentence in the Local Court, she was studying Certificate IV in Community Services, with a view to obtaining work as a social worker with troubled youth. She has currently put that study on hold, pending the outcome of her appeal to this Court and perhaps ascertaining what effect, if any, a conviction would have upon her ability to pursue her interest in working in the future with troubled youth. There is however no evidence one way or the other that a conviction that has been recorded by the Local Court would inhibit her in the future of obtaining employment working with troubled youth. It is not as if this was some form of sexual offence.
	
	
	The imposition of a bond under s 10 would not provide adequate general deterrence and would not provide any meaningful penalty which offences of this nature require in accordance with what fell from Hoeben CJ at CL in Pattalis v R.
	
	
	For those reasons the appeal is dismissed.

2834165,Kioko v R [2016] NSWDC 281,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentence passed by Magistrate Longley sitting in the Manly Local Court on 14 February 2016. The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge that on 23 January 2016 at Collaroy he did drive a motor vehicle on Pittwater Road whilst there was present in his breath or blood the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol. The reading was 0.053.
	
	
	23 January 2016 was a Saturday. The offence appears to have occurred about 8.26pm. The road was dry. There was medium traffic. It was dusk. The appellant was not guilty of any erratic driving. Nothing that he did drew the police’s attention to his driving. He was stopped at a fixed random breath testing station and underwent breath analysis. He told the police that he had taken two beers earlier in the evening at a family picnic or barbecue. He only finished drinking his last drink five minutes prior to being breath tested. He was allowed the 20 minutes for residual mouth alcohol to be absorbed and then submitted to breath analysis at 9.26pm. That resulted in the reading that I have mentioned. At the time of driving the appellant had in his car his two young sons.
	
	
	The appellant obtained a driver’s licence on 21 June 2006. He has been driving in this State for almost ten years. But for two offences he has a previously unblemished record. On 28 September 2006 he was fined for driving in a bus lane. Of more significance is that on 8 April 2007 he was charged with a low range PCA offence. For that offence he appeared before the Manly Local Court on 9 May 2007 and was fined $550 and disqualified from driving for three months. He appealed to this Court. This Court set aside the conviction and pursuant to s 10 dismissed the charge and placed the offender on a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In essence the appellant now asks me to do again what happened approximately nine years ago in June 2007.
	
	
	The appellant’s career is in the field of mental health advocacy. He holds a very responsible position with a Schizophrenia Fellowship of New South Wales. He has held that position since April 2006. A reference has been tendered from Associate Professor Stephen Woods, a well-known forensic psychologist, with whom the appellant has been working at the Schizophrenia Fellowship since 2008. In his reference Professor Woods tells me this:
	


“Mr Kioko is, in my opinion, a person of high moral and social values who has dedicated himself to assisting persons less fortunate than others due to mental illness. I have discussed the circumstances of the offence with Mr Kioko and note that he has been subject to sustained exposure to major workplace stressors over the past number of years. Unfortunately, the work-related stress inevitably impacted on his marital relationship to the extent that he [and] his wife briefly separated; the separation manifested in Mr Kioko suffering a Major Depressive Episode for which he was treated by a psychiatrist.”

The reference goes on to point out that Professor Woods was told by the appellant that he had consumed two full strength beers (Coopers Red) whilst picnicking with his family. It would appear this was at the time of the separation because when he was breath tested the appellant’s wife was not present in the car, only their two children. Professor Woods went on to point out that the appellant was particularly self-critical for what would be the negative ramifications for both his continued employment and his ability to transport his children to and from their normal activities and because of his wife who has part-time employment. The Professor records that the appellant had requested supervision at meetings focusing upon alcohol-use counselling and psycho-education.


	
	I accept that the appellant needs his licence to perform his role with the Schizophrenia Fellowship. He conducts home visits to individuals living with serious and persistent mental illness. He attends appointments with and provides support to patients during crises and he has to attend meetings with other interested parties in the community, in particular others involved in the Mental Health sector and sectors such as homelessness and general health.
	
	
	Given the circumstances of the offending and given the offender’s generally good character and relatively blameless driving record I accede to the appellant’s request that he be dealt with under s 10. For those reasons I set aside the conviction recorded and the sentence passed by the Manly Local Court on 24 February 2016. Under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without proceeding to a conviction and having regard to the good character of the offender and extenuating circumstances I am satisfied that it is expedient to release the offender on a good behaviour bond. I order that the offender be released on a good behaviour bond for a period of two years from today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	to appear before the Court if called upon to do so any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	to reside at [redacted]; or
	
	
	to advise the Registrar of the Court by pre-paid registered post of any change of any residential address during the term of the bond.
	



	
	Any other orders sought?
	
	
	O’KANE: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You will have to go to the registry to sign the new bond Mr Kioko. You will have to go back to the Downing Centre.
	
	
	O’KANE: Level 3 your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Level 3, the Downing Centre, next door and you might need to wait awhile because my Associate has to get all the paper work over there.
	
	
	APPELLANT: Thank you very much your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Needless to say Mr Kioko don’t do it again.

		03 November 2016",2016-06-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2834167,Bach v R [2016] NSWDC 278,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence passed by Deputy Chief Magistrate Mottley sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 13 April 2016. The appellant pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity to a charge that on 5 April 2016 at Darlinghurst she did knowingly contravene a prohibition or restriction contained in an apprehended domestic violence order. The learned Magistrate imposed a fine of $1,100.
	
	
	The appellant’s surname is Nguyen. She is described in the factsheets by the police as “Kathy Bach NGUYEN” and records from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam describe her as Bach Nguyen Tuyet Van. It may be that in Vietnamese her surname is both Bach and Nguyen but it appears from what I have been told from the Bar table that she is known as Nguyen Tuyet Van Bach. In any event, nothing much turns on the correct order of the appellant’s names.
	
	
	She came before the Local Court as a lady of prior good character. There is no suggestion that she has any criminal record in this State or in this country and there are records from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam that she has no criminal record in her native country.
	
	
	The appellant appears to have had a sheltered upbringing. According to the evidence before me, her parents operate one of the longest running law firms in South Vietnam and impressed a close acquaintance of the appellant, who describes himself as a “Taiwanese-American”, as of aristocratic mien who grew up in what could be described as the rigid upper class culture of Vietnam prior to the collapse of democratic government in that country. Her family has also been described as both respected and affluent.
	
	
	In Vietnam the appellant studied in an MBA program offered by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University which had a campus there and more recently the appellant has come to Australia and is currently studying at the University of Technology in Sydney. Prior to undertaking study at the University of Technology, she was studying at the Australian Institute of Music.
	
	
	There she met Mr Grant Samuels who was a teacher at the Institute and at various times taught the appellant. They formed an intimate relationship which ended sometime in late 2015. Something or other caused Mr Samuels to apply for an AVO. That was granted by the Downing Centre Local Court and at 12.05pm on Tuesday 5 April 2016 the appellant was served with the AVO by the police.
	
	
	Within a quarter of an hour of the service of the order, the appellant left her apartment and walked to the apartment of Mr Samuels where she knocked on the withinsill of Mr Samuel’s apartment. Mr Samuels looked out of his window and identified the appellant as the person standing outside his window knocking on his window sill. He then made a call to the police and the same police who had served the AVO on the appellant saw the appellant walking from Mr Samuel’s residence back in the direction of her own residence holding the AVO in her hand.
	
	
	Whilst the evidence does not disclose it, it is a possibility that the appellant did not understand the nature of the orders contained on the AVO papers and merely wished to make some inquiry of Mr Samuels as to their significance. In any event, if there were a breach, which the appellant admits by pleading guilty, it was technical in a sense and no harm has been established and no inconvenience has been disclosed to Mr Samuels.
	
	
	It has been submitted from the Bar table that the appellant was upset and confused by the service of the AVO and that is quite possible. That is especially so when one considers that on 13 April 2016 the appellant appeared before the Downing Centre Local Court and was fined and then on 6 May 2016 filed a notice of appeal to this Court but later in that month was seen by Dr Albert Ling at the UTS Health Service who noted that she had an impending Court case, was crying and was fearful and that she required an increase in her medication. She also told Dr Ling that she could not do the exam which she was scheduled to sit. A “chronic disease management plan” organised by Dr Ling clearly suggests that the appellant has been suffering from anxiety on a chronic basis and has been prescribed the drug Lovan which had caused her to settle and the same document notes that acupuncture had also decreased the amount of the appellant’s anxiety. The management plan is dated 5 June 2016. In other words, the medical evidence suggests that the appellant was greatly upset by the litigation process and required medication to calm her down which is consistent with her having been upset and confused by the service of the AVO and no doubt fearful of what to her would be a foreign, criminal justice system.
	
	
	The appellant subsists on moneys remitted to her by her parents from Vietnam and she receives approximately $500 per week. I accept that the appellant would have a reduced capacity to pay the fine of $1,100. The circumstances in my view all point to this being an appropriate case for the application of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and there is no opposition from the Crown to that course of action.
	
	
	For those reasons, I set aside the conviction recorded and the sentence passed by the Downing Centre Local Court on 13 April 2016.
	
	
	Ms Nguyen, under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, without proceeding to a conviction but having regard to your prior good character, I am satisfied that it is expedient to release you on a good behaviour bond. I order that you be released on a good behaviour bond for a period of 18 months from today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at [redacted]; and
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of this Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.
	



	
	Would you take her to the Registry, Mr Valentin?
	
	
	VALENTIN: Yes, your Honour.

2834168,Alagendram v R [2016] NSWDC 279,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against a sentence imposed by Magistrate Trad sitting in the Local Court at Burwood 22 February 2016. The appellant had been served with a field court attendance notice to appear before that Local Court on 2 February 2016. The matter became before Magistrate Trad on 22 February 2016 when the appellant made an application under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. Her Honour rejected that application and then sentenced the appellant but on 29 February 2016 the appellant filed a notice of appeal. The appellant repeats the application he made to Magistrate Trad that he be dealt with pursuant to s 32.
	
	
	The facts of the offence are disturbing. The appellant was charged that at about 4.30pm on 20 December 2015 at Homebush West he did drive a motor vehicle, AH 85 YH, on a road, namely Tavistock Road, whilst there was present in his breath or blood a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. The reading recorded was 0.254. About that time on Sunday 20 December 2015 the appellant was driving his green Toyota Avalon sedan registered number AH 85 YH in an easterly direction along Tavistock Road in Homebush West. About 16 metres west of the intersection of Tavistock Road and Hampstead Road the appellant caused his vehicle to collide with the offside passenger and driver’s door of a parked unoccupied blue Holden Barina. The blue Holden Barina sustained moderate damage to both offside doors.
	
	
	Despite colliding with the blue Holden Barina, the appellant continued to drive his green Toyota Avalon in the same easterly direction for a further 30 metres on Tavistock Road. At that point his vehicle collided with the offside doors of another parked and unoccupied vehicle, a silver Toyota Kluger. That vehicle sustained major damage to the rear offside door and moderate damage to the driver’s door.
	
	
	Despite colliding with the silver Toyota Kluger, the appellant continued to drive in an easterly direction along Tavistock Road for a further ten metres when he collided with the rear of a parked white Mazda CX7. At the time of the collision the white Mazda CX7 was occupied by its driver, another passenger and a four month old infant. As a result of that collision the white Mazda CX7 sustained moderate damage to its bumper bar.
	
	
	Despite colliding with the white Mazda CX7 the appellant continued to drive his green Toyota Avalon in the easterly direction for a further 20 metres where he reached the intersection of Tavistock Road and Hampstead Road. At that intersection the appellant turned left into Hampstead Road. By this time the driver of the white Mazda CX7 had taken off in pursuit of the appellant’s vehicle. The white Mazda CX7 caught up with the green Toyota Avalon only when the green Toyota Avalon slowly came to a halt, being unable to continue further because of damage sustained in the three collisions in which it had been involved.
	
	
	The driver of the white Mazda CX7 stopped his vehicle behind the appellant’s vehicle about 20 metres north of the intersection of Tavistock and Hampstead Roads. The driver of the white Mazda CX7 alighted from his vehicle and ran to the appellant’s vehicle where he removed the car keys from the ignition and asked the appellant to get out of his car. The driver of the white Mazda CX7 then called the police. A short time later the police attended the scene and spoke with the driver of the white Mazda CX7 and with the appellant. The appellant was unsteady on his feet and claimed to have no understanding of the English language. He provided to the police a Sri Lankan driver’s licence in his name. The police by their inquiries ascertained that the green Toyota Avalon was registered to the appellant. A bystander who spoke the Tamil language offered assistance and, using that person as an interpreter, police arrested the appellant and took him to Auburn Police Station for the purpose of undergoing breath analysis. The breath analysis returned the reading of 0.254 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath.
	
	
	The collisions in question all happened in the suburb of Homebush West which was the suburb in which the appellant resided. The police in question were from the Flemington Police Station. The appellant was then taken to a local hospital by the police, having been “scheduled” by them on account of his expressing suicidal ideation. There is a two page computer generated note made at the local hospital. That records that the appellant was a 45 year old man who presented both with suicidal ideation and intoxication. The further history goes on to say this:
	


“Patient was brought in scheduled by police for suicidal ideation. Had four beers today and then drove on the road in his car, reports he had a car accident where his car hit into the curb. Denies any suicidal ideation at the time or currently. Breath tested an alcohol level 0.25.

Reports he has been depressed recently and has had 16 sessions with counsellor. Misses family who are overseas in Sri Lanka.

Nil other recent stressors reported.

Nil medical issues or injuries reported.

Medications nil regular.”

The note contains a social history. That recorded that the appellant lived alone, that his family were is Sri Lanka and that he was a “regular drinker” of alcohol. On examination, although the appellant was alert, he appeared to the examiner to be intoxicated. He was kept in the hospital overnight and in the following morning was reviewed by the Psychiatric Registrar. At that time he denied suicidal thought and denied any thoughts of harming anyone else and denied any thought of harming himself. He wished to go home and was allowed to do so.


	
	It ought to be obvious from what I have already said that the appellant was born in Sri Lanka. He is of Tamil ethnic origin. In evidence is a report dated 3 May 2016 from Ms Rebecca Kortge, a clinical psychologist. That report was clearly not before the Local Court. It contains a fairly lengthy history. However there are some inconsistencies in that history. The appellant was born on 22 February 1970 in Trincomalee in the eastern province of Sri Lanka. He was the fifth of eight siblings. His father was a farmer. He had a very close relationship with each of his parents but his father died, unfortunately, on 8 August 2015. The appellant lived in Trincomalee with his family for 16 years until 1986. He then went to live in the Vanni area in the northern province of Sri Lanka between 1986 and 1990. In 1990 he returned to Trincomalee. In that same year he married his wife in Trincomalee.
	
	
	The psychologist’s history continues thus:
	


“He told me there were ‘problems when we got married’ as his wife was from ‘a different [ie lower, fishing] caste’, so his mother was ‘angry’. He indicated these problems had since been resolved, such that ‘my wife visits my mother once a month’, despite her own mental health issues. He reported his wife was a nurse for 15 years until she was deemed ‘medically unfit’ for work as a result of her nerve dysfunction”.


	
	In Trincomalee the appellant had ten years education. He stopped his education in order to move to the Vanni area, that move being due to the civil conflict between the Sri Lankan army and the Tamil separatists in northern Sri Lanka. The appellant was able to return to Trincomalee with the advent of an Indian peace-keeping force. The history then tells me that the appellant returned to the Vanni area from mid-1990 to 2006 where he was a farmer. However, when the conflict between the Sri Lankan army and the Tamil separatists worsened, it was necessary for the appellant to go into hiding between 2006 and 2009. However, further on the same page of the same report, it is stated that the appellant was in hiding not between 2006 and 2009 but between 2001 and 2009, a period of nine years. The conflict in history cannot be determined because the appellant chose not to give any evidence.
	
	
	The conflict stopped in 2009 and the appellant was then imprisoned by the Sri Lankan army. The appellant referred to that change in status as a kidnapping. According to the appellant, he was tortured and sustained serious personal injuries whilst in the Sri Lankan army camp and he escaped in August 2009. He then moved to Colombo and stayed with his wife and mother‑in‑law until 29 August 2009.
	
	
	On that day he left Sri Lanka travelling by aeroplane to Malaysia, but, as he did not have a visa to enter that country, he then travelled to Thailand. Subsequently he travelled from Thailand to Malaysia again by aeroplane. He lived in Malaysia for one year in 2010 and then travelled to Indonesia by aeroplane living there for nine months in 2011. He then attempted to travel by boat to Australia in December 2011. According to the history given by the appellant to the psychologist, the appellant was on the boat for two days and was within 90 kilometres of mainland Australia when the Royal Australian Navy intervened and towed the boat back to Christmas Island. The appellant was then detained on Christmas Island for 16 days before being transferred to an immigration transit accommodation centre in Brisbane.
	
	
	The history tells me that the appellant was found to be a refugee by the Refugee Review Tribunal in September 2012 but the appellant has not been granted any permanent visa to reside in Australia. A decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 22 January 2016 was before the Local Court and is before me. That decision was in response to an application for review of a decision of 13 January 2016 made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration cancelling the appellant’s subclass 050(Bridging)(General) visa pursuant to s 116 of the Migration Act 1958 (Commonwealth). The Tribunal set aside that decision and substituted it with the decision not to cancel the same visa. Accordingly, the appellant was at the relevant time and remains on a bridging visa justifying his visits in this country. That bridging visa allowed the appellant to work. Up until the commission of the offence now in question the appellant was working as a cleaner. He was permitted to do so. He was remitting a part of his income to his family in Sri Lanka.
	
	
	There was a small amount of evidence of the state of health of the plaintiff’s eldest son and wife from Sri Lanka. There was a ‘Diagnosis Ticket’ for an admission to an institution between 3 January 2016 and 6 January 2016 for the appellant’s eldest son. He had made an attempt to take his own life. That is the allegation. However, the ‘Diagnosis Ticket’ tells me that there were no signs of depression, no need for treatment and no further follow up was required. In other words at the time the appellant’s eldest son was discharged from the institution he had no need for further psychiatric treatment. However it is to be noted that the period in question was after the offence now in question and during the period immediately prior to the revocation by the Minister of Immigration of the appellant’s visa.
	
	
	The other piece of medical evidence from Sri Lanka concerns the wife of the appellant. The document is dated 14 January 2016, and is from a female medical practitioner. The diagnosis offered by the medical certificate is ‘arthritis’ which is hardly a nerve dysfunction. According to the female medical practitioner from Sri Lanka she had been treating the appellant’s wife for two years prior to 14 January 2016.
	
	
	I turn now to the appellant’s mental health. He came under the care of Ms Rebecca Kortge, clinical psychologist, on 13 October 2014. The diagnoses offered by Ms Kortge are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a Major Depressive Disorder. It might have been more accurate for her to have diagnosed an episode of a Major Depressive Disorder. It is problematic as to whether the appellant was suffering from two psychiatric illnesses or only one which could fit into the diagnostic criteria of either PTSD or a Major Depressive Disorder. In any event, it is clear, and it is common ground between the appellant and the Crown, that at the time that the appellant committed the offences now in question he was suffering from the symptoms of either PTSD and/or Major Depressive Disorder. In other words he was suffering from a ‘mental illness’ within the meaning of s 32(1)(a)(ii) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. Furthermore, the diagnoses offered were not sufficient to categorise the appellant as being ‘mentally ill’ within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2007. In other words the appellant at the time he committed the offence now in question fell within s 32(1)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	The question which arises on this application is whether the appellant satisfies the requirements of s 32(1)(b) of the same Act. That requires that the appellant:
	


“on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law.”

If the appellant satisfies that provision then the Local Court and this Court on appeal from the Local Court may take the action set out in subs (2) and (3) of s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. It has been held that the seriousness of the offence is a relevant matter to be taken into account when determining whether to apply s 32. It has been held that the section involves a discretionary decision in which the Magistrate is permitted latitude as to the decision that might be made, a latitude confined only by the subject matter and the object of the Act. In essence the provision allows for treatment rather than punishment and the treatment can only be enforced by the Court for a period of six months. It is to be also noted that this Court, when exercising the primary jurisdiction of sentencing, and the Supreme Court, when exercising its primary role of sentencing have no power to deal with an offender pursuant to s 32. In other words, s 32 applies only to proceedings in the Local Court, obviously summary offences, and not matters which must be dealt with on indictment. That alone indicates that s 32 is not to be applied in serious matters and clearly supports the interpretation, which I have already cited, that the gravity of an offence is a matter to be taken into account.


	
	This offence occurred because the appellant drank a large amount of alcohol and then chose to drive his vehicle on a road. Is this offence in some way related to the appellant’s mental illness? The appellant, as I have stated did not give evidence in the Court below or in this Court. The only explanation for the appellant’s conduct proffered in the evidence before me is a history contained in Ms Kortge’s report of 3 May 2016. That report contains this history on p 11:
	


“I asked Mr Alagendram for clarification about what happened on 20 December 2015, and he told me that he had been at the market with friends and then to their home to commemorate a relative who had died by drowning in Sri Lanka. He reported receiving a call from his mother in law, who told him his wife’s legs had suddenly become senseless, and so she had been admitted to hospital. He told me that he did not have his Skype phone with him, so rushed away without telling his friends anything, so he could drive and call his wife on his Skype phone. He described being ‘blind in my mind’ and reflected his subsequent shock at his own behaviour, given he was usually the designated driver and always encouraged other people not to drive if they had been drinking. [He] reported his friends had also voiced confusion and shock as he was suddenly ‘so different’ and ‘panicked’.

Mr Alagendram reported he usually felt ‘dull, tired and low mood’ after receiving calls about his family’s situation, however that this time was different and thought this may have been as he was drinking.

Mr Alagendram reflected his sadness at his wife trying to protect him by asking her mother not to call him. However, her mother called him despite this advice, as she was worried he would become upset if she did not call him. He reported his wife had now been discharged from hospital, and was still attending regular treatment for her condition.”

As I have already pointed out the certificate from the female practitioner in Sri Lanka given after 20 December 2015 merely refers to a diagnosis of “arthritis” and does not say anything about a hospital admission on or about 20 December 2015.


	
	However, those who take alcohol can sometimes be taken unaware by some emergency and be tempted to drive whilst under the influence of alcohol. That is a risk which drinkers take. 20 December, a Sunday in 2015, was the Sunday prior to Christmas in Australia and is often a time when people attend Christmas parties and the like and there is friendship, merriment, family get‑togethers and the taking of food and drink, including alcohol, to create a happy time for those participating in a Christmas party. Someone could be attending a Christmas party, and drinking, with the intention of not driving home, but for example catching a cab or taking a lift with somebody else, or even walking home, but being given news of some emergency such as the sudden collapse of a parent, an injury to a child, an emergency at home such as the outbreak of fire or a burglary, and be tempted to attend to the emergency as quickly as possible. Here, on the history given by the appellant to Ms Kortge, he was attending what we might regard as a “wake” commemorating a relative who had died by drowning in Sri Lanka, and whilst commemorating this relative, received unexpected news and decided to drive home quickly to contact his wife on his Skype phone, risking the consequences of the fact that he had been drinking.
	
	
	As recorded in Magistrate Trad’s reasons, the appellant told the Local Court through his solicitor, Ms Elbaba, that he just wanted to get home, no matter what it took. There is no causal nexus, in my view, between the appellant’s mental condition or mental illness and the criminal conduct involved. The appellant took a grave risk. If those persons who were seated in the white Mazda CX7 had been injured, whether it were the driver, his passenger or the four‑month‑old infant, the question would be how long ought the full-time prison term be, and not whether he should be dealt with under s 32. If he had severely injured a passenger in a vehicle or, for example, a pedestrian whom he knocked down whilst driving with such a large amount of alcohol in his system, he would be facing a term of imprisonment of a number of years.
	
	
	The evidence about the plaintiff’s alcohol intake is also problematic. I note that the appellant told those at the hospital that he had consumed “four beers” on 20 May 2015. The Australian Government has issued from time-to-time a standard drink guide. That tells a drinker the amount of alcohol in usual servings of drink. For example, a full-strength beer has in a schooner glass 1.6 standard drinks, a can or 375 millilitre bottle of full-strength beer contains 1.5 standard drinks. The alcohol content of mid-strength beer and light‑strength beer is obviously less. However, if the appellant consumed four cans or 375 millilitre bottles of beer he would have consumed six standard drinks. To reach 0.05, the bottom of the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol, the authorities constantly advertise that one need only consume three standard drinks. Accordingly, six standard drinks, if consumed in one hour, would give a blood alcohol reading of 0.10. To reach a blood alcohol reading of 0.254 the appellant would have to have drunk at least 15 standard drinks of alcohol or ten cans or ten 375 millilitres of full-strength beer in one hour. In other words, the appellant’s blood alcohol reading indicates that he consumed a very large amount of alcohol. The exact amount cannot be ascertained without ascertaining the period over which the alcohol was consumed. The appellant gave this history of his alcohol consumption to Ms Kortge.
	


“Mr Alagenbrah did not report as significant history of drug or alcohol use. I asked Mr Alagenbrah about his usual drinking habits and he reported he did not drink much or regularly, as he did not drink at home or on his own. He clarified that he only drank socially, and rarely went out socially as he usually worked on weekends.

Mr Alagenbrah told me if he wasn’t working, he tended not to have the energy, time or finances to be in the mood to go out socially, let-alone drink.”

However that history must be contrasted with the history obtained at the hospital which was that he was a “regular drinker” of alcohol. A person who is but a social drinker of alcohol would find it difficult to stay awake with a blood alcohol reading of 0.254. That the appellant had such a high alcohol reading is consistent with his being a practiced, seasoned or experienced drinker.


	
	I therefore have gave difficulty in accepting the history concerning alcohol consumption contained in Ms Kortge’s report. I accept that in the hospital records reflect the true position that the appellant was a regular drinker of alcohol, that he was drinking heavily on 20 December 2015 and faced with a sudden emergency decided to take a course which was extremely ill advised.
	
	
	It is not suggested in the current case that the appellant took to drinking a large amount of alcohol, for example, to self-medicate because of the misery caused to him by the exigencies of his life and his concern about his family members in Sri Lanka or his concern about his being murdered were he to return to Sri Lanka. Rather the appellant went out drinking with friends to commemorate the death of a relative who died from natural causes, drowning, back in Sri Lanka. The drinking had nothing to do with the personal circumstances of the appellant. Putting the appellant on a treatment plan for a period of six months would do nothing to obviate the risk of the appellant’s offending again in the like manner. The treatment which he has been undergoing since September of 2014 is because of the vicissitudes of his life up until that time and trying to allow him to cope with his PTSD or a Major Depressive Disorder or both. That treatment was not dealing with the appellant’s alcohol intake nor poor decision making when under the influence of alcohol. Like the learned Magistrate below I am not satisfied that this is an appropriate case to apply s 32. The only thing that might be thought to be a “treatment plan” is the recommendation by Ms Kortge continue to attend upon her for treatment which is what the appellant wished to do in any event as he finds her treatment helpful and finds it helpful to talk and learn strategies to help him manage symptoms.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate pointed out that there was no particular treatment plan but did advert to that which I have just adverted to. In her reasons the Magistrate said this:
	


“Of course a serious offence, that circumstances itself will be one of the many factors that the Court will take into consideration in the weighing exercise which is well documented and referred to in the authorities and in particular from [Director of Public Prosecutions v] El Mawas [2006] NSW CA 154:(2006) 66 NSW LR93). It is a factor to take into consideration.

The test to be considered by the Court is what is in the interests of the community. Sometimes that coincides exactly with the wishes of the defendant. Sometimes the wishes of the defendant and the interests of the defendant is exactly the same thing, but not always, and particularly the nature of an offence to be taken into consideration, not so much that it is seriousness and therefore as a matter of principle would not be dealt with - that is not a principle recognised at law in matters of this nature. What it is, is what the type offence involved; what has occurred; and it is in the public interest that he be dealt with in accordance with the law or under s 32.”

A little later her Honour went on to say this:

“Getting home to somewhere in Sydney [,] it is unclear why that was going to make any particular difference other than impose a particular risk that he did in fact pose to other people using the road on the day in question. Now the main reason for me is that if someone cannot negotiate, cannot discern because of a particular level of distress, their inability and inappropriateness of being not only in a vehicle but in operation of that vehicle and to continue to drive in those circumstances is what in my view raises a particular concern. And in my view a disposal pursuant to s 32 and I address that issue because of the nature of the conduct that has occurred on this occasion as a result of the mental condition [is] one that has been as put directly or very specifically at risk members of the public, other road issues at this particular time in question.”


	
	The learned Magistrate did not act on any wrong principle. She clearly was concerned about the significance of the crime committed by the appellant. Furthermore close analysis shows that the crime committed by the appellant could have occurred if he had been born in Australia and was a happy man, living with his family, who had been to a Christmas party but panicked after he had drunk a large amount of alcohol. It had nothing to do with the vicissitudes of life which had befallen him in his native land or subsequently. It merely had to do with the fact he drank too much alcohol and then chose to drive in what he considered an emergency, but, whether there was a real emergency or not, is far from being established in my view. I, like the Magistrate do not accept that this is an appropriate case to deal with under s 32, both because of the severity of the crime and the fact that it is not explicable by the appellant’s mental illness, but should be dealt with according to law.
	
	
	The only complaint then made about the sentence is a technical one. The sentence imposed was a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for a period of two years, a minimum disqualification period of six months pursuant to s 211(1)(a) and the minimum interlock license period pursuant to s 211(1)(b) for a period of two years, and s 225 of the Road Transport Act was to apply.
	
	
	It ought to be clear from the facts that I have recited that the appellant’s car became undrivable on 20 December 2015. He has subsequently disposed of it. He has no intention of driving it again. Therefore the Magistrate ought to have imposed an interlock exemption order pursuant to s 212 and on the basis that the appellant no longer had access to a vehicle and ought to have imposed an appropriate disqualification period.
	
	
	I had thought to impose the automatic disqualification period of three years and mentioned that to Ms Elbaba yesterday afternoon at about 4.15pm. However, I failed to give her a Parker warning because under the orders made by the learned Magistrate, there was, in essence, a disqualification period of two years and six months but because there has been no Parker warning to increase the disqualification period to three years, would infringe the principle in Parker’s case.
	
	
	Accordingly, I intend, as requested, to set aside the mandatory interlock orders and to make an interlock exemption order and disqualify the appellant from driving for two years and six months. For those reasons I set aside the minimum initial disqualification period pursuant to s 211(1)(a) and the minimum interlock licence period pursuant to s 211(1)(b). In lieu thereof I make an interlock exemption order pursuant to s 212 on the basis that the appellant no longer has access to a motor vehicle. I disqualify the appellant from driving for a period of two years and six months. Section 225 of the Road Transport Act applies. Otherwise the appeal is dismissed.
	
	
	OLENDER: Your Honour because the appellant had already entered into the s 9 bond there’s no requirement for him to go to the Registry to enter into a new bond.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That is correct.
	
	
	OLENDER: As the bond will continue, I just wanted to say that as I mentioned to Mr Interpreter this morning that it maybe necessary to go over to the Registry but it’s not.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It’s not, no.
	
	
	SPEAKER: Because he has already signed s 9 bond in the Local Court.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Correct and I haven’t set it aside, so he’s still bound by it.

2834176,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Zaiter [2016] NSWCCA 247,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Joseph Zaiter was granted bail in the Supreme Court on 13 October 2016. On 19 October 2016 the Crown filed a detention application in this Court.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing of the application on 26 October 2016 the Court granted the application and refused bail. The following are my reasons for joining in the making of those orders.
	
	
	The respondent is charged with a number of offences of supplying cocaine and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime.
	


Alleged offences between 2 May and 16 October 2015 at Sydney


	
	The respondent is charged with knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of cocaine and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime between 2 May and 16 October 2015. The broad allegation is that in that period of time the respondent was involved in the supply of just over 2.6 kg of a prohibited drug and dealt with some $142,000 in cash which is alleged to have been the proceeds of drug supply activity.
	
	
	The police investigation involved the installation of audio and video surveillance devices in various hire cars that the respondent is alleged to have used within this period. According to the police statement of facts, on about 20 occasions within this period the respondent was seen to be involved in handling quantities of cocaine and sums of money which he concealed beneath the centre console of the vehicle. For example, on some occasions he was seen to retrieve a quantity of what was alleged to have been cocaine and leave the vehicle and then to return to the vehicle empty handed. On various occasions he was seen to produce bundles of money from his pants and store it underneath the centre console.
	
	
	On most of these occasions it is the police contention that the respondent supplied the cocaine to an unknown person. However, on one occasion he engaged in sexual activity with a woman in his car and then provided her with a small quantity of cocaine (0.25 grams). She subsequently made a statement to police confirming the supply to her of the cocaine. On another occasion he threw two bags of cocaine out of the car which police recovered and confirmed that it was in fact 0.26 grams of cocaine.
	
	
	The most significant supply is said to have occurred on 5 July 2015 where the respondent is alleged to have taken from the car quantities that are asserted to be half a kilogram and one kilogram of cocaine and leave and then return empty handed.
	
	
	In a conversation with an unknown male on 27 May 2015, which the police assert was in relation to the large scale supply of cocaine and the profits that were being made by the respondent, he was recorded as having said, ""I sell it for one eighty … I'm still making thirty grand on occas"". (""Occas"" is apparently common drug terminology for ounces.)
	
	
	The police facts assert that there are other recordings (that are not particularised in the statement of facts) that show the involvement of the respondent in the large scale supply of cocaine and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	The submissions by counsel for the respondent pointed out that the prosecution case was heavily dependent upon electronic surveillance evidence. There was speculation by police as to the substance being cocaine and as to quantities. It was submitted that the substance “was not cocaine but something else, perhaps powdered steroids”. As to the sums of money seen in the recordings, it was contended that the police had provided mere estimates of the amounts.
	
	
	The submissions did not suggest any innocent or alternative explanation for the respondent using various hire cars and being seen to be in possession of significant sums of money, including the police assertions that on 20 May 2015 he handed an unknown male three large bundles totalling about $50,000 in fifty dollar notes and that on 16 October 2015 he removed about $25,000 from his pants.
	
	
	At the hearing of the application on 26 October 2016 the Crown played to the Court an excerpt of the surveillance device recording of the incident on 5 July 2015 referred to above. In my perception, it bears out the assertion in the police facts that the respondent retrieved plastic-wrapped white rectangular thin block-like objects that had the appearance of compressed powder from underneath the centre console of the car and put them into a bag. He was careful to avoid his fingerprints being left on the objects by holding them within a cloth-type object in his hands.
	


Offence on 30 September 2015 at Wiley Park


	
	A specific offence separately charged but within the period covered by the above charges concerned an incident on 30 September 2015 when the respondent and Steven Sevastopoulos drove to a location in Wiley Park. An unknown male handed a bag to the respondent who was sitting on the passenger side of the car. The respondent and Sevastopoulos then concealed that bag underneath the centre console. Their car was later stopped on the M5 and searched by police.
	
	
	Prior to the police searching, the surveillance devices recorded the pair discussing what is described as a “cover story” for money concealed within the car. For example, the respondent is alleged to have said “if they do find the money … right … I’ll say it’s a friend of mine. I took [the hire car] up to my friend yesterday”. Sevastopoulos said, “what are we going to do … are we going to get pinched for this?” and the respondent replied, “I don’t know. There are two of us, so they can’t prove whose it is. It’s Eddie’s money anyway.” Police recovered a bag which contained $99,050. Both the respondent and Sevastopoulos denied knowledge of it. The police also seized an encrypted Blackberry phone, a Nokia mobile phone, and a TAB receipt for $7000. The respondent and Sevastopoulos were both released without charge pending further investigation.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent asserted in written submissions that his instructions were that this money was “lent to the applicant by a person named Eddie who specifically did not want the applicant to disclose the source of the monies. I am instructed that person is a well-known gambler who has received considerable recent media attention and scrutiny.”
	


Offences on 19 January 2016 at Manly


	
	At about 3pm on 19 January 2016, Sevastopoulos was seen to go to a café in North Sydney where he met with Kale Dempsey, who is described as being an associate of the respondent and Sevastopoulos. Dempsey provided a pink Telstra bag to Sevastopoulos who then drove to the respondent’s home in Manly. He entered the respondent’s home carrying an object which could not be identified by surveilling police. The police facts assert that the respondent was home but that is, apparently, disputed. Sevastopoulos left about an hour later carrying a brown bag. He caught a taxi but was pulled over at Mosman. The bag was searched and found to contain the pink Telstra bag in which there was 488 grams of cocaine in a “Foodsaver"" vacuum sealed bag. He was also in possession of an encrypted Blackberry phone.
	
	
	Police then executed a search warrant at the respondent’s home. The police facts assert that the respondent “was still at home”. They found 19.55 grams of cocaine in two bags behind a picture frame. They found a further 2.44 grams of cocaine in four bags hidden under a kitchen drawer. They also found a Sunbeam Foodsaver vacuum heat sealing machine in a cupboard above the refrigerator. A subsequent examination identified this machine as having been used to seal the 488 grams of cocaine that were found in Sevastopoulos’ possession at Mosman. The expertise of the police officer who carried out this examination is an issue.
	
	
	Police also found a set of electronic scales, 18 vials of steroids, and another encrypted Blackberry phone. Analysis at the Forensic and Analytical Science Service revealed DNA consistent with being the respondent’s on the packaging of cocaine found within his premises, on the electronic scales and on the “Sunbeam Foodsaver” machine.
	
	
	In written submissions, counsel for the respondent contended that the evidence suggested that the 488g of cocaine was supplied by Dempsey to Sevastopoulos and that the visit by the latter to the respondent's home could have been for any number of reasons, including the supply of the small quantities of cocaine later found there. This is obviously at odds with the assertion that the respondent was not home when Sevastopoulos attended.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was no DNA evidence linking the respondent to any of the packaging of the drug. DNA consistent with being that of Sevastopoulos was in fact found on the Telstra bag but none at all was detected on the Foodsaver vacuum sealed bag. It was also pointed out on the respondent’s behalf that there were no large sums of money found at the respondent's home.
	
	
	Evidence tendered in the respondent’s case included that his solicitor had been told that Sevastopoulos intended to rely upon a Carey defence (he was ""simply returning the drugs to their rightful owner""). Thus, it was submitted, given he was arrested when travelling away from Manly, the respondent could not have been the owner. Section 31 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) provides that the rules of evidence do not apply but the evidence as to Sevastopoulos’ intentions as to his plea and his defence is not at all soundly based.
	
	
	It was also contended that the steroids found at the respondent's home come in a powder form to which liquid is added for injection. Accordingly, the substance apparently seen in the respondent's possession on the various occasions between 20 May and 16 October 2015 could also have been steroids.
	


Proceeds of crime charges relating to accommodation expenses


	
	According to the police facts, the Australian Taxation Office has indicated that the respondent had not declared any legitimate income or filed income tax returns in at least the last five years. The police contend that his only income appears to be from drug supply and proceeds of crime.
	
	
	The applicant is charged with knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime between 19 April 2011 and 21 March 2013 at Sydney in that he paid $1150 per week rent on what is described as a “luxury apartment” at Manly; the total cost being $116,042.85.
	
	
	A further charge similarly arises in respect of rent the applicant paid on another “luxury apartment” in Manly between 29 November 2013 and 26 February 2015 whereby he paid at total sum of $69,928.55.
	
	
	Finally there is a further proceeds of crime offence alleged in respect of the rent of just under $7,000 per month paid by the respondent for the premises at which he was living at the time of his arrest going back to 6 February 2015 (approximately $77,000).
	
	
	It was indicated that the respondent intends to establish that all money suspected of being the proceeds of crime will be shown to be sourced from legitimate gambling activity. It is unnecessary to go into the scant detail; it suffices to say that the evidence presented to the Court in this application was far from persuasive as to the credibility of this claim.
	


Seriousness of the charges


	
	The majority of the offences charged against the respondent are of considerable seriousness. The most serious is the charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of cocaine between May and October 2015 for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. There is also the charge of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine being the 488 grams of cocaine found on 19 January 2016 whereby the maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. Significant standard non-parole periods are prescribed in respect of both of those offences.
	


Citation of judgments of the Supreme Court


	
	I pause to observe that in this case, and as seems to often occur, the parties have cited judgments of single judges of the Supreme Court presiding in the Common Law Division Bails List. It is important to recognise that such judgments do not often lay down anything of precedential value for “bail authorities” (as defined in the Bail Act).
	
	
	Many such judgments are delivered ex tempore. Some judges are more inclined as a matter of individual practice to publish judgments on the Caselaw website whereas others are not. Bail decisions involve a discretionary evaluative judgment on a variety of factors about which, and within limits, reasonable minds may differ. It does not follow that simply because a judgment is published it is more authoritative than others that are not.
	
	
	What I am saying should not be taken as any criticism of judges who do publish their judgments in the public domain. But it must be recognised that most of these judgments are very specifically directed to the facts and circumstances of the case at hand. It is useful for “bail authorities” to have examples of how particular factual circumstances have been considered by Supreme Court judges. But every bail application presents its own unique factual matrix.
	
	
	It should be kept very firmly in mind that the doctrine of precedent is concerned with decisions on points of law: see, for example, Fleming v White; Gamble v Hiles [1981] 2 NSWLR 719 at 725-6 (Street CJ); and R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 at [30] (Basten JA). A decision by a single judge of the Supreme Court regarding, for example, delay as a decisive factor in determining whether cause has been shown under s 16A of the Bail Act is no more than the view taken by that particular judge in the circumstances of the particular case at hand.
	


The need to show cause


	
	Sections 16A and 16B(1)(a) and (f) of the Bail Act have the effect that the respondent is required to show cause why his detention is not justified.
	
	
	If cause is shown, there is a need for the Court to assess any bail concerns: s 17. On that assessment, if it is determined that there are any unacceptable risks, bail must be refused: s 19. In making this assessment it is necessary to have regard to the various matters in s 18. Generally as to the approach to be taken, see Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83 at [14]-[26].
	


The respondent’s personal circumstances


	
	The respondent was born in 1975 and so he is now aged 41. He has a wife and two young children who have experienced a number of difficulties as a result of the respondent being taken into custody. In a letter placed before the Court, Ms Zaiter described the respondent as ""a very hands-on father"". One of the children is particularly suffering as a consequence of her father's absence and both are clearly distressed about it. Ms Zaiter herself is stressed and anxious. The respondent relied upon the hardship being experienced by his family as relevant to the grant of bail.
	
	
	The respondent has a criminal history that includes three matters of armed robbery and one of possessing a prohibited weapon dealt with at the Parramatta District Court on 4 April 1996 whereby he was imprisoned for 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 month.
	
	
	In January 2001 he was dealt with in the Local Court for a charge of possessing an unauthorised firearm whereby he received a two year good behaviour bond as well as a $2000 fine.
	
	
	On 3 July 2008 in the Sydney District Court the respondent was sentenced for a charge of supplying a prohibited drug to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months with effect from 3 July 2008. The facts of that offence were tendered before this Court and indicate that on 24 February 2005 the respondent and a co-offender were involved in the purchase of a bag of 249 grams of cocaine for $40,000 in a controlled undercover police operation. It is of some note that Mr Sevastopoulos acted as a broker between a police agent and the respondent and his co-offender.
	
	
	The respondent referred to the last matter to point out that he had been on conditional bail for three years prior to being sentenced and there was no suggestion of any breach.
	


Delay


	
	The Crown accepts that the jurisdiction of this court involves a de novo determination of the application: R v Kugor [2015] NSWCCA 14. Nevertheless it contended that it was an error by the primary judge to find that cause had been shown because of the anticipated delay until the respondent’s trial might be held. That was, it appears, the sole basis upon which his Honour found that cause was shown. The Crown contended that this is a relevant factor but not determinative by itself.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent accepted the evidence placed before the Court by the Crown which was to the effect a trial would likely be listed in the District Court sometime after June 2017. However, he contended that there was no certainty as to this. If, for example, committal to the District Court for trial was not imminent as the Crown expects, or if there was severance of any of the various charges, it could be that the matter would not be finalised until 2018. He submitted that such a delay was a substantial factor supporting his submission that bail should be allowed.
	
	
	There seems a reasonable prospect of a trial occurring in the third, or at worst fourth, quarter of 2017. Quite obviously that is a significant time since the respondent was refused bail on his arrest in January 2016. The delay until now has largely been a product of the time taken for the prosecution to compile and serve its brief of evidence but it has apparently been contributed to by the respondent changing his legal representation. There has otherwise been nothing that could be regarded as preventable or the fault of the prosecution. The prospective delay between committal and trial is unremarkable with the current heavy caseload pending in the District Court.
	
	
	The delay in this matter is concerning and is an important factor in the ultimate determination.
	


Strength of the prosecution case


	
	The Crown submitted that it has a strong case whereas the respondent contended otherwise. A major issue raised in submissions was the ability of the prosecution to establish in relation to the large commercial quantity offence that the substance the respondent was seen handling in the surveillance device recordings was in fact cocaine. On the limited materials available to this Court I would not regard the prosecution's circumstantial case as weak; it appears to be quite viable. The prospect of the Crown being successful in relying upon the respondent's previous cocaine supply offence as either tendency or coincidence evidence is impossible to assess at this point and I have not taken it into account.
	
	
	There was also a significant dispute about the strength of the case concerning the commercial quantity charge arising from the events of 19 January 2016. I would regard this case as stronger. In the absence of any credible alternative explanation for the attendance by Sevastopoulos at the respondent's home immediately after having received a substantial quantity of cocaine from an associate of the respondent and then leaving with the drug packaged in a way consistent with equipment on hand at the respondent's home, I would not regard this case as a weak one either.
	
	
	The proceeds of crime charges are significant as well. The alternative explanations sought to be advanced for the respondent's possession and expenditure of substantial sums of money when he had no regular legitimate income appear to be quite dubious.
	


Bail concerns


	
	The Crown contended that all four of the bail concerns listed in s 17(2) of the Bail Act applied: that the applicant would fail to appear; that he would commit a serious offence; that he would endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community; and that he would interfere with witnesses or evidence.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the respondent’s criminal history and referred to the fact that a significant period of fulltime custody would ensue inevitably if the respondent was convicted. In this regard the Crown particularly noted the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life applying to the large commercial quantity supply charge. This, it was contended, provided a very substantial incentive for the respondent to fail to appear in court.
	


Proposed bail conditions


	
	The respondent submitted that the conditions of bail he proposes, coupled with the other relevant matters, both established why his detention was not justified and allayed any of the bail concerns raised by the Crown. The conditions include a curfew, frequent reporting to police, and the lodgement of security by two acceptable persons in the total sum of $1,450,000.
	
	
	These are no doubt very onerous conditions and the lodgement of such a substantial surety is significant in the context of the Crown's concern about the prospect of the respondent failing to appear at his trial.
	


Determination


	
	The Crown did not specifically address each of the bail concerns it raised. In my view the most pertinent for consideration in this case is the risk of the respondent not attending court when required due to the gravity of the charges and the likely outcome if convicted. There is also some force in the suggestion that the applicant presents a risk of further serious offending and that would obviously be a concern about further drug supply offences given the persistent nature of what is alleged in the present charges and the history of the respondent having a prior conviction for a relatively serious example of such an offence.
	
	
	If the current allegations are to be accepted, it would seem that service of a previous term of imprisonment has not deterred him. Equally, having had the $99,050 seized by police in September 2015, the respondent allegedly continued about his drug supply activity similarly undeterred.
	
	
	A further matter of concern is the respondent's apparent access to large sums of money in the context of him not being in any apparent employment and not having filed a tax return for five or more years.
	
	
	If it became necessary to decide I would be of the view that, notwithstanding the very strict conditions of bail proposed, there are unacceptable risks of the respondent not appearing in court as required and of committing a further serious offence. But it does not get to that because I am of the view that the respondent has not put forward enough to show cause why, in the face of these very serious charges with a seemingly viable case against him, his continued detention is not justified.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the foregoing reasons I joined in the making of the following orders at the conclusion of the hearing:
	


1.   Detention application granted.

2.   Bail is refused.


	
	WILSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

Introduction
1       The appellant, Jeganathan Ramasamy, has appealed against the learned trial judge’s decision to convict him of two charges of criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) by a public servant under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The charges state that the appellant dishonestly misappropriated two “Apple iPad 2” devices (“the Two iPad 2s”), which had been entrusted to him in his capacity as the director of the Technology Department of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“the SDCF”) in September 2011, by
(a)     converting them to his own use by giving one of the Two iPad 2s to his daughter for her personal use; and
(b)     selling the other to his colleague for a sum of $200.
The appellant was sentenced to ten weeks’ imprisonment for each of the two charges, with both sentences to run concurrently. The trial judge’s grounds of decision are reported as 
Public Prosecutor v Jeganathan Ramasamy
 
[2016] SGDC 40
.
2       Both before the trial judge and on appeal, it is undisputed that the appellant received the Two iPad 2s from NCS Pte Ltd (“NCS”), a vendor of the SCDF, and that he had given one to his daughter and sold the other to his colleague, Mr Eric Yap Wee Teck (“Mr Yap”). At that time, Mr Yap was the senior director of Emergency Services in the SCDF.
[note: 1]
 What is in dispute is (a) whether the Two iPad 2s were the property of the SCDF which had been entrusted to the appellant or whether they were his personal property, a point which goes towards the 
actus reus
 of the offences; and (b) even assuming that the Two iPad 2s had indeed been so entrusted, whether the appellant had mistakenly believed that they were his personal property and thus did not have the requisite 
mens rea
 to commit the offences. On appeal, counsel for the appellant, Mr Sanjiv Rajan (“Mr Rajan”), focuses on the second issue. The crux of the defence is that the appellant and the relevant NCS staff were at the very least talking at cross-purposes, in relation to why the Two iPad 2s were procured and handed over to the appellant.
[note: 2]
 Mr Rajan submits that the trial judge erred in not finding that the appellant was labouring under the mistaken impression that the Two iPad 2s were purchased by the staff from NCS for the appellant for his personal use.
3       I shall proceed to set out the background facts to provide the necessary context before going into the parties’ arguments, summarising the trial judge’s decision and finally giving my decision. Unless otherwise specified, the facts in the next section are undisputed and are mostly extracted from the Statement of Agreed Facts.
[note: 3]
Background facts
4       The appellant was the director of the Technology Department of the SCDF from 1 August 2007 to 11 September 2012. In that capacity, the appellant’s job scope included, among other things, overseeing the implementation and maintenance of Info-Comm Technology (“ICT”) systems in the SCDF and evaluating new ICT systems to improve the SCDF’s operational and administrative processes.
[note: 4]
5       In February 2011, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (“IDA”), which has since been restructured to form the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), invited participants from the SCDF to enrol in a trial which involved the use of iPads within the standard operating environment, commonly referred to as “SOE” (“the IDA trial”).
[note: 5]
 The IDA trial was focused on providing the functionality of access to “SOE emails” through the use of Apple iPads. On the appellant’s directions, the SCDF registered for the trial.
[note: 6]
 A few months later, in July 2011, the SCDF raised an invitation to quote (“ITQ”) to invite vendors to put in bids for the supply of various equipment, including Apple iPad 2s, which were needed for the IDA trial. Two vendors, Genesis IT Services and New Vision Electronics, were successful in the ITQ and were each to supply two iPad 2s to the SCDF. There was some delay before the iPad 2s were delivered. On 22 September 2011, the appellant received an Apple iPad 2 installed with the relevant software for the IDA trial. This iPad 2 is neither the subject of either charge nor directly relevant to them, but I include a reference to it as well as some details on the IDA trial in this brief narrative as both parties have alluded to these aspects as part of their case.
6       On 7 September 2011, the appellant had a meeting (“the meeting”) on the premises of the SCDF with three staff members from NCS. This was a few weeks before he received the iPad 2 that was procured for the purpose of the IDA trial.
[note: 7]
 NCS, a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (“SingTel”), is a system integrator that develops software for its customers, one of which is the SCDF. The three staff members from NCS at the meeting were (a) the group general manager, Mr Wong Soon Nam (“Mr Wong”); (b) the director of Business Development, Ms Esther Goh Tok Mui (“Ms Goh”); and (c) the director of Integrated Solutions, Ms Tan Chien Mien (“Ms Tan”). I will refer to them collectively as “the NCS staff”. The meeting was arranged as NCS wanted to assure the SCDF that it would resolve a problem which had arisen in respect of a project that they were collaborating on.
[note: 8]
7       After the meeting, the parties went to the SCDF officers’ mess for a coffee break. While they were chatting, the appellant noticed that some of the NCS staff were using the Apple iPad 2. He was informed that they had bought the Apple iPad 2s using their NCS staff discount.
8       The Prosecution and the appellant dispute what transpired thereafter in the officers’ mess. The Prosecution’s case is that the parties reached an agreement that NCS would provide iPad 2s to the SCDF for the purpose of a trial concerning general mobility and applications that NCS would be rolling out in future for the SCDF. The appellant, on the other hand, asserts that there was no such agreement; instead, Mr Wong had agreed to see if there was a way he could help the appellant procure iPad 2s for his personal use.
9       On 8 September 2011, a day after the meeting, the appellant sent Mr Wong a text message stating “I am serious about the iPAD … Any good news”. Mr Wong replied, through a text message, “[c]ertainly. It is considered done. Esther [
ie
, Ms Goh] is arranging”.
10     A few days later, on 13 September 2011, the appellant sent a text message to NCS’s deputy director of Business Development, Mr Yee Siew Wai, Stanley (“Mr Yee”), asking him “[s]o when is the ipad2 coming … Pse note I will have to pay”. Mr Yee thereafter informed him on 15 September 2011 that the Two iPad 2s had arrived and delivered them to him in his office. The Prosecution and the appellant again put forward different accounts of what transpired when Mr Yee met the appellant to pass him the Two iPad 2s, but it seems to be common ground that the appellant had asked Mr Yee how much he needed to pay for the Two iPad 2s and was told to check with Mr Wong.
11     More than a week later, on 26 September 2011, the appellant and Mr Wong exchanged a series of text messages which both the Prosecution and the appellant place considerable emphasis on but in different ways. The series of text messages read as follows:
 
The appellant:
 
 
Friend, thank you for the F1 tickets. For the IPad2, can you tell me the amount I have to pay..
 
 
Mr Wong:
 
 
The iPad2 is meant for all the new mobile apps that we are rolling out for Scdf and for you to trial
 
 
Mr Wong:
 
 
So this is tool to facilitate testing
 
 
The appellant:
 
 
Noted…
 
12     The appellant says that he had simply replied “[n]oted” because he was in a meeting when he received Mr Wong’s messages.
[note: 9]
 The Prosecution, on the other hand, argues that such a reply was clearly sent in acknowledgement to what Mr Wong had conveyed – that the Two iPad 2s were for the purposes of trial.
13     The phone records show that Mr Wong called the appellant about four minutes after that series of text messages was exchanged.
[note: 10]
 According to the appellant, Mr Wong told him in this call to try out the Two iPad 2s before they discuss the price. The Prosecution does not accept this. Mr Wong initially gave evidence that he did not call the appellant but later said, when he was shown the call records, that he could not remember the contents of the phone call or the fact that it was made. That night, Mr Wong forwarded the same series of text messages to Ms Goh.
[note: 11]
14     Subsequently, the appellant gave one of the Two iPad 2s to his daughter for her use and sold the other to Mr Yap for $200.
15     The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“the CPIB”) began investigations into the alleged offences sometime in January 2012. Nearly two months later on 6 March 2012, NCS sent a letter to the SCDF making reference to the purported loan of the Two iPad 2s to the SCDF since 15 September 2011 and indicating that the purported trial that the Two iPad 2s were supposedly meant for had concluded.
[note: 12]
 It is undisputed that this was the first time that NCS had sent any official correspondence to the SCDF in respect of the Two iPad 2s.
The parties’ cases below
The Prosecution’s case 
16     The Prosecution’s case was that the Two iPad 2s were on loan from NCS for the purpose of a trial concerning general mobility and applications which NCS would roll out for the SCDF in future, and were entrusted to the appellant in his capacity as the director of the department. It submits that the appellant had dishonestly misappropriated them with full knowledge of this purpose.
17     Relying on the evidence of the NCS staff who had testified at trial, the Prosecution submitted that the NCS staff and the appellant reached an agreement during the meeting in the officers’ mess on 7 September 2011 that NCS would loan the Two iPad 2s to the SCDF for the purposes of a trial. It argued that as supported by the evidence given by Mr Yee,
[note: 13]
 this purpose was again told to the appellant by Mr Yee when he delivered the Two iPad 2s to him on 13 September 2011. It further argued that even if the appellant had for some reason been labouring under the wrong impression, the text messages sent by Mr Wong on 26 September 2011, which are set out at [11] above, must have made it absolutely clear to him that the Two iPad 2s were loaned to the SCDF for the purposes of a trial and were not sold to the appellant for his personal use. It argued that he could not have been mistaken from that point on. In this regard, the Prosecution also referred to the fact that Mr Wong had forwarded the series of text messages to Ms Goh that night, which on his evidence, was for the reason of keeping her in the loop on what he had communicated to the appellant about the purpose of the Two iPad 2s. The Prosecution submitted that this must mean that contrary to the appellant’s assertion (see [11] above), the appellant and Mr Wong did not say anything that detracted from the contents of the text messages in the subsequent phone conversation.
The appellant’s defence
18     The appellant’s defence was that the Two iPad 2s were meant for his personal purchase and thus neither the 
actus reus
 nor the 
mens rea
 of the offences was made out. His version of the events was that on 7 September 2011, while they were in the officers’ mess, he had a discussion with the NCS staff about purchasing iPad 2s for his personal use and Mr Wong had promised to check and get back to him. In the alternative, the appellant argued that at the very least, he had wrongly thought that the Two iPad 2s were for his personal purchase as he had been talking at cross-purposes with the NCS staff. He submitted that because of his mistaken state of mind, he did not have the 
mens rea
 to commit the offences even if the 
actus reus
 was made out.
19     In support of his defence, the appellant relied on the evidence of some of the Prosecution’s witnesses as well as objective evidence such as contemporaneous phone records and text messages. Starting with the meeting in the officers’ mess on 7 September 2011, the appellant pointed to Ms Tan’s evidence in cross-examination that the appellant had asked whether there was “any other means” to buy the iPad 2s after he was told that they could not obtain the iPad 2s for him using their staff discount.
[note: 14]
 Next, he referred to the text messages he sent the following day to Mr Wong in which he emphasised that he was serious about the iPad 2s and asked if there was any good news. He also relied heavily on his repeated attempts to enquire about the payment of the Two iPad 2s from Mr Wong or Mr Yee, many of which are supported by objective evidence in the form of text messages. The appellant further pointed out that NCS did not load any application into the Two iPad 2s which were delivered in mint condition and did not follow up on the Two iPad 2s in the three to four months from September 2011 to January 2012. He contended that these demonstrated that the Two iPad 2s were not provided for the SCDF’s official use or for trial.
[note: 15]
The decision below 
20     The trial judge convicted the appellant on both charges after a 12-day trial. He found that the Two iPad 2s were not the appellant’s personal property but had been entrusted to him by the SCDF for the purposes of a trial, and that he knew that they were entrusted for this purpose and was 
not
 labouring under any mistaken belief in dealing with them in the manner he did.
21     On the point of entrustment, the trial judge relied on four main points. First, he relied on the evidence of the NCS staff who were present at the discussion in the officers’ mess on 7 September 2011, namely Mr Wong, Ms Goh and Ms Tan. All three had testified that they did not recall that any one of them had agreed to look into the possibility of getting iPad 2s for the appellant’s personal purchase.
22     Second, the trial judge found the conduct of the parties, in particular the NCS staff, after the meeting to be consistent with the Prosecution’s case that the Two iPad 2s were on loan to the SCDF. He found the series of messages exchanged between Ms Wong and the appellant on 8 September 2011 to be, at best, a neutral piece of evidence, which was equally consistent with an understanding that the iPad 2s were urgently needed for the purpose of testing. The trial judge found the manner in which the NCS staff, specifically Ms Goh, had arranged for the purchase of the Two iPad 2s to be significant and telling. He noted that she had raised a requisition form within NCS and had stated on the form that the Two iPad 2s were for “customer testing”, which were steps consistent with an official purchase rather than a purchase by NCS on behalf of the appellant.
23     Third, the trial judge placed considerable emphasis on the text messages the appellant exchanged with Mr Wong on 26 September 2011. He held that it was clear from a plain reading of those text messages that the Two iPad 2s were meant for the trial of applications that NCS would eventually roll out for the SCDF. To his mind, the message conveyed in those text messages, in particular the words “this is tool for testing”, was “straightforward and unambiguous”. The trial judge rejected the appellant’s explanation of how he had understood the messages and why he had replied “noted”, discounting it as being “contorted and contrived”. He did not think that Mr Wong would have taken such liberty as to peremptorily dictate, in such specific terms no less, how the appellant was to use the Two iPad 2s, had they indeed been intended for his personal usage.
24     Fourth, the trial judge placed weight on the fact that the appellant’s case was inconsistent and irreconcilable with the account that the appellant had given to Mr Yap a day after the appellant was interviewed by the CPIB. Mr Yap had given evidence that the appellant had told him that he had approached NCS to request two iPad 2s for testing, and the two iPad 2s “became surplus” after they were delivered because Singtel had supplied him with two iPad 2s that he had earlier asked for (presumably for the IDA trial). The trial judge noted that the appellant did not seek to challenge Mr Yap’s recollection. Taking this in the light of the other evidence, the trial judge concluded that there was no doubt in his mind that the appellant had only formed the idea of purchasing the Two iPad 2s 
after
 they “became surplus” (
ie
, after the iPad 2s that were ordered for the purposes of the IDA trial arrived).
25     Having established that the appellant had been entrusted with the Two iPad 2s, the trial judge moved on to the issue of whether the appellant was under a mistaken belief that the Two iPad 2s were for his personal purchase. The trial judge noted that there was evidence that the appellant had asked for the price of the Two iPad 2s and had also expressed an intention to pay for them, but was satisfied that the appellant was not under any such mistaken belief notwithstanding those pieces of evidence. He noted the appellant’s account that the discussion on the iPad 2s at the meeting centred on the issue of personal purchase, but found that this was not corroborated by any of the others who were present. He also found the appellant’s indifference to the price and specifications of the Two iPad 2s to be inconsistent with the actions of a person who was buying the Two iPad 2s. Importantly, the trial judge found that 
even if
 the appellant had genuinely harboured some misunderstanding about the Two iPad 2s, no such misunderstanding could have been possible after the exchange of text messages he had with Mr Wong on 26 September 2011.
26     Finally, the trial judge was also of the view that the appellant’s credibility had been impugned by the numerous inconsistencies in the accounts that the appellant gave (a) in court; (b) to Mr Yap in January 2012; and (c) in his statement to the CPIB in January 2012.
Arguments on appeal
27     The parties’ cases on appeal are largely similar to their positions in the court below, save that the appellant appears to have elected to focus more on his alternative argument.
[note: 16]
 This argument is essentially that at the very least, even if NCS had supplied the Two iPad 2s to the SCDF for official reasons, he did not act dishonestly as he had always been under the impression, albeit a mistaken one, that the Two iPad 2s were for his personal purchase and use. Given that the appellant has adopted such an approach, I will correspondingly focus my analysis on the issue of 
mens rea
. Where necessary, I will elaborate on the arguments of the parties in my analysis below.
My decision
28     Having examined the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I am of the view that both the accounts of the Prosecution and the appellant are equally reasonable and plausible. It must necessarily follow that there is reasonable doubt that renders the conviction unsafe. I shall set out below my reasons for arriving at this conclusion.
29     I should state at the outset that I do not agree with the trial judge’s key finding that the appellant could not have had any mistaken belief that the Two iPad 2s were for his personal purchase because it had been made clear to him that they were meant to be loaned to the SCDF for the purposes of trial. In my assessment, and with respect, there is room for considerable doubt as to whether the parties might have at the very least been talking at cross-purposes. The appellant’s conduct and text messages up to, and including, the text messages he exchanged with Mr Wong on 26 September 2011 are, in my view, objectively capable of being understood as being consistent with his defence that he was under the impression that the Two iPad 2s were procured for his personal purchase.
The evidence of the NCS staff about the meeting
30     The evidence given by the NCS staff weighs largely against the appellant. Their unanimous testimonies were that an agreement had been reached after the meeting for NCS to supply the SCDF with iPad 2s for the purposes of trial. But it cannot be ignored that Ms Tan’s evidence at the very least corroborates the appellant’s account that he had asked whether they could help him purchase iPad 2s for his personal use.
[note: 17]
 She also testified that he had gone on to ask whether they could help him to purchase the iPad 2s for his personal use by other means
[note: 18]
 after they informed him that they were not able to obtain them at staff discount for him, but she was not able to recall how they had responded.
[note: 19]
The text message on 8 September 2011
31     Moving next to the text message that the appellant sent to Mr Wong the following day where he said “I am serious about the iPAD … Any good news” and Mr Wong replied “[c]ertainly. It is considered done. [Ms Goh] is arranging”, I agree with the trial judge that this should be regarded as a piece of neutral evidence that could support either case. Where we depart is that he thinks it is at 
best
 neutral while my view is that it is at 
least
 neutral.
32     In my view, the fact that the appellant had asked whether there was any “good news” and reiterated that he was serious about the iPad 2s could be understood as being more consistent with the appellant’s account that he was under the impression that Mr Wong would help him check if he could help him buy the iPad 2s and was thus following up. In fact, beyond the appellant’s state of mind, I find it difficult to understand why there would have been a need for the appellant to send such a message if, going by the Prosecution’s case, the NCS staff and the appellant had already reached an agreement the day before for NCS to provide the Two iPad 2s to the SCDF for trial. I did not find the Prosecution’s submission that by “good news”, the appellant was referring to whether the iPad 2s could be swiftly delivered to be persuasive. For one, this is not consistent with the account of the NCS staff, in particular Ms Goh, that the appellant was initially reluctant for iPad 2s to be introduced into the SCDF as he was concerned whether that might compromise cyber security.
[note: 20]
 There appears to be no reason why the appellant, who was initially reluctant and had to be persuaded, would suddenly want the iPad 2s to be urgently given to the SCDF. But I do not think it is necessary for me to come to a definitive finding on this issue. Ultimately, I am of the view that it is best to treat this text message as a neutral piece of evidence given that it is neither comprehensive nor unequivocal, and is capable of subjectively different interpretations.
Subsequent communication between the parties
33     The evidence that most strongly supports the appellant’s case and raises considerable doubt in my mind as to the guilt of the appellant is the fact that the appellant had made repeated attempts to pay for the Two iPad 2s. It is undisputed that the appellant had asked to make payment or asked about the price of the Two iPad 2s on the following occasions:
(a)     in his text message to Mr Yee on 13 September 2011 in which he asked “[s]o when is the ipad2 coming … Pse note I will have to pay” (see [10] above);
(b)     when he met Mr Yee on 15 September 2011 and asked Mr Yee how much he needed to pay for the Two iPad 2s and was told to check with Mr Wong (see [10] above); and
(c)     in his text message to Mr Wong on 26 September 2011, in which he asked Mr Wong to “tell [him] the amount [he has] to pay” (see [11] above).
34     The appellant argues that apart from these three instances, he had asked Mr Wong about the price of the Two iPad 2s on other occasions. He says that he spoke to Mr Wong over the phone on 16 September 2011 and had asked Mr Wong how much he needed to pay for them, to which Mr Wong replied that he would check and get back to him. He also asserts that he had followed up on the issue of payment over two phone calls with Mr Wong on 25 October 2011. The appellant also claims to have attempted to contact Mr Wong on several occasions from then till December 2011 but was unable to do so as Mr Wong was overseas. The Prosecution does not – and cannot – dispute that these calls, which are reflected in the phone records, had taken place. It contends, however, that the appellant did not speak to Mr Wong about the issue of payment during these conversations and relies on Mr Wong’s evidence for this argument. In the main, Mr Wong’s evidence is that he is unable to recall the contents of the conversations but nonetheless doubts that they had spoken about payment or he would have asked his staff to follow up on that.
35     Despite this being a rather contentious issue in the trial below, I do not think it is necessary for me to focus my attention on whether the appellant had indeed spoken to Mr Wong about the issue of payment on those “other occasions”. Of greater importance is the undisputed fact that he had asked about the price of the Two iPad 2s and to make payment not merely once but 
three times
 (as set out at [33] above). This sits uncomfortably with the Prosecution’s case. Had the Two iPad 2s been provided for official purposes for the SCDF, or more importantly had he known that they had been provided for such purposes, there would be no reason why he would have been concerned about the issue of payment. His conduct is more consistent with that of a person who was buying the Two iPad 2s for himself or who had 
thought
 that the Two iPad 2s were for his own purchase.
36     I am unable to find any satisfactory answer from the evidence or the submissions of the Prosecution that negates this key feature of the appellant’s defence. The Prosecution argues that his enquiries about payment are “not conclusive” about his genuine belief as they are contradicted by the evidence of the NCS staff that the agreement was that the Two iPad 2s were on loan to the SCDF. I do not find this persuasive. The evidence of the NCS staff represents 
their
 states of mind and may at best be a factor to take into account when assessing the 
appellant’s
 state of mind. Their evidence does not, however, conclusively negate the objective evidence that shows that the appellant had sought to make payment, which points to a different state of mind that he may have had.
37     Next, the Prosecution argues that the appellant’s behaviour was inconsistent with that of a person genuinely interested in buying the Two iPad 2s as he was indifferent to the colour, price or specifications of the Two iPad 2s. I do not find this argument convincing, especially in the light of the explanation given by the appellant. He said that he had been eager to get his hands on the iPad 2s as they had just been released and were hard to get on the open market; to my mind, this explanation is entirely reasonable.
38     The Prosecution’s strongest argument is that 
even if
 the court infers from the appellant’s attempts to pay that the appellant had such a mistaken belief, any such mistaken belief would have been corrected and could no longer have existed after Mr Yee allegedly told him on 15 September 2011 that the Two iPad 2s were meant for the SCDF to use for trial.
[note: 21]
 At the very latest, the appellant ought no longer be mistaken by 26 September 2011 when Mr Wong reiterated the purpose of the Two iPad 2s to him and he replied “noted” in acknowledgement.
[note: 22]
39     I am not persuaded by the Prosecution’s argument. There is no objective evidence to support Mr Yee’s account that he had indeed told the appellant that the Two iPad 2s were meant for trial when he delivered the Two iPad 2s. Further, there also exists incontrovertible evidence that the appellant still continued to ask Mr Wong about the price of the Two iPad 2s even 
after
 speaking to Mr Yee on 15 September 2011. On a separate but related note, I also note Mr Yee’s evidence that Ms Goh had replied “let [the appellant] check with [Mr Wong]”
[note: 23]
 when he returned to NCS and recounted to her that the appellant had asked him about payment. In my assessment, if Ms Goh had truly responded in this fashion to Mr Yee, 
ie
, to advise that the appellant should check with Mr Wong, it is plainly inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case. Had there been a clear agreement or understanding all along between the parties that the Two iPad 2s were meant for testing, it is curious that Ms Goh would have replied to Mr Yee’s query along those lines. Rather, it would have been only natural and logical for her to dismiss any query about payment. Indeed, one would imagine that she would have been perplexed as to why there was even any talk about payment.
40     I turn next to the series of text messages the appellant exchanged with Mr Wong on 26 September 2011. This is indisputably the most crucial piece of evidence against the appellant. The trial judge gave considerable weight to this aspectand found it to be almost decisive. To him, Mr Wong’s replies were couched in “very simple English”, and were “straightforward and unambiguous” in conveying that the iPad 2s were “for trial by SCDF”. The trial judge was of the view that Mr Wong’s replies were framed in peremptory language and in specific terms on how the appellant was to use the Two iPad 2s. To recapitulate, the text messages read as follows:
 
The appellant:
 
 
Friend, thank you for the F1 tickets. For the IPad2, can you tell me the amount I have to pay..
 
 
Mr Wong:
 
 
the iPad2 is meant for all the new mobile apps that we are rolling out for Scdf and for you to trial
 
 
Mr Wong:
 
 
So this is tool to facilitate testing.
 
 
The appellant:
 
 
Noted…
 
41     I accept that on its face, this brief exchange of text messages would appear to support the Prosecution’s case. But with great respect, I differ from the trial judge’s understanding of the meaning and cogency of these messages. I do not think that they can properly be considered to be conclusive evidence that renders the appellant’s case untenable.
42     Fundamentally, I do not agree that Mr Wong’s replies are “straightforward and unambiguous”. Text messages are what they are: short messages which can be grammatically incorrect and contain typographical errors. They are convenient short-cuts, or substitutes for actual conversation or full written correspondence. As a result, they can be fertile ground for miscommunication and consequent misinterpretation. Imprecise or ambiguous language used in such an exchange might well reflect that the parties are talking at cross-purposes. In the midst of Mr Rajan’s cross-examination of Mr Wong on this exchange of text messages, the trial judge commented that “people are not precise in their language when they communicate using [text messages] and WhatsApp”. This would seem to suggest that the trial judge had in fact acknowledged the real possibility of miscommunication arising from the exchange of short text messages. Yet despite his comments, the trial judge went on to chastise Mr Rajan for “trying to split hairs” and for “trying to put the blame on [Mr Wong] for not being precise”. With respect, the trial judge did not consider that there was room for doubt as to the meaning of these text messages.
43     Mr Wong’s replies are hardly a model of clarity or precision, and cannot be said to be unequivocal or complete. While he did say that the iPad 2 is meant for the SCDF “to trial” and later that it is “[a] tool to facilitate testing”, he did also say that the iPad 2 was meant for 
the appellant
 “to trial”. I find it exceedingly curious that Mr Wong seemed to have deliberately omitted addressing several details in his messages. Most tellingly, Mr Wong avoided directly answering the appellant’s query about payment. He could simply have said that no payment was expected, but he did not. He could have made reference to their alleged agreement at the meeting and expressly clarified that the Two iPad 2s were not for sale or for the appellant’s personal use, but he did not. He could also have expressed surprise or confusion at why the appellant was asking about payment, but he did not. This may be due to the informal, brief nature of text messages, or may be a deliberate choice made by Mr Wong not to make certain things clear for whatever reason.
44     The bottom line is that these messages do not encapsulate the entire communication between them and are shorn of context. While I agree that they might support the Prosecution’s case to a certain extent, I am quite unable to accept that they are strongly decisive or conclusive evidence that would point unambiguously towards the appellant’s guilty mind.
45     My conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the appellant and Mr Wong exchanged a phone call, which lasted about two minutes, almost immediately after the text messages were sent.
[note: 24]
 Mr Wong was the one who called the appellant. The appellant’s evidence is that Mr Wong had told him during this call to try out the Two iPad 2s first and then they could talk about the price later. Mr Wong initially testified that no such call took place. He later conceded that there was such a call when he was shown the phone records, but said that he could not remember the contents of the conversation. What was said in this immediate follow-up to the text messages – which most certainly took place even though the contents of the conversation are disputed – would likely have provided more context and could change how we view or interpret the text messages. This further illustrates how the text messages 
simpliciter
 cannot be taken to have encapsulated the entire exchange between the parties or be fully reflective of their states of mind. Taking this into account, the weight of the text messages in support of the Prosecution’s case and against the appellant’s case must correspondingly diminish.
Observations on other aspects of the evidence
46     Nonetheless, I agree with the trial judge that there are circumstances apart from the text messages on 26 September 2011 that cast doubt on the appellant’s case. These principally involve the inconsistencies between the case he has put forward and the account that he gave to Mr Yap when they met in January 2012, a day after the appellant was called in for investigations by the CPIB.
47     According to Mr Yap, the appellant explained to him that the SCDF was going to test a mobile mail system using iPads and he had asked SingTel to supply two iPads for testing. When he was later told that the iPads could not be supplied, he approached NCS and requested two iPad 2s 
for testing
. But subsequently, the Two iPad 2s provided by NCS became “surplus” after SingTel supplied him with the iPad 2s that were originally promised, and that was when he sold one to Mr Yap. The appellant did not challenge Mr Yap’s account (save for pointing out that the supplier of two of the iPad 2s for the IDA trial was New Vision Electronics and not SingTel) and in fact said that the account was “largely accurate”.
[note: 25]
 He simply argued that Mr Yap’s evidence should not have much bearing because he was not privy to the communications between the appellant and the NCS staff. This argument does not address the crux of the issue, which is that regardless of what Mr Yap knew or did not know, the appellant had told him a different account of why and how the Two iPad 2s were procured.
48     Further, it is also undisputed that the appellant informed Mr Yap that he had told the officers from the CPIB who interviewed him the day before that the purpose of the Two iPad 2s was for “a trial … on [his] mobile mail”. This contradicts the position he puts forward in the appeal, which is that he had believed that the Two iPad 2s were meant for his personal purchase. I did not find his explanation that “mobile mail” here refers to his personal “Yahoo” mail to be persuasive.
49     But at the same time, there is also other evidence, apart from the appellant’s repeated queries and attempts to make payment, that works against the Prosecution’s case. Importantly, I do not think that the actions of the appellant in passing one of the Two iPad 2s to his daughter and selling the other to Mr Yap point irresistibly to him having a dishonest intent. I am unable to comprehend why he would have done so if he had known either from the start or after Mr Wong’s text messages on 26 September 2011 that the Two iPad 2s were meant for the SCDF. In particular, selling an item that does not belong to you but to your organisation to a 
senior officer
 of your own organisation simply goes against the grain of logic and common sense. It is difficult to see why the appellant would have acted in such a brazenly cavalier and foolhardy manner even if he had wanted to take the liberty to pocket $200 – which is not, objectively speaking, a very large amount to be enriched by – or benefit his daughter. While it is certainly not necessary for the Prosecution to prove that an accused person had a motive to commit an offence before a charge is made out, the absence of a reasonable motive is still a relevant factor to take into account. In the present case, I cannot discern any plausible reason why the appellant would have dealt with the Two iPad 2s in the way he did had he truly been conscious that they were entrusted to him as the SCDF’s property.
50     The fact that NCS did not load any applications into the Two iPad 2s and more importantly, that there was no follow-up action from NCS in the three to four months from September 2011 to January 2012 is also inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case that NCS had provided them to the SCDF for testing. Ms Goh tried to explain this away by saying that she had to deliver the Two iPad 2s to the appellant urgently and thus did not have time to load the applications, and did not follow up with the SCDF on their supposed arrangement to develop applications because she was understaffed and was preoccupied with other projects that were given priority as they were of higher value.
[note: 26]
 I do not find these two explanations persuasive. I also find it troubling that NCS did not, and did not see any need, to properly document the “trial” arrangements until March 2012, which was after the CPIB investigations had begun.
51     Leaving aside the issue of 
mens rea
 of the offences which I have been focusing on, all the above aspects cast doubt on whether even the 
actus reus
 of entrustment is made out. The evidence raises doubt as to whether the Two iPad 2s were truly intended for the SCDF “to trial” or whether for whatever reason, NCS had simply procured them for 
the appellant’s
 personal “trial” or use, with or without an expectation of payment.
Conclusion
52     On a careful and considered evaluation of the evidence, I am drawn to conclude that both the Prosecution’s case and the appellant’s case have inconsistencies and gaps which cannot be fully reconciled with different parts of the evidence. This could mean that both cases are equally plausible or reasonable, or that they are equally not. It could also suggest that the whole truth of the matter lies somewhere in between or that some parties, for reasons which may be quite removed from the present charges before the court, may have chosen to remain inscrutable or possibly even not to have been wholly truthful at various points.
53     Ultimately, in a criminal case the burden is squarely on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In my judgment, the overall picture in this case does not point convincingly and squarely towards the appellant having the requisite dishonest intent to support a finding of guilt. While I am not fully convinced that the appellant was wholly truthful and that his case should be preferred 
in toto
 over that of the Prosecution’s, what matters is that ample doubt, which has crossed the threshold of “reasonable doubt”, has been raised. I therefore conclude that the conviction is unsafe. With respect, the trial judge erred in concluding otherwise against the weight of the evidence. The appeal against conviction is thus allowed, and the appellant is acquitted and discharged.

You have been convicted by the Jury of Conspiring to Pervert the Course of Justice. 
 
You, Alan Smith agreed to, and did, alter your original witness statement to remove the passage 
 
that you both realized could be used to support Tulisa Contostavlos’s case in an entrapment 
  
hearing. 
 
   
Mazher Mahmood, it was your idea, you were the intended beneficiary and you made use of a 
 
loyal employee in order to achieve your purpose. The motive was to preserve and enhance your 
reputation: You wanted another scalp. Miss Contostavlos’s conviction would achieve that, and to 
 
achieve it, you were prepared to deceive the Court. I have no doubt that it was your conduct in 
 
 
arranging the alteration of Smith’s statement, together with the, albeit unintended, consequences 
that flowed from it that ultimately lead to that case being stayed.
--------
To bolster your reputation you had instigated the prosecution by providing the evidence in the 
first place and then, when it suited you, you arranged for Smith to corrupt it. 
 
Any Perverting of Justice is serious, particularly of criminal justice, because it undermines the 
whole process, as happened here. Mazher Mahmood, because of your primary role in those 
proceedings, you were, in my view, in a position of considerable responsibility towards that 
Court, and that makes yours a bad example of the offence. I have also to take into account that 
 
you involved your co-defendant in what you wanted, and brought him, as a result, before a 
criminal court facing sentence. 
 
 
I have taken into account your previous good character and your mother’s health. I accept that in 
your career, you have done some good work in the past and the other matters urged on your 
behalf but, as you sensibly recognize, there is no basis or justification for suspending the 
 
inevitable prison sentence 
 
 
Alan Smith, you in my view, are in a different position. True, you played a crucial role in 
carrying out the conspiracy, but it was not your idea and you were not the beneficiary. You find 
 
yourself here principally because of misplaced loyalty. 
 
You have a number of previous convictions, but they were a long time ago and, other than, 
perhaps, explaining your lack of resistance when asked to act dishonestly, they have no other 
relevance. 
 
You are now 67 and retired. I have taken into consideration what is said about your health 
 I cannot ignore what you did, particularly as you could have refused to cooperate in playing 
 
your role, but, bearing in mind your age, health and subsidiary role, I am able properly to 
 
suspend the inevitable prison sentence.",2016-10-21 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Spencer 


Central Criminal Court 

Friday 21st October 2016 


 

 
1. Angela Whitworth, you may remain seated for the time being.  
 
2. I have to sentence you for the murder of your daughter Sarah. She was only 20 
months old when you deliberately smothered her to death on 15th May 2013 at your 
home in Bicester. You killed her because you believed the family court was not going 
to let you take her to Kenya to live with you there, but instead was going to let her 
reside with her father in this country. It was a thoroughly wicked and selfish act. For 
 
murder there is only one sentence, life imprisonment. That is the sentence I shall pass 
upon  you  shortly.  But  I  also  have  to  decide  what  minimum  term  you  must  serve 
before you are eligible even to be considered for release on parole. 
 
3. You are now 44 years of age. You were born and brought up in Kenya, in a caring 
and  loving  family,  from  a  distinguished  tribe,  although  you  experienced  the 
unhappiness of your parents eventually separating. In 1996 you came to the United 
Kingdom on a student visa and settled here. You embarked on training to be a nurse. 
You did not follow that through but you worked for many years as a care assistant.  
 

 

1
--------
4.  You  have  frankly  admitted  to  the  psychiatrists  who  examined  you  that  over  the 
years you were dishonest and manipulative in several ways, and had no compunction 
in  telling  serious  lies  when  it  suited  you.  When  your  visa  was  about  to  expire  you 
married John Whitworth in 2000 as a means of staying in this country, but it was a 
marriage in name only. You divorced in 2004. 
 
 
5. In 2006 you met Sarah’s father, Nabil Dahane on a dating site on the internet. He 
was a Moroccan national, 7 years younger than you. The relationship blossomed and 
 
you  were  married  in  2007.  You  lived  together  for  4  years  or  so  but  there  were 
difficulties in the marriage and no doubt there was fault on both sides. In 2010 you 
became pregnant. You had set your heart on motherhood for a long time. When Sarah 
was born on 17th September 2011 she was a much loved and much wanted child. It is 
quite clear however, that you developed an all consuming desire to take Sarah with 
you to Kenya to start a new life there. 
 
6.  As  a  result  there  were  proceedings  in  the  family  court  which  became  bitterly 
contested. In January 2012 Sarah’s father applied for contact and a prohibited steps 
order to prevent you from taking Sarah to live abroad. You applied to the family court 
for permission to remove her from the jurisdiction permanently so she could live with 
you  in  Kenya.  There  were  problems  over  contact.  You  were  required  to  surrender 
Sarah’s  passport.  In  November  2012  the  family  court  found  that  you  had  wrongly 
denied her father contact for a period of 3 weeks. There was naturally a concern that if 
you  were  permitted  to  take  Sarah  to  Kenya  with  you  permanently  you  would  not 
 
facilitate contact between father and daughter. 
 
7. The strains and stresses of this contest over Sarah’s future took their toll on you 
emotionally.  In  October  2012  you  saw  your  GP,  and  you  were  prescribed  an  anti-
depressant.  You  saw  him  again  in  November  and  January.  You  underwent  some 
cognitive behavioural therapy and seemed to be better. But there was a deterioration 
again and on 1st March 2013 the dosage of your anti-depressant was increased. That 
was the last time you saw your doctor. You stopped taking your medication, either 
because you did not want to or because you felt you did not need to take it.   
 

 

2
--------
8.  You  had  been  receiving  considerable  support  from  the  health  visitor,  Helen 
Parkinson. When she saw you on 21st February 2013 she noted that you were very 
distressed and angry with Sarah’s father and resentful that you were being prevented 
from going home to Kenya with Sarah. By now you had a new partner who was living 
over there. Helen Parkinson was concerned that you seemed so angry and asked you 
directly if you had any thoughts of harming yourself or Sarah. You said you had no 
such  thoughts  and  appeared  shocked  even  to  have  been  asked  this.  When  Helen 
Parkinson  saw  you  a  week  later  you  were  much  calmer.  You  gave  the  impression 
throughout of being a loving mother with your child’s best interests at heart. 
 
9. By early March 2013 Sarah was seeing her father for contact three days a week, 
including an overnight stay. It was no doubt galling for you that he had a new partner 
 
who lived in the same street as you. The final hearing in the family court to determine 
Sarah’s  future  was  due  to  take  place  on  17th  June  2013.  Sarah’s  interests  were 
 
represented independently by a guardian appointed by the court. Her report was filed 
on 14th May. It was sent to your solicitors. You had been awaiting it anxiously. The 
guardian’s view was that it was unlikely that you would facilitate contact in Kenya, 
no matter what steps were put in place and her recommendation was that a residence 
order  should  be  made  for  Sarah  to  be  cared  for  by  her  father.  She  was  settled  and 
thriving  in  this  country  and  the  loss  of  her  relationship  with  her  father  would  be 
detrimental  to  her.  If  on  the  other  hand  you  decided  to  stay  in  this  country,  the 
 
recommendation in the report was for a joint residence order. 
 
10.  That  report  was  e-mailed  to  you  by  your  solicitors  shortly  before  3pm  on  15th 
 
May. You telephoned your brother to help you read the report because your laptop 
was broken and you could not read it properly on your mobile phone. During that call 
 
your  brother  could  hear  Sarah  in  the  background.    Over  the  next  hour  there  was  a 
series of calls between yourself and your brother. He did his best to reassure you that 
all was not lost, and that the court would not necessarily take Sarah from you.  
 
11. The last call with your brother ended at 4.08pm. One minute later you telephoned 
Kenya Airways to book a flight to Kenya that night for yourself only. You could not 
have taken Sarah with you even if you had wanted to, because you had no passport for 
 
her.  The  call  was  recorded  and  I  have  listened  to  it.  Sarah  can  be  heard  in  the 

 

3
--------
background, so she was still alive at that stage, as you now accept. There is no trace of 
emotion  or  distress  in  your  voice,  even  though  you  were  about  to  murder  your 
 
daughter  and  were,  you  say,  planning  soon  to  kill  yourself  when  you  arrived  in 
Kenya. Adopting the description of one of the psychiatrists who has listened to the 
call, you sounded calm, logical, rational, organised, collected and in control. You also 
booked a return flight for 29th May, in fourteen days time, to avoid suspicion that you 
would be anything other than a visitor to Kenya.  
 
12. Sometime soon after the call, you killed Sarah. It is plain from the medical and 
scientific  evidence,  and  from  what  you  told  the  psychiatrists,  that  you  smothered 
 
Sarah to death by placing a black plastic bin bag over her head and holding it there 
until she stopped breathing. It would probably have taken 5 minutes or so for her to 
lose consciousness. There is no evidence of injury, although she would surely have 
struggled. She must have been terrified and bewildered in her last moments of life. 
You left her body lying among the bed clothes and made your escape.  You drove to 
Heathrow airport arriving at 6.30pm and caught the flight to Kenya. Evidence from 
passengers on the plane does not suggest you were showing any signs of emotional 
distress during the flight. 
 
13. Next morning you were supposed to have taken Sarah to meet her father outside 
Tesco’s  in  Bicester  at  9  a.m.  for  her  contact  visit.  In  fact  she  was  to  have  4  days 
staying contact with her father, the longest period ever.  He was naturally concerned 
when there was no sign of you or Sarah at the appointed time. He feared that you had 
 
abducted Sarah. He reported the matter to the police. Very soon afterwards the police 
received a call from your brother’s wife. You had phoned your brother a few minutes 
earlier from Kenya, to say you had arrived safely and that you had done something 
wrong  or  bad:  you  told  him  Sarah  was  dead.  The  police  went  to  your  house  in 
Bicester and found Sarah’s body. 
 
14. One can only imagine the desolation and distress Sarah’s father must have felt on 
discovering  that  his  beautiful  precious  daughter  was  dead,  at  the  hands  of  her  own 
mother. I have read his moving victim personal statement.  He has flown over from 
Morocco for today’s hearing. It is clear that Sarah was a delightful little girl, with her 
whole life stretching before her. However strongly you felt about the way the justice 

 

4
--------
system  was  likely  to  treat  you  when  the  custody  case  came  to  court,  you  knew 
 
perfectly well you had no right to end her life as you did. The consequences for her 
father have been devastating, both physically and emotionally. He has suffered post 
traumatic  depression.  He  was  unable  to  work  for  a  year  and  has  suffered  severe 
 
financial hardship. His life in this country fell apart, and he returned to Morocco. He 
cannot contemplate a new relationship and another child. 
 
15. You have told the psychiatrists that your intention was to kill Sarah and then to 
kill yourself, but that you wanted to die in Kenya hence the flight to Kenya that night. 
It is true that within two days of your arrival in Kenya you did administer noxious 
substances to yourself by drinking weedkiller and pesticide. A member of your family 
had killed himself in that way some months earlier. The chemicals made you ill but 
did not apparently endanger your life to any serious extent. You were discharged from 
 
hospital next day. I remain sceptical as to how genuine an attempt this was to take 
your own life, but that hospitalisation led your family to look after you closely. 
 
16.  You  soon  set  about  creating  a  new  life  for  yourself  in  Kenya,  and  you 
subsequently  moved  to  Uganda.  You  changed  your  name.  You  were  effectively  in 
 
hiding. I did not detect in the material before me any significant evidence of remorse 
over the period of 3 years before you were eventually arrested and extradited to the 
United Kingdom to face trial. I was therefore impressed by what you have said today 
through your counsel about the way you now feel about the pain and suffering you 
have  caused  to  Sarah’s  father,  and  all  the  family,  your  sense  of  self-loathing,    and 
your belief that you deserve to be sent to prison for ever and never released. The best 
evidence  of  your  remorse,  however,  is  that  to  your  great  credit  you  have  pleaded 
guilty to murder. Some defendants in your position might have sought to advance a 
partial  defence  of  diminished  responsibility  hoping  that  the  jury  would  convict  of 
manslaughter rather than murder. By contrast you have accepted full responsibility for 
your actions. You will receive maximum credit for your guilty plea.  
 
 
17. It is common ground that under schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the 
appropriate starting point for the minimum term for a murder of this kind is 15 years, 
which is equivalent to a 30 year determinate sentence. I have to consider and weigh 

 

5
--------
up  the  aggravating  and  mitigating  factors  in  order  decide  what  the  minimum  term 
 
should be. 
 
18. There are two very serious aggravating factors identified in paragraph 10 of the 
schedule. First, your daughter was particularly vulnerable because of her age. She was 
only 20 months old, and entirely dependent upon you. Second, to kill her as you did 
 
was  the  most  fundamental  abuse  of  trust.  It  was  a  complete  betrayal  of  your 
 
responsibility  as  her  mother.  Those  factors  require  a  significant  increase  from  the 
starting point. 
 
19. I have considered carefully to what extent there was planning or premeditation of 
this killing. Parliament has said that a significant degree of planning or premeditation 
will amount to an aggravating factor. It is plain from some of the material you had 
been  accessing  on  the  internet  in  the  previous  year  or  so  that  you  had  been 
considering  the  possibility  of  killing  yourself  and  your  child  if  the  custody  case 
ultimately went against you.  There was, however, no settled intention to do so at that 
 
stage,  of  that  I  am  sure.  I  am  satisfied  that  it  was  your  discovery  of  the 
recommendation  in  the  guardian’s  report  and  the  prospect,  as  you  saw  it,  of  losing 
Sarah if you returned to Kenya, which caused you to decide to kill her. 
 
20. You made that decision very swiftly but in a calm and calculating fashion. Sarah 
was still alive when you spoke to your brother and when you booked your flight. You 
had deliberated for quite some time that afternoon on what you were going to do and 
how  you  were  going  to  do  it,  and  escape  justice.  Whether  or  not  you  genuinely 
intended to kill yourself as well, I am driven to the conclusion that your attitude was 
 
that if you were not going to be able to have Sarah, no one would have her. That was 
an utterly wicked and selfish stance to take. Whatever cultural excuse you seek to put 
forward you are an intelligent woman who had lived for many years in this country 
 
and knew perfectly well what was acceptable and what was unacceptable behaviour 
by any civilised standards. 
 
21. I am prepared to accept that your behaviour was impulsive and out of character. 
 
You had no history of violence or abuse towards Sarah, or any other human being. I 
am also prepared to accept that the stress under which you had been living for several 

 

6
--------
months  as  the  family  court  litigation  unfolded  provides  some  explanation  for  your 
behaviour, but no excuse. You had been mildly depressed but not even so depressed 
as  to  need  to  seek  further  treatment  or  even  to  take  the  tablets  that  had  been 
prescribed. 
 
 
22.  I  have  considered  carefully  all  the  reports  from  the  psychiatrists,  and  from 
Professor  Mezey  and  Dr  McInerny  in  particular.  I  have  also  considered  the  report 
from the neuropsychologist, Dr Watts. There is a dispute between the psychiatrists as 
to whether you were suffering from an emotionally unstable personality disorder, with 
traits of an anti-social personality disorder, as Professor Mezey and Dr Watts contend. 
There is no need for me to reach a conclusion on that issue because I accept that to a 
degree  you  were  suffering  from  at  least  a  mild  mental  disorder,  described  by  Dr 
McInerny  as  an  adjustment  disorder  characterised  by  a  depressive  reaction  with 
accompanying  anxiety,  which  was  an  understandable  emotional  response  to 
considerable  stressors  at  the  time,  but  which  did  not  amount  to  a  serious  mental 
illness. It is not the label attached to the mental disorder which is important but the 
practical impact of the disorder on your behaviour that day and the extent to which it 
lowered your degree of culpability. I note the chaotic state of the house at the time, 
which  is  some  indication  of  the  mental  turmoil  you  had  been  going  through  in  the 
days leading up to the killing. Nevertheless, I am quite sure, and by your plea you 
accept, that you were in your right mind at the time and knew perfectly well what you 
were doing. Your ability to understand the nature of your conduct, to form a rational 
judgment,  and  to  exercise  self-control  was  not  substantially  impaired,  whatever  the 
classification of your mental disorder. 
 
23. I turn to the mitigating factors. Whilst I do not find there was a significant degree 
of planning or premeditation as an aggravating factor, equally I cannot find that there 
was a lack of premeditation such as to amount to a mitigating factor under paragraph 
11  of  the  schedule.  The  killing  was  not  a  wholly  impulsive  act  and  nor  was  your 
escape to Kenya. You went about it in a calculating and methodical way. The mental 
turmoil  to  which  I  have  referred,  amounting  to  a  mental  disorder,  does  afford  you 
 
some mitigation, but not a great deal having regard to all the circumstances I have 
 
outlined.  I  do  not  consider  that  this  can  properly  be  regarded  as  a  case  with  the 
mitigating factor that the offender was provoked, for example, by prolonged stress, in 

 

7
--------
a way falling short of a defence of provocation or loss of control. I note that you had 
made it clear to the health visitor back in February, when she specifically asked you 
whether  you  would  consider  harming  yourself  or  Sarah,  that  you  rejected  any  such 
notion.  You  knew  that  however  bad  the  stress  of  the  custody  battle  nothing  could 
justify taking your daughter’s life. 
 
24. For the same reason I reject the suggestion that it is a mitigating factor that you 
believed  the  murder  of  your  daughter  was  an  act  of  mercy.  There  are  very 
 
occasionally tragic cases where a parent genuinely cannot bear to see his or her child 
suffering  from  some  life-destroying  illness  or  disability  and  where  the  parent  has 
become convinced that it would truly be an act of mercy to end the child’s life. This is 
not such a case. Sarah was a fit and healthy child. She had a good relationship with 
her father. What you could not bear was the thought of her living with him rather than 
with you, when you believed that it was your entitlement to have her living with you 
come what may, regardless of Sarah’s best interests let alone the rights and wishes of 
her father. 
 
 
25.  I  take  into  account  your  otherwise  good  character.  I  take  into  account  your 
remorse. I give you full credit for your guilty plea, which in the case of murder cannot 
 
be  more  than  one-sixth  of  the  minimum  term,  in  accordance  with  the  Sentencing 
Council  guideline.  I  shall  also  deduct  from  the  minimum  term  to  be  served  the 
number of days you have spent in custody on remand, both in Uganda following your 
arrest on 9th March this year and in this country following your extradition. The total 
 
number of days is 227. 
 
26. I have taken into account everything your counsel has so eloquently said on your 
behalf,  both  in  his  written  submissions  and  in  his  oral  submissions  today.  I  have 
looked  at  and  taken  into  account  the  authorities  cited  to  me  and  quoted  in  Mr 
 
Morley’s sentencing note.  But each case turns on its facts and none can be regarded 
in any sense as a guideline case. 
 
27. Weighing and balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors, I have concluded 
that  the  appropriate  minimum  term,  before  credit  for  your  plea  and  time  spent  on 
 
remand would be 18 years. Giving you one-sixth credit for your plea, the minimum 

 

8
--------
term is reduced to 15 years which is the equivalent of a 30 year sentence, From that 
 
there will be deducted  the 227 days you have served on remand.  
 
Please stand up 
28.  Angela  Whitworth,  for  the  murder  of  your  daughter  I  sentence  you  to 
 
imprisonment for life. You will serve a minimum term of 15 years, less the 227 days 
you have served on remand since your arrest in Uganda. It will be for the parole board 
to decide whether and if so when to release you after you have served that minimum 
term. If and when you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of your life.

Sentencing remarks by Mr Justice Singh 

 

5 October 2016 

 
[The Defendant may remain seated for the time being.] 
 
 
Introduction 
 
1.	 

On 10 June 2016 the Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of murder.  His victims 
were Sian Blake, who was his partner and aged 43; and their two sons Zachary Blake-
Kent, who was aged 8, and Amon Blake-Kent, who was aged 4.   

The murders took place at some point during the night of 14-15 December 2015 at the 
family’s home in Erith, South East London.   

 
I  am  grateful  to  Lindell  Blake,  Sian  Blake’s  mother,  and  Cheryl  Golding  for  their 
victim  personal  statements.    They  both  speak  eloquently  to  the  impact  which  these 
deaths have had on the family and friends of Sian Blake.  Nothing I say can begin to 
compensate for their tragic loss but I offer them all my sincere sympathies.

Sian Blake was a successful actress and more recently had been doing work such as 
voiceovers  and  deaf  language  interpretation.    She  first  began  to  suffer  neurological 
symptoms in September 2013.  From June 2015 she was under the care of Mr Robert 
Hadden,  a  consultant  neurologist.  In  October  2015  the  most  likely  diagnosis  was 
motor neurone disease but further tests had to be conducted.  Mr Hadden last saw Sian 
 
Blake  on  Friday  11  December  2015.    He  confirmed  his  diagnosis,  prescribed 
 
medication  to  slow  the  progress  of  the  disease  and  referred  her  to  the  motor  nerve 
clinic.  To Mr Hadden she seemed distressed and depressed.  He took this to mean 
 
that she accepted that she had a terminal illness.  She was very weak and could hardly 
make  any  movements  with  her  hands.    Although  she  could  walk  unaided,  this  was 
slow and unsteady. 

It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  before  the  court  that  the  relationship  between  the 
Defendant and Sian Blake’s family was not good.  There was little, if any, contact 
between them by this time.

Neither  Zachary  nor  Amon  attended  formal  school.    They  were  educated  at  home. 
 
However, Sian Blake’s condition in 2015 led her to think about their future education. 
 
It is clear on the evidence before the court that she was contemplating that they would 
attend a school in Greenwich from April 2016.   

It is also clear from the evidence that Sian Blake continued in December 2015 to take 
an interest both in her work and in properties which she owned with her sister and 
which she let to tenants. 

In my view the evidence before the court is inconsistent with any suggestion that Sian 
Blake either wished to have her life terminated or agreed that the Defendant should 
take her life.  For the avoidance of doubt I should make it clear that, at the hearing 
before me, Mr Sturman QC, who has appeared on behalf of the Defendant, disavowed 
any such suggestion. 

The manner in which the Defendant killed his victims in this case was truly horrific. 
  
Although  the  murder  weapons  have  never  been  found,  the  evidence,  including  the 
pathology evidence, is consistent with his having killed each of his victims in turn, 
first  Sian  Blake  and  then  each  of  the  boys.   It  is  consistent  with  his  doing  so  with 
 
repeated blows with a blunt instrument, using severe force, and then by using a bladed 
weapon. 

Post mortem examination carried out on 6 January 2016 established that, in relation to 
Sian Blake, the cause of death was head and neck injuries.  There was evidence of 
 
blunt force trauma to the back left hand side of her head.  At least five blows were 
 
used.  Her skull was fractured.  The injuries to the head would have had the capacity 
at  least  to  render  her  unconscious  and  were  a  significant  contributor  to  her  death. 
  
There  was  also  a  deep  incised  wound  to  the  left  hand  side  of  her  neck,  involving 
numerous  blood  vessels  (including  the  left  jugular  vein),  and  also  cutting  into  the 
front of the larynx and cervical spine.  This had the capacity to be independently fatal. 
The  evidence  suggests  that  this  was  inflicted  after  the  blunt  force  injuries  were 
caused, since there is no evidence of blood inhalation.  There were no classic defence 
 
wounds but there were deep bruises over the arms and the back, suggesting gripping 
or some level of struggle.   

 

In  relation  to  Zachary,  the  cause  of  death  was  head  and  neck  injuries.   There  was 
evidence  of  blunt  force  trauma  to  the  back  left  hand  side  of  his  head.   There  were 
 
skull fractures and associated brain changes.  Multiple blows were used.  This would 
have  had  the  capacity  to  render  him  unconscious  at  least  and  could  independently 
have proved fatal.  There were also two major incised wounds to the throat, which 
together virtually encircled the neck, cutting deeply into the muscles.  Major blood 
vessels had been incised.  There was also a stab wound to the chest, which passed 
through  the  chest  cavity  and  diaphragm  into  the  liver.    All  of  the  incised  wounds 
 
appeared  to  be  bloodless,  suggesting  that  they  were  caused  at  or  just  after  death. 
 
There were injuries present at the top of his back, which suggests either a struggle or 
restraint, with those on the left shoulder being suggestive of fingertip gripping.   

In relation to Amon the cause of death was head injury.  Blunt force trauma had been 
applied to the back left hand side of his head.  The skull was fractured.  There were 
contusions  to  the  brain.  These  injuries  would  have  had  the  capacity  to  cause

unconsciousness at least and could independently have proved fatal.  There was also a 
stab wound to the back of the neck.  This was associated with a number injuries to the 
 
back  of  the  scalp  and  amounted  to  a  deep  penetrating  stab  wound,  which  passed 
through the base of the skull and into the cervical spine, damaging the cervical cord. 
This would have been an independently fatal injury.  There were no classic defence 
wounds.  There were marks consistent with gripping and what may have been struggle 
 
or  restraint,  although  these  were  less  marked  than  those  seen  on  the  bodies  of  the 
other two victims.   

 

The bodies were found buried in the garden of the family home on 5 January 2016. 
 
Each body had been individually wrapped in plastic material and sheeting.  Concrete 
slabs had been placed on top of them and then soil.  Attempts had been made to hide 
the fact that the soil had been disturbed. 

Sian Blake’s body was naked and drawn into a tight foetal position.  The boys’ bodies 
were also naked.  There was no sign of abuse. 

Detailed examination of the premises, including luminol examination, revealed blood 
staining in a number of rooms, which would not necessarily be visible to the naked 
eye.  There were signs of recent attempts to paint some of the walls with a paint roller. 
  
I  have  seen  photographs,  which  indicate  to  me  that  these  were  hurried  attempts  to 
cover something up rather than normal redecoration.   

On 16 December 2015, the Defendant appears to have removed all of the possessions 
 
of Ms Blake and the two boys, including their clothes, coats and shoes.  To this end he 
 
made contact with a charity furniture shop on that date.  At some point, the Defendant 
burnt various items in the garden of the family home. 

On the afternoon of 16 December the Defendant was visited by police officers.  He 
was uncooperative.  Eventually he let them into the house.  He told the officers that 
Sian Blake had been fed up with the tension between the Defendant and her family 
and that she had decided to go and see a friend in Cambridge with their children.   

The Defendant then made arrangements to leave the UK for Ghana.  In this context he 
took  Sian  Blake’s  mobile  phone.    He  used  that  phone  to  send  some  messages 
pretending to be Sian Blake.  The phone would also connect to the network via GPRS 
and would therefore give the impression that Sian Blake was still alive and that she 
 
was the person who was travelling around. 

On 16 December 2015 at 10.23am a text message was sent from Sian Blake’s phone 
 
to her sister Ava, which said: 

“Hi  Ava  I  am  taking  time  to  myself  and  my  children  without  constant 
opinions from family and friends.  Opinions that upset me and then upset 
my children.  Nobody knows what I am going through and regardless of 
all the comments, no one can cure me.  I have had enough of appeasing 
everyone.  We are away and I will not be calling or speaking to anyone for 
a few months.” 

Of course, by that time, Sian Blake was in fact dead.

Relevant legislation 
 
21.	 

The mandatory sentence for murder is one of life imprisonment.  I must then consider 
 
the starting points which have been set out by Parliament in Sch. 21 to the Criminal 
Justice Act 2003.  It is common ground in this case that the only two starting points 
 
which are potentially relevant are those set out in paras. 4 and 5 of that schedule.   

“(1) 

Para. 4 provides: 
If – 
 
(a)  the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the 
combination  of  the  offence  and  one  or  more  offences 
associated with it) is exceptionally high, and 

(b) the  offender  was  aged  21  or  over  when  he  committed  the 
 

 

Para. 5 provides: 

“(1) 

If – 
 
(a)  the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) but the court considers 
that  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  (or  the  combination  of  the 
offence and one or more offences associated with it) is particularly 
high, and 

(b) the offender was aged 18 or over when he committed the offence, 

 

the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 
30 years. 
 

(2)	  Cases  that  (if  not  falling  within  paragraph  4(1))  would  normally  fall 

 

within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include -

 

… 
(f) the murder of two or more persons …” 

Having chosen a starting point, the court should take into account any aggravating or 
mitigating  factors,  to  the  extent  that  it  has  not  allowed  for  them  in  its  choice  of 
starting point:  see para. 8.  Detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors 
 
may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the 
making of a whole life order:  see para. 9. 

4
 

offence, 

include – 

 

 

 

the appropriate starting point is a whole life order. 
(2)	  Cases  that  would  normally  fall  within  sub-paragraph  (1)(a) 

 

(a)  the  murder  of  two  or  more  persons,  where  each  murder 

 

involves any of the following – 

(i) a substantial degree of premeditation or planning …” 

 
 
22.	 

 
 
 
23.	 

 
 
 
24.
--------
25.	 

 
I  will  refer  to  the  provisions  of  paras.  10  and  11  when  I  return  to  the  facts  later. 
However, I note at this stage that, as was common ground, those provisions are not 
 
exhaustive of aggravating and mitigating factors. 
 

 
 
Relevant principles 
 
 
26.	 

The relevant legal framework was common ground at the hearing before me.  It was 
set out in detail at paras. 2-18 of the note on sentence dated 20 September 2016 by the 
Prosecution,  with  which  the  Defence  agreed  in  their  response  dated  27  September 
2016, at para. 2.  It is therefore unnecessary to set out that framework at length here, 
although  I  have  had  full  regard  to  it.    Many  of  the  authorities  to  which  both  the 
Prosecution and the Defence have drawn my attention were recently summarised by 
 
the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in Wadkin and Gomez v R [2016] EWCA 
Crim 1047, in which I gave the judgment of the court.  In particular it was said at 
para. 21: 

“In R v Reynolds [2015] 1 Cr App R (S) 24 the judgment of this court 
was  given  by  Lord  Thomas  CJ.    At  para.  5  the  court  said  that  it  was 
 
necessary to refer briefly to the decisions of this court in R v Jones (Neil) 
[2006] 2 Cr App R (S) 19, where this court (in a judgment given by Lord 
Phillips  CJ)  gave  guidance  as  to  the  application  of  Sch.  21;  and  R  v 
Oakes [2013] 2 Cr App R (S) 22, where this court gave further guidance 
in a judgment given by Lord Judge CJ.  The court continued: 

“Even though the assistance given in those decisions will be 
 
considered  by  a  judge  before  determining  whether  a  whole 
life order is required, we would simply emphasise four points. 

 
i)	 

The guidance given in Sch. 21 is provided to assist 
the  judge  to  determine  the  appropriate  sentence. 
 
The  judge  must  have  regard  to  the  guidance  but 
each  case  will  depend  critically  on  its  particular 
facts.  See Jones at [6]. 

 

ii)	  Where  a  whole  life  order  is  called  for,  often, 
perhaps  usually,  the  case  will  not  be  on  the 
borderline;  the  facts  will  leave  the  judge  in  no 
doubt that the defendant must be kept in prison for 
the rest of his life:  see Jones at [10]. 

 

iii)	  The  court  should  consider  the  fact  that  the 
defendant  has  pleaded  guilty  to  murder  when 
deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole 
life term:  see Jones at [15].  The Guideline of the 
Sentencing Guidelines Council which states (in its 
2007  Revision)  at  para.  6.6.1  ‘where  a  Court 
determines  that  there  should  be  a  whole  life 
 
minimum  term,  there  will  be  no  reduction  for  a 
guilty  plea’,  must  be  read  along  with 
the 
observations in Jones. 

 

5
--------
iv)	  The  whole  life  order  is  reserved  for  the  few 
exceptionally  serious  cases  where,  after  reflecting 
on  all  the  features  of  aggravation  and  mitigation, 
the  judge  is  satisfied  that  the  element  of  just 
punishment requires the imposition of a whole life 
order:  see Oakes at [29].” 

 
 

The factual issues as between the parties 
 
 
27.	 

Normally there would be a written basis of plea where there has been a guilty plea, 
unless the Defendant accepts in its entirety the Prosecution version of events.  There 
is  no  such  agreed  basis  of  plea  in  the  present  case.  However,  it  has  not  been 
necessary for there to be a Newton hearing.  The Prosecution filed a detailed note for 
opening  dated  2  October  2016.    The  Prosecution  and  Defence  submitted  a  joint 
document dated 13 September 2016, which sets out the limited extent to which the 
facts  are  in  dispute  between  the  parties.    The  Defence  accepted  that  many  of  the 
 
“disputes” are in fact immaterial to sentence and that any submissions could be made 
on  the  face  of  the  papers  in  this  case.    Furthermore  the  Defendant  acknowledges, 
through  that  note,  that  the  court  may  well  choose  to  reject  his  account,  not  least 
because the decision was taken that no evidence would be called for the Defence. 
Of significance in my judgment is the following concession made by the Defence at 
para. 2(d) of the joint note: 

“It is accepted that death in the manner it was inflicted, and at the time it 
 
was  caused,  had  never  been  discussed.    This  is  a  guilty  plea  to  triple 
murder,  it  is  accepted  that  this  is  not  a  suicide  pact,  and  that  the  boys 
could not and did not consent to dying.” 
 

 

 
 
 
29.	  While I accept that there is evidence before the court that Sian Blake was depressed, 
in  particular  after  learning  of  her  terminal  diagnosis  in  December  2015,  as  I  have 
already indicated, she was planning for the months ahead both in relation to her own 
interests and in relation to the boys’ education. 

Furthermore, although the Defendant is adamant that he intended to take his own life 
 
after he had killed the others, but that his “courage” failed him, I do not accept that 
contention.  In my judgment it is inconsistent with the actions of the Defendant, in 
particular in the time immediately after the murders and in the subsequent months.   

 
28.	 

 
 
30.	 

 
 
32.	 

 

 
 
Psychiatric evidence 
 
 
31.	 

The court has before it a report by Dr Philip Joseph, a consultant forensic psychiatrist. 
 
Dr Joseph was instructed by the Defence although he has prepared his report having 
in mind that his overriding duty is to the court.  

Dr  Joseph  conducted  an  interview  with  the  Defendant,  at  which  he  asked  the 
 
Defendant to describe his state of mind which led to his decision that the only solution 
was to kill Sian Blake, the children and then himself.  His reply, as recorded at para. 
26 of the report, was as follows: 

6
--------
33.	 

 
 
 
34.	 

 
 
 
35.	 

“I was losing hope.  I find it very difficult to explain what I was thinking.  
In the week before the killings I believe there was something mentally 
wrong with me.  I was depressed and angry at the situation.  I had tried so 
hard  and  the  children  were  keeping  me  going.    My  composure  was 
breaking down, the ability to bottle my feelings up was going.  I had not 
made a plan of what to do or when to do it.” 

 

Turning  to  the  events  of  the  night  of  14  December  2015,  the  Defendant  gave  this 
 
account to Dr Joseph, as recorded at para. 32 of his report: 

“Something just snapped in me.  Everything came out, feelings of anger 
and  depression  and  the  unfairness  of  the  situation.    I  was  tired  and 
emotional and in turmoil about what her family were doing to her.  I felt 
as if I had just been pushed off a diving board and was falling.  I grabbed 
 
hold of a small axe that was kept on a ledge in the kitchen.  Sian’s head 
 
was  bent  low  down  and  she  was  bent  over  looking  at  the  floor.    I 
approached her from the side and hit her at the back of her head as hard 
 
as I could and she fell unconscious after the first blow.  After that I hit 
her repeatedly on the head.  My mind was blank and I was focusing on 
doing and not thinking.  It was like I was there but not there.” 

As Dr Joseph notes at para. 33: 

“I asked the Defendant when he started attacking Sian if it was also in his 
 
mind that he would kill the children and then himself.  He thought about 
 
this and said it must have been in his mind.  He then went into the rooms 
 
of Zachary and then Amon, they were both asleep and he attacked them 
with the axe with the intention of killing them as quickly as possible.  He 
 
would not have been able to attack them if they had not been asleep and 
neither child woke up.  He then picked up Amon and put him in Zac’s 
room, and then brought Sian into the same room.  He went to get a knife 
from the kitchen and cut their throats to ensure that they were dead.  The 
 
Defendant told me that he realised he was doing something wrong and 
illegal when he killed the three of them.” 

At para. 34 Dr Joseph records that the Defendant told him “that his plan was to then 
 
kill himself with the same knife.”  However, he just stood there and did not do so. 
“Although he still had the knife, he felt all the power had drained from him and he no 
longer had the willpower to kill himself.”  The Defendant said that he decided instead 
to  return  to  Ghana  and  kill  himself  there.    As  I  have  already  mentioned,  I  do  not 
accept that account by the Defendant.  My view is reinforced by what Dr Joseph states 
in his conclusions at para. C7: 

 

“…  There  is  no  evidence  that  he  was  depressed  for  example,  either 
before  or  after  the  killings,  and  he  has  not  provided  any  convincing 
explanation as to why he did not kill himself as planned despite the long 
period  of  time  following  the  killings  and  his  subsequent  arrest.    It  is 
notable that he has shown no evidence of a depressive illness or suicidal 
thoughts since his remand into custody, despite the fact that not only is 

 

7
--------
he  having  to  come  to  terms  with  the  fact  that  he  killed  Sian  and  the 
children, but he is also facing three counts of murder.” 

 
 
At para. C5 of his conclusions Dr Joseph says: 

 
“… The Defendant has no history of mental illness and there is nothing 
to  suggest  that  he  was  suffering  from  symptoms  of  mental  illness,  for 
example a depressive illness, in the period surrounding the killings.” 

However, Dr Joseph also concluded that the Defendant does show features which are 
consistent  with  a  narcissistic  personality  structure:    see  para.  C3  of  his  report.    He 
goes on to state at para. C4: 

“Features  in  this  Defendant  of  a  narcissistic  personality,  which  affect 
about one per cent of the population, include a grandiose sense of self-
importance, requiring excessive admiration, has a sense of entitlement, is 
interpersonally  exploitative,  puts  his  own  needs  over  those  of  others, 
lacks empathy and shows arrogant, haughty behaviours or attitudes.” 

I am grateful to all counsel for their detailed submissions in writing and at the hearing 
before me.  I have taken all matters fully into account even if I do not specifically 
refer to a point which has been made.  In particular I have carefully taken into account 
everything that Mr Sturman has said by way of mitigation.  

The  Defendant  is  aged  49  and  was  a  man  of  hitherto  effective  good  character.    In 
particular there is no evidence of previous violence.   

The Defendant had the difficult task of caring for Sian Blake and their children as her 
health deteriorated and the outlook became more bleak.   

The Defendant accepted what he had done at an early stage, including when he was 
arrested  in  Ghana.    I  accept  that  he  entered  guilty  pleas  at  the  first  reasonable 
opportunity,  after  psychiatric  evidence  had  been  obtained,  which  made  it  clear  that 
there was no defence to the charges of murder.   

However, I do not accept Mr Sturman’s basic submission, which is that this is not an 
 
exceptional and rare case in which just punishment requires the imposition of a whole 
 
life order.  I accept the primary submission made on behalf of the Prosecution by Mr 
Heywood QC that this is such a case. 

First, I accept Mr Heywood’s submission that this case falls within para. 4(2)(a)(i) of 
Sch. 21 to the 2003 Act.  In my judgment this was indeed a case where each murder 
involved  a  substantial  degree  of  premeditation  or  planning.    At  the  very  least  that 
must be true of the murder of each of the two little boys individually and in turn after 
the Defendant had already killed Sian Blake.

Further, and in any event, there were serious aggravating features of this case.  Each 
of the victims was “particularly vulnerable because of age or disability”:  see para. 
10(b) of Sch. 21. 

There was an “abuse of position of trust”:  see para. 10(d).  Indeed Mr Sturman fairly 
accepted that it was a gross abuse of trust. 

There was concealment of the bodies:  see para. 10(g) of Sch. 21. 

In addition, as I have already mentioned, there were the aggravating features in what 
the Defendant did after he had committed these murders.  He made efforts to remove 
evidence of his crimes at the house, including repainting.  He sought to lay a false trail 
 
by  using  Sian  Blake’s  mobile  phone.  He  lied  to  the  police  and  others  about  the 
whereabouts  of  the  family.    He  escaped  abroad  by  going  to  Ghana,  although  I  do 
accept that, after he had been arrested there, he agreed to his extradition back to the 
UK. 

Having considered the matter very carefully and bearing in mind the gravity of the 
case, I do not consider this to be a borderline case.  I have been left in no doubt that 
this is one of those exceptional and rare cases where the requirements of punishment 
 
mean  that  a  whole  life  order  must  be  imposed,  even  after  taking  into  account  the 
mitigating factors.   
The  legislation  on  surcharges  applies  to  this  case  and  an  order  will  be  drawn  up 
accordingly.

Arthur  Simpson-Kent:  the  sentence  of  the  court  is  a  mandatory  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment on each of these three counts of murder.   

In the case of each of these three counts, because of the exceptional seriousness of the 
offences, the early release provisions do not apply and so the sentence is a whole life 
order. 

 

9",2016-10-05 00:00:00,UK Crown Court
2842368,Moss v R [2016] NSWCCA 242,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 9 October 2015 Maiden DCJ sentenced Mr Paul Moss, the applicant, in respect of the following offences to which he had pleaded guilty:
	



	
	That on 7 August 2014 he dealt with the proceeds of crime ($330,500), being reckless as to whether it was the proceeds of crime (s 193B(3) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).
	
	
	That on 7 August 2014 he dealt with the proceeds of crime ($333,980), being reckless as to whether it was the proceeds of crime (s 193B(3) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).
	
	
	That on 7 August 2014 he supplied a prohibited drug (77.8 grams of methylamphetamine) (s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)).
	



	
	The Court order signed by his Honour states in respect of the two proceeds of crime offences that the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment as follows:
	


“Both these matters will be dealt with concurrently.

Commencing from 07/08/15 expiring on 29 May 2018 with a balance of term on 06 May 2019” (sic).


	
	In respect of the drug offence, the Court order states that the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment as follows:
	


“Commencing from 07/08/14 expiring on 22 February 2017” (sic).


	
	On the present application by Mr Moss to appeal against his sentences, counsel agreed that the effect of these orders was that the total sentence imposed was four years and nine months with an effective non-parole period of three years, nine months and 23 days (Transcript pp 19-20). It is regrettable that there was a distinct lack of clarity in his Honour’s identification of the sentences both in these orders and in the Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	By reason of errors in his Honour’s reasoning on sentence, it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence Mr Moss by an independent exercise of its discretion (Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 at [42]). It is neither necessary nor appropriate for this Court to attempt to assess the degree to which the errors were influential in his Honour’s determination of the sentences he imposed (ibid).
	
	
	Before turning to the grounds of appeal and re-sentencing, we summarise as follows the evidence before the sentencing judge and this Court.
	


The circumstances of the offences


	
	The following facts were the subject of agreement at the sentencing hearing in the District Court and were not challenged in this Court.
	
	
	Prior to 7 August 2014, the Australian Crime Commission had been conducting investigations through Task Force Eligo, in which the Australian Federal Police and NSW Police participated, in relation to money laundering activities.
	
	
	The applicant is a British citizen who arrived in Australia on 14 July 2014, after travelling from London to Brisbane via Hong Kong.
	
	
	At about 1.55pm on Thursday 7 August 2014 he left the Capitol Square Hotel, Haymarket in Sydney carrying a black backpack. As he did, he was approached by Australian Crime Commission investigators and was escorted back into the foyer.
	
	
	He was then approached by New South Wales Police and cautioned. When asked by police what was in his backpack, he replied “You know”. He was again asked to identify the contents of his backpack, and he replied “There’s 330 in there”. When asked to clarify what he meant by “330”, he replied “$330,000”.
	
	
	The applicant was then placed under arrest and again cautioned.
	
	
	A preliminary search of his person located a key to room 419 at the Capitol Square Hotel. Police questioned him about the key. He confirmed that he was staying in room 419 by himself and that no other person had a key to the room. He said that there was a further $330,000 cash in the room.
	
	
	When asked whose it was, the applicant replied “I don’t know I picked it up and I was on my way now to drop some of it off to a guy in a taxi. I don’t even know who he is”. The applicant was then asked “This cash or the cash in the room?”. He replied “The cash in the room is the same cash”.
	
	
	He was then asked if there was anything else the officer should know. The applicant volunteered that there was an amount of “meth”. When asked how much he stated “I really couldn’t tell you mate” and that the drugs were his.
	
	
	The applicant also had in his possession a black Nokia mobile phone with a phone number sticky taped on the back. The phone contained a number of text messages relating to meeting someone at around 2 pm on 7 August 2014.
	
	
	Police enquiries revealed that the phone number was registered to a false identity. Enquiries with the Capitol Square Hotel confirmed that the applicant booked room 419, that it was booked for one person and that it was paid for in cash.
	
	
	The backpack in the applicant’s possession was seized by investigators and taken to Sydney City Police Station. Investigators searched the backpack and within the main compartment located three vacuum sealed packages containing significant quantities of bundled Australian currency. Further bundles of Australian currency were located unpackaged within a separate compartment of the backpack. The currency was counted and totalled $330,500, comprised of $20, $50 and $100 notes.
	
	
	Police conducted a search of the applicant’s wallet. Inside the wallet, they located two SIM cards and a hand written ledger setting out dates, locations, amounts of money to be dropped off and collected, as well as references to the drop off and collection of “bits”.
	
	
	The ledger was written by the applicant. (It contained 12 entries relating to the picking up or dropping off between 17 July and 7 August 2014 of “bits” or money. Initial references to money were to amounts of $3,000. The last two entries, of 6 and 7 August, were for the dropping off of two amounts of $330,000. There was a reference to the picking up of $1 million on 6 August 2014).
	
	
	Police applied for and were granted a search warrant for room 419 of the Capitol Square Hotel, Haymarket.
	
	
	At about 7.10pm on 7 August 2014, police gained entry to the room using the key found on the applicant at the time of his arrest. They located:
	



	
	A European Union passport in the name of Paul Daniel Moss;
	
	
	Travel documents and receipts in the name of Paul Moss;
	
	
	Handwritten notes of phone numbers, bank account details and an address;
	
	
	In the pocket of a pair of blue shorts, a plastic bag containing a white crystal substance;
	
	
	A Blackberry mobile phone, a Samsung mobile phone and a mobile tablet device;
	
	
	A grey suitcase containing vacuum sealed bags in which there were significant quantities of bundled Australian currency. Further bundles of Australian currency were located unpackaged within the lid of the suitcase. The currency was counted and totalled $333,980 comprised of $20, $50 and $100 notes.
	



	
	The white crystal substance was sent to the Forensic and Analytical Science Service for analysis. It was found to be 77.8 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 53%.
	
	
	The applicant declined to participate in an interview with police.
	
	
	The applicant was then charged.
	


The applicant’s subjective circumstances


	
	A Corrective Services’ pre-sentence report dated 30 September 2015 was accepted by the sentencing judge as providing relevant information about the applicant.
	
	
	The report stated the following about the applicant’s family/social circumstances, his education and his employment.
	


“Mr Moss stated that he had arrived in Australia on a holiday visa just 3 weeks prior to his arrest and subsequent incarceration. Prior to this, he reported that he was living in Spain in a flat attached to his former mother-in-law’s home. He plans to return to live in Spain following his release from custody. His current partner and his eldest child live in Spain and the remainder of his family reside in England. He had 3 adult children from 2 previous marriages. Mr Moss stated that his marriage of 20 years duration ended approximately 6 years ago as a result of financial stressors associated with his once very successful company going bankrupt. Mr Moss described this period as being particularly difficult as he lost his wife and company at the same time. Mr Moss described a close and supportive relationship with his children and his current partner.

Mr Moss commented that he was raised in England by both parents in a happy and supportive home. He has 3 siblings with whom he remains close and he also shares a strong relationship with his mother. His father passed away approximately 2 years ago.

Mr Moss completed the equivalent of the Higher School Certificate in England and went on to complete an apprenticeship as a butcher.

He stated that he has almost always maintained employment with only brief periods of unemployment between positions in his younger years.

Mr Moss’ most significant employment was for 15 years as the owner and director of a company involved in importing and supplying commercial furniture. He described building this business from scratch into a multi million dollar company. He reported that the company declared bankruptcy in around 2009 following 2 large contractors failing to pay, resulting in a loss of approximately $700,000.

Following the company bankruptcy, Mr Moss returned to his trade as a butcher for 18 months prior to relocating to Spain and commencing work as a taxi driver and casual builder. He indicated that he was struggling financially at this time and his intentions were to come to Australia to see if he could obtain work in the mining industry.

Mr Moss claimed that he has employment available with a relative upon his return to Spain.”


	
	The report also recorded that the applicant admitted that the motive for his offences was greed and that he expressed regret for what he had done, not attempting to justify or minimise the significance of his conduct.
	
	
	Letters from members of the applicant’s family were in evidence, demonstrating dismay at his conduct but their continuing support for him. There was also evidence that the applicant had no prior convictions.
	


The applicant’s evidence


	
	The applicant gave oral evidence at the sentencing hearing. It is unnecessary to refer to it as in a number of respects it was not accepted by the sentencing judge and in any event before this Court his counsel disclaimed reliance upon it, with one limited exception. The exception related to the applicant’s evidence that he was threatened with violence if he did not continue with the criminal tasks he was asked to perform. His counsel referred to this only in a very limited way. He did not assert that the evidence established that the applicant acted under duress. He simply put that the evidence was “consistent with this scenario of someone picking and dropping off things, that certain consequences would have been explained to him if he didn’t perform that function” (Transcript p 9).
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	In light of the Crown’s concessions of error in the judgment and the need for re-sentencing, it is necessary to refer only to the following limited portions of the judgment.
	
	
	First, the sentencing judge said that he was unable to adopt Corrective Services’ view that the risk of the applicant re-offending was low because “of what I consider the unsatisfactory nature of [the] evidence before me”. His Honour did not elaborate further. The evidence to which his Honour referred appeared to be evidence concerning the circumstances of the offences and not evidence bearing on the risk of him re-offending.
	
	
	Secondly, his Honour found that the proceeds of crime offences were above the mid-range of seriousness, whilst the drug offence was within the mid-range.
	
	
	Thirdly, his Honour said the following concerning deterrence:
	


“In respect of the question of general deterrence, this matter looms large here and I will come back to it shortly when I have considered the other factors. Clearly, where a person is carrying methamphetamine and significant amounts of cash, possibly $1 million at one period of time, then this Court must send a message that if people want to come to Australia and undertake serious criminal activity they will not be given a short time in custody and sent home. That is, not having any period of probation service. I am proposing to impose periods of time for parole, but that matter will be reflected in how I accrue the sentences. In respect of the third matter, again, courts have regularly said such a matter must or should, except in exceptional circumstances, impose a custodial sentence which will act as a deterrent to others and I take that into account. The second matter is the question of specific deterrence, and in respect of this offender, because of his age, that does not loom large here as he will return to England as I understand it.”


	
	Fourthly, in respect of the applicant’s good character, his Honour said:
	


“One of the tragedies of this matter is that because of his good character, he was more likely not to come under notice of the authorities and thus, in doing what he did, it was a risk that he was prepared to take. In considering those factors and considering that he is unlikely to reoffend in this country, I must err on the side of general deterrence, and that matter is foremost in my mind in imposing the sentence that I propose to.”


	
	Fifthly, his Honour noted that the applicant had been described as a “model offender” in respect of his time in custody and that “but for the way in which he gave his evidence before me”, his Honour would have accepted that description.
	
	
	Sixthly, his Honour allowed a 25% discount in respect of the plea of guilty to the proceeds of crime offences and a discount of 15% in respect of the drug offence, the plea in respect of the latter not having been proffered until after a contested committal.
	
	
	Seventhly, his Honour did not find that there was sufficient evidence to enable him to take into account the applicant’s back soreness, there only being an x-ray before the Court.
	
	
	Eighthly, due to the applicant’s ability to make phone calls, his Honour did not take into account the fact that the applicant had no family member in Australia who is able to visit him.
	
	
	Ninthly, the sentencing judgment concluded as follows:
	


“In respect of the supply prohibited drug, that sentence is to commence on 7 August 2014. I consider that a four year head sentence is appropriate. I take from that the 15% for his plea of guilty and I will allow the statutory probation period of 25%. So the custody term will be backdated to 7 August 2014 and is to go for a period of 30.6 months, which we put at 6 February 2017 or 22 February 2017.

Regarding the two remaining matters, being recklessly deal with proceeds of crime, these matters should be dealt with entirely concurrently with the above matter as they arise out of the same facts and actions of the offender. I propose in respect of those matters, a head sentence of five years as appropriate. I then reduce it 25% for his early pleas of guilty and a further 25% in respect of the probation period. Both matters are to commence one year after the first matter.

Mr Crown, the dates tentatively are 7 August 2014 to 22 February 2017 and the balance of term will take us up to – I do not have to impose a parole period on that one, I can leave it where it is because it is nugatory, it has no effect. There is no need for a parole period because of the other two matters.

…

I consider in this matter that special circumstances are not appropriate and thus I then take 25% of the 45 months which is approximately 36 months bearing in mind the overwhelming need for general deterrence.”


	
	The applicant relies on the following grounds of appeal:
	


Ground One

The learned sentencing judge erred by:

(a)   failing to consider the issue of totality; and

(b)   partially accumulating the sentences for the proceeds of crime offences upon the sentence for the drug supply offence.


	
	The sentencing judge imposed wholly concurrent sentences for the proceeds of crime offences. These were accumulated to the extent of one year on the sentence for the drug offence. Thus the sentence for the latter was stated to commence on 7 August 2014 whilst the sentences for the former were stated to commence on 7 August 2015.
	
	
	However his Honour’s reasoning contained an internal inconsistency in that on the one hand, consistently with the actual sentences imposed, he stated that the sentences for both proceeds of crime matters were to commence one year after that for the drug matter and on the other hand he said that the recklessly deal matters should “be dealt with entirely concurrently with the above [that is, the drug] matter”.
	
	
	In light of this inconsistent reasoning, the Crown was correct to concede that Ground 1 should be treated as established.
	
	
	We add that in sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge did not adhere to the requirement of s 48 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) that he state the earliest date upon which the applicant would be eligible to be released on parole (s 48(1)(b)).
	


Ground Two

The learned sentencing judge erred by:

(a)   calculating that “25% of the 45 months … is approximately 36 months”;

(b)   sentencing the applicant to a total effective non-parole period which exceeded 80% of the overall term of imprisonment; and

(c)   declining to find special circumstances on the basis of the partial accumulation of individual sentences.


	
	The Crown rightly conceded that Ground 2(a) was established as the sentencing judge made an arithmetical error that appeared to operate to the detriment of the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown also correctly conceded that Ground 2(b) was established as the sentencing judge imposed an effective aggregate non-parole period equal to 80% of the head sentence without explaining why it was appropriate that that percentage exceed 75%.
	
	
	Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides:
	


“44 Court to set non-parole period

…

(2)   The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).”


	
	Whilst this subsection applies by its terms only to individual sentences, the courts have applied it by analogy to aggregate sentences (Hejazi v R (2009) 217 A Crim R 151; [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [35]-[36]). The parties in the present case did not suggest that the individual sentences imposed by his Honour departed from the relevant ratio but the applicant contended, and the Crown accepted, that the aggregate sentence did so because the total effective non-parole period exceeded 80% of the overall term of imprisonment. This came about as a result of the aggregation of individual sentences that conformed to the statutory ratio. His Honour appears to have overlooked the effect of aggregation on the ratio applicable to the aggregate sentence as his comments in the course of argument suggested that he intended to apply the statutory ratio throughout.
	
	
	This being his intent, he should have found, for the purposes of s 44(2), that special circumstances existed in respect of the individual sentences which justified departure from the statutory ratio. This would have enabled him to arrive at an aggregate balance of term that was one-third of the aggregate non-parole period. Although the Crown did not concede it, we thus find that Ground 2(c) has been established, in addition to Grounds 2(a) and (b).
	


Ground Three

The learned sentencing judge erred by:

(a)   giving greater weight to general deterrence on the basis that the applicant was a foreign national; and

(b)   declining to take into account the circumstance that the applicant would experience more onerous custody in Australia because he is a foreign national.


	
	In addressing general deterrence, the sentencing judge said that “this Court must send a message that if people want to come to Australia and undertake serious criminal activity they will not be given a short time in custody and sent home” (p 12). The applicant argued that this involved the proposition that general deterrence was of greater significance in the case of the applicant than in relation to Australian offenders because the applicant was an overseas national and that this was contrary to the principle in R v Shrestha (1991) 173 CLR 48 at 71; [1991] HCA 26 that this country “has a responsibility, both moral and under international treaty, to treat all who are subjected to criminal proceedings in its courts or imprisonment in its gaols … without discrimination based on national or ethnic origins”. No conclusion need be reached about this ground in light of our upholding of other grounds of appeal.
	
	
	For the same reason, Ground 3(b) need not be addressed. It raises a topic to which reference is made in the course of re-sentencing below.
	


Ground Four

The sentencing judge failed to properly take into account the applicant’s prior good character and prospects of rehabilitation.


	
	The Crown correctly conceded that this ground of appeal had been established on the basis that the sentencing judge, without proper explanation, discounted the evidence of the applicant’s good behaviour in custody because of the way in which he gave evidence on sentence ([44] above). There was no obvious respect in which the applicant’s evidence on sentence impacted on that other evidence and no explanation as to why it in fact did so was given by his Honour. The effect on the sentencing process was potentially significantly adverse to the applicant’s interests.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to deal with other matters raised by the applicant in support of this ground of appeal.
	


RE-SENTENCING


	
	As errors in the sentencing process having been established, this Court is required to re-sentence.
	


Additional evidence admitted on re-sentencing


	
	An affidavit of a solicitor employed in the offices of the applicant’s solicitors indicated that Justice Health records revealed that the applicant suffers from a back problem for which he is prescribed painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs.
	
	
	The affidavit also indicated that Corrective Services stated that, with one limited exception, the applicant had received positive comments on his work, conduct and interactions whilst in custody. The exception related to his reprimand and caution for the discovery of items in his cell which he told officers he intended to use to put up shelves in the cell.
	
	
	In an affidavit, the applicant stated that he wakes up every day suffering back pain and that Corrective Services has attempted to assist him by providing extra pillows and mattresses.
	
	
	He also indicated that he has been given a degree of responsibility in his job as a storeman/clerk at the Cessnock Correctional Centre. He said that he has undertaken a number of courses but has been denied enrolment for others because he is classified as a “deportee”.
	
	
	He calls overseas to speak to his family but the calls are monitored and recorded and he has to pay for them from the very limited funds that he has available.
	
	
	He expressed considerable regret for his offending.
	


Re-sentencing consideration


	
	The proceeds of crime offences are each subject to a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and the drug offence is subject to a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole periods are specified for the offences.
	
	
	The offences of which the applicant was convicted were objectively serious. He dealt with two amounts of about $330,000 which represented the proceeds of crime and he had in his possession for the purposes of supply more than 15 times the indictable quantity of methylamphetamine. His activities involved a degree of organisation as evidenced by the ledger he kept.
	
	
	We recognise the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for offences such as those of the applicant and take that factor into account. Specific deterrence is a consideration of only limited significance as the prospect of the applicant re-offending appears low.
	
	
	So far as subjective factors are concerned, we note that the applicant expressed remorse to the Corrective Services Officer who prepared the pre-sentence report and also in his affidavit which was read upon his present application for leave to appeal. In his favour also is a generally satisfactory employment record and an absence of prior convictions. As well, he has strong family support to assist in his rehabilitation and there is evidence that a job is available for him in Spain after he has completed his sentence.
	
	
	Some limited weight is to be given to the applicant’s submission that incarceration is particularly onerous for him because he is a foreign national without family in Australia. However his ability to speak English fluently and to have telephone contact with his family overseas limits the impact of this consideration (compare R v Huang (2000) 113 A Crim R 386; [2000] NSWCCA 238 at [18]-[19] and see Yang v R [2007] NSWCCA 37 at [24]-[26]). The applicant complains that his telephone calls are timed and recorded. Whilst the position in this respect has not been suggested to be any different for other persons in custody, the applicant’s reliance upon telephone calls is great because of the absence of persons able to visit him.
	
	
	Relevant also is the evidence on appeal of the applicant’s suffering of considerable back pain, restricting his movement and requiring extra bedding. His conduct in custody and progress towards rehabilitation has been excellent save for one incident of limited significance.
	
	
	The applicant should be allowed a 25% discount on his head sentences in respect of the proceeds of crime offences to reflect his early pleas of guilty and a discount of 15% in respect of the drug offence to which he pleaded guilty after a contested committal hearing.
	
	
	No finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is justified other than one to achieve a ratio of the applicant’s overall balance of term to his overall non-parole period for his three sentences which reflects the statutory ratio of no more than one third.
	
	
	We consider that some limited accumulation is appropriate in respect of the sentences. To reflect the criminality involved in Count 2 additional to that involved in Count 1, the sentence on the former count should be accumulated by 6 months on that for the latter. Likewise, the sentence on Count 3 should be accumulated on the sentence for Count 2 by a further nine months to reflect the additional criminality involved in that offence.
	
	
	Neither party to the application for leave to appeal suggested that sentencing statistics demonstrated that sentences imposed in other cases concerning the subject offence provisions established a range that could be of assistance in re-sentencing in the present case. The applicant referred to some cases in which offenders were sentenced under those provisions but the facts of them were not sufficiently similar to those in the present case to warrant discussion of them.
	
	
	In respect of Count 1, we consider a head sentence of 4 years imprisonment less the 25% discount for the early plea (that is, 3 years) to be appropriate. We consider the same sentence, to commence 6 months after that for Count 1, to be appropriate in respect of Count 2. In respect of Count 3, we consider a sentence of 4 years imprisonment less 15% discount for the plea of guilty (that is, 3 years 4 months) to be appropriate. As we have indicated, this sentence should commence 9 months after the commencement of the sentence for Count 2.
	
	
	On this basis, the applicant’s overall head sentence will be 4 years 7 months. The non-parole period and the balance of term should be approximately 75% and 25% respectively (that is, 3 years and 5 months, and 1 year 2 months) of this term. To achieve this, we make a finding of special circumstances in respect of the sentence for Count 3 increasing the proportion of the balance of the term to the head sentence.
	


ORDERS


	
	Taking these considerations into account, we make the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed and sentences imposed by the District Court on 9 October 2015 quashed.
	
	
	The applicant is sentenced to terms of imprisonment as follows:
	



	
	In respect of Count 1 (dealing with proceeds of crime of $330,500) to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 7 August 2014 and concluding on 6 November 2016, with a balance of term of 9 months concluding on 6 August 2017.
	
	
	In respect of Count 2 (dealing with proceeds of crime of $333,980), to a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months commencing on 6 February 2015 and concluding on 6 May 2017, with a balance of term of 9 months concluding on 6 February 2018.
	
	
	In respect of Count 3 (supply a prohibited drug), to a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months commencing on 7 November 2015 and concluding on 6 January 2018, with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months concluding on 6 March 2019.
	


The applicant’s overall head sentence is 4 years and 7 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months commencing on 7 August 2014 and concluding on 6 January 2018 with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months concluding on 6 March 2019.

The first date that the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 6 January 2018.

2842370,Leffley v R [2016] NSWCCA 243,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: By Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal filed 14 April 2016, the applicant, Shaun Neil Leffley, sought leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court sitting at Penrith (English DCJ) on 9 June 2015.
	
	
	The applicant plead guilty to two counts of supplying a prohibited drug in an amount of not less than the commercial quantity (amphetamine and methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for each offence is 20 years’ imprisonment and or a fine of 3,500 penalty units. A standard non-parole period of 10 years applies.
	
	
	The applicant also entered pleas of guilty to three offences of possess prohibited drug contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (cannabis, cocaine and oxymetholone). These matters were before the Court on sentence on a Certificate in accordance with s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The maximum penalty for each of these offences is 2 years’ imprisonment and or a fine of 20 penalty units.
	
	
	The applicant entered his guilty pleas on 18 March 2015 before the Wagga Wagga Local Court. The sentence proceedings were heard in the District Court on 15 May 2015.
	
	
	Particulars of the sentences imposed are as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of supply methylamphetamine a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 10 October 2014 and expiring on 9 October 2017 with a parole period of 3 years expiring on 9 October 2020.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of supply amphetamine, a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 10 October 2014 and expiring on 9 April 2019 with a parole period of 4 years expiring on 9 April 2023.
	



	
	In respect of the offence of possess cannabis, possess cocaine and possess oxymetholone convictions were recorded pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999.
	
	
	The sentencing judge made a finding of special circumstances and adjusted the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. The non-parole period represents 52% of the total term.
	
	
	The Notice of Intention to Appeal in these proceedings was filed on 24 June 2015. The Notice was extended on 15 March 2016 and subsequently on 15 April 2016. A Notice of Appeal was filed on 14 April 2016.
	
	
	The sentencing judge set out the factual background to the offending at [1]-[5] of her Remarks on Sentencing (ROS). The facts set out below are based upon the agreed facts as summarised in the Crown’s Written Submissions (CWS) dated 15 August 2016.
	


Factual Matters


	
	At approximately 2:00am on 10 October 2014, the applicant was driving his white Hyundai iLoad vehicle in Narrandera when he was pulled over by police for the purpose of a random breath test. When asked as to whether he had any drugs in the vehicle he admitted that he had a small amount of cannabis leaf which was contained in a Tupperware container that was handed to police. He also handed over a water pipe to the police officer.
	
	
	The Crown Summary of Facts records the following:
	


“Police formed the view that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the applicant had other drugs in the vehicle: [ROS [2]]. The applicant was cautioned and asked whether there were other drugs in the vehicle. He said that there were not. A search of the vehicle then located the following items [ROS [2]-[4]]:

(a)   Two M&M containers that each contained an amount of cannabis;

(b)   A black Nike sports drink bottle which contained a container holding 7.5g of methylamphetamine; a sealed bag containing 30.3g of amphetamine; a cylindrical clear tube which contained 1.302g of methylamphetamine; a blister pack of Diazepam and contact lens containers containing 0.404g of cocaine and 0.139g of methylamphetamine;

(c)   A gift box containing a Uniden brand portable radio box, which, when opened, was found to contain two cryo-vac bags containing 892.6g of amphetamine. This amphetamine was analysed and found to have a purity of 12.5%;

(d)   A tissue containing 4.44g of oxymetholone;

(e)   A blue coloured sports bag containing two cry-vac [sic] bags containing cannabis leaf;

(f)   A black sports drink bottle containing 376.0g of methylamphetamine. The methylamphetamine was later analysed and found to have a purity of 79%;

(g)   Sixteen mobile telephones and four Blackberry phones including SIM cards (one of which was turned on);

(h)   A laptop and three tablets and a number of two-way portable radios; and

(i)   Drug administering items, including ice-smoking pipes, cocaine snorting tube and other glass pipes.” (CWS at [10])


	
	The total quantity of amphetamine and methylamphetamine found in the applicant’s possession, as stated above, amounted to a commercial quantity of each of the drugs. The amphetamine amounted to slightly less than a large commercial quantity (1kg). Particulars are as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Drug
			
			
			Amount Found
			
			
			Commercial quantity
			
			
			Large commercial quantity
			
		
		
			
			Amphetamine
			
			
			922.9g
			
			
			250g
			
			
			1kg
			
		
		
			
			Methylamphetamine
			
			
			383.3g
			
			
			250g
			
			
			1kg
			
		
	



	
	The Crown noted that a total of 0.44g of oxymetholone and 0.404g of cocaine was also found by police. Each quantity was less than the small quantity applicable to that drug.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the applicant entered his guilty pleas at the first available opportunity.
	


Proceedings on Sentence


	
	At the sentence hearing, the Crown tendered a bundle of material. This included the abovementioned Statement of Agreed Facts, the applicant’s criminal and custodial histories, an analyst’s certificate dated 10 December 2014, the s 166 certificate, a pre-sentence report of Theresa Ross dated 23 April 2015, and a drug and alcohol report of Peter Townsend dated 24 April 2015.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon a letter from Odyssey House dated 6 May 2015 and a psychological report of Mr Phil Gorrell dated 24 April 2014 (Exhibit 1).
	
	
	He also relied upon a letter which he addressed to the sentencing judge dated 14 May 2014 together with a character reference from Mr Dean Profilio dated 4 February 2015 (Exhibit 2). The applicant’s father gave evidence at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	It was submitted at the sentence hearing that the offending fell slightly less than the middle of the range in relation to the nature of the offences charged. The Crown submitted that the drug supply offences fell objectively within the mid-range of seriousness.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing judge set out in her Remarks on Sentence a number of factual matters based upon the agreed facts and circumstances: ROS pp 1-4. Reference was made to the applicant’s account to the custody manager whilst waiting to be charged to the effect that he was threatened by persons causing him to convey the drugs. However, as the applicant did not himself give evidence at the sentence hearing, his account was not verified.
	
	
	In the Pre-Sentence Report dated 23 April 2015, reference is made to the applicant having stated that the main motivation for his offending behaviour was to pay off his drug debts (p 2).
	
	
	In the report of Mr Gorrell, Psychologist/Social Worker dated 24 April 2014, the applicant is reported as having said that a person asked him to deliver a package to another person in South Australia and that he, the applicant, indicated that he had assumed that the package contained illicit substances (p 5).
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that the offence of supply prohibited drugs were serious offences which, her Honour stated, were often committed:
	


“…by desperate persons seeking to fund a drug habit. The community suffers enormously as a result. Lives are destroyed, crimes are committed to fund habits and career criminals higher up the chain escape detection. Vast sums of public money are expended on treatment programs and rehabilitation facilities and mental health facilities to assist those who are addicted to these hideous substances…” (ROS at pp 6-7)


	
	Her Honour observed that all too often persons who are persuaded to supply drugs are persons of otherwise good character as was the case with the applicant.
	
	
	In the course of her remarks her Honour emphasised the fact that in sentencing general deterrence “looms large” and that the penalty to be imposed should send a message to the community that those who engage in the supply of drugs will face condign punishment when charged: (ROS at p 7).
	
	
	Her Honour observed:
	


“This offender had in his possession significant quantities of amphetamine and methyl-amphetamine. The large commercial quantity of amphetamine, as I have said is one kilogram. This offender had 922.9 grams, not a great deal less than the large commercial quantity and certainly at the upper end of the scale for quantities of this particular drug and that alone makes this offence objectively serious. The commercial quantity of methyl-amphetamine as I have said is 250 grams and this offender had 383.5 grams, less than half the commercial quantity but nonetheless a significant quantity of an illicit drug. The purity however was particularly high, 370 grams was found to have a purity of 79%, that could result in the drug being cut many times over.

The nature of this particular drug is of course particularly pernicious in its effect on those who choose to use it and who unfortunately, as this offender now only knows too well, quickly become addicted. Fortunately the drugs were intercepted by sheer chance, otherwise they may well have reached their destination and been distributed into the community with serious consequences.” (ROS at p 8)


	
	The sentencing judge made reference to the offender’s claims that he entered into the supply of drugs in order to pay a drug debt, that he was unable to pay the debt and that he and his family had been threatened if he did not repay it.
	
	
	Her Honour observed:
	


“He did not give evidence on sentence, the Crown therefore has not had the opportunity to test the evidence of the offender in that regard. The offender does bear the onus of establishing on balance that he was only a courier. The difficulty I am faced with in giving significant weight to the untested evidence is the plethora of other items located in his vehicle at the time of his arrest. He also had in his possession cannabis in a variety of containers, implements which could be utilised for the ingestion of drugs such as the water pipe, a cocaine snorting tube and other glass pipes. He had multiple mobile phones, he had cocaine and oxymetholone which is a synthetic male hormone or anabolic steroid and a number of two way portable radios, the pen cam, a CCTV type camera and an eavesdropping device…” (ROS at p 9)


	
	Her Honour proceeded, stating that the need to acquire funds to support a habit or to repay a drug debt, “…are not matters of mitigation on sentence…” although she acknowledged that factors such as the impulsivity of the offence and motivation are matters that can be taken into account when assessing the objective criminality of the offence: ROS at p 9.
	
	
	Her Honour stated:
	


“This offender I find on balance was someone who was a courier, one who was motivated by his habit and drug debt rather than someone who was motivated to engage in couriering of drugs purely for profit.

However I find having regard to what was found in the vehicle that his level of participation falls well above that of a street level courier. He was on any view of the evidence playing an important role in the distribution of a significant quantity of drugs. The importance of his role can be inferred from the quantity of drugs involved.” (ROS at pp 9-10)


	
	Her Honour proceeded, as earlier indicated, to find that the offences fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness and that accordingly she proposed to depart from imposing the standard non-parole periods in respect of each offence.
	
	
	Her Honour allowed a 25% discount on sentence for the applicant’s pleas, found him to be truly remorseful and contrite and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation if he attended an appropriate full-time residential rehabilitation program as recommended by the psychologist and Corrective Services (ROS at p 10).
	
	
	Her Honour determined that the sentences to be imposed were to be served concurrently on the basis that the offences were committed “…in the one course of criminal conduct…”. She accepted that the applicant was unaware of the nature and quantity of the drugs in his possession.
	


Ground of Appeal


	
	The applicant relied upon only one ground of appeal in the following terms:
	


Her Honour erred in imposing sentences that were discordant with her findings of fact and which were thereby manifestly excessive.


	
	This ground in essence asserted that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In order to establish such a ground it is necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence was “unreasonable” or “plainly unjust”: Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25; and Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [59].
	
	
	It is well accepted that whether a sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust is a matter to be considered in the context that there is no single correct sentence and that sentencing is not a mathematical exercise. Additionally, sentencing judges are required to reach a sentence for each offence by balancing many different and conflicting features: Markarian v R, supra, at [27]; Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen (2014) 253 CLR 58; [2014] HCA 2 at [34].
	


Applicant’s Submissions


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, after allowing for a 25% discount on sentence for the applicant’s early pleas of guilty, the starting points for the two sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in respect of the two supply offences were 11 years and 4 months (charge sequence 9, supply amphetamine: 922.9 grams) and 8 years (charge sequence 11, supply methylamphetamine: 383.3 grams) respectively.
	
	
	In the written submissions on behalf of the applicant dated 11 April 2016, the sentencing judge’s findings were summarised as follows:
	


(i)   The applicant was a courier who was motivated by his habit and drug debt rather than someone who was motivated to engage in such activity purely for profit (ROS 9.8);

(ii)   The offences fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness (ROS 10.1-2);

(iii)   The applicant should receive a 25% discount for his pleas of guilty which were entered at the earliest opportunity (ROS 10.2);

(iv)   The applicant was truly remorseful and contrite (ROS 10.3);

(v)   The applicant has good prospects for rehabilitation if he attends an appropriate full-time residential rehabilitation program as recommended by the psychologist and Corrective Services (ROS 10.4);

(vi)   There is a low likelihood of the applicant re-offending if he successfully undergoes rehabilitation (ROS 10.5);

(vii)   The offences were committed in the one course of criminal conduct and accordingly, can be served concurrently (ROS 10.6-7);

(viii)   The applicant was unaware of the nature and quantity of the drugs in his possession (ROS 10.7);

(ix)   There were special circumstances that justified a longer than normal period of supervised parole (ROS 10.8-9).” (AWS 8-9)


	
	The submission for the applicant was that against the background of the findings as set out in (i) to (ix) above, the sentences are manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Intervention of this Court, it was contended on behalf of the applicant, was justified for similar reasons as given in the judgment of this Court in Hill v R [2012] NSWCCA 265.
	
	
	The judgment in that case, it was argued, provided guidance for the purposes of the present application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	It was submitted for the applicant at [24]:
	


“The findings made by her Honour were very supportive of the applicant. The two offences were correctly assessed as one course of criminal conduct, committed by a person who was unaware of the nature and quantity of the drugs and in circumstances where he was a courier who was motivated by his habit and drug debt, rather than someone who was motivated to engage in such conduct purely for profit. The offences fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness and the applicant had no prior criminal record. He was truly remorseful and contrite, has good prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of re-offending is low. These factors in particular, attract leniency and an approach consistent with that adopted by this Court in Hill. Accordingly, it is submitted that the sentences her Honour imposed in respect of the two supply charges are manifestly excessive.”


	
	In support of the submissions that intervention by this Court is justified for reasons advanced in Hill v R, supra, it was noted that in that case this Court allowed a severity appeal on the ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	It was noted that in Hill v R the Court found a lesser sentence was warranted in law where the sentence imposed was said to be incongruously at odds with the offender’s strong subjective case. It was submitted that the decision in that case provides guidance in the present application as to the appropriate sentences.
	
	
	Mr Rowe of counsel, who appeared in this Court on behalf of the applicant, acknowledged that the observations made by Harrison J in Hill upon which he relied did not purport to establish a statement of principle other than observing that the sentencing judge in that case had failed to bring into account significant aspects of the subjective case. Mr Rowe submitted that the total effective sentence involving a total term of imprisonment of 8 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was the type of sentence that was appropriate for what he described as “repeat offenders” or offenders that had a prior record, or to offenders that were “substantially involved in the supply exercise” (T 24 August 2016 at p 2).
	
	
	In respect of the charge (sequence 9) of supply amphetamine in the amount of 922.9 grams, Mr Rowe observed that the purity of the drug involved was quite low as opposed to the supply of methylamphetamine the subject of the other charge (sequence 11).
	
	
	Mr Rowe also observed that the supply was made up of two different substances that constituted a deemed supply, the applicant not having precisely known what the substances were, and that his level of involvement was identified as that of courier. He submitted that the sentence was plainly unjust because “…it is the sort of sentence that should be reserved for far more serious matters”: T 2.
	
	
	In support of the ground of appeal relied upon, Mr Rowe emphasised the fact that the applicant did not have a criminal record, was a man of prior good character and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation, there being, he submitted, no likelihood of reoffending: T 3.
	
	
	Mr Rowe submitted that the sentencing exercised must have miscarried:
	


“…because if you make those sort of very, very favourable findings on the subjective case, we say it must follow that it has got to result in a non-parole period of less than four and a half years on any view of it. That is really at the heart of our argument.” (T 4)


	
	Mr Rowe also submitted that error lay in the fact of the length of the effective total sentence.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown in its written submissions referred to the principles that apply to an appeal against sentence in which it is alleged that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive as enunciated by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen, supra, and Hili v The Queen, supra.
	
	
	The Crown also referred to the observations in AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111; [1999] HCA 46 at [128], to the effect that there will be a range of possible sentences that could be imposed without error. The Crown submitted that the total effective sentence imposed in the present case was within the range of sentences that could be imposed without error.
	
	
	The Crown stated that the observations made in Hill v R, supra, by Harrison J at [24], and relied upon by the applicant, namely, “[t]he sentence imposed upon the applicant is incongruously at odds with the strong subjective case” was not a statement of principle. The Crown referred to the observations of this Court to that effect in Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264 at [61].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that unlike Hill, but like Briouzguine, supra, the sentencing judge expressly considered and took into account the applicant’s subjective circumstances as part of the instinctive synthesis in arriving at the total effective sentence imposed. The applicant’s subjective circumstances, the Crown noted, were additionally taken into account in the determination to vary the statutory ratio to just 52% of the total term, a finding which it submitted was generous in all the circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown observed that the quantities of the drugs involved are also significant. The quantity of amphetamine, it was noted, fell only slightly below the large commercial quantity of amphetamine and the quantity of methylamphetamine was well over (almost double) the commercial quantity of that drug.
	
	
	The Crown also noted that the sentences imposed in respect of the two s 25(2) offences were concurrent, so that the total effective sentence of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, related to the applicant’s supply of significant quantities of two extremely harmful drugs: CWS at [25].
	
	
	The Crown noted that the sentencing judge made a finding which was favourable to the applicant, namely, that the level of his offending fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness: ROS at 10. That finding, it was observed, was consistent with the submission made by counsel for the applicant at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	After taking into account the 25% discount for the early pleas of guilty, the Crown observed that the total effective non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months fell well below the standard non-parole period of 10 years for those offences.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this Court’s judgment in Hill does not provide guidance for the purpose of this case and set out in its written submissions the distinguishing features between Hill and the applicant’s case: at [27]. One such distinguishing feature was that the offender in Hill was given a 25% discount for his pleas of guilty and a further discount of 25% for past and present assistance (a combined discount of 50%).
	
	
	In addition, an element of coercion was found to have existed in Hill which led to a significant reduction in his sentence.
	
	
	The Crown observed that the present case concerned large quantities of two very harmful drugs which are growing in frequency before the Courts: R v Hatzisavvas; R v Lopez-Rios [2016] NSWCCA 147 at [136] ff. The Crown submitted that there was a strong need for deterrence, both general and specific, in view of the harm caused by such drugs and the difficulty of detecting offences relating to their supply.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in the circumstances it cannot be said that a total effective sentence of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months was manifestly excessive.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judge made factual findings about which no complaint has been made. Further the matters advanced in the submissions for the applicant do not establish any erroneous application of sentencing principle or that the sentencing judge failed to take into account all relevant considerations in determining the sentences imposed: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5; [1936] HCA 40.
	
	
	It is well accepted that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies: Markarian, supra, at [27].
	
	
	The sentencing judge in this case took into account all relevant objective factors in concluding that the applicant’s level of participation fell well above that of a street-level courier and that he had played an important role in the distribution of a significant quantity of drugs.
	
	
	As noted above, her Honour also made findings which were favourable to the applicant including a finding that, on balance, he was a courier who was motivated by his habit and drug debt, rather than motivated purely for profit and that the offences fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The applicant also had the benefit of a finding that he had good prospects of rehabilitation if he attended an appropriate full-time residential rehabilitation program and a determination that the offences were committed in one course of criminal conduct and that therefore the sentences should be served concurrently.
	
	
	As noted above, the applicant was granted a discount for his guilty pleas of 25%.
	
	
	It is of some importance in these proceedings to observe that the determination that the offences fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness had a significant bearing upon the determination of the non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months in contrast to the standard non-parole period of 10 years. Given that the total quantity of methylamphetamine found in the applicant’s possession amounted to almost double the commercial quantity and, in the case of the amphetamine, was slightly less than a large commercial quantity, the determination of the sentence, including the non-parole period, could be considered as containing an element of leniency.
	
	
	The finding of special circumstances further operated to the applicant’s benefit as providing the basis for a variation in the ratio of the non-parole period to the total term of the sentences imposed, namely, a ratio of 52% instead of the otherwise prescribed ratio of 75%.
	
	
	No error was established in this case as occurred in Hill where the sentencing judge imposed a sentence that was said to be “incongruously at odds” with the strong subjective case. As earlier noted, in the present case the sentencing judge expressly had regard to all relevant subjective circumstances in determining sentencing.
	
	
	The sentences imposed, in particular the total effective sentence of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, was not, in my opinion, manifestly excessive. As the High Court has observed, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, an appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle even though where and how is not apparent from the reasons: Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584; [2001] HCA 64 at [58]; and Hili v R, supra, at [59].
	
	
	I have concluded that the sentences imposed were not outside the range of sentences available and that no basis exists for the contention that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. Indeed a consideration of all objective and subjective factors, in my opinion, establishes that the sentences imposed were well within the applicable range of sentences.
	
	
	Finally, it is to be observed that in determining sentence the sentencing judge was required to give effect to both specific and general deterrence.
	
	
	Her Honour’s observation that:
	


“general deterrence looms large and any penalty to be imposed [is] to ensure that a message is sent to the community that those who choose to engage in the supply of drugs will face condign punishment when they are charged”

is an appropriate one in this case: ROS p 7.


	
	Finally, as noted above, the factual findings made by the sentencing judge, not challenged as having been erroneous in any respect, included, in particular, that the applicant, though a courier who was motivated by his habit and drug debt, was found to have participated at a level well above that of a street level courier and played an important role in the distribution of a significant quantity of drugs: ROS p 9.
	
	
	The sentences imposed were not, in my opinion, manifestly excessive.
	


Orders


	
	I accordingly propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hall J.

2842376,R v Adams (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 1563,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 17 October 2016, I ruled that the tender of a representation contained in voir dire exhibit G (VD ex G) should be rejected. At the same time, I ruled that a representation contained in voir dire exhibit H (VD ex H) was admissible. I indicated on that occasion that I would give my reasons for those rulings later, a course with which both counsel were content. This judgment constitutes those reasons.
	


Background


	
	The background to the rulings can be found in a number of earlier judgments of mine, perhaps the most useful of which is R v Adams (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1359.
	
	
	In a nutshell, the accused is standing trial by judge alone on a count of murder alleged to have been committed on 24 September 1983. The Crown case is that the accused choked or strangled Ms Mary Wallace (the deceased) with intent to force her to have sexual intercourse with him whilst they were alone together in his motor vehicle very early one morning, they having met at a wine bar earlier that night, and that he thereby committed murder pursuant to the doctrine of felony murder.
	
	
	The foundational offence relied upon for the purposes of felony murder (as it then was, pursuant to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) is the offence to be found in s 37 of the same Act (again, as it then was).
	
	
	Although it is not disputed by the accused that he was in the company of the deceased early that morning, there is little, if any, direct inculpatory evidence as to what occurred between them (the accused, in interviews with the police, has given an exculpatory account). To a large extent, the Crown case is founded upon inferences said to be able to be drawn from tendency evidence given by three separate women (the tendency complainants): my judgment in R v Adams [2015] NSWSC 1960 sets out the background of that contention, including my pre-trial determination that the evidence was admissible.
	
	
	One of those women is Ms Karen Brown (pseudonyms of the tendency complainants have been used consistently throughout the proceedings, and in all of my judgments). She gave evidence in the trial by way of AVL link on 4 October 2016 and 5 October 2016.
	
	
	In summary, her evidence was that, in late July or early August 1978, she met a man at a nightclub on the lower North Shore of Sydney who, in some but not all ways, matched the appearance of the accused as it was then. Her position is that, after she accepted an offer of a lift home from that man, he brutally raped her, both at a harbourside reserve in the inner northern suburbs, and subsequently at a private home somewhere in the vicinity of Wahroonga. Her evidence was that the perpetrator strangled her whilst sexually assaulting her.
	
	
	Ms Brown gave evidence that, eventually, the perpetrator freed her the next morning. She informed friends of what had occurred, and briefly informed the police, but was too terrified of the perpetrator to take the matter further.
	
	
	Her evidence was also that, over a period of more than three decades, she had memorised the number plate of the vehicle of the perpetrator, so that she could be on her guard if he were ever to return.
	
	
	In 2013, the officer in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the deceased, Detective Senior Constable Jones, recorded that Ms Brown recalled the number plate of the vehicle used by the perpetrator as being DMB 055 or DMB 065.
	
	
	Turning to the documents the subject of objection, VD ex G contains a representation that the “Vehicle Used (year, make, colour, etc.)” by the accused was a “1964 Holden sedan, brown with white top, DMB 055”. The date listed in the top left corner of the form under the heading “5. Date Committed” is “16.9.78”. I shall discuss the context of that representation in more detail shortly.
	
	
	It was agreed between the parties that VD ex H contains a representation that, as at 19 September 1978, the accused, Robert John Adams, was the owner of a “64 holden sedan. brown/white roof. no DMB-055”. Again, I shall discuss the context in more detail later.
	
	
	In other words, although there were some aspects of the description and modus operandi of the man who sexually assaulted Ms Brown that could be said to support the proposition that the perpetrator was the accused, the link between the recollection of Ms Brown about the number plate (recorded in the year 2013) and the representations about the car registrations (contained in VD ex G and VD ex H) is an important part of the Crown case.
	
	
	Consequently, the joint position of both counsel, and accepted by me, was that this question of admissibility was an important one. Accordingly, quite some time was taken with regard to it, including the receipt by me of very helpful written and oral submissions from both counsel.
	


Voir dire exhibit G

Attributes


	
	Turning first to VD ex G, it is headed “NSW Police Department Further Crime Information Report”. It deals with the offence of “assault female” alleged to have been committed by the accused (the document contains the words “17. OFFENDER 1” and “18. NAME ROBERT JOHN ADAMS”) at an address in Neutral Bay on 16 September 1978. (For clarity, I record that the complainant with regard to that allegation is not one of the three tendency complainants in the trial.)
	
	
	On its second page, the document provides a narrative of the alleged offence that one can infer was based largely on a statement taken from the complainant. On its first page, it speaks of the accused having been arrested with regard to that allegation on 19 September 1978. The following appears above that on the first page: “16. Vehicle Used (year, make, colour, etc)” as part of the form. Immediately below that appear the following words, typed into the document with a typewriter: “1964 Holden sedan, brown with white top. DMB 055”.
	


Crown submissions


	
	There was no dispute between the parties about the relevance of the representation contained in that document, in light of the background that I have sketched. Accordingly, the representation is prima facie admissible, pursuant to s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor accepted that that representation, made out of court and tendered to prove the truth of its contents, contravened the rule against hearsay contained in s 59 of the Evidence Act. He also accepted the concomitant proposition that, unless the representation contained in VD ex G fell within one of the exceptions to the rule against hearsay contained in the Evidence Act, then the representation that the accused used a “1964 Holden sedan, brown with white top, DMB 055” could not be tendered in order to prove the truth of it.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor relied upon the exception to the rule against hearsay to be found in s 69 of the Evidence Act. In its entirety that section is as follows:
	


69 Exception: business records

(1) This section applies to a document that:

(a) either:

(i) is or forms part of the records belonging to or kept by a person, body or organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business, or

(ii) at any time was or formed part of such a record, and

(b) contains a previous representation made or recorded in the document in the course of, or for the purposes of, the business.

(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains the representation) if the representation was made:

(a) by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact, or

(b) on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact.

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the representation:

(a) was prepared or obtained for the purpose of conducting, or for or in contemplation of or in connection with, an Australian or overseas proceeding, or

(b) was made in connection with an investigation relating or leading to a criminal proceeding.

(4) If:

(a) the occurrence of an event of a particular kind is in question, and

(b) in the course of a business, a system has been followed of making and keeping a record of the occurrence of all events of that kind,

the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence that tends to prove that there is no record kept, in accordance with that system, of the occurrence of the event.

(5) For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to have had personal knowledge of a fact if the person’s knowledge of the fact was or might reasonably be supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived (other than a previous representation made by a person about the fact).


	
	It was contended by the Crown Prosecutor that (in accordance with s 142 of the Evidence Act) I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that (in accordance with s 69(1)(a) and (b) of the Evidence Act) VD ex G is or was a document that formed part of the records kept by an organisation in the course of a business, as that latter concept is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act. It was said that the New South Wales Police falls within that definition, and did so as at the date when the document came into existence, seemingly 1978.
	
	
	It was also submitted that, again making findings on the balance of probabilities with regard to a question of admissibility, and drawing inferences from the document as a whole (in accordance with s 183 of the Evidence Act), I would be satisfied that the representation was made, at the least, on the basis of information indirectly supplied by a person who might reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of the fact asserted in the representation, in accordance with s 69(2)(b) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Furthermore, the Crown Prosecutor accepted that s 69(3) of the Evidence Act can, in some circumstances, operate to exclude business records that would otherwise be admissible as an exception to the rule against hearsay; in other words, he accepted that s 69(3) of the Evidence Act can constitute an “exception to the exception” to the exclusionary rule against hearsay.
	
	
	He further accepted that I am entitled to infer from the document both that the representation was prepared in contemplation of an Australian proceeding, and that the representation was obtained in connection with an investigation (at the least) relating to a criminal proceeding.
	
	
	His submission, however, was that, properly understood, s 69(3) of the Evidence Act does not operate to render the representation inadmissible. In summary, he submitted that, because the proceeding or investigation that related to the creation of the representation to be found in the document was not the criminal proceeding in which the representation was tendered, then s 69(3) does not operate to exclude it. In other words, he submitted that, for the exclusion in s 69(3)(a) or (b) to operate, the proceedings connected with the representation must be the same proceedings in which the representation is tendered. He relied upon what was said by Santow J in Kang v Kwan [2002] NSWSC 1187.
	
	
	I respectfully consider that there are some powerful arguments to the contrary.
	
	
	First, as a matter of statutory interpretation, I consider it important that both s 69(3)(a) and s 69(3)(b) use the indefinite article “a” or “an”, rather than the definite article “the”. In other words, if Parliament had intended the “exception to the exception” to operate only in the limited circumstances for which the Crown Prosecutor contended, I think that Parliament would have expressed itself differently, and semantically linked the connected proceedings with the proceedings in which the representation is being tendered.
	
	
	Secondly, the tide of authority runs very much against the submission. In Lewis v Nortex Pty Ltd (in liq); Lamru Pty Ltd v Kation Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1083, Hamilton J put forward a number of propositions with regard to s 69 of the Evidence Act. In particular, at [4] his Honour said:
	


[4] In my view, the following relevant propositions flow from the section considered in the light of that authority:

(1) It is important, as is general in exercises of statutory construction, to construe words in s 69 in the context of the section and of the EA [the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)] generally. In doing this, it should be borne in mind that the EA supersedes not only the common law but the provisions as to admissibility of business records previously contained in Part IIC of the Evidence Act 1898. What must be concentrated on are the words of this section in the context of the EA.

(2) It is important always to bear in mind that what may be tendered as evidence which evades the hearsay rule under the provisions of s 69 is not documents but representations in documents. In this regard, it is only in relation to the penultimate paragraph of the letter, to which I have referred, that tender is made by Mr Motbey under s 69.

(3) The cases in general terms indicate that the inclusive provisions of subss (1) and (2) of s 69 should be regarded as being of wide import and construed accordingly: Schipp v Cameron (No 3); ASIC v Whitlam at [155], both supra. Equally, the exclusory provisions of s 69 ought be construed as sections of wide import. In particular, it should be borne in mind that the expression contained in s 69(3)(a), ""in contemplation of"" and the expression contained in both s 69(3)(a) and (b) ""in connection with"" should be regarded as words of wide meaning: R v Rondo supra at [96] per Smart AJ.

(4) It should also be noted that what is referred to in subss (3)(a) and (b) respectively is not the proceeding in which the tender of material is sought to be made, or a proceeding to which the investigation referred to in (b) has led, but simply a proceeding or an investigation.

[emphasis added]


	
	That analysis of s 69(3) has been adopted on very many subsequent occasions: see Australian Medic-Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd (2008) 170 FCR 9; [2008] FCA 1038; BestCare Foods Ltd v Origin Energy LPG Ltd (formerly Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd) [2010] NSWSC 1304; and Thaler v Amzalak (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1315. And it can be seen that that analysis is directly contrary to the submission of the Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	Thirdly and finally, the underlying rationale for the “business records” exception to the rule against hearsay is one of reliability founded upon regularity and repetition, combined with an absence of motive on the part of a representor to be untruthful (consciously or unconsciously), in the absence of the possibility of subsequent civil or criminal litigation. Section 69(3) excludes evidence that cannot be characterised as coming within that rationale.
	
	
	In other words, the rationale of exclusion is not based upon the mere fact of whether the representation contained in the document came into existence in connection with this litigation or that investigation; rather, it is founded upon the detrimental effect on reliability that any litigation or any investigation could have upon the representation.
	
	
	In short, the rationale for the admission of business records as an exception to the rule against hearsay, and the rationale for the “exception to the exception”, does not fit comfortably with the reading for which the Crown Prosecutor contended.
	
	
	To my mind, those three factors argued strongly in favour of the evidence being rendered inadmissible by way of s 69(3) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In other words, even accepting (for the sake of argument only) that the preconditions contained in s 69(1) and s 69(2) of the Evidence Act are established with regard to VD ex G by the Crown on the balance of probabilities, I consider that the tendered representation is excluded by way of the operation of s 69(3) of the same Act.
	


Voir dire exhibit H

Attributes


	
	VD ex H is a typed document that bears in its top right hand corner the typed date “4th May 1972”. To the right of that appears in printing “M5182”. The document bears the printed heading “C.C.I.” It pertains to the accused, and records details of his appearance, investigations of his alleged crimes (along with dates), and the details of vehicles and addresses said to be associated with him.
	
	
	The representation contained in that document tendered by the Crown, and objected to by defence counsel, is “ADAMS… Robert John… 19.9.78 Owner of 64 holden sedan. brown/white roof. no DMB 055”. As I have said, the Crown submission, not disputed by defence counsel, was that that part of the document is to be understood as being a representation that, as at 19 September 1978, the accused was the owner of a vehicle that was a 1964 Holden sedan, brown in colour with a white roof, with the registration number DMB 055.
	
	
	VD ex H is a portion of voir dire exhibit M (VD ex M). The latter is a bundle of documents that was located years later in the box of exhibits connected with the investigation of the disappearance of the deceased in September 1983.
	


Undisputed aspects


	
	With regard to questions of admissibility, there was no dispute that a representation that the accused as at 19 September 1978 owned a vehicle with the number plate DMB 055 was relevant, as that concept is defined in s 55 of the Evidence Act. That is unsurprising, because, as I have said, the tendency complainant Ms Brown gave evidence in the trial that she had memorised the number plate of the motor vehicle driven by the man who brutally raped her in late July/early August 1978: either DMB 065 or DMB 055. In other words, the Crown submission is that the representation in VD ex H provides an inculpatory link between the perpetrator of the sexual assaults upon Ms Brown and the accused, which in turn informs the question of whether the accused possessed a tendency said to be relevant to the count of murder.
	
	
	Nor was it disputed between the parties that s 59 of the Evidence Act generally prohibits the receipt of out of court representations to prove the truth of their contents. In other words, unless an exception to the rule against hearsay can be established by the Crown, the representation would be inadmissible.
	
	
	Separately, it was agreed that s 183 of the Evidence Act permits me to draw inferences from documents in determining questions of admissibility related to those documents. In other words, I am entitled to draw inferences, both from VD ex H and VD ex M.
	
	
	A further preliminary matter was that defence counsel resisted any reliance by the Crown upon the mechanistic provisions facilitating proof of a document to be found in s 48 of the Evidence Act. Because the Crown Prosecutor made it clear, however, that he was not relying on that section, I need not discuss it further.
	
	
	Finally, it was agreed that the moving party on a question of admissibility must establish matters of fact on the balance of probabilities, in accordance with s 142 of the Evidence Act. Having said that, there was a dispute about whether the Crown or the accused was the moving party with regard to a particular question; I shall detail that dispute shortly.
	
	
	The exception to the rule against hearsay upon which the Crown relied in support of the admission of the representation contained in VD ex H was, again, the “business records” exception contained in s 69 of the Evidence Act. Admission of the representation pursuant to the section was resisted by defence counsel on a number of separate bases. I have already set out that section, and it is useful to explain my analysis by moving through the constituent parts of the provision seriatim.
	


First dispute – business record as defined?


	
	With regard to s 69(1)(a), the Crown submitted that I would infer on the balance of probabilities that VD ex H is or was part of the records kept by an organisation for the purposes of a business. The submission was that I would infer that the document was part of the records of the New South Wales Police Service, which, it was said, falls within the definition of a business to be found in the Dictionary of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Defence counsel did not deny that the Police Service falls within the definition of a business. He submitted, however, that I could not be satisfied that the document is a business record as defined. That is because, he submitted, as a matter of statutory interpretation I would need to be satisfied not only that the document was a record of a business, but also the record of a particular business.
	
	
	In discussion between Bench and Bar table about a possibly instructive example, defence counsel submitted that, if a party tendered a receipt for a credit card purchase that related to an item of clothing and that undoubtedly emanated from either David Jones or Myer, but one could not tell from which of those department stores it came, then the receipt would not fall within the definition of a business record and would be inadmissible.
	
	
	He went on to submit that the evidence of retired police officer, Mr John Andrews, on the voir dire was against the proposition that the document was a police document, in that Mr Andrews did not recognise the particular page of VD ex M that was a copy of VD ex H as such. Indeed, the evidence of Mr Andrews was that, in his experience, all police documents in those days bore the letter “P”; VD ex H does not.
	
	
	Furthermore, defence counsel submitted that, looking at VD ex H as a whole, it is quite possible that other organisations (such as the Department of Corrective Services, or the Department of Immigration) created and retained such documents.
	
	
	I resolve this first dispute as follows. To my mind, one can safely infer that the document was created for the purposes of a business. By that I mean that it is virtually inconceivable that a person would create such a document – featuring as it does a printed form with typed details, and recounting as it does aspects of the life of the accused over a period of some years – for personal or private purposes. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that VD ex H is a record of a business.
	
	
	Secondly, contrary to the submission of defence counsel, I do not read into s 69(1)(a) of the Evidence Act a requirement that one must be satisfied that a document emanates from a particular business. In other words, returning to the example of the credit card receipt, I would regard such an item as admissible, even if one could not say affirmatively whether it was created by David Jones or Myer. I say that because the sub-section in question does not, by its terms, require specificity about a particular business.
	
	
	Thirdly, and in any event, I am affirmatively satisfied that VD ex H was a document created by the New South Wales Police Service for its own purposes. Drawing inferences from the document as a whole, I do not accept that it could emanate from the Department of Immigration: the document is to do with intersections with the criminal justice system, along with aspects of the appearance of the accused, and vehicles that may assist to locate him, or implicate him in offences. Nor do I accept that the document could have been created by the Department of Corrective Services: it has far too much detail about topics that are nothing to do with sentences imposed or served for that proposition to be correct.
	
	
	To my mind, both in 2016 and in the 1970s, there was only one organisation in New South Wales that could or would have created such a document: the Police Service.
	
	
	As for the evidence of Mr Andrews, it is quite true that he did not recognise the document as emanating from the police. But that is of little weight: he was giving evidence in 2016 about a document that is 40 years old. He has not served as a police officer for many years. Finally, his evidence was that he served as a senior constable, and there may have been all sorts of intelligence documents held by the New South Wales Police Service with which he was not familiar as a uniformed officer.
	
	
	In short, I consider that VD ex H falls within s 69(1) of the Evidence Act, and I resolve the first dispute in favour of the Crown.
	


Second dispute – foundation of representation?


	
	Turning to s 69(2) of the Evidence Act, the requisite representation at its lowest must have been made: on the basis of information indirectly supplied by a person who might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the fact asserted. That concept is in turn informed by the definition contained in s 69(5) of the Evidence Act, which at its lowest is: a person is taken to have had personal knowledge of a fact if the person’s knowledge of the fact might reasonably be supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard, or otherwise perceived.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I would infer on the balance of probabilities that the description of the vehicle, its registration, and the name of its owner are ultimately based on records that were maintained at the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) (which no doubt had a different name in those days). Those records are not available, but it was said that I would be satisfied to the necessary standard that the representation came to be recorded in the document on the basis of information indirectly supplied from that source. Accordingly, it was said that the precondition contained in s 69(2) of the Evidence Act is established.
	
	
	Defence counsel resisted that proposition. He submitted that the provenance of the entry is simply unknown, and one cannot draw inferences about its provenance on the balance of probabilities. If all that one is left with is speculation, one can hardly be satisfied that the representation is founded upon a “chain of information”, as envisaged by the statute. And he submitted that, in the ultimate, an expectation of reliability is an important foundation of the business records exception to the rule against hearsay.
	
	
	Separately, I understood his submission to be that, even assuming that the representation is indeed derived from information held by the RMS, the viewing of a document containing such information by a person, who constituted the first “link” in a “chain of information,” would not suffice for the purposes of the section. That was said to be because the mere viewing or reading of a document of that kind would not constitute personal knowledge of the actual fact of the registration number of motor vehicle.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this dispute, consideration of VD ex H as a whole shows that it records the precise registration numbers of many vehicles said to be associated with the accused. And I have already expressed my satisfaction that the document is a record of the New South Wales Police.
	
	
	I do not accept that one is not entitled to infer, on the balance of probabilities, that those recorded details, including the representation in dispute, are ultimately derived, by way of a chain of information, from records held at the RMS. One can also infer that those records were ultimately founded on the actual act of registration, whereby (in those days) a person would physically present registration papers at a motor registry, pay for the registration of the motor vehicle, and have the papers stamped by way of a receipt by a clerk who recorded that event in the records of the RMS.
	
	
	In other words, I do not accept the thesis of the defence counsel that the “chain” failed to commence with personal knowledge.
	
	
	Separately, and if I am wrong in that primary analysis, I do not accept that the legislation operates so constrainedly as not to permit evidence of a representation about the registration number of a motor vehicle that is ultimately founded upon records about that very fact held by the RMS.
	
	
	It is true, of course, that one may query the correctness of the entry of the representation in the document: assuming that it was based on a chain of information, there may well have been a slip or typographical error along the way. But that is a question of weight, not a question of admissibility pursuant to s 69(2) and (5) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In short, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the representation was made, at the least, on the basis of information indirectly supplied by a person who might reasonably supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact that the accused was the owner of a motor vehicle with the asserted attributes. And I come to that view especially bearing in mind the breadth of the approach to personal knowledge permitted by s 69(5) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In short, I resolve the second dispute in favour of the Crown.
	


Third dispute – connection with litigation or investigation?


	
	Turning to s 69(3), it was agreed between the parties that the sub-section constitutes an “exception to the exception”, as I have discussed previously with regard to my rejection of the tender of VD ex G. But there was a dispute with regard to VD ex H about who bears the onus with regard to that exception. In particular, defence counsel submitted that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, it should be the Crown who bears the onus of proving that a representation does not fall within s 69(3). That was said to be because the excluding facts (including the purpose contained in s 69(3)(a) of the Evidence Act) are very much within the power of the tendering party to prove, rather than in the power of the resisting party to disprove.
	
	
	To be weighed against that submission is the fact that s 69 is an exception to the rule against hearsay. It is uncontroversial that the tendering party must establish that exception. But s 69(3) is a “carve out” from the section if certain circumstances are established. One might well expect that it would be incumbent upon the resisting part to establish (on the balance of probabilities) that “exception to the exception”.
	
	
	Although I prefer the latter proposition as a matter of structure, for abundant caution I have determined the question of the role of s 69(3) of the Evidence Act on the assumption that it is incumbent upon the Crown to prove that the tendered representation does not fall within the exception contained within the sub-section, rather than it being incumbent upon the accused to prove that it does.
	
	
	In that regard, defence counsel submitted that it is noteworthy that VD ex M (of which VD ex H is an extract) was found in the box of exhibits that undoubtedly related to the investigation of the disappearance of the deceased. He submitted that that would play an important role in my determination of whether the tendered representation was prepared or obtained in contemplation of, or in connection with, an Australian proceeding, or whether it was made in connection with an investigation leading to a criminal proceeding (namely, the trial that is being conducted before me).
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this discrete dispute, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the representation in VD ex H is not captured by the exclusion in s 69(3) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	By way of explanation, a sharp contrast may be drawn between VD ex G and VD ex H. VD ex G shows all the hallmarks of a particular document, reciting particular representations, all for the purposes of a particular investigation, leading to a particular charge. In contrast, one can infer on the balance of probabilities that VD ex H is an intelligence report that the police maintained about the accused for their general information purposes. Although it speaks of particular asserted crimes of the accused (stealing petrol in 1972, committing rape in 1975), it cannot be linked to any particular investigation or litigation. Rather, both VD ex H and VD ex M, of which it was a part, are in the nature of overviews of the life of the accused and his physical characteristics, his offending, his vehicles, and his intersections with the police and the criminal justice system.
	
	
	It is true that VD ex M was found in a box containing the exhibits relating to the investigation of the disappearance of the deceased. But I infer on the balance of probabilities that the document was placed there simply to assist anyone who came to re-investigate the matter, not because the document, when created, was connected with an investigation or a proceeding.
	
	
	And in any event, it is important to remember that it is not the document that must be connected with an investigation or a proceeding to be excluded pursuant to s 69(3). Rather, it is the preparing or the obtaining or the making of the representation contained in the document that must possess that characteristic. There is nothing to suggest that the representation contained in the document that the accused was the owner of a particular motor vehicle with a particular registration was prepared or obtained or made with regard to a particular proceeding, or with regard to a particular investigation.
	
	
	In short, I am satisfied that the representation that, as at a certain date, the accused owned a particular motor vehicle, was not related to an Australian proceeding, or a particular investigation, in the ways enumerated by s 69(3). It follows that the exclusion in s 69(3) of the Evidence Act does not operate to render the representation inadmissible.
	


Fourth dispute – probative/prejudicial evaluative judgment?


	
	The final basis for rejection relied upon by defence counsel was the well-known evaluative judgement contained in s 137 of the Evidence Act. That section is as follows:
	


In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.


	
	It was said that the probative value of the evidence is rather low, in that one can hardly be confident that a document from 40 years ago, its provenance lacking in specificity, accurately records the details of a motor vehicle. And it was said that the prejudice accruing to the accused is high, in that there is simply “no one who is able to be cross-examined” about the representation.
	
	
	Turning to my resolution of this final basis of resistance to tender, it is true that the accuracy of the entry is open to valid question, and the mere fact that the details were recorded by no means shows that they were indeed correct.
	
	
	It is also true that, in the recent decision of R v Tai [2016] NSWCCA 207, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal made it clear that, in certain circumstances, the exceptions to the prohibition on the receipt of hearsay evidence contained in the Evidence Act can operate so harshly towards a party (and especially an accused person) that exclusion pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act should occur.
	
	
	Having said that, there is nothing to suggest that the representation was made capriciously or without due care; to the contrary, VD ex H as a whole bespeaks a careful noting of many aspects of the life of the accused.
	
	
	As well as that, in accordance with the approach that commenced with R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228; [2006] NSWCCA 112 and was recently confirmed in IMM v The Queen (2016) 90 ALJR 529; [2016] HCA 14at [47], I consider that I should assess the probative value of the evidence at its highest: that is, on the assumption that the tribunal of fact in the trial will accept the representation as accurate. If that be so, the representation provides an important link between the accused and an allegation significant to the tendency that is the centre-piece of the Crown case for murder. Approaching the representation that way, its probative value is very high.
	
	
	As for the danger of unfair prejudice, a sharp contrast can be drawn, on the one hand, between the facts of R v Tai (in which the hearsay representations sough to be led by the Crown were those of the alleged victim of the count on the indictment) and, on the other hand, the circumstances here (in which the hearsay representation pertains to a particular aspect of the life of the accused almost 40 years ago, albeit an important aspect).
	
	
	To my mind, the true analogue of the facts of R v Tai in this case would be an attempt by the Crown to place the version of events of one of the tendency complainants before me, by way of simply tendering her statement, over objection of the defence counsel. That is a long way from the tender of this single representation contained in a business record.
	
	
	As well as that, there is of course not the slightest onus on the accused at any stage of the trial. Nevertheless, in terms of assessing the prejudicial effect of the receipt of the representation, it is the case that the accused could perhaps adduce evidence, if not of the number plates of vehicles he owned many years ago, then of whether he owned a vehicle matching the description given at all. In other words, the accused is not forestalled, in theory or practicality, from disputing the accuracy of the representation. That plays a role (admittedly a small one) in my assessment of the prejudice of admitting the representation.
	
	
	Finally, by way of a number of separate exceptions to the rule against hearsay, Parliament has made an explicit and longstanding decision to permit representations to be placed before tribunals of fact that cannot be the subject of cross-examination of the representor, and sometimes of the person who recorded the representation, by the opposing party. R v Tai shows that there are limits to that; nevertheless, I consider that that choice made by Parliament is entitled to due deference.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, although I accept that some forensic prejudice will accrue to the accused by the admission of the hearsay evidence pursuant to a mechanism created by Parliament, I do not consider that the danger of that prejudice outweighs the probative value of the representation.
	
	
	In short, I reject the final basis of resistance to the tender of the representation contained in VD ex H.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	It is for the foregoing reasons that I ruled that the tender of the representation in exhibit G would be rejected, but that the representation in exhibit H would be admitted in the trial.

2842379,R v Adams (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 1565,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 27 September 2016, Robert John Adams (the accused) was arraigned before me on an indictment containing a single count. It averred that, on 24 September 1983, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Mary Louise Wallace (the deceased).
	
	
	The accused entered a plea of not guilty to that count. No jury was empanelled, because I had previously ordered that the trial proceed by judge alone: see my judgment in R v Adams (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1359.
	
	
	By the end of the openings of counsel, it was clear that the Crown case was a circumstantial one. It alleged that the accused committed the offence charged on the basis of the doctrine of felony murder, as it was on 24 September 1983. It was also clear that a significant part of the circumstantial case of the Crown was the proposition that, as at the date of the alleged murder, the accused possessed a tendency to choke or strangle women in order to force them to submit to having penile/vaginal sexual intercourse (intercourse) with him.
	
	
	My pre-trial judgment in R v Adams [2015] NSWSC 1960 explains why I considered foreshadowed evidence in support of that tendency to be admissible in the trial. It is noteworthy that that judgment of mine was founded upon the evidence of four women who had alleged that they had been sexually assaulted (the tendency complainants). At the start of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor made it clear that the evidence of only three of those women would be placed before me in the Crown case. Nevertheless, there was no application by defence counsel for me to revisit my pre-trial ruling, or the reasoning underpinning it, at any stage.
	
	
	I consider that it is convenient for me first to set out the evidence placed before me in general chronological form, albeit with some thematic grouping. As I do so, I shall indicate which evidence was undisputed and which disputed in the trial, and briefly explain the nature of any such dispute.
	
	
	Of course, with regard to any person who alleges that he or she has been a victim of a sexual assault, a pseudonym will be used, consistently with all of my earlier judgments, and the procedure adopted in the hearing of the trial itself.
	


Evidence relating to Andrea Hyde


	
	Ms Andrea Hyde was a tendency complainant who gave evidence by Audio-Visual Link (AVL) from a remote location. She was cross-examined in the same way. The following aspects of her evidence were undisputed.
	


Undisputed evidence


	
	Ms Hyde was 28 years old in 1975. As at early August 1975, Ms Hyde was single, and had been sharing a house with Ms Peta Peters, another young woman, for six months in a suburb of Sydney. Ms Hyde had moved in with Ms Peters after having divorced her former husband. She had also had an abortion in late July 1975, and was experiencing bleeding and pain as a result.
	
	
	In early August 1975, Ms Hyde was working at a retail store in The Rocks. She did not drink alcohol, and did not frequent bars, pubs, or nightclubs.
	
	
	As at the same month and year, the accused was living at Munro Street, North Sydney. He had been living there for a number of years with his wife, but they were separated at the time and he was living alone. He was 23 years old, having been born in May 1952. He was employed as a carpenter in the city of Sydney, opposite a now-demolished hotel.
	
	
	On a day that she described as close to the end of the week in winter 1975, and soon after the abortion had been performed, Ms Hyde met the accused at a café near Circular Quay. The accused told her of being the foreman on a building site near there.
	
	
	Ms Hyde described the accused at that time as being “A big bloke, probably six foot at least, thought he was about 28 years of age, he had sort of blondie/brown coloured hair, medium length and straight”. She thought he had blue eyes, and he appeared solid with a medium build.
	
	
	After the two of them chatted for a period at the café, the accused drove Ms Hyde the short distance from there to her workplace. The vehicle that he drove was an old (that is, as at 1975) Holden station wagon.
	
	
	The following day, by agreement the accused came by the workplace of Ms Hyde in his vehicle. She finished work at 6 PM. The general plan was that they would go out to dinner, perhaps to a Chinese restaurant on the North side of Sydney.
	
	
	The accused told Ms Hyde that he needed to change out of his work clothes first, before they went out for the meal. He drove Ms Hyde to a suburb with very large houses and parked the car. The accused invited Ms Hyde inside his home – a small worker’s cottage – for a cup of coffee. The cottage was separate from, and close to, a place that looked to Ms Hyde like a mansion.
	
	
	When she entered the home, Ms Hyde had with her a leather handbag, a purse containing details of her identification, and a pay envelope. She was wearing a T-shirt, a brown skirt, brown tights, and brown leather shoes with a small heel. She was also wearing Moroccan beads as a necklace and “baubly” earrings to match. Because she was experiencing bleeding as a result of her recent medical procedure, she was also wearing a pad.
	
	
	There was no dispute between the parties that the accused and Ms Hyde had intercourse shortly after their arrival at the home of the accused that evening. As I shall detail later, it was firmly disputed between the parties whether that intercourse occurred with or without the consent of Ms Hyde. It was also firmly disputed whether the accused inflicted any violence upon the person of Ms Hyde at or about the time that that intercourse took place. In particular, it was firmly in dispute whether that violence featured him choking or strangling Ms Hyde.
	
	
	Returning to undisputed evidence, after the intercourse, Ms Hyde went to an outside bathroom that contained a shower. She did not return to the inside of the home of the accused. Rather, she left suddenly, without her underpants, her pantihose, her handbag containing her personal identification, and the pad that she had been wearing. She did have with her the pay envelope, and she was carrying her shoes in her hands.
	
	
	The following was also undisputed. At about 6.45 PM on 4 August 1975, Ms Antonia De Boer was driving from her home in Wollstonecraft towards Lavender Bay Scout Hall in Munro Street, McMahons Point. In the backseat were two children whom she was taking to a Scout meeting at the hall. The sun had certainly set by that stage, and the early August evening was very cold.
	
	
	Just as Ms De Boer was about to turn left into Munro Street, she saw Ms Hyde running towards her car. Ms Hyde (who was completely unknown to Ms De Boer) was waving her arms and screaming. Ms De Boer stopped the car, and Ms Hyde opened one of the back doors and got in. Ms Hyde was distressed, crying, and appeared to Ms De Boer to be in a state of shock. In the car, Ms Hyde spoke of a man having attacked and raped her, and said “He tried to murder me”.
	
	
	Ms De Boer drove the four of them to the Scout Hall, introduced Ms Hyde to the Scout Master, Mr Graeme Keed, and spoke to him. At a committal later in August 1975, Ms DeBoer recalled that Ms Hyde had come to the front of the bonnet of the car before she got in. Ms De Boer also recalled that, at the Scout Hall, Ms Hyde was rubbing her hand over her stomach.
	
	
	Mr Keed saw that Ms Hyde was not wearing her shoes, was shaking, half-crying, very much distressed, and appeared very frightened. Mr Keed regarded Ms Hyde as not actually crying, but trembling or physically shaking. He did not see any physical injury to Ms Hyde.
	
	
	She told him that her assailant was over 6 feet, spoke of being attacked, and, when asked by Ms De Boer, stated that she had been raped. It seemed to Mr Keed that Ms Hyde was more focussed on retrieving her belongings from the home of the accused than anything else.
	
	
	Shortly after that, the Scout group leader, Mr Henry Ball, arrived. Mr Ball saw that Ms Hyde was sobbing. Although her clothing appeared generally normal, he noted that she was carrying her shoes.
	
	
	Mr Ball walked to a telephone box, but found that it was engaged. Whilst waiting, he saw a Holden station wagon of a greyish colour with roof racks drive by; there is no dispute that that was the vehicle of the accused.
	
	
	Whilst walking back to the Scout Hall after telephoning the police, Mr Ball saw a man on the street. That man turned around and started to walk back down Mitchell Street in the direction of Munro Street. Again, there is no dispute that that man was the accused. Mr Ball described him as at August 1975 as being about 6 foot tall, slim build, with dark hair and a beard, dressed in shorts, what appeared to be a T-shirt, and short socks and desert boots. Mr Ball saw the accused walk away.
	
	
	On his return to the hall, Mr Ball spoke to Ms Hyde. She said that her assailant had “raped and strangled” her, and that the assailant retained all of her personal belongings, her diary, and her handbag. Ms Hyde asked Mr Ball to go and attempt to retrieve her items. She referred to having been “raped and strangled” three or four times. In the opinion of Mr Ball, she had naturally pale skin and was shivering.
	
	
	Uniformed police in the person of Constable Wayne Hill and Senior Constable Andrews arrived at the Scout Hall at about 7.20 PM. They first spoke to Mr Ball, and thereafter to Ms Hyde, who by that time was sitting in the back of a car. Constable Hill noticed that Ms Hyde was upset and sobbing. Senior Constable Andrews pointed out to Constable Hill the area of Ms Hyde’s neck. Constable Hill noticed red marks on it. Some days later, at the committal hearing, Constable Hill described what he saw as a “General reddening of the area”. Constable Hill also noticed that Ms Hyde had with her what looked like a pay envelope.
	
	
	The two uniformed officers went to the home of the accused in Munro Street and knocked on the door, but there was no answer.
	
	
	Subsequently, detectives became involved in the investigation. One of them, Detective Constable Warren Reid, could not recall at committal having seen red marks to the neck of Ms Hyde when he was speaking to her.
	
	
	Between about 6.30-7.45 PM, Ms Hyde was in the company of Constable Diane Waring. Ms Hyde was crying off and on. She appeared upset and distressed. Constable Waring did not notice any injuries to her throat. At committal, Constable Waring said that, if she had observed injuries to Ms Hyde, she would have made a note of them.
	
	
	Meanwhile, at about 7.45 PM, police forced entry into the home of the accused, who was absent, and took possession of two blankets. They also found an earring in the fold of a blanket. The earring was in two pieces. The earring was shown to Ms Hyde at North Sydney Police Station and she identified it as being her own. Ms Hyde was conveyed to Royal North Shore Hospital.
	
	
	Detectives returned to the home of the accused, and saw a station wagon with registration EFM 336 parked outside. The accused was found to be at home; when he asked “What’s the trouble?”, the police informed him that they had received a complaint of rape. His response to that allegation was “I fucked her, but I didn’t rape her”.
	
	
	The accused was informed of his rights. He informed the police that Ms Hyde had left a number of items at his home, and that they were in his car. He removed a bag containing the items from the rear of his vehicle, and provided them to the police.
	
	
	At about 10.45 PM at the hospital, Dr Grudzinskas examined Ms Hyde. He noted “No abnormalities on head or neck”, although the doctor did note that the entrances of her vagina and anus were slightly excoriated. The doctor noted that Ms Hyde had an IUD contraceptive device in place. She informed the doctor that she had had an abortion 10 days before.
	
	
	Swabs were taken from the vagina of Ms Hyde, her panties, her pantihose, the clothing of the accused, two blankets, and some other items of women’s clothing.
	
	
	Ms Hyde gave a statement to the police later that evening, and photographs were taken of her throat. They were not tendered in evidence before me; my understanding is that they have been lost.
	
	
	Later that evening, Ms Hyde arrived home. Her flatmate, Ms Peters, was in the living room. Ms Peters noted that the face of Ms Hyde was grey. Ms Hyde told her flatmate that she had been raped, and that she had thought that she would be killed.
	
	
	Subsequently, the items seized and the swabs taken were scientifically examined. Human sperm was found on the vaginal swab and smears. Human semen stains were found on the pad, the skirt, the petticoat, the men’s shorts and the men’s shirt. Human blood stains were found on the panties, the pad, the skirt, and the petticoat of Ms Hyde, and also on the shirt of the accused.
	
	
	Ms Hyde gave evidence at the committal, at the end of which the accused was committed to the Supreme Court for trial on a charge of rape.
	
	
	Subsequently, Ms Hyde left Sydney and travelled to Darwin in order to avoid giving evidence in the rape trial. Years later, on 24 August 2009, she gave a further statement to police. The following day, she drew a diagram of the interior of the cottage of the accused. She also gave evidence at the inquest into the disappearance of the deceased on 9 December 2010. Her second statement, and her evidence at the inquest, maintained the position that she had been strangled and raped.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	In short, as I have said, the position of Ms Hyde was that she was forced by severe physical violence in the form of strangulation to submit to intercourse with the accused. The details of that assertion were as follows.
	
	
	Whilst the two of them were in the home, the accused was getting a drink. He said something about sex. She informed him that she was bleeding. Shortly thereafter, the two of them were sitting on a lounge. The accused groped her both inside and outside her clothing. She physically tried to stop him.
	
	
	The accused than bodily picked her up and threw her onto his bed. She made it clear, verbally, that she did not consent to having intercourse with him.
	
	
	The accused placed both of his hands around her neck, and applied pressure to the extent that her ability to breathe was affected. During the physical interaction, one of her earrings came off and was ripped in two.
	
	
	Because she was being strangled, Ms Hyde said “OK, do it”. Her tights, underpants, pad and shoes were removed. She was forced to perform oral sex on the accused. He placed his penis in the vicinity of her anus, but did not penetrate her in that way. At the time she was saying “No, please don’t”, and the accused desisted.
	
	
	After that, the accused had intercourse with Ms Hyde. At the time, the top part of her body was completely clothed.
	
	
	After that came to an end, the accused ordered her to “Go into the bathroom and wash yourself”. He unlocked the main front door of the cottage. Once outside, Ms Hyde ran from the house, leaving behind many of her personal items.
	
	
	The position of the accused about those disputed matters was as follows.
	
	
	In a record of interview in which he engaged with detectives at 3.20 AM on 5 August 1975, the accused said that he and Ms Hyde had indeed engaged in intercourse, but she had done so completely freely. There had been no complaint on the part of Ms Hyde at any stage, and she had said nothing at that stage about having recently had an abortion. He did not bodily pick her up or throw her onto the bed. It was she who had consensually removed her underpants before they had intercourse. After that came to an end, Ms Hyde spoke of having just had an abortion, and the accused described her as becoming “uptight”. Ms Hyde then requested to have a shower. The accused facilitated that, and she went to the outdoor bathroom. After 10 minutes or so he realised that she had disappeared. He agreed that she left behind at his home two bags, her coat, her pantihose, her underpants, and the pad.
	
	
	The accused described walking and driving around the neighbourhood looking for Ms Hyde. Unable to find her, he went to the home of his wife to pick up a sewing machine, and thereafter went to the home of his then-girlfriend to have a meal. On returning home, he found that someone had forced entry to his home. However, because nothing had been taken or damaged, he did not report that break-in to the police.
	
	
	His position to detectives was that he was not aware that Ms Hyde was bleeding or wearing a pad, despite the fact that he had touched her pubic hair. He said that, if he had known that she was wearing that item and was bleeding vaginally, he would not have engaged in intercourse with her.
	
	
	His position was that she had simply left the home to use the outdoor bathroom. Inexplicably, she departed hurriedly, leaving behind a number of her personal items. It was indeed he whom Mr Ball had seen searching for her, both on foot and in his motor vehicle. Unable to find her, he had placed her belongings in a bag that he intended to drop off to her at her place of work.
	
	
	At trial, defence counsel put the following points of dispute to Ms Hyde (in accordance with the well-known rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67).
	
	
	Generally, it was put to Ms Hyde in cross-examination by defence counsel that she had consented to intercourse with the accused, and in the lead-up to that event there was not the slightest coercion or violence directed towards her by him.
	
	
	As for her sudden departure, the following was put to her in cross-examination (TT 660.47-661.2):
	


Q. And you panicked because you had had intercourse after your abortion; is that right?

A. No.

Q. And that's why you ran off from the house that evening, is it not?

A. No, basically, the choking really did it.


	
	In final address, defence counsel said the following (TT 1107.33-37):
	


The position I put to Ms Hyde from memory towards the end of cross examination, she suffered a panic attack at the end, which might well have been as a result of what she experienced shortly before the act of sexual intercourse – I say shortly, I mean within days or weeks, and then had an abortion. And for that reason she had a panic attack and left the flat.

Evidence relating to Ellen Moon

Undisputed evidence


	
	The evidence relating to the tendency allegation of Ms Ellen Moon was received in its entirety in statement and deposition form, without objection by defence counsel.
	
	
	There was also evidence that the accused had pleaded guilty many years ago to having committed the offence of rape against Ms Moon.
	
	
	There was also evidence in the trial that, at the inquest in 2010, Ms Moon gave evidence and affirmed the truth of the statement she had given to police many years beforehand. The transcript placed before me also records that, thereafter, the accused extended an apology for his conduct to Ms Moon.
	
	
	Finally, in both written and oral final submissions, defence counsel made it clear that there was no dispute about the evidence led in the Crown case with regard to the conduct of the accused against Ms Moon.
	
	
	For a multitude of reasons, therefore, the following summary of the evidence can be regarded as completely accepted by the accused.
	
	
	As at 30 May 1976, Ms Ellen Moon was living on the lower North Shore of Sydney. Although neither her age nor date of birth was placed in evidence in the trial, she is described as having been a young woman at that time.
	
	
	At about 8.15 PM, she left an earlier social event to go to the Mosman Skiff Club at the Spit. Whilst there, she drank no alcohol. She danced with a man who introduced himself to her as Bob, and who told her that he was a carpenter. That man was the accused. Ms Moon described the accused as at May 1976 as being: about 5 feet 11 inches tall, of medium build, olive complexion, with long straight hair that was brushed to one side, wearing a brown body shirt and dark pants with a light blue stripe.
	
	
	At the club, the accused spoke of the possibility of dinner and a cup of tea. Ms Moon declined the invitation, and announced that she was leaving. The accused offered to walk her to her car. Ms Moon farewelled her friends, and the two of them left the club together.
	
	
	Whilst they were walking towards her car, the accused stated that he wished to get a jumper from his vehicle. They walked together to that vehicle. Once there, the accused asked Ms Moon more than once to sit in his car with him. She agreed. Ms Moon described the car as a fawn station sedan, with sheepskin seat covers on the inside, and with the back seat down. She noted that inside the vehicle was a light covered container, which looked like a box containing some items.
	
	
	The accused asked Ms Moon whether she wanted to drive to a location where they could see a better view. She replied that there would not be much of a view at night. The accused drove the car around to the other end of the car park.
	
	
	The two of them sat in the car together for a period and kissed. That occurred with the consent of Ms Moon. When the accused tried to undo the top of her jacket, she resisted. The accused became aggressive. He said (referring to his penis) “If you don’t touch me by the time I count to five, I will choke you and kill you”. Ms Moon did not comply with that demand, which featured a threat of death. As a result, the accused pressed hard on her windpipe with his hands, with the result that Ms Moon was struggling to breathe. Ms Moon became terrified that she would be murdered. She said “OK, OK”.
	
	
	The accused then took her hand with his hand and placed it on his penis on the outside of his pants. After that, he removed her shoes and jeans. Ms Moon resisted again. The accused tightened his hold on her throat and said “Either fuck me now or I will fuck you when I kill you, and you won’t be able to talk when you are dead, I will strangle you and throw you in the river”. Ms Moon, fearing death, did not struggle further. Thereafter they had intercourse, including ejaculation, without the consent of Ms Moon.
	
	
	After that had come to an end, the accused said “I’ve done a terrible thing. Take me to the police station”. The accused dressed and then slowly drove the two of them in his car to the car of Ms Moon. She was permitted to leave in her own car, and drove home.
	
	
	At the time, Ms Moon was living in a group house. Her flatmate, Ms Susan Harridge, then aged 22 years, had herself been home for about 45 minutes when she saw a young woman approaching the front door. She recognised the young woman as Ms Moon. Ms Moon ran to Ms Harridge in tears. Ms Harridge noted that Ms Moon was “suffering from redness to the front of her throat. It extended from about the bottom of her throat to the top of her throat and all the front”. Ms Moon told Ms Harridge and another flat mate what had happened to her, and the police were contacted. The police later arrived at the house.
	
	
	At 12.10 AM, Constable Miller spoke to Ms Moon at her home. He described her as upset, and noted red marks around her neck. She was conveyed to Mosman Police Station.
	
	
	At 12.30 AM, two female police officers met Ms Moon at Mosman Police Station. Ms Moon was taken home again, where she changed out of the clothes she had been wearing, and was thereafter conveyed to Royal North Shore Hospital for a medical examination. One of the police officers noticed red marks around the neck of Ms Moon.
	
	
	The examining doctor observed no injuries to the genitals of Ms Moon, but saw signs of recent intercourse. The doctor also noted reddening of the skin of her neck and lower jaw.
	
	
	At 2.15 AM, police went to the home of the accused at Munro Street, North Sydney. There they saw a 1967 Holden Station Sedan, registration EFM 366, parked outside. They also saw a dog that appeared to be a Golden Labrador.
	
	
	The accused identified himself to police, and admitted that the car out the front of the house belonged to him. He was told an allegation of rape had been made against him, and that he was going to be taken to the police station. He replied “Yes, but I want to get dressed first”. The accused expressed his understanding that he was not obliged to say anything, and identified the clothes that he had been wearing that night (which were in his bedroom) and the underwear that he had been wearing (which he was initially wearing, but changed out of prior to attending the police station). The accused admitted that the dog present at the house belonged to him. He agreed to accompany the police, and handed his car keys to one of the officers, who drove his car to the police station.
	
	
	Later, detectives asked the accused whether he would show them where the offence had allegedly taken place. He agreed and told them it was “down at the Spit”. Whilst at The Spit with detectives, he said “I must have been mad”, “I need psychiatric help. I must be mad to do these things”, “If I was of two minds, when I did these things, what do you think I would get?”, and “I do need help”.
	
	
	Later again, the police returned to the home of the accused in Munro Street, North Sydney. There they seized a large carving knife with a sticky substance on it. When spoken to later about that knife, the accused replied “Yes, it’s probably my blood. I thought of killing myself last night, it is a terrible thing that I have done”.
	
	
	A subsequent scientific examination of samples taken by the doctor and police revealed the presence of semen on the vaginal swabs and smears from Ms Moon. Seminal staining was found on the underpants of Ms Moon, and the inside front of the trousers of the accused. Human blood was found on the handle and the blade of the carving knife seized from the house of the accused.
	
	
	Evidence was placed before me without objection that the accused pleaded guilty to the offence of rape, was convicted of that offence in this Court, and was sentenced to a period of imprisonment.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	As I have indicated, there was no dispute about the entirety of this evidence. Rather, the dispute between the parties was about what, if any, role the interaction between the accused and Ms Moon should play in my consideration of the count of murder.
	


Evidence relating to Karen Brown


	
	Ms Karen Brown was also a tendency complainant who gave evidence by AVL from a remote location, and was cross-examined in the same way. The following aspects of her evidence were undisputed.
	


Undisputed evidence


	
	In late July or early August 1978, Ms Brown was aged 21 years old. She had moved to Sydney in 1977 or 1978, and was employed as a clerk at an office in North Sydney. She was single, did not own a motor vehicle, and was a quiet person by nature. About six months previously, she had moved to the Sydney suburb of Lane Cove with Ms Vicki Panton (former name Robinson). They had been friends for a number of years, and would sometimes go out together socially.
	
	
	Ms Brown would occasionally go out to listen to music with Ms Panton at a wine bar in Mosman, and other bars in Wollstonecraft and Cammeray.
	
	
	One evening in late July or early August 1978, shortly after her 21st birthday, Ms Brown went out to a wine bar with a female friend (she could not recall who it was). It was the first time that Ms Brown had visited that bar, and in evidence before me she could not remember its name. She described it as being on the corner of the Pacific Highway and Miller Street at North Sydney. She said that there was a white building opposite the bar. The venue was dark and crowded, and a band was playing. The two young women had left the home at about 9 PM, that being the usual time at which they would go out. Ms Brown was wearing a tweed vest, a brown wrap-around skirt, boots and stockings, and she was carrying a brown handbag.
	
	
	Ms Panton recalled going out to a bar in Sydney one evening with Ms Brown. That was unusual, because Ms Brown was quite shy and did not normally go out with Ms Panton.
	
	
	Shortly before closing time, Ms Brown was approached by a man who introduced himself as Bob. She described him as having blue eyes, a moustache, wearing his hair in a style that was popular in the 1970s in that it came just below his ears, possessing a heavy-set build, and about 6 feet tall. She also described him as wearing either a short-sleeved shirt, or a long-sleeved shirt that was rolled up. He was wearing blue jeans. Ms Brown noted that Bob had a tattoo on his left arm.
	
	
	Ms Brown was not intoxicated at closing time, because she did not drink much and did not have much money. She had consumed a few glasses of white wine over the course of the evening.
	
	
	Ms Panton recalled Ms Brown telling her that she was leaving at about 11 PM or midnight. At the time, Ms Panton saw a man whom she regarded as good-looking and well-dressed standing near Ms Brown.
	
	
	Ms Brown gave evidence that Bob offered her a lift home, which she accepted. His car, a white Holden 4-door sedan, was parked about 50 metres down a side street from the bar. They walked to it and entered it.
	
	
	The man Bob drove off immediately, and took Ms Brown to a nature reserve located a drive of about 15 minutes from the bar. A single road led into the reserve. Ms Brown thought she could see the harbour from where the car stopped, but she could not see the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The man parked the car on a strange angle on the grassed area of the reserve, whereby the exit of Ms Brown from the motor vehicle was blocked by a cliff or rocky outcrop.
	
	
	Ms Brown believed that she and the man Bob would have a “kiss and a cuddle”, and thereafter the man would drive her home and subsequently ask her out.
	
	
	Once Bob parked the car at the reserve, he manually engaged all of the internal locks in the car. Then he suddenly reached over, forced himself on top of Ms Brown, removed her wrap-around skirt, pulled her underwear down, and had intercourse with her without her consent.
	
	
	At the time, Ms Brown was crying. She gave evidence that the man Bob had both of his hands around her neck and was squeezing her throat whilst he was having intercourse with her. Although her airway was not sufficiently blocked for her to pass out, she was terrified.
	
	
	Eventually, Bob ejaculated and the intercourse came to an end. The two of them sat in the car. Ms Brown wanted to flee, but felt that there was “nowhere to run”. They sat there silently for a time.
	
	
	Eventually, Bob drove out of the park. The car travelled somewhere near the Pacific Highway. Ms Brown recalls seeing yellow and green signs displaying the names of suburbs, including Chatswood and Wahroonga. She saw the buildings of Knox Grammar, and a hotel built of stone. Although the car stopped at various traffic lights, all of the internal doors were locked, and Ms Brown was too terrified to try to escape. Around Wahroonga, Ms Brown became exhausted, and stopped taking note of the passing landscape.
	
	
	They arrived at an older house that may have had a veranda. Ms Brown recalls seeing motorbikes in the vicinity of the house. The man Bob led Ms Brown into the house. They walked down a hallway, and she has a vague recollection of seeing an unclean kitchen at the end of it. The man Bob took Ms Brown to a bedroom, closed the bedroom door, and locked it with a key. Ms Brown saw there was a dirty mattress on the floor, which may have been a double mattress. There was other furniture, but she was unable at trial to recall what it was.
	
	
	Bob ordered Ms Brown to take her clothes off; she complied through terror. She lay on the mattress, Bob got on top of her, and they had intercourse again without her consent. At that stage, Ms Brown was crying, telling Bob to take her home, and was experiencing physical pain.
	
	
	Whilst she was being sexually assaulted again, Ms Brown noted that Bob had coloured tattoos – one on his left arm and some on his back.
	
	
	The intercourse came to an end again, and Ms Brown lay very still. Thinking that her assailant was asleep, she got up in an effort to escape. As soon as she did so, the man got up, pushed her back onto the mattress, and commenced to sexually assault her violently again. She pleaded with him to stop and to take her home. She was hysterical, crying, and making a lot of noise. The man Bob refused to stop, and was repeatedly yelling at her to “shut up” and “be quiet”.
	
	
	Ms Brown felt the entirety of the weight of the man on her body. He was very strong, and she was too terrified to struggle to any great extent.
	
	
	Eventually, that episode of intercourse came to an end as well. At some stage during the night, Ms Brown asked the man to let her out of the room so that she could use the toilet. The man Bob told her to “piss on the mattress” instead. Having no other option, Ms Brown urinated on the mattress.
	
	
	At some stage the man left the room, and Ms Brown lay on the mattress for an unspecified time.
	
	
	The next day, after daybreak, the demeanour of the man changed completely. He offered Ms Brown a lift home. She dressed, and was driven by the man Bob along the Pacific Highway. He told her not to tell anyone what he had done, and specifically told her not to go to the police. Ms Brown asked him to drop her at a location near Chatswood that was in fact some distance from her home.
	
	
	Having alighted, she walked behind his car and noted its number plate. She then walked into a block of units, and waited for the man to drive away. She then walked the rest of the way home, because she did not wish the man to know where she lived.
	
	
	When Ms Brown arrived home, her friend Ms Panton came into the room. Ms Brown told her what had happened. Ms Panton gave evidence that Ms Brown appeared upset, and told Ms Panton that she had been raped. Ms Panton took Ms Brown to a friend, Ms Jennifer Goss (former name Greenwood). Ms Goss noted that Ms Brown was “Distressed, teary, and traumatised”. Ms Goss gave evidence that Ms Brown told her that she had been raped. When Ms Goss suggested that the police be called, Ms Brown strongly rejected the idea, and appeared to be frightened.
	
	
	Two police officers arrived, despite the fact that Ms Brown had not called them because of her fear. She told the police some but not all of what had happened. They seemed to Ms Brown to be uncaring, and to blame her for what had occurred. She told the police that she did not wish to assist in an investigation.
	
	
	Some days later, Ms Brown went to a doctor to see whether she had been infected with a sexually transmitted disease. The doctor responded to her in much the same way as the police had done.
	
	
	Ms Brown moved out of her home because she was terrified that the man Bob may have followed her there, and could know where she lived. Ms Panton moved back to her home state, and did not have much more to do with Ms Brown. Ms Brown remains terrified in particular of North Sydney; speaking generally, she has never recovered from her ordeal of almost 40 years ago.
	
	
	On 21 November 2012, Detective Senior Constable Jones (the officer currently in charge of the re-investigation into the disappearance of the deceased) contacted Ms Brown. That was after Detective Jones had read a document that recounted something of the events involving the man Bob and Ms Brown in 1978. Ms Brown expressed her readiness to provide details about what had happened to her. She made a statement to police on 15 January 2013. She provided the police with a sketch of the bedroom of the man Bob, and a sketch of the nature reserve.
	
	
	On 15 January 2013, Ms Brown took part in a photo identification parade. She was shown 20 photographs of young men, each of whom had a full head of dark hair and a moustache. The array became exhibit Y in the trial. She chose two photographs as being “similar to” the man who had raped her. Of the two, she said that photograph number 7 was more similar to the man than photograph 14. Photograph 7 is a photograph of the accused of indeterminate date, although it was clearly taken many years ago.
	
	
	Separately, the evidence of Ms Brown was that she had memorised the number plate of the man Bob so that she could be on her guard if he ever returned, and retained it in her mind for decades. She told Detective Jones in November 2012 that the number plate was either DMB 055 or DMB 065.
	
	
	The typewritten document that became exhibit 4B in the trial contains two representations. The first is that, as at 19 September 1978, the accused was the owner of a 1964 Holden sedan, brown with a white roof, and with the registration DMB 055. The second is that, as at the same date, the accused resided at an address on Hewitt Street, Wahroonga.
	
	
	On 20 December 2013, when arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased, the accused was photographed. As at that date, there was a large tattoo of an eagle extending across his back. He had no other tattoos on his person. Furthermore, during cross-examination of Detective Jones, she agreed that a card produced from the Department of Corrective Services records no markings to his body, other than a small scar on his back and a back tattoo.
	
	
	In his electronically recorded interview (ERISP) of 20 December 2013, after the accused had been arrested on a charge of murder, Detective Jones put to him a summary of the allegation of Ms Brown. One of the responses of the accused was not to deny the offence, but rather to say “No, as I said, I can’t, I can’t recall her, I can’t recall it”.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	There was very little dispute between the parties about matters of evidence pertaining to Ms Brown. There was, however, a significant dispute about what could be deduced from all of the evidence relating to her allegation.
	
	
	The Crown position, in a nutshell, was that I would be comfortably satisfied that the man who brutally sexually assaulted Ms Brown was in fact the accused.
	
	
	The defence accepted that Ms Brown was a truthful and honest witness who was undoubtedly sexually assaulted by a man in 1978 as she described. But the defence position was that I could not be at all satisfied that the assailant who introduced himself to her at a bar in North Sydney was the accused. I shall deal with the competing submissions about this and other disputes later in my judgment, but it is convenient to say at this stage that an important part of the defence submission was that Ms Brown was clear that her assailant had tattoos to much of his body, and in particular on his left forearm. And yet the evidence is that the accused had and has tattoos nowhere except for his back.
	


Evidence relating to the deceased, up to her meeting with the accused


	
	Having summarised the evidence pertaining to the three tendency allegations, I turn now to discuss the evidence about the deceased leading up to, and including, September 1983.
	
	
	None of the following is disputed.
	


Undisputed evidence


	
	The deceased was born in August 1950, and accordingly was 33 years old as at the date of her disappearance. In the late 1960s, she trained as a nurse at Royal North Shore Hospital, along with Ms Pauline Biddle-Broadfoot (former name Biddle).
	
	
	At the time of her disappearance the deceased was living alone at an apartment in Drummoyne, and working as a theatre sister at Hunters Hill Hospital. In surgery, she would often wear clogs that were suitable for use in a sterile environment. She would also sometimes wear clogs socially, they being a fashionable item in the early 1980s.
	
	
	She was a popular, lively, and well-liked person. She had a large number of female friends whom she had met through nursing. She was reliable with regard to commitments, both at work and in her personal life. She was a trusting person. She had enjoyed a number of romantic relationships, but was single at the time of her disappearance, and had subscribed to a “matchmaking” service.
	
	
	In terms of her health and medical conditions, the deceased smoked cigarettes and would drink heavily on occasions. She also had poor circulation in her feet and ankles, had had her gall bladder removed, and suffered from scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine).
	
	
	She had also been diagnosed with Raynaud’s Disease. That is a condition that affects the extremities of the body (the fingers, the toes, and sometimes the nose). As a result of coldness or stress, there can be a painful spasm in the blood vessels leading to the extremity becoming pale or even blue. Some forms of the disease are linked to diseases of the connective tissues that can in turn seriously interfere with the operation of organs such as the heart, the lungs, and perhaps the kidneys.
	
	
	From July until September 1983, the deceased was in a romantic relationship with a Mr Frank Barbara. She had strong feelings for him, which were not entirely reciprocated.
	
	
	On the Sunday evening before Friday 23 September 1983, Ms Biddle and the deceased had dinner together. The deceased was in good spirits, and told her friend that she was organising a farewell dinner for a nurse who was moving to Canberra.
	
	
	After they finished work on the evening of Friday 23 September 1983, the deceased and her friend, Ms Leslie Parker (former name Kennedy) drove together to the deceased’s apartment in Drummoyne. Ms Parker had taken a change of clothes to work, so that she could go to the farewell function without returning home. Each of them showered and changed, and they enjoyed a glass of champagne together before leaving for the dinner.
	
	
	At around that time, Mr Barbara spoke to the deceased on the phone. She informed him that Ms Parker was at her home, and that they were going to the function together. Mr Barbara and the deceased made plans to catch up the following week.
	
	
	The deceased and Ms Parker caught a taxi to the Malay Restaurant in North Sydney. On the way there they picked up Ms Mary Williams, another nursing colleague.
	
	
	Present at the function were approximately 40 guests. Service of the meal was delayed, and quite a bit of alcohol was consumed. Ms Helen Morrison (former name Finn), the guest of honour, was presented with a farewell gift by the deceased. Ms Morrison noted at that stage that the deceased was quite affected by alcohol, in that she was repeating herself and slurring her words. At the end of the evening, Ms Morrison walked home directly from the restaurant.
	
	
	Some time before midnight on Friday 23 September 1983, a doctor offered Ms Parker a lift home. The deceased playfully accused Ms Parker of being “a piker”, and told her that she herself had had a lot to drink. Ms Parker left directly from the restaurant, at which seven to nine members of the party remained.
	
	
	The function at the restaurant concluded. The deceased left the function with Ms Williams, Ms Debbie Mullin and her husband, and Ms Vicki Taylor. They travelled to the Stoned Crow, a nearby wine bar, where they met Mr Chris Liney, and two young women who were in his company. Ms Taylor described the deceased at that stage as being in good spirits, laughing and giggling, but not falling down drunk.
	
	
	Later at the Stoned Crow, the deceased told a number of persons that she had been “bashed”. She said that a man had asked her to go home with him, she had declined, and he had hit her in the face.
	
	
	Ms Taylor gave evidence that it was noted at the Stoned Crow that the deceased could not be found, and people went outside to look for her. The deceased then rushed past Ms Taylor into the women’s toilets of the Stoned Crow. Ms Taylor followed her in, and asked her what was wrong. It was then that the deceased told her that she had been assaulted. Ms Taylor could not see any injuries to the deceased, but noted that she was crying and recalled mascara running down her face. Eventually, the deceased returned to the socialising within the Stoned Crow.
	
	
	Ms Taylor went home from the Stoned Crow at about midnight or 1am on Saturday 24 September 1983 with Ms Mullin and her husband. The deceased and Ms Williams were still at that wine bar when Ms Taylor left.
	
	
	When the Stoned Crown closed at 2 AM, the remaining group comprised of the deceased, Ms Williams, Mr Liney, and his female flatmate travelled on foot to another nearby wine bar, the Alpine Inn. It was there that the accused and deceased intersected for the first and only time.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	As I have said, none of the evidence summarised above was disputed by either party. Nor was there dispute about any other aspect.
	


Evidence relating to the accused, up to his meeting with the deceased

Undisputed evidence


	
	As I have said, the accused was born in May 1952, and accordingly was 31 years old in September 1983.
	
	
	On 27 September 1976, Mr Patrick Besso, parole officer, prepared a pre-sentence report with regard to the accused, who was then incarcerated. Mr Besso had spoken to the accused about the fact that the accused had written letters and poetry to his then-girlfriend.
	
	
	In the late 1970s, Mr Ross Adams (no relation of the accused), then a young man, used to frequent the Crows Nest Hotel and the Cammeray Hotel. At those venues he met a number of men who played rugby. He began to play rugby with the Cammeray Northbridge Rugby Club, and to socialise with the other players and their friends. He went on tour with the rugby club in 1981.
	
	
	In December 1982, Ms Suzanne Newhouse (former name Beckingham) began sharing a flat with the accused. She believed that Mr Ross Adams was also living in the flat at that stage. She had answered an advertisement for a flatmate placed by the accused, whom she understood to have been renting the flat for some years.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Ross Adams was that he met the accused through the rugby club, and it was during the 1983 season that the accused offered him a room in an apartment in Chatswood. When Mr Ross Adams moved in, one bedroom remained vacant, and it was shortly afterwards that Ms Newhouse moved in. I interpolate that that minor divergence between Ms Newhouse and Mr Ross Adams is of no moment.
	
	
	According to Mr Ross Adams, the three flatmates got on reasonably well. It was the habit of Mr Ross Adams to spend about half the week at the home of his parents in Randwick (from Sunday until Tuesday), and the rest of the time at the flat. He would take his washing home to his parents each week.
	
	
	As at September 1983, the accused was working as a carpenter in Lane Cove River Park. He owned at some stage a red VC Holden Commodore, and, as at 24 September 1983, a brown VH Holden Commodore with the registration number MAA 265. He had purchased that vehicle from Sundell Motors, where the vehicles of the accused were serviced by Mr Peter Jones. Mr Jones was also involved in the rugby club, along with the accused and Mr Ross Adams.
	
	
	At about 4 PM on Friday 16 September 1983, Ms Barbra Andrews (former name Pittman) met the accused whilst he was doing some paving work outside his block of flats. They chatted for 10 to 15 minutes. The following morning, Saturday 17 September 1983, Ms Andrews and the accused met again, when she was taking her rubbish out and he was leaving his flat. They spoke for two minutes. The accused invited her to a party, an invitation that she declined.
	
	
	According to a version of events he gave to the Police on 29 September 1983, and in the ERISP in which he engaged on 20 December 2013, the accused finished work on Friday 23 September 1983 at about 4.30 PM. He commenced drinking at various locations on the lower North Shore. He commenced at the Crows Nest Hotel, and from there travelled to Sheila’s Wine Bar. Eventually he arrived at the Alpine Inn, which was across the road from the Stoned Crow, at about 2.20 AM on Saturday 24 September 1983. It was there that he met the deceased.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	None of the evidence summarised above was disputed by either party. Nor was there dispute about any other aspect.
	


Interaction of the deceased and the accused

Undisputed evidence


	
	As I have said, the deceased and the accused met at the Alpine Inn in the early hours sometime after 2 AM on Saturday 24 September 1983.
	
	
	On the arrival from the Stoned Crow of the group that included the deceased, she sat on a bench seat and Ms Williams went to the bar. Mr Liney was sitting on a stool a short distance from the deceased.
	
	
	On her return from the bar with a drink, Ms Williams saw two men sitting next to the deceased, one older and one younger. The older man was Mr Ullie Rabsch, the bar manager of another wine bar on the lower North Shore, who had known the deceased for some years. The younger man was the accused. Ms Williams gave the drink to the deceased and went over to sit with Mr Liney.
	
	
	When Mr Rabsch had first seen the deceased at the Alpine Inn, he had sat down next to her, they had embraced, and he asked how she had been. She told him about having been assaulted at the Stoned Crow by a man because she did not wish to go out with him. Mr Rabsch could see no injuries to the deceased. Mr Rabsch formed the opinion that the deceased was very intoxicated.
	
	
	As I have said, there was no dispute in the trial that the younger man with the deceased was the accused. In evidence, Mr Rabsch recalled the accused as being “amazingly, immaculately” dressed. It seemed to Mr Rabsch that the accused was uncomfortable with the presence of another male. As a result, Mr Rabsch left the deceased and the accused alone.
	
	
	Later, the deceased asked Mr Rabsch whether he would give her and Ms Williams a lift home when he came to leave. He explained that he would be getting a lift himself, and going in the other direction.
	
	
	Ms Sandry Coady (former name Baird) was the flatmate of Mr Liney. She described dancing at the Alpine Inn. She also described taking the deceased to the women’s toilets on a number of occasions, where the deceased was physically sick.
	
	
	Mr Rabsch left the Alpine Inn at about 3.15 AM. He farewelled the deceased, noting that she was still quite intoxicated. At that stage, she was still talking to the accused.
	
	
	At some indeterminate time after the arrival of the party at the Alpine Inn, Ms Williams saw the deceased walk towards the entrance of the bar. The women’s toilets were in the same general direction. The deceased did not return for 15 minutes or so. Eventually, Ms Williams went to look for her friend. As she approached the women’s toilets, Ms Williams saw the accused walking out of the men’s toilets, which were adjacent to the women’s. He did not enter the women’s toilets at that stage. Ms Williams entered the women’s toilets looking for the deceased. There were two cubicles, one of which was locked. Ms Williams banged on its door several times and asked “Are you alright?” There was no reply.
	
	
	Ms Williams walked out of the toilets and saw the accused in the vicinity. She said to him “She must be in there, I can’t get her to unlock the door and she won’t answer”. The accused replied “I better come in and have a look”. Inside the women’s toilets, the accused unsuccessfully used a key to manipulate the locked cubicle door. He then tried to shoulder the door open three times or so, all of them unsuccessful. Ms Williams said “Don’t do that, you’ll break your shoulder”, to which the accused replied “I should be used to it, I’m a policeman”. That was, of course, untrue: the accused has never been a police officer.
	
	
	Eventually, the accused succeeded in kicking the door open. Ms Williams observed the deceased sitting on the toilet, fully clothed, with her head in her lap. Ms Williams asked “Mary, are you alright?” The deceased replied “My head hurts”. Concerned that the door had hit the deceased when it flew open, Ms Williams examined her head for injuries, but saw none.
	
	
	Ms Williams said to the deceased “We better get you up and get you home”. The accused, who was still present, said “I think she’s left her bag inside”, referring to the bar. Ms Williams re-entered the bar and retrieved the purse of the deceased, returned to the vicinity of the women’s toilets, and saw the deceased standing outside them with the accused.
	
	
	Ms Williams, the deceased, Mr Liney, and the accused all walked out onto the footpath. The time is unclear, but it must have been after the departure of Mr Rabsch at 3.15 AM. Ms Williams said “We better get a cab”, but there were no taxis to be seen. The accused said “I’ve got my car here” and pointed to a car parked out the front of the Alpine Inn. In her evidence, Ms Williams recalled it as a reasonably new silver coloured Holden Commodore with clear perspex bull bars. The accused said “I can take her home”. In response to the enquiry of Ms Williams as to whether he knew where the deceased lived, the accused correctly spoke of Drummoyne. When asked by Ms Williams whether he was fit to drive (in terms of sobriety) the accused repeated his earlier lie: “I am a policeman”.
	
	
	By this stage, the deceased was sitting slumped on a step, according to Mr Liney. Ms Williams asked her “Do you want to go home with this fellow?”, to which the deceased replied in the affirmative. Ms Williams helped her friend into the passenger seat of the car. Mr Liney asked the accused if he would be driving near the home of Mr Liney on River Road (in order to obtain a lift himself), but the accused said he was not going in that direction. The accused entered the driver’s seat, and the car drove away from the wine bar in the direction of Willoughby (that is, to the North). Ms Williams left the Alpine Inn with Mr Liney shortly afterwards.
	
	
	As I have said, the departure of the deceased in the vehicle owned and driven by the accused is the last occasion on which she has ever been seen (or otherwise perceived to be alive) by family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances, the police, or indeed anybody in the world other than the accused. That includes security patrols of the Crows Nest area, none of whom were found (on subsequent police enquiry) to have observed the car of the deceased parked where he subsequently claimed it to be.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	The position of the accused, as revealed in his conversation with police on 29 September 1983, and his ERISP of 20 December 2013, is as follows.
	
	
	The accused did indeed drive his motor vehicle, with the deceased as sole passenger, in a northerly direction up Willoughby Road away from the Alpine Inn. He quickly realised, however, that he was too drunk to drive. Having driven about 100m north on Willoughby Road, he turned left (into what must have been Albany Street), and pulled over. He and the deceased then engaged in consensual sexual contact in his vehicle in the early hours of the morning in that public place. Due to his intoxication, the accused was not entirely clear whether actual intercourse took place. He did subsequently believe that his penis had been exposed. He also must have ejaculated, because he subsequently cleaned the front car seats because they were stained with his semen (I shall provide more detail about that activity shortly).
	
	
	After the sexual contact concluded, the accused passed out. He awoke at about 5 AM, and the deceased was nowhere to be seen. He composed himself, drove home, and commenced his Saturday morning.
	
	
	The Crown did not dispute at trial that the accused stopped the vehicle somewhere with himself and the deceased in it. Nor did it dispute that the accused did not drive the deceased home, nor the assertion of the accused that there was sexual contact between the two of them in the vehicle that led to ejaculation.
	
	
	But the Crown submitted that I would be satisfied that the accused did not have intercourse, or indeed any sexual contact with the deceased, with her consent.
	
	
	Rather, the Crown submitted that the combined effect of a large number of circumstances would inevitably lead me to conclude that, shortly after their departure from the wine bar, the accused choked or strangled the deceased in order to force her to submit to sexual contact with him in his vehicle. The Crown also asked me to infer that the act of choking or strangling the deceased promptly caused her death, either by deprivation of oxygen; deprivation of blood to the brain; stimulation of various nerves in the neck (and perhaps other parts of the body), which caused her heart to slow down or stop; or a combination of one or more of those medical mechanisms. That submission was based upon the evidence of Dr Duflou, who gave oral evidence about those mechanisms generally in the trial.
	
	
	The Crown did not allege that the accused, in choking the deceased, intended to kill, or intended to inflict grievous bodily harm, or indeed was recklessly indifferent to human life, as that term is defined at law. Rather, the Crown submitted that the accused choked or strangled the deceased with the intention of having intercourse with her without her consent, well knowing that she was not consenting.
	
	
	As I have said, the Crown submitted that, by way of the doctrine of felony murder, if I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is how the deceased died, then the accused is guilty of the offence of murder.
	


Events of the weekend of 24 and 25 September 1983

Undisputed


	
	Much of the evidence about what occurred on the Saturday and Sunday was in dispute, including with regard to what occurred, the time at which it happened, and the order in which it happened. The following general propositions, however, were agreed between the parties.
	
	
	A “champagne breakfast” was held at the home of “Duke” Smith, a member of the rugby club, in the Sydney suburb of Naremburn. The accused arrived early, perhaps as early as 6.30 in the morning. Many of the guests confirmed that he was present. One guest, Mr Robin Fletcher, observed the accused to produce a case of beer from his boot on arrival. Mr Fletcher recalls discussion at the party that the boot was wet when the beer was taken from the car.
	
	
	More than one guest recalled the accused being at the breakfast in casual clothing featuring a T-shirt, shorts, and thongs, as opposed to his smarter outfit of the evening before.
	
	
	More than one guest saw the accused fall asleep at the social event later on the Saturday morning, perhaps at around 10 AM.
	
	
	Separately, from about 9 AM on the Saturday, friends and family of the deceased tried to contact her. Ms Biddle-Broadfoot telephoned her at home at about that time, but there was no answer. The deceased had a family function organised for the Saturday afternoon or evening, but she neither attended nor telephoned. Because that was so out of character for the deceased, people became very worried about her.
	
	
	Returning to the activities of the accused, at some stage on the Saturday, Ms Barbra Andrews (who, it will be recalled, met the accused the previous weekend) saw the accused out the front of his flat. He invited her to a party that evening. She neither accepted nor declined. He asked her to call him later that afternoon with an answer. She did so at about 2 PM, and accepted the invitation.
	
	
	At about 6 PM, the accused picked up Ms Andrews at her home, but informed her that they should go to the bar of a hotel instead of a party. They returned briefly to his flat, and the accused changed his clothes. They walked to a hotel in Chatswood, and had some drinks there. At about 9 or 9.30 PM, they returned to his home, watched television, and had intercourse. Ms Andrews arrived back at her own home at about 11.45 PM on the Saturday.
	
	
	On the Sunday, Ms Williams, Ms Kennedy, and the father of the deceased met at her apartment in Drummoyne. Knocking on the door received no response, so her father broke in. The three of them went inside, but there was no sign of the deceased. Ms Williams saw the champagne glasses and a small bowl of peanuts just as she and the deceased had left them when the two young women departed for the farewell dinner on the Friday evening. Later on the Sunday evening, her father reported the deceased as a missing person to the police.
	
	
	By the end of the weekend, many family members and friends of the deceased were deeply concerned, and a police investigation into her disappearance was under way.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	Because of the complexities of the various versions of events of the Saturday and Sunday, it is necessary to recount the evidence of each witness, along with the version of the accused, in some detail. It is also convenient to summarise the chronology of versions of the Crown witnesses, and to record the position of defence counsel about that chronology.
	


Suzanne Newhouse 


	
	At about 8.30 AM on Saturday 24 September 1983, Ms Newhouse (the female flatmate of the accused) was asleep in bed. She had retired to bed about 11.30 PM on the Friday evening, and had not been woken during the evening, either by the accused, or Mr Ross Adams (the male flatmate of the accused). She usually slept with her bedroom door open when nobody was home.
	
	
	At 8.30 on the Saturday morning, Ms Newhouse received a phone call at the apartment. The male caller asked where “the bastard” was, referring to the accused. He told her to tell the accused that “PJ” rang, and that he was calling from the Big House Hotel in the centre of Sydney. After the call ended, she went back to bed for a short period. Thereafter, she got up and went to the newsagent to collect the newspapers, and then returned to the flat.
	
	
	At about 10.30 or 11 AM, Ms Newhouse saw the accused return to the flat. She asked how his night had been, and he replied “Just the normal”. The accused obtained a beer from the fridge, went to the lounge room of the flat, and watched television. When seen by Ms Newhouse, he was wearing dark trousers and a cream shirt. Ms Newhouse told the accused of the telephone call from PJ. The accused left the house for a short time, and returned after about half an hour.
	
	
	At about 11.45 AM, Ms Newhouse left the flat. At the time, the accused was in his room with the bedroom door shut. Ms Newhouse returned at about 2 PM, and the bedroom door of the accused was still shut.
	
	
	After about an hour, the accused came out of his room. He was wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and thongs. He told Ms Newhouse that he was going to a party. At about 4 PM, Ms Newhouse left the flat to help a friend to move house. When she left, she saw the car of the accused parked in the street.
	
	
	At about 2 to 2.30 AM on Sunday 25 September 1983, Ms Newhouse returned to the flat and saw that nobody was home. She watched TV in the lounge room, and then went to sleep at 3.30 AM. Nobody was home at the time she went to bed.
	
	
	Ms Newhouse awoke at about 8 AM on the Sunday, and commenced to watch television.
	
	
	At about 9.30 or 10.30 AM on the Sunday, the accused came home. He went to the fridge, obtained a beer, and then went to the lounge room to watch television. Ms Newhouse went out for groceries, and returned 15 minutes later.
	
	
	When she came back to the apartment, the washing machine (which was located in the kitchen) was operating.
	
	
	Later in the day, when the Rugby League grand final was on television, Ms Newhouse did her own load of washing. Once the washing cycle stopped, she went downstairs to hang her washing on the clothesline of the block of units, and saw that the accused had hung his car seat covers on the clothesline to dry. She also saw brown sheets hanging on the line, which she identified as some sheets that she had given to the accused so that they could be given to one of his friends.
	
	
	Later again, Ms Newhouse washed the car of her father, which she was using at the time. She returned upstairs to the apartment, and saw that the accused was present. He left the flat, and she wondered where he had gone. Ms Newhouse entered the bedroom of the accused. From his bedroom window, Ms Newhouse looked down to the parked area at the front of the block of flats, and saw that the accused had the floor mats out of his car and that its boot was open. The car was parked on the paved area at the front of the block of flats. Ms Newhouse saw the accused with a hose in his hand, and she observed him to be scrubbing the interior of the boot. She also saw that he had removed a number of items from the boot, including a bag of tools, some clothes, some tools, a piece of carpet, and an orange towel.
	
	
	Later that evening, at approximately 6 PM, Ms Newhouse went to her parents’ house to return her father’s car, and to have a Sunday roast dinner with her family. At about 9.30 PM, Ms Newhouse returned to the apartment. She saw that the accused was watching a movie on television. After that, he went to his bedroom. She herself retired to bed.
	
	
	On the Monday morning, 26 September 1983, Ms Newhouse rose at about 6.45 AM. Whilst she was getting ready for work, she saw the accused come out of his bedroom wearing his work clothes. Ms Newhouse was aware at the time that the accused was working at Lane Cove National Park.
	
	
	At about 5.45 PM on the Monday, Ms Newhouse arrived home from work. She saw the accused sitting on the lounge. The washing machine was operating. After it had finished, Ms Newhouse saw the accused remove from the washing machine the clothes that he had been wearing on the morning of Saturday 24 September 1983.
	
	
	At trial, defence counsel submitted that there was a significant difference in recall between when Ms Newhouse was asked a leading question in examination-in-chief (with which she would readily agree) as opposed to a more general question in cross-examination (which would result in uncertainty). He pointed to the specific example in her evidence, whereby Ms Newhouse spoke inconsistently of whether or not she had assisted a female friend to pack on the Friday night. He submitted that Ms Newhouse had no independent recollection of the events of 1983 beyond her previous statements, and that she had simply relied on documents in giving her oral evidence in the witness box.
	
	
	Ms Newhouse agreed in cross-examination that she first provided information to police about the events of the weekend when they came to the flat, prior to her first formal statement to them of 2 October 1983. She did not recall, however, what she had said on that first occasion, or the questions that they had asked.
	
	
	She accepted that she did not tell police during that initial questioning that she had observed the accused washing out his boot, but provided this information in a subsequent undated letter addressed to “Sergeant” prior to providing her first statement.
	
	
	As I have said, on 2 October 1983, Ms Newhouse spoke to police. Although her statement of that occasion was not tendered in evidence, one can infer that she told Detective Counsel the following.
	
	
	She said that she arrived home on Friday 23 September 1983 at about 10.30 PM. She went to bed at about 11.30 PM. She was woken at 8.30 AM on the Saturday by the telephone call from PJ. The accused arrived home later that morning.
	
	
	Ms Newhouse also told the police that she had left the home at 4 PM on the Saturday, returning at about 2 or 2.30 AM on the Sunday to watch the America’s Cup sailing race on television. She fell asleep in her bedroom, with the bedroom door open.
	
	
	Ms Newhouse also told the police of a telephone call of 30 September 1983 from the accused, which I shall detail shortly.
	
	
	Defence counsel submitted that Ms Newhouse had not raised the specific suggestion that the accused had hosed out his boot (as opposed to cleaning it with water and rags, which was raised in the letter that was written after her first conversation with police, but before her first formal statement) prior to giving evidence in the trial, despite the unusual nature of such an activity.
	
	
	Defence counsel observed that the timeline provided by Ms Newhouse was inconsistent with the accounts of other witnesses about the movements and clothing of the accused on Saturday 24 September 1983.
	
	
	Additionally, in her original account of the cleaning of the car, Ms Newhouse stated that she saw the accused walk to his car and drive it into the driveway, whereas in the witness box she stated that, when she first saw them, the accused and his car were already in that location.
	


Ross Adams


	
	The evidence of Mr Ross Adams was that he returned to his home on the Saturday morning at about 10 or 10.30 AM. He stayed for only a brief time before departing. At the time, he was playing competitive cricket and “would have been” collecting his cricket whites before playing. Mr Ross Adams passed the accused in the street: Mr Ross Adams was driving away from the block of flats, and the accused was driving towards it.
	
	
	Separately, around the time that the deceased disappeared (but not necessarily on the weekend in question), Mr Ross Adams saw the accused washing his car. He also saw the accused leaning over the boot and, from his bodily movements, Mr Ross Adams inferred that the accused was scrubbing the interior of the boot. Mr Ross Adams saw a carpet on the ground, next to the boot. Mr Ross Adams observed all of this from his bedroom window within the apartment.
	
	
	At some stage shortly after he observed the accused to be cleaning the car in that way, Mr Ross Adams asked him why he had been cleaning his boot so vigorously. The accused told Mr Ross Adams that he had killed some ducks at Lane Cove.
	
	
	On 1 October 1983, Mr Ross Adams spoke to Detectives Counsel and Matthews. The occurrence pad entry of that conversation demonstrates that Mr Ross Adams outlined his movements on the Friday night and Saturday morning, stated that he had passed the accused in the street, and that he appeared to be “just coming home”. Otherwise, Mr Ross Adams could not assist with the movements of the accused on the Friday night or Saturday morning.
	
	
	On 11 October 2010, Mr Ross Adams gave his first formal statement to the police, after he had been contacted by them. As I have said, he had originally been interviewed by police on 1 October 1983, but no formal statement had been prepared at that time.
	
	
	Mr Ross Adams gave a second statement to police on 19 October 2010, 8 days after his first formal statement. In that statement, when speaking of observing the accused washing the boot of his car from his own bedroom window, Mr Ross Adams stated that he could, in fact, have been watching from a window in another room.
	
	
	Defence counsel submitted that the evidence of Mr Ross Adams and Ms Newhouse was contradictory, as Ms Newhouse recalled Mr Ross Adams leaving the house on the Sunday morning, and the accused washing his car on the Sunday afternoon. Mr Ross Adams, therefore, simply could not have witnessed the accused washing his car on that day, because he would have been at the home of his parents.
	
	
	Additionally, Mr Ross Adams could not be clear about the specific day that he allegedly saw the accused washing his boot, but only noted that it was around the time of the disappearance of the accused.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Ross Adams stated that he had asked the accused why he was washing his boot, and the accused had provided the explanation that he had been transporting ducks, which defence counsel submitted was a plausible explanation.
	
	
	Defence counsel also submitted that Mr Ross Adams provided inconsistent evidence about occasions on which he had previously witnessed the accused cleaning his car.
	
	
	Finally, defence counsel pointed to the fact that, for whatever reason, Mr Ross Adams is recorded in the occurrence pad entry as saying nothing about having seen the accused washing his car in general, or its boot in particular, when first spoken to on 1 October 1983. To express that proposition another way, Mr Ross Adams said nothing to police about that until the time of his first formal statement of 11 October 2010, 27 years after the alleged events that he was then recounting.
	


Barbra Andrews


	
	Ms Barbra Andrews gave evidence that she recalled seeing the accused dressed in shorts, thongs and a casual top on the Saturday of the weekend in question. At the time, either he was washing his car or she was washing hers. The accused invited her to a party, and the arrangement was made that she would call the accused after 2 PM. Ms Andrews spoke of the accused changing at his home, the undisputed visit to the bar, the two of them walking to the hotel at Chatswood, their return to his home, and the subsequent intercourse.
	
	
	Ms Andrews also gave evidence that, on the Sunday at 3 PM, she went for a drive with her sister and daughter. The car broke down and had to be towed to a service station. The three of them walked home. Whilst walking, Ms Andrews saw the accused in the driver’s seat of his car. In the witness box, Ms Andrews recounted that she in fact saw the accused hosing out the boot of his car on that occasion.
	
	
	Despite their sexual contact the evening before, Ms Andrews did not speak to the accused. She gave evidence in the trial that that was because she was fearful of the accused, as a result of how he had treated her the preceding evening.
	
	
	That evidence, however, was not notified to the accused as tendency evidence. Furthermore, despite me granting an application for the re-examination of Ms Andrews to be deferred so that the Crown Prosecutor could confer with her, no re-examination was conducted. Finally, the Crown Prosecutor did not rely on that evidence, perhaps suggestive of sexual violence on the Saturday evening, in any way in his final address. In those circumstances, I interpolate that I have put the nebulous allegation made by Ms Andrews from my mind.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Andrews could not be certain whether she had informed anyone, prior to entering the witness box in the trial, that she had observed the accused to be cleaning his boot on Sunday 24 September 1983. That included, notably, when she was speaking to Detective Jones, the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Crown Prosecutor, in 2016.
	


Version of the accused


	
	As I have said, the accused was interviewed by Detectives on 29 September 1983. Although no contemporaneous documentary or other record of that interview was created, at trial the accused did not dispute what he was alleged to have said. Furthermore, during the ERISP of 20 December 2013, the substance of his version of events of 30 years before was put to the accused, and he was content with it. I proceed to summarise his version of what occurred on the Saturday and Sunday.
	
	
	The accused fell asleep in the driver’s seat of his vehicle after the sexual contact with the deceased came to an end. He awoke in the same position at about 5 AM on the Saturday. The deceased was nowhere to be seen, and the accused assumed that she had simply departed and made her own way home.
	
	
	The accused drove himself home, drank two beers, changed his clothes, and did some washing in the form of sheets, pillow cases, and work clothing. That household task was undertaken very early on the Saturday morning, because he left home at Chatswood in time to arrive at the champagne breakfast at Naremburn by around 7 AM. He took a case of beer with him to that social event.
	
	
	Eventually, he fell asleep in the backyard, waking again at about 12 midday. He returned home, had a shower, and returned to the party at about 2 PM. He returned to his home a third time that day at 6.30 PM.
	
	
	Later that evening, the accused had intercourse with Ms Andrews. His version of the events leading up to that generally conformed with her chronology. According to the accused, she left his flat at about 1 AM on the Sunday.
	
	
	The position of the accused was that, during the day on the Sunday, he stayed at home, drank some beers, watched the Rugby League grand final in the afternoon, and thereafter watched a murder mystery on television.
	
	
	His version was that, on the Monday, he went to work at the Lane Cove River Park at about 7.30 AM. In the afternoon, back at the block of units, he washed his car seat covers because they were stained with semen, as a result of the sexual contact between the deceased and himself very early on the Saturday morning. He took the opportunity to vacuum the car, and also to rinse the boot in search of a leak that had developed.
	
	
	I interpolate that there was evidence in the trial that Holden Commodores of the early 1980s suffered from a build defect, whereby the seals of their boots were imperfect, with the result that their boots would leak. Having said that, Mr Peter Jones (who, it will be recalled, was employed at the car dealership and service centre) spoke of a procedure whereby two workers would be needed to identify the site of the leak: one would be enclosed in the boot with a torch, and the other would be outside spraying water onto the boot.
	
	
	I also interpolate that defence counsel submitted that I should approach the version of the accused (about cleaning his car and hosing the boot on the Monday afternoon) as being easily mistaken, one way or another. In other words, it was said that I could take the view, on all of the evidence, that the accused may well have been speaking of the day before, the Sunday, as the day of the car cleaning and boot hosing, not the Monday, when he spoke to detectives on 29 September 1983, and on 20 December 2013 in the ERISP. In the alternative with regard to how such an error may have developed, he submitted that the police in 1983 may have made a slip of a day with regard to the version given by the accused, especially bearing in mind that the notes of the interview were not adopted by the accused.
	


Events subsequent to the weekend

Undisputed evidence


	
	On Tuesday 27 September 1983, Ms Williams made a statement to police about the events of the evening of 23 September 1983. She prepared an identikit picture of the man who departed the Alpine Inn with the deceased. A copy of that image became exhibit A in the trial. It was not disputed in the trial that the image approximates the appearance of the accused that weekend.
	
	
	On 29 September 1983, information was provided to investigating police to suggest that the accused may have been the man that departed the Alpine Inn with the deceased. The detail of the information was not further pursued in the evidence in the trial.
	
	
	At 11.15 PM on Thursday 29 September 1983, Detective Senior Constable Counsel and Detective Senior Constable Matthews observed the accused driving his vehicle. They caused it to be stopped, spoke to the accused, conducted a search of the vehicle, and located cannabis under the driver’s seat.
	
	
	Both the accused and his motor vehicle were taken to North Sydney Police Station. The car was seized by police, and retained for a number of weeks. The accused was interviewed there with regard to his interaction with the deceased (I have already provided a summary of what the accused said on that occasion). After the interview was completed, the accused was charged with possessing a prohibited drug (the cannabis located in the vehicle), and impersonating a police officer (based on the things that he had said at the Alpine Inn).
	
	
	On the same evening, Mr Robin Fletcher, an associate of the accused from the rugby club, was telephoned by the accused. The accused asked Mr Fletcher to bail him out on his two pending charges. The accused also said “Tell the sergeant what I was wearing”, referring to the attendance of the accused at the champagne breakfast on the Saturday morning. Mr Fletcher told the detectives that the accused was wearing a T-shirt, black shorts, and a pair of thongs. The accused was released to bail.
	
	
	On Friday 30 September 1983, Detective Counsel attended the apartment of the deceased in the company of Detective Sergeant Butcher (nowadays he would be referred to as a scene of crime officer) and Dr Baxter (an analyst from what is now known as the Forensic and Analytical Science Service (FASS)). Fingerprints were collected from the scene, along with a hairbrush that contained a number of hairs.
	
	
	On the same day, the accused telephoned Ms Newhouse at about 3 PM. He asked her why she had let the police into the flat they shared, and told her that she had no right to do so. That was in reference to the occasion earlier in the week when the police arrived at the flat, Ms Newhouse allowed them entry into the flat, and she briefly spoke to them. The accused also asked her what she had told police. Ms Newhouse explained that she had no familiarity with police, and said “What else was I supposed to do?” She refused to tell the accused what she had told the police. After that phone call, Ms Newhouse promptly moved out of the shared flat in Chatswood.
	
	
	As I have previously detailed, police spoke to Mr Ross Adams and Ms Newhouse on 1 October 1983 and 2 October 1983 respectively.
	
	
	On 5 October 1983, detectives went to the Lane Cove River. Nothing of relevance was located.
	
	
	In the meantime, Dr Baxter was in the process of examining the motor vehicle of the accused. A fingerprint was found on the interior of the boot, but it was the fingerprint of neither the deceased nor the accused.
	
	
	On 5 October 1983, enquiries were made with security patrols in the Crows Nest area. As I have said, no record of the vehicle of the accused being seen parked in that area in general, or Albany Street in particular, was able to be located.
	
	
	On 6 October 1983, Detective Walsh (a scene of crime officer) vacuumed the boot of the car of the accused. He placed the contents in a brown paper bag. He labelled it “83/1363, Re missing person Mary Louise Wallace, Matter vacuumed from boot of Holden Commodore Sed. No. MAA-265, B.J.W D/Sgt 2/C Chatswood, 6/10/83”, and signed it. He handed the paper bag to Detective Milroy. There was no detail in the trial about precisely how all of that was done.
	
	
	Separately, the vacuum cleaner of the accused was seized, along with its contents. That was because the accused had told police that he had used his vacuum cleaner to clean the interior of his car some time after his interaction with the deceased.
	
	
	On 7 October 1983, police confirmed that the deceased had been subscribed to a telephone dating service whereby she could meet men for possible romance.
	
	
	Around the time of the week of the 14 October 1983, the police commenced to search in bushland near Delhi Road, Lane Cove Road, Lady Game Drive and Bradfield Road in the Northern Suburbs of Sydney. Police divers searched the Lane Cove River. Nothing of relevance was found.
	
	
	Meanwhile, during the week of 20 October 1983, Ms Susan Holman (former name West) commenced work at a kiosk at Lane Cove National Park. At about 1 PM on a day during that week, the accused came to the counter of the kiosk and spoke to Ms Holman.
	
	
	He said that he had just divested himself of $10,000 by giving it to his solicitor. He also said that he was suspected of murdering “the nurse from Crows Nest” and that he was the “prime suspect”. In answer to an enquiry of Ms Holman, the accused said that he was not the boyfriend of the deceased, but had just met her that night. He said that he had driven the deceased around the corner, and had passed out with his pants around his ankles. He told Ms Holman that he did not remember anything. He also said “Do I look like I have a murderer’s face?”
	
	
	The accused told Ms Holman that he was subject to “holding charges” and could not go anywhere. He also said that his financial situation was being investigated.
	
	
	The accused also said to Ms Holman “You better watch out, or I might hit you over the head and rape you as well”. Ms Holman riposted “If you do that, you might find yourself with a knife in your guts”. The accused laughed and walked off. Cross-examination of Ms Holman showed that it was disputed between the parties at trial whether the accused appeared to be joking or not.
	
	
	At some stage during the conversation, Ms Holman had told the accused that the kiosk had a problem with mice. One or two days later, the accused returned to the kiosk, and told Ms Holman that he had a solution to the mouse problem. He produced an upturned coffee cup. Underneath it was what Ms Holman believed was a live funnel web spider. She felt frightened by the actions of the accused.
	
	
	A few days later, Ms Holman was about to close up the kiosk. Whilst she was on the phone, the accused appeared. The accused asked for a Cornetto ice-cream, and she gave it to him. He also spoke of setting up a mouse trap.
	
	
	Whilst she was locking up, the accused placed his arm around her waist, and rubbed his body up and down against her. She removed his hand from her person, locked the door of the kiosk, and walked straight to her car. Later, she told her boyfriend what had happened, and promptly made a statement to the police.
	
	
	On 10 November 1983, investigating police received an anonymous handwritten letter. It was to the effect that the body of the deceased was buried in a crevice in bushland. The letter enclosed a portion of a page from a street directory, with an area marked as a suggested location for a search.
	
	
	A photo of the letter became exhibit XXX. It is clear that the author of the letter had a command of English spelling, punctuation, and grammar. The postmark on the envelope of the letter is Katoomba, and the date of the postmark is 7 November 1983. A fingerprint was detected on the letter. It was not that of the accused.
	
	
	On 10 November 1983, investigating police took the material vacuumed from the boot of the car of the accused, along with hairs obtained from the hairbrush, to the laboratory at Lucas Heights for the purpose of an examination that featured irradiation.
	
	
	Chief Inspector John Goulding conducted that examination. No meaningful results could be obtained.
	
	
	A couple of weeks after 10 November 1983, detectives retrieved the samples from Lucas Heights that had not been destroyed, and placed them at the Chatswood Crime Scene Office.
	
	
	In early 1984, the police received a letter relating to the disappearance of the deceased. It bore a postmark that showed the place of mailing as Dee Why and the date as 20 February 1984. The author of the letter does not have a good command of spelling in the English language. The letter refers to details surrounding the disappearance of the deceased, including the number plate of the vehicle of the accused, and the fact that the deceased lived in Drummoyne. The letter also refers to there having been sexual contact between “RA” and the deceased. Although there had been significant publicity about the disappearance of the deceased, Detective Counsel gave evidence in the trial that the version of events of the accused (including that there had been sexual contact between himself and the deceased) had not been promulgated.
	
	
	The author of that second letter is, one might infer, a very disturbed person.
	
	
	Police made a number of searches in the subsequent months and years. They included at Lane Cove National Park, where the accused was employed. They also included searches in accordance with the map received with the anonymous letter in late 1983. Nothing of relevance was located.
	
	
	By 1988 or 1989, Mr Ross Adams was still living with the accused. The accused commenced a romantic relationship with a woman called Linda, and the two of them purchased a house together in Gladesville. The accused and Linda moved into that home. Mr Ross Adams moved in with them as a tenant.
	
	
	Some time in 1988 or 1989, Mr Ross Adams was drinking with the accused at Gladesville RSL Club. Mr Ross Adams ventured to ask “What happened to that nurse?” The accused leant over, put his face quite close to that of Mr Ross Adams, and said in a serious tone “What’s that to you?” That way of communicating, including tone of voice, was not the usual way in which the accused and Mr Ross Adams spoke to each other.
	
	
	Eventually, the investigation wound down without any person being charged with an offence relating to the disappearance of the deceased.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	Mr Ross Adams gave evidence of the following.
	
	
	Shortly after the incident at the RSL Club, the accused and his partner Linda were in the backyard at Gladesville. Mr Ross Adams told them that he was leaving the home in two weeks; in other words, he gave them two weeks’ notice as a tenant. He re-entered the home and sat on his bed.
	
	
	The accused entered the bedroom. He told Mr Ross Adams to leave by the following Wednesday, which was about three days afterwards. The accused also grabbed Mr Ross Adams by the neck, shoved his head down between his legs, and held it at a point below the knees of Mr Ross Adams. That enforced position applied pressure to the neck of Mr Ross Adams, and he found it difficult to breathe as a result.
	
	
	After a time, the accused released his grip. The accused asked for the house key back, and spoke of returning rent already paid in advance by Mr Ross Adams, but the latter declined the offer. The accused told Mr Ross Adams that he was going out for a drink.
	
	
	Mr Ross Adams was frightened by what had occurred. He gathered up his belongings and drove to the home of his parents, because he was afraid of what the accused may do to him on his return.
	
	
	I interpolate that that alleged event was not relied upon by the Crown as revealing any tendency on the part of the accused. Nor was it relied upon as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused. As I understood it, it was merely relied upon to show that the accused was angry with Mr Ross Adams for raising the question of the disappearance of the deceased.
	


Re-activation of the investigation

Undisputed evidence


	
	In October 2002, the New South Wales Police re-activated their enquiry into the disappearance of the deceased. Detective Sergeant Puffet became the officer in charge of the investigation. Efforts were made to locate all of the items seized as exhibits in the original investigation, all of the statements taken, and all of the documents otherwise created. That included Detective Puffet and another police officer locating a cardboard box at the Mosman Police Station storage unit that was labelled to the effect that it contained the exhibits from the original investigation. The exhibits were extracted, examined, photographed, and held securely.
	
	
	At some stage, Detective Puffet and other police inspected the original search sites, including the area around the Lane Cove National Park observation deck (which had been demolished since 1983), and Kuring Gai Chase National Park. Nothing was found.
	
	
	There was also physical surveillance of the accused at certain stages. No incriminating evidence was derived from that process.
	
	
	A number of exhibits thought to be from the original investigation were conveyed to the FASS for DNA analysis. They included the hairs vacuumed from the boot of the vehicle of the accused, and the hairs from the hairbrush inferred to belong to the deceased. They were examined, and judged not to be suitable for nuclear DNA testing.
	
	
	In 2007, Mr Ross Adams saw the accused. That was at a reunion of the rugby club.
	
	
	In about 2009, persons who had previously given statements to the investigating police shortly after the disappearance of the deceased began to give further statements. They included Ms Mary Williams, Mr Chris Liney, and Ms Leslie Parker.
	
	
	Ms Parker, when shown a photograph of the boot of the accused depicting it to contain a clog, came to the firm view that she could not only identify that item as the same kind of clog that the deceased used to wear, but also that she was able, 30 years later, to identify that mass-produced item from a photograph as the clog that the deceased wore.
	
	
	I interpolate that the Crown Prosecutor did not rely on that as evidence of identification, but, at the most, as evidence of similarity. Nor was it his case, he confirmed, that the accused had disposed of the body of the deceased, but inexplicably left one of her clogs in the boot of his vehicle. Accordingly, I put the assertion of identification by Ms Parker to one side.
	
	
	By 2010, Detective Jones had become the officer in charge of the investigation. It was during that year that Detective Jones and the accused first met. They had a conversation at his home with regard to the fact that an inquest into the disappearance of the deceased would be conducted in the Coroner’s Court.
	
	
	Between 5 and 7 October 2010, a further excavation of a location in Lane Cove National Park took place. Nothing of relevance was found.
	
	
	After the investigation was recommenced, very extensive bureaucratic and administrative searches were undertaken to see whether there was any sign of the deceased still being alive. I refer to such things as inquiries with all police services in Australia, Centrelink, the Department of Immigration, the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, all major financial institutions in Australia, the Health Insurance Commission, and the Australian Taxation Office. There was also a process of checking unidentified bodies found in New South Wales since the disappearance of the deceased. No sign of the deceased was detected.
	
	
	On 2 December 2010, Detective Jones contacted Sundell Motors (from where the vehicle the accused owned as at 23 September 1983 had been purchased, and where he had been in the habit of having it serviced). The business had closed down six months prior, and the last principal of the business informed her that no records had been kept for the period prior to the 1990s.
	
	
	An inquest was conducted in December 2010. Many witnesses who gave evidence in the trial before me also gave evidence at the inquest.
	
	
	On 14 December 2010, Dr Duflou, forensic pathologist, gave evidence in the inquest into the disappearance of the deceased about possible mechanisms of death as a result of manual strangulation.
	
	
	In late 2013, further scientific investigations were conducted. A swab was taken from the inside cheek of the sister of the deceased for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) comparison purposes.
	
	
	The swab from the sister of the deceased, the hairs said to be from the hairbrush, and the hairs said to be from the vacuuming of the boot, were sent to Dr Dadna Hartman at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Victoria for mtDNA testing.
	
	
	Hairs said to be from the vacuuming of the boot of the deceased, and hairs said to be from the hairbrush, were sent to Ms Elizabeth Brooks, expert hair analyst within the Australian Federal Police in Canberra.
	
	
	In her report of 15 January 2014, and a supplementary report of 10 June 2014, Ms Brooks made clear that all of the hairs located had been naturally shed; there was nothing to suggest that they had been pulled out. She also expressed the opinion that the hairs vacuumed from the boot were identical to the hairs taken from the hairbrush. At trial, whilst accepting that there was no statistic that expressed the rarity of that occurrence, she expressed the opinion that such a match is “incredibly rare”.
	
	
	In her reports of 12 December 2013, 3 March 2014, and 20 July 2016, Dr Hartman expressed the opinion that the hairs vacuumed from the boot had the same mtDNA profile as the hairs taken from the hairbrush. The buccal swab from the sister of the deceased revealed a slightly different mtDNA profile, but Dr Hartman expressed the opinion that that variation was not exclusionary, and could be explained as a natural variation between siblings.
	
	
	Dr Hartman provided many calculations seeking to reflect the rarity of such a match. Her final position, encapsulated in a Power Point presentation that became exhibit 4E, was that, adopting a conservative approach, 1 in 518 persons in the Australian community would be expected to possess that mtDNA profile.
	
	
	In the morning of 20 December 2013, the accused was arrested at his home on a charge of murder. He accompanied Detective Jones and other police to a police station. There he engaged in an ERISP, which commenced at 9.53 PM, and concluded at 11.41 PM. There was no evidence in the trial about the reason why that process was so delayed.
	
	
	As I have said, in summary, the accused confirmed the correctness of what he had said to police literally three decades previously. For convenience, I shall briefly repeat some aspects of his version.
	
	
	He agreed that he owned a brown Holden Commodore in 1983.
	
	
	He agreed that, in 1983, he had told police that he was a carpenter at Lane Cove River Park. He also agreed that he had told police that, on Friday 23 September 1983, he had finished work at about 4.30 PM, gone home, consumed a few beers, and watched a movie. From 7 PM until 12 midnight on Friday 23 September 1983, he was at the Crows Nest Hotel drinking with friends. He could not recall going to Sheila’s wine bar afterwards.
	
	
	He did recall going to the Alpine Inn at approximately 2.20 AM on Saturday 24 September 1983. He had driven there, and believed that he might have parked out the front of the wine bar. His estimate was that he had consumed 20 to 30 schooners of beer before arriving at the Alpine Inn. The accused recalled talking to the deceased at the Alpine Inn, and attempting to “pick her up”.
	
	
	He recalled the incident in which he had kicked open the door of the cubicle in the women’s toilets, and seeing the deceased inside. He also recalled having described himself as a police officer or an airline pilot. He explained that he was in the habit of telling lies about his occupation in order to impress women.
	
	
	He recalled the deceased telling him that she lived in Drummoyne, and the fact that he had offered her a lift. He told the detectives in the ERISP that, in fact, his intention had been to take the deceased to his house, and to have consensual intercourse with her.
	
	
	The accused told police that, at the time he drove away from the Alpine Inn, he was drunk. After he drove the car around the corner, he pulled over, feeling “fazy” or “fuzzy”. He recalled that he and the deceased “fooled around”, but did not, at the time of the ERISP, recall whether they had had intercourse. When he woke up in his car, the deceased was gone. Although he accepted that he had told police in 1983 that he had woken at approximately 5 AM, at the time of the ERISP he was unsure of the time.
	
	
	After that, the accused drove to his flat in Chatswood, drank two beers, and changed his clothes. He did not see either Ms Newhouse or Ms Ross Adams when he returned home. His estimate was that he would have arrived home at about 5.10 AM, based upon the assumption that he had woken at 5 AM, and the fact that it would have been a short drive from Crows Nest to Chatswood.
	
	
	At the time of the ERISP, the accused did not remember the time at which he arrived at the champagne breakfast, but agreed with his earlier statement (when he was reminded of it) that it would have been at about 7 AM. There he consumed a few beers, and then went to sleep on the grass in the backyard. He also accepted his earlier version to the effect that he had woken up at about midday.
	
	
	He recalled meeting Ms Andrews, and having intercourse with her on the Saturday evening.
	
	
	On Monday 26 September 1983, he went to work at Lane Cove River Park between 7.30 AM and 4.30 PM. He washed the seat covers of his car that afternoon. As I have already explained, defence counsel submitted that it could well be that either the accused or the police were mistaken by 24 hours in that regard. He washed his car, and hosed the boot to see whether it was leaking.
	
	
	He worked on the Tuesday and Wednesday, and on the Wednesday evening went out with another young woman who lived in Artarmon.
	
	
	On Thursday 29 September 1983, the accused was arrested whilst driving his car. He recalled the police seizing his vehicle for a time, and his vacuum cleaner. He also recalled giving a sample of his blood.
	
	
	At the time of the ERISP, he could not recall the details of his previous cars.
	
	
	As for Ms Newhouse, he could not recall how long she lived with him. He denied that he would have washed the boot of his vehicle with water and rags. He noted that his corroborated presence at the champagne breakfast contradicted the timeline of events of the Saturday morning given by Ms Newhouse.
	
	
	The accused could not, at that stage, provide any explanation as to why a hair of the deceased may have been in the boot of his car.
	
	
	The interview concluded with the accused informing the independent officer that he had no complaints about any aspect of it.
	
	
	As I have said, various forensic procedures were conducted upon the accused, including the taking of photographs of a very large tattoo on his back. Those photographs became exhibit T in the trial.
	
	
	On 23 July 2015, Detective Jones confirmed from Detective Counsel that Detective Walsh had been stationed at Chatswood Police Station between 6 and 13 October 1983. Detective Counsel also confirmed that Chatswood Police Station had a secured exhibit room in the early 1980s.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Matthias Zierholz, handwriting expert, gave evidence in the trial on 19 October 2016. His evidence was based upon two statements of his, the first of 13 December 2010, and the second as recent as 14 October 2016.
	
	
	He had been asked to examine the letter and extract from a street directory that were sent to police on 7 November 1983 (Exhibit XXX and Exhibit M); the subsequent letter sent to police on 20 February 1984 (Exhibit N, its envelope being depicted in exhibit O); and to compare those documents with letters sent by the accused from prison in 1986.
	
	
	In a nutshell, he came to the view that the samples of writing were different. He expressed the opinion, however, that there could be three explanations for that difference.
	
	
	The first is that the samples of writing were created by different persons.
	
	
	The second is that they were created by the same person, who deliberately disguised his or her handwriting.
	
	
	The third is that they came from the same person, but his or her handwriting had changed over time.
	
	
	On reflection, Dr Zierholz ruled out the second possibility of disguise. Dr Zierholz did not rule out the third possibility (same author, but change in writing over time), as a matter of prudence, because he felt that he had insufficient material upon which he could do so.
	
	
	In other words, the opinion of the handwriting expert was inconclusive: neither a definitive exclusion of the accused, nor a definitive inclusion.
	


Disputed evidence


	
	I have recounted the above as undisputed evidence. To be clear, however, defence counsel raised the possibility that the chain of possession of the various seized hairs may not be perfectly sound. He also provided a detailed criticism of the opinion of Ms Brooks and, to a lesser degree, Dr Hartman, although that criticism did not constitute his primary position. I shall detail those criticisms later in this judgment.
	
	
	That completes my conspectus of the evidence, both undisputed and disputed, that was placed before me. I now turn to discuss the legal principles that I have applied in my analysis of that evidence.
	


Directions


	
	In coming to my verdict, I have taken into account the following legal matters. By that I mean, if this had been a trial by jury, I would have directed the jury as follows.
	
	
	First, it is incumbent upon the Crown to prove each and every element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. The accused need do nothing and prove nothing (Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions [1935] AC 462).
	
	
	Secondly, the criminal standard of proof is not to be further defined (Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28; [1971] HCA 55).
	
	
	Thirdly, turning to analyse the elements of the count on the indictment, as I have said, the Crown case for murder was restricted to felony murder. As at 24 September 1983, s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was as follows:
	


18 Murder and manslaughter defined

(1)

(a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him, of a crime punishable by death or penal servitude for life.

(b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.

(2)

(a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.

(b) No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only, or in his own defence.


	
	The Crown Prosecutor made it clear that his case was that the act causing death occurred in the commission of a foundational offence (as opposed to “in an attempt to commit” such an offence). His case was also that the act was alleged to have been committed by the accused, not by “some accomplice with him”. Finally, he explained that the act causing death was alleged to have occurred during the foundational offence, not “immediately after” its commission.
	
	
	The foundational offence upon which the Crown relied for felony murder was contained in s 37 of the Crimes Act. As at 24 September 1983, that section was as follows:
	


37 Attempts to choke etc (garrotting)

Whosoever:

by any means attempts to choke suffocate or strangle any person, or

by any means calculated to choke suffocate or strangle, attempts to render any person insensible unconscious or incapable of resistance,

with intent in any such case to enable himself or another person to commit, or with intent in any such case to assist any person in committing, an indictable offence,

shall be liable to penal servitude for life.


	
	As can be seen, the maximum penalty then applicable to the offence contained in s 37 brought that offence within one of the preconditions for a foundational offence then contained in s 18 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The act causing death must have been a willed and conscious act (Ryan v The Queen (1967) 121 CLR 205; [1967] HCA 2; and Penza and Di Maria v R [2013] NSWCCA 21).
	
	
	The indictable offence that the Crown alleged the accused had intended to commit (at the time of allegedly committing the offence then contained in s 37 of the Crimes Act) was to be found in s 61D of the same Act (yet again, as it was on 24 September 1983). The central portion of that section was as follows:
	


61D Sexual assault category 3—sexual intercourse without consent

(1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse shall be liable to penal servitude for 7 years or, if the other person is under the age of 16 years, to penal servitude for 10 years.


	
	It was not disputed between the parties that, as at the same date, the offence contained in section 61D(1) of the Crimes Act was an indictable offence.
	
	
	As at 24 September 1983, the common law rule that, for offences of which the death of a human being was an element, the death must have occurred within a year and a day of the act causing death, had not yet been abolished by statute (see now s 17A of the Crimes Act, which commenced on 17 March 1991). Accordingly, it is an element of the offence of murder that the deceased died before 25 September 1984.
	
	
	As well as that, in order for the Supreme Court of New South Wales to have jurisdiction with regard to an allegation of murder, the murder must be alleged to have been committed in New South Wales, or to have some connection with this State (see generally Part 1A of the Crimes Act). The parties did not explore this requirement to any degree; accordingly, I shall simply approach it on the basis that the Crown must prove its allegation that an act causing the death of the deceased occurred in New South Wales.
	
	
	Accordingly, the elements of the offence of murder that must be proven beyond reasonable doubt are as follows:
	



	
	The accused
	
	
	In New South Wales
	
	
	Voluntarily
	
	
	Did an act
	
	
	That caused the death of the deceased
	
	
	Within one year and one day of that act; and
	
	
	The act was done
	
	
	During the commission by the accused of the offence of
	
	
	By any means attempting to choke, suffocate or strangle the deceased
	
	
	With intent to enable himself to commit the indictable offence of
	
	
	Having penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with the deceased
	
	
	Without her consent
	
	
	The accused knowing that she did not consent to that intercourse.
	



	
	By the end of the trial, it was agreed between the parties that, depending upon my findings of fact, it could be that I would need to direct myself with regard to the elements of manslaughter by way of an unlawful and dangerous act. I shall come to the elements of that offence as necessary.
	
	
	That completes the directions that I would have given a jury about the elements of the offence alleged. The further directions I would have given are as follows.
	
	
	Fourthly, bearing in mind that the Crown case is a circumstantial one based on inferences said to be able to be drawn from a large number of alleged facts, my analysis should not focus on each individual fact, but rather their combined force (The Queen v Hillier (2007) 228 CLR 618; [2007] HCA 13 at [46]). Furthermore, I would not need to be satisfied of any particular fact beyond reasonable doubt; it is the elements of the offence that require proof to that standard (Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573; [1990] HCA 56). That legal proposition is subject to a single exception, which I shall discuss separately below.
	
	
	Fifthly, bearing in mind that the Crown case is a circumstantial one, before I could return a verdict of guilty of murder, I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that no rational hypothesis, other than guilt of the offence charged, is available on the facts that I find to be established (Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234; [1963] HCA 44; Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619; [1911] HCA 66).
	
	
	Sixthly, it was agreed between the parties that, for at least two reasons, before I could return a verdict of guilty, I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, as at September 1983, the accused possessed a tendency to strangle women in order to cause them to submit to intercourse with him.
	
	
	That was not only because of authority to the effect that, in order for a tendency to be taken into account in aid of proof of guilt, that tendency must be proven to the criminal standard (see the discussion of HML v The Queen (2008) 235 CLR 224; [2008] HCA 16 in DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272 at [30], and the recent judgment of Bathurst CJ in R v Matonwal & Amood [2016] NSWCCA 174 at [92]).
	
	
	It was also because, in the circumstances of this case, it was agreed between the parties that the alleged tendency is an indispensable intermediate fact with regard to proof of the guilt of the accused of the offence of murder (Shepherd v The Queen).
	
	
	Seventhly, the Crown alleged that the accused cleaned the boot of his motor vehicle shortly after the disappearance of the deceased. And the Crown alleged, as part of its circumstantial case, that the accused had done so because he had disposed of the body of the deceased by way of storing it in the boot for some period. The Crown further submitted that the cleaning of the boot demonstrated a consciousness of guilt of murder on the part of the accused.
	
	
	I have borne in mind the legal principle that, in order to accept that line of reasoning, I would need to be satisfied: that that act was indeed done by the accused; that the act was done to conceal something material to the trial, not something insignificant; and that the act was done by the accused in order to conceal his guilt of the murder of the deceased, as opposed to any other crime, or for any other reason (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193; [1993] HCA 63; R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52).
	
	
	I would also need to bear carefully in mind that persons may seek to conceal things for many reasons, not just because they are guilty of a crime; that an act done because of an awareness of guilt certainly cannot prove guilt on its own; and that, even if I accept that there was a cleaning of the boot, and that it was done with a consciousness of guilt, that act just becomes another circumstance that I would take into account in this circumstantial case.
	
	
	Eighthly, the fact that the accused did not give evidence in the trial means nothing, and is not to be held against him by me in the slightest (RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620; [2000] HCA 3; Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50; [2001] HCA 25).
	
	
	Ninthly, expert evidence was admitted in the trial on the basis that the relevant witnesses had knowledge, training or experience that permitted them to give such evidence (s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)). Having said that, the assessment of the correctness and probative value of those opinions remains a matter for me as the tribunal of fact; merely because an expert has expressed an opinion by no means demonstrates that the opinion is indeed correct and must be accepted.
	
	
	Tenthly, I must exercise caution about hearsay evidence, for the simple reason that, by its nature, the person who made the statement relied upon for its truth cannot be cross-examined, and hearsay evidence is generally unable to be tested deeply (s 165(1)(a) of the Evidence Act). And that caution applies particularly to a representation relied upon for a hearsay purpose that may be founded upon a “chain of information”, deriving in turn from the representations of others.
	
	
	Eleventhly, I should carefully bear in mind that the accused has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage. That is because he is on trial for a murder alleged to have been committed 33 years ago, and led in support of that allegation is tendency evidence of events said to have occurred over 40 years ago. For those reasons, the accused has inevitably been disadvantaged in his ability to deal with and respond to those allegations in the courtroom (s 165B of the Evidence Act; Groundstroem v R [2013] NSWCCA 237 at [62]). To give one of the examples of that disadvantage, documentary records of repairs that may have been undertaken to the motor vehicle belonging to the accused in the early 1980s (relevant to the question of whether it had a leaking boot seal, as he has claimed) are no longer available.
	
	
	That concludes all of the legal matters that I have taken into account. I now briefly set out a number of legal propositions that I have not taken into account, along with my reasons for not doing so.
	
	
	First, defence counsel submitted that it is an essential element of the offence that was contained in s 37 of the Crimes Act that an offender intended, by way of choking, suffocating, or strangling the victim, to “complete” the act; that is, to inflict death. I do not accept that submission, for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, such a reading would have rendered the offence-creating provision otiose in 1983, because of the common law doctrine of attempt attaching to the offence of murder, and also because of the existence of statutory forms of the offence of attempted murder in any event.
	
	
	Secondly, although the concept of suffocation perhaps suggests “completion”, neither the concept of choking or strangulation does so, as a matter of the meaning of the English words used by Parliament
	
	
	Thirdly, there is direct authority of a superior Court of New South Wales to the contrary, with regard to the direct ancestor of the offence contained in s 37 of the Crimes Act as at September 1983: see R v Bishop (1888) 88 4 WN (NSW) 107.
	
	
	The second direction that I have not adopted is as follows. I have already indicated that I accepted the joint position of the parties that, for two reasons, the alleged tendency of the accused must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. I do not accept, however, the submission of defence counsel that, in considering any alleged tendency incident, the evidence in support of that incident must be considered in complete isolation from the evidence in support of other tendency incidents, and indeed from the direct evidence about the count of murder. That is because I do not believe that it is the law of New South Wales that such a restrictive and artificially divided approach is to be taken to various incidents said to underpin and demonstrate an overarching tendency.
	
	
	In similar vein, I do not accept the submission of defence counsel that, in order to prove an overarching tendency beyond reasonable doubt, one must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each individual tendency incident said to demonstrate that tendency. Again, I do not consider that the law is so restrictive in its approach to proving a proposition about an alleged tendency.
	
	
	Defence counsel took me to a single judgement of Hodgson JA (Kirby and Whealy JJ agreeing) in DJS v R [2010] NSWCCA 200 at [56] in support of his submission. Three things may respectfully be said about that.
	
	
	The first is that defence counsel respectfully disavowed as incorrect a closely related principle in the same judgment.
	
	
	Secondly, I think it significant that, bearing in mind the very large number of discussions of the correct approach to tendency evidence in the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State and the High Court of Australia over the past 30 years, the proposition for which defence counsel contended could be found by him nowhere else in the authorities.
	
	
	Thirdly, I do not accept that the submission of defence counsel is consonant with the correct approach to a circumstantial case. In a circumstantial case, the destination (the elements of the offence) must be proven beyond reasonable doubt; the facts leading to that destination need not. Here, I have already accepted that the intermediate destination (the alleged tendency) must be proven beyond reasonable doubt; by analogy, the pieces of evidence said to lead to that destination (the alleged tendency incidents) need not be proven to that standard.
	
	
	In summary, I accept that the tendency must be proven beyond reasonable doubt before it can be taken into account to prove murder. I do not accept that each alleged tendency incident must itself be proven beyond reasonable doubt as a further intermediate stage. Nor do I accept that each alleged tendency incident must be analysed in complete isolation from the others, and from the direct evidence led in support of the murder count.
	
	
	That completes my discussion of legal matters. I turn now to the reasons for my verdict.
	


Reasons for verdict


	
	My reasoning in this matter is sequential. It is based on the following steps.
	


First step – Ellen Moon


	
	There is no dispute that, in May 1976, the accused sexually assaulted Ms Ellen Moon and inflicted severe violence on her in the form of strangulation, in order to achieve his goal of having intercourse with her. She was a young woman whom he had never met before. He met her in the evening at a public place of conviviality at which alcohol was served. At the commencement of their interaction, he was pleasant. He inveigled her to his car on a pretext involving clothes (the need for him to obtain his jumper). After that, he persuaded her into the car. The two of them engaged in consensual kissing. Thereafter, his demeanour and behaviour markedly changed. The accused used the modus operandi of strangulation against Ms Moon, whilst she was seated in the passenger seat of his car, in order to gratify himself sexually. The sexual act obtained was intercourse, culminating in ejaculation.
	
	
	Thereafter, the accused seemingly changed suddenly again, and expressed insight into, and remorse about, his conduct.
	
	
	As I have said, all of that has been accepted by the accused in a number of ways. There is no question but that I am entitled to be satisfied of the assertions of Ms Moon, and all of the persons whose evidence was placed before me about what was done to her, beyond reasonable doubt. That is the first step in my reasoning.
	


Second step – Andrea Hyde


	
	Armed with those propositions, established to the criminal standard, I turn to the interaction of the accused and Ms Andrea Hyde in August 1975.
	
	
	It will be recalled that there is no dispute on the part of the accused that he is the man whom Ms Hyde met at a café in Circular Quay. There is also no dispute that he and Ms Hyde had intercourse culminating in ejaculation on his part. What is very much in dispute, of course, is whether or not that intercourse occurred with the consent of Ms Hyde, and whether or not the accused inflicted violence upon her in the form of strangulation in order to overcome her lack of consent.
	
	
	It will also be recalled that there is no dispute that Ms Hyde left the home of the accused very suddenly after the intercourse took place. It was undoubtedly dark by that time in August in Sydney, and independent witnesses described the evening as very cold. Ms Hyde left behind her handbag, her personal identification, her underpants, her tights, and a pad that she had been wearing.
	
	
	There was also no dispute that Ms Hyde had recently had a termination, and was in pain as a result. Nor was it disputed that Ms Hyde was wearing a pad when she first entered the home of the accused. Nor could it be disputed, as a result of the finding of human blood on a large number of items seized from the home of the accused – including the pad – that Ms Hyde was indeed bleeding vaginally when she had intercourse with the accused.
	
	
	As I have said, Ms Hyde left the home of the accused in darkness, on a winter’s evening, on foot. She was carrying her shoes. She flagged down a vehicle, the occupants of whom were completely unknown to her, by waving her arms, screaming, and indeed dangerously running in front of it to some degree. Once inside the vehicle, and in the presence of two children, she immediately spoke of being attacked and a man trying to murder her.
	
	
	Thereafter, she was seen by many persons to be distressed, including showing physical signs of trembling. From an early stage, she spoke of sexual violence that featured a threat of death. Her concern to retrieve her belongings is consistent with such a fear, in that her handbag contained personal identification documents.
	
	
	Most noteworthy of all, perhaps, Senior Constable Andrews and Constable Hill observed red marks to the throat of Ms Hyde.
	
	
	All of the foregoing powerfully supports the proposition that something occurred in the home of the accused that led Ms Hyde to become so afraid that she would flee, on foot, undressed, and bleeding vaginally, into a Sydney winter’s evening.
	
	
	It is perfectly true, as defence counsel submitted, that, in giving evidence before me in 2016, Ms Hyde was very unclear about the sequence of events that she said unfolded in the home of the accused. The Crown Prosecutor himself accepted that there was a lack of clarity in the evidence of Ms Hyde. He also accepted that there was a readiness on her part to agree, in cross-examination, to propositions that were inconsistent with what she had said in chief, that evidence in turn being based on a statement that she had given to police over 40 years before the trial. I have given due consideration to the lack of clarity and consistency in the evidence of Ms Hyde before me.
	
	
	To be weighed against that is the fact that Ms Hyde was giving evidence in 2016 of events that had allegedly occurred in 1975; literally, a period of over four decades. Great consistency in her version in those circumstances would not only have been surprising, it would have been suspicious. Furthermore, although Ms Hyde was certainly unclear, even confused, about the sequence of events and details, she was clear that she had been sexually assaulted at the home of the accused, that she had been the subject of physical violence, that she had fled in great fear, and, most importantly, that she had been strangled.
	
	
	Furthermore, the sighting of red marks to the neck of Ms Hyde by more than one person shortly after she left the home of the accused very powerfully corroborates her version of what had occurred.
	
	
	Separately, it was made clear by defence counsel, by way of his compliance with the rule in Browne v Dunn, along with his written and oral submissions, that the proposed alternative rational hypothesis for the behaviour of Ms Hyde was as follows. Having engaged in consensual intercourse with the accused, she became overcome with remorse and agitation in the context of having had her recent termination.
	
	
	Of course, it was not incumbent upon the accused to establish that alternative hypothesis to the slightest degree; indeed, it was not incumbent upon the accused to put forward an alternative explanation at all. Nevertheless, the explanation having been put forward, and giving due deference to the varieties of human response and emotion that can occur, I assess that alternative explanation as being an unlikely one. In particular, it may perhaps provide an explanation as to why Ms Hyde may have left the home of the accused suddenly, and in a distressed state. It provides no explanation at all as to why Ms Hyde expressed a fear of death, in the context of marks being seen simultaneously to her throat.
	
	
	Defence counsel also made the point that it was rather odd that Ms Hyde left a number of belongings behind, but was able to leave with her pay packet in her hand, and also carrying her shoes. But I think that that evidence is of little moment: both parties were agreed that Ms Hyde left suddenly, and whether she took her pay packet and left her handbag, or vice versa, seems to me not to take the matter much further. It could also be the case that one might infer that a woman could remove her shoes, or fail to put them on, so that she could run more quickly.
	
	
	In summary, all that I have spoken of argues powerfully in support of the proposition that Ms Hyde was speaking the truth when she spoke of being raped and placed in fear of death, literally at the hands of the accused.
	
	
	But all of that evidence is not the end of the matter. To be added to my consideration, of course, is my undisputed satisfaction of the circumstances surrounding the crimes against Ms Moon, committed by the accused less than a year after his interaction with Ms Hyde.
	
	
	The similarities are compelling: a meeting between the accused and a young woman. That meeting occurring in a public place of conviviality. The availability of the motor vehicle of the accused. The inveigling of the young woman to a location chosen by the accused on a pretext. That pretext involving the clothing of the accused. An initial pleasant interaction. A sudden change on the part of the accused. Full penile/vaginal sexual intercourse featuring ejaculation being insisted upon by him. And most importantly of all, an allegation by Ms Hyde of strangulation in the context of forced intercourse, when that is precisely what the accused has admitted he did nine months later to Ms Moon.
	
	
	In short, my undisputed satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of what the accused did to Ms Moon inevitably plays a highly significant role in my resolution of the dispute about what Ms Hyde has alleged.
	
	
	Taking into account the evidence of Ms Hyde; the evidence of disinterested witnesses with regard to the circumstances surrounding her flight and immediate complaint; and taking into account the undisputed criminal conduct of the accused towards Ms Moon, I am satisfied that the accused had intercourse with Ms Hyde without her consent, and in order to overcome that lack of consent he strangled her to the point of fear of death. And although, as I have already said, I do not consider that I am required to be satisfied of that proposition to the criminal standard before I can use the evidence for a further purpose, I indicate that I am indeed satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	That state of satisfaction constitutes the second step in my reasoning. The third step is to consider the evidence of Ms Brown.
	


Third step – Karen Brown


	
	It will be recalled that there was no dispute before me that Ms Brown was subjected to an ordeal that was extended, degrading, and brutal. In other words, there was no suggestion that she was fabricating her evidence. The dispute was about whether one can be satisfied that the perpetrator of those acts was the accused.
	
	
	That dispute needs to be understood in the context that there is no evidence directly identifying the accused as that perpetrator. The Crown case in that regard is circumstantial. It has a number of strands.
	
	
	First, the man who approached Ms Brown at the bar generally fitted the description of the accused as he appeared back then. I include in that the height, build, hair colour, hairstyle, facial hair, and eyes of the man, and the fact that he was generally described as good looking. And although it was not relied upon for a moment as identification evidence, the assertion of Ms Brown in 2013 that the photograph of the accused shown to her in the array was “similar” to her assailant, very broadly supported the proposition of similarity of appearance.
	
	
	Secondly, it is important, of course, that the man introduced himself as Bob.
	
	
	Thirdly, the perpetrator drove to the northern suburbs of Sydney. In particular, Ms Brown recalled landmarks (such as Knox Grammar) and the suburb sign for Wahroonga. I did not understand it to be disputed by defence counsel that the accused did at some stage live in that suburb. Of course, on its own, that means little, and it is quite true that the evidence of Ms Brown was that she believed she was driven past that suburb. Nevertheless, it is not entirely insignificant that the perpetrator did not drive to (for example) Cronulla in the south, Penrith in the west, or Castle Hill in the northwest, of Sydney.
	
	
	Fourthly, the perpetrator took Ms Brown originally to a waterside reserve in the inner northern suburbs of Sydney. It is not disputed that, in the early 1980s, the accused was employed at Lane Cove River Park. Nor is it disputed that, at the time of his interaction with Ms Hyde in August 1975, the accused resided at McMahons Point. He resided at the same location at the time of his interaction with Ms Moon in May 1976.
	
	
	Again, that is hardly determinative or conclusive. But it plays some including role, just as (by way of hypothetical example) the accused living nowhere near the inner northern harbourside suburbs of Sydney would play an excluding role, to some small degree, in a circumstantial case.
	
	
	Fifthly, Ms Brown spoke of there being tattoos to much, if not all, of the back of the perpetrator. There is no dispute that the accused has a large tattoo of an eagle on his back, and it has been there for many years.
	
	
	To be weighed against that is the fact that in a previous statement Ms Brown spoke of the perpetrator having tattoos all over his body and on his left forearm. She maintained in the witness box that she saw the tattoo on his arm. Those are excluding observations that I shall discuss in more detail later.
	
	
	Sixthly, Ms Brown memorised two variants of a number plate that matched the number plate recorded as having been that of a car owned by the accused. That representation was contained in a document that I accept was created by the New South Wales Police Service, for reasons that I shall explain shortly. That motor vehicle is recorded as being owned by the accused in mid-September 1978; that is, a matter of weeks after the assault on Ms Brown. It is also noteworthy that the description in the police document of the motor vehicle said to belong to the accused fits, in a very general way, with the description of the motor vehicle given by Ms Brown, that being a white Holden sedan with four doors.
	
	
	It is perfectly true that Ms Brown may be mistaken in her recollection of the number plate. It is also true, as defence counsel submitted, that the accuracy of the document is open to question, for a number of reasons.
	
	
	First, conclusive documentation from the relevant government department is no longer available.
	
	
	Secondly, in those circumstances, one cannot be sure of the information upon which the representation is based.
	
	
	Thirdly, in light of the evidence tendered in the trial of Mr John Andrews, a former police officer, the evidence is not conclusive that the document recording the registration number is a police document.
	
	
	Fourthly, the representation in the document about the vehicle was tendered, not the document itself. As for the representation about the address of the accused being in Wahroonga, it was placed in evidence through the examination-in-chief of Detective Jones. In other words, defence counsel submitted that I cannot have regard to the other representations contained in the document in order to test the accuracy of the two tendered representations.
	
	
	As for the latter submission, it is true that the document was not tendered in the trial; rather, one representation contained in it was tendered, and the other was referred to in the oral evidence of the detective. But Detective Jones also gave oral evidence that the representation appeared on “A page from the criminal antecedents found in the storage of the file in relation to Robert John Adams”.
	
	
	As I have indicated, I am satisfied that the document containing the two representations was created by the New South Wales Police Service. I say that because, even disregarding the entirety of the rest of its contents, it is inconceivable that a document as described by Detective Jones, located in a box of exhibits retained as part of an investigation by the police, was created by any other organisation. It follows that I believe that Mr Andrews was either mistaken in his recollection, or perhaps had not been exposed to such a document in his role as a uniformed police officer.
	
	
	On the other hand, I accept, of course, that, without a certificate of registration, one cannot be sure that the representation in the document accurately reflects the true position.
	
	
	Having said all of that, it remains the fact that the link between the motor vehicle registration noted almost 40 years ago in a police document, and the number plate seen by Ms Brown 40 years ago, and recounted to Detective Jones in 2013, is undoubtedly a significant one.
	
	
	Finally, it is true that Ms Brown recalls that the man who sexually assaulted her had a tattoo to his left forearm. Although the evidence was not entirely clear, I also approach my task on the basis that her evidence was that the perpetrator had tattoos to much of his body, beyond his back. Those memories of hers have given me significant pause. In the ultimate, I do not believe that they mandate exclusion of the accused as the perpetrator against Ms Brown. I believe that they can be explained in a way consistent with the accused being the perpetrator against Ms Brown, for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, Ms Brown was describing in 2016 events that occurred in 1978, about which she had first spoken in detail to investigating police in the form of Detective Jones. That was, at the earliest, in late 2012. It is possible that Ms Brown is mistaken about the extent of the tattoos.
	
	
	Secondly, on either case, Ms Brown had been through an extremely traumatic event, from which she has never fully recovered psychologically. One would be surprised if every detail of her version of events, including the description of the perpetrator, were completely reliable.
	
	
	Thirdly, Ms Brown spoke in the witness box of being “repulsed” by the tattoos of her assailant whilst she was being raped on the mattress, and deliberately looking away from them. Her disgust may well have led her to recall the tattoos of the perpetrator as being more extensive than they actually were.
	
	
	Fourthly and finally, it is not to be forgotten that the perpetrator shared many other characteristics with the accused. In particular, it is not to be forgotten that Ms Brown spoke of the perpetrator as having extensive tattooing to his back; that is exactly what the accused possesses.
	
	
	In short, considering the concatenation of circumstances listed above, I assess the circumstantial case arising from the evidence about the crimes against Ms Brown that the accused was their perpetrator as being quite strong. But, of course, those circumstances are not to be assessed on their own.
	
	
	They are also to be assessed in light of the undisputed evidence of what the accused did to Ms Moon, and my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of what he did to Ms Hyde.
	
	
	Again, a pattern emerges. A meeting with a young woman. The meeting occurred in the evening. It occurred at a public place of conviviality. The place of the meeting was either in the centre of Sydney, or in its inner northern suburbs. The male person was pleasant and attractive. He introduced himself as Bob. The male person was not with his own male or female friends. The male person had a motor vehicle available to him. The male person and the young woman ended up in that motor vehicle, with her consent. The young woman consented to some form of shared affection. The male changed, and suddenly became very violent and threatening. Full penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with ejaculation took place. Each woman was treated very much as nothing more than an object: Ms Hyde by being sexually assaulted when bleeding from the vagina as a result of an abortion; Ms Moon by being threatened with death, to be followed by defilement of her body; Ms Brown by being ordered to urinate on the mattress when she pleaded to be permitted to use the toilet.
	
	
	Most importantly of all, the male person used strangulation in the course of the sexual assault, with the result that the victim was placed in terror.
	
	
	It is quite true that there are differences between what the accused did to Ms Moon, what I am satisfied he did to Ms Hyde, and what the Crown alleges he did to Ms Brown. For example, in the case of Ms Brown, she was detained for a period of many hours, in contrast to Ms Moon and Ms Hyde. Furthermore, it is true that Ms Brown believed that she was being strangled not before the intercourse that was imposed upon her, but rather during it. Other variations are no doubt to be found in the evidence of the three women.
	
	
	Defence counsel placed emphasis on that latter factor, and submitted that there was a significant contrast between what was done to Ms Moon, and allegedly done to Ms Hyde (strangulation in order to ensure compliance), and what was done to Ms Brown on her version (strangulation during intercourse, perhaps for the sexual gratification of the perpetrator).
	
	
	It is true that Ms Brown had the recollection that she was not choked or strangled before the sexual intercourse commenced. Rather, she was physically constrained by the weight of the attacker, which pinned her to the passenger seat and, later, to the mattress. But I think that it is quite possible that the perpetrator strangled Ms Brown during intercourse as a preventative measure against possible resistance; in other words, not for reasons markedly different from those that led to the strangulation of Ms Moon and Ms Hyde. It is also quite possible, I think, that the accused gained sexual or psychological gratification from strangling Ms Hyde and Ms Moon. And in any event, I think that, as a tribunal of fact exercising common experience of the world, I am entitled to find the following.
	
	
	Sexual assault, although regrettably not rare in either 2016 or the 1970s, constitutes a criminal deviation from the normal sexual interaction between adults. Sexual assault involving full intercourse, ejaculation, and the infliction of physical violence (above and beyond the violence of the sexual assault itself) is rarer. And sexual assault featuring those attributes, and manual strangulation to the point of the victim being placed in fear of death, is rarer again.
	
	
	In other words, I think that, if there be a distinction between the point of their ordeal at which Ms Moon and Ms Hyde suffered strangulation, and the point at which Ms Brown suffered it, it is an insignificant one.
	
	
	In short, the compelling – indeed irresistible – conclusion, founded upon the combination of the direct evidence about the tendency complaint of Ms Brown, combined with the behaviour of the accused towards Ms Moon and Ms Hyde, is that the accused is indeed the perpetrator of the offences against Ms Brown.
	
	
	Again, although I do not consider that I am legally required to reach the criminal standard of satisfaction before I can use the evidence of Ms Brown with regard to the count on the indictment, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is the man who brutalised that young woman, and severely damaged her life. That is the third step in my reasoning.
	


Fourth step – a tendency established


	
	The fourth step in my reasoning is to consider whether the Crown has established that, in the period spanning the commission of the offences against Ms Hyde in August 1975, the commission of the offences against Ms Moon in May 1976, and the commission of the offences against Ms Brown in late July or early August 1978, the accused possessed a tendency to rape women, and to strangle them ancillary to that crime.
	
	
	My satisfaction that the accused is the man who attacked each of Ms Moon, Ms Hyde, and Ms Brown leads inevitably to the conclusion that the accused did indeed possess such a tendency. Yet again, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that proposition. That is the fourth step in my reasoning.
	


Fifth step – Mary Wallace


	
	The fifth step in my reasoning is to turn to apply all of those findings to the events of the weekend of Saturday 24 September 1983, and the week or two thereafter.
	
	
	Again, when one considers the tendency that I have found established beyond reasonable doubt, and the incidents that prove it, and compares that tendency to the events of the evening of 23 September and the early morning of 24 September 1983, a pattern readily emerges. An interaction between the accused and a young woman, the deceased. That interaction taking place in the hours of darkness. The interaction commencing at a public place designed for socialising. The public place being on the lower North Shore of Sydney. The accused not being in the company of his own male or female friends. The accused having his car readily available. The accused inveigling the deceased into the car, including by way of a false pretext of being a police officer. The accused and the deceased being alone together in the car. The accused and the deceased having some sort of sexual contact in the vehicle, culminating in his ejaculation.
	
	
	The indisputable fact that must be added to that readily discernible pattern of factors is the fact that, after having been in the presence of the deceased in those circumstances, the deceased has been neither seen nor heard of by any person, in circumstances where the inevitable conclusion is not only that she is dead, but also that she died very soon after her departure from the Alpine Inn.
	
	
	Further facts, because they are trenchantly and cogently disputed, can be added to the mixture of evidence only with great circumspection.
	
	
	As I have said, there was a sharp dispute at trial about the evidence from the Crown witnesses of the accused hosing out or cleaning his boot on Sunday 25 September 1983, the deceased having last been seen by any person other than the accused when she drove away with him in the early hours of 24 September 1983.
	
	
	I accept that the disputed evidence of Ms Newhouse, Mr Ross Adams, and Ms Andrews about the events of the weekend is open to valid criticism. It suffered from a lack of consistency with regard to the witnesses, both internal (that is, between the statements of an individual witness) and external (that is, between the witnesses). Each of Ms Newhouse, Mr Ross Adams, and Ms Andrews was not entirely internally consistent with regard to important details, and at least Mr Ross Adams and Ms Andrews spoke for the first time of alleged events years after one may have expected them to have first mentioned them.
	
	
	Furthermore, as I have recounted, the evidence of Mr Ross Adams was that, in all likelihood, the cleaning of the boot that he allegedly saw occurred on a Saturday, because he was in the habit of spending Sunday with his parents at their home, not at the flat in Chatswood. The evidence of Ms Newhouse about the clothing she observed the accused to wear at a certain time on Saturday 24 September 1983 is not consistent with the evidence of many witnesses who saw the accused dressed very casually whilst present at the champagne breakfast. Ms Andrews said nothing about seeing the boot being cleaned until 33 years after she allegedly saw that occur.
	
	
	In short, having reflected carefully on the evidence of those three witnesses about the events of the weekend, it plays little or no role in my verdict, because, except with regard to undisputed matters, I have effectively put it to one side.
	
	
	But it is to be recalled that defence counsel confirmed that it is not disputed that, on that weekend, there was indeed a connection between the accused, a hose, and the boot of his car: on his own version, the accused was hosing the boot in an effort to identify leaks in its seal.
	
	
	Nor is it disputed by the accused that he did indeed wash the seat covers that weekend, because he wished to remove seminal staining arising from his sexual interaction with the deceased.
	
	
	In other words, the dispute between the parties is within a relatively short compass. There is no issue that the accused was, on the weekend in question, cleaning his car. Nor is it disputed that, on the same weekend, he was using a hose in connection with the boot of his car. Rather, the issue is what precisely he was doing, and why.
	
	
	The resolution of that question can be informed by a further fact, itself not the subject of dispute by defence counsel as a primary position.
	
	
	As I have said, hairs said to be vacuumed from the boot of the accused’s Commodore by a scientific police officer on 6 October 1983 were analysed years later by Ms Elizabeth Brooks, a senior forensic scientist who specialises in hair analysis. She expressed the opinion that the hairs said to be from the boot were identical in their microscopic characteristics to hairs taken from a hairbrush seized from the home of the deceased (who, it will be recalled, lived alone). Ms Brooks, whilst unable to provide any statistic of rarity, expressed the opinion that a match of that kind is “incredibly rare”.
	
	
	I respectfully think that a number of separate criticisms can be made of the evidence of Ms Brooks. For example, because she was provided by the organisation seeking her opinion with context inculpatory of the accused, it is possible that she was subject to unconscious bias in her (to a degree, subjective) determination of identicality.
	
	
	Secondly, she accepted in the witness box that, in truth, some of the hairs were not identical in each and every attribute to the other hairs, but explained that those variations were not significant, or were otherwise explicable. But the dividing line between excluding variations and includable variations was not clear in my own mind at the end of her evidence.
	
	
	Thirdly, despite the obvious need for great care to be taken in record keeping with regard to analysis of exhibits in a murder investigation, Ms Brooks agreed with defence counsel that, regrettably, she had mis-described one of the “sub-exhibits” that was in her care. Furthermore, when asked in the witness box to identify which sub-exhibit was the correct one, she provided an alternative thesis that was itself subject to criticism, in that it did not appear to be consistent with her dealings with other sub-exhibits.
	
	
	Fourthly, it seems odd, perhaps, that a process of comparing each hair to all hairs was not adopted, bearing in mind that the hypothesis being tested was that all hairs emanated from the one person.
	
	
	Fifthly, it seems that no detailed record was kept of the observed characteristics of one of the hairs that formed part of the comparison process.
	
	
	As I have said, those criticisms, when considered cumulatively, have considerable force.
	
	
	On the other hand, defence counsel also fleetingly submitted that it is noteworthy that Dr Baxter (who first had custody of the seized hairs many years ago) spoke of them as being quite long. On the other hand, Ms Brooks (who analysed them years later) spoke of them as being quite short. I understood defence counsel to be raising, perhaps, the prospect that the hairs analysed were not the hairs seized.
	
	
	He also suggested that there was a lack of detail about the precise steps adopted with regard to the hairs said to be found in the vacuumings by police from the boot of the vehicle; the taking of the hairs from the hairbrush; and the seizure of the contents of the vacuum cleaner of the accused. He suggested that that lack of detail raises the spectre of cross-contamination, or other incompetence.
	
	
	I do not accept those submissions. To my mind, the difference in the description of some of the hairs seen by each expert is of little moment: the detailed oral and documentary evidence amply satisfies me that the hairs analysed (both by Ms Brooks and Dr Hartman, whose evidence I shall discuss in a moment) were indeed the hairs vacuumed from the boot by Detective Walsh in 1983. I say that because careful analysis of all of the evidence in the Crown case about those exhibits shows that the chain of custody was not broken. Nor is there any probative evidence to suggest that some sort of contamination or admixture occurred with regard to the exhibits that were ultimately the subject of scientific examination.
	
	
	As can be seen from the above, in short I accept some but not all of the criticisms that defence counsel has made of the examination of the hairs by Ms Brooks. But the primary position of defence counsel was that the hairs said to have been taken from the boot could indeed be hairs of the deceased. In other words, the primary position of defence counsel was not that the analyst was mistaken, or mixed up, or unconsciously biased, in expressing the opinion that the hairs from the boot were identical to the hairs from the hairbrush. I repeat: his primary position was that the hairs from the boot are indeed the hairs of the deceased.
	
	
	The simple explanation for that was said to be entirely innocent secondary transfer. That was said to be perfectly possible, bearing in mind the following. As a matter of expert evidence and common human experience, hairs can readily be transferred by and on clothing. The deceased was indeed in the front passenger seat of the motor vehicle of the accused. On both cases, the accused and the deceased had sexual contact in the motor vehicle. The accused was indeed at the boot of the car (not only when hosing it, but also when he produced the carton of beer from it upon his arrival at the champagne breakfast). Finally, there were undoubtedly other human hairs, and even animal hairs, identified in the materials vacuumed from the boot.
	
	
	It is perfectly true that the fall back position of defence counsel was that the analysis of Ms Brooks (and indeed of the mtDNA analyst, Dr Hartman) should be discounted for a large number of reasons. But I think that, as the tribunal of fact, I am entitled to analyse the evidence on the primary position of defence counsel.
	
	
	To summarise my discussion of the scientific evidence so far: it was not effectually disputed by defence counsel that the hairs analysed by Ms Brooks came from the boot of the vehicle of the accused; it was not disputed that the accused was using a hose on his boot within 48 hours after the deceased was last seen alive by any other person; and it was not disputed that the hairs analysed by Ms Brooks and Dr Hartman could be from the head of the deceased.
	
	
	Separately, as I have already said, Dr Hartman expressed the opinion that the mtDNA profile of the hairs from the boot was identical to that of the hairs from the hairbrush (they were not quite identical to the mtDNA profile of the sister of the deceased, but Dr Hartman expressed the opinion that that variation between siblings is readily explicable). Dr Hartman also expressed the opinion that such a profile is expected to occur in 1 in 518 persons (that being a cautious estimate).
	
	
	Again, defence counsel made a number of criticisms of that statistic. One of them was that, to the extent that the mtDNA profiles of persons of African descent make up part of the comparison database, and relatively few such persons were members of Australian society in 1983, the comparison with the database may give a false picture of rarity that should be adjusted downwards. A further criticism was that the comparison database contains no results obtained from the United Kingdom, Ireland, or France, perhaps suggesting that there is a paucity of profiles derived from persons of Caucasian background; to be weighed against that is the fact that results from the United States of America and Canada are included in that database.
	
	
	There is some force in that, as there is in his other criticisms of the mtDNA evidence. But, again, I understood them to be ancillary positions adopted by defence counsel. As I have said, the primary position was that the hairs taken from the boot could indeed be those of the deceased, but they ended up there by way of entirely innocent and commonplace secondary transfer.
	
	
	Again, I believe that I am entitled to take the primary position of defence counsel at face value, and to factor it into my reasoning.
	
	
	One is then presented with the following facts. The last person in the world with whom the deceased was seen to be in company was the accused. The deceased was never seen or heard of again after she was seen in the company of the accused. The accused had a tendency to rape and strangle women. Over a period of some years, he evidenced that tendency, with regard to three different women. The tendency was chronic, and showed itself as recently as a little over five years before the disappearance of the deceased. The incidents that demonstrated the tendency showed a repetitive and specific modus operandi. Many of the characteristics of that modus operandi were shared by the circumstances of the intersection between the accused and the deceased, and their departure together from the wine bar. A number of hairs that defence counsel accepted could very well be those of the deceased were vacuumed from the boot of the motor vehicle of the accused a week or so after the disappearance of the deceased. Less than 48 hours after the deceased was last seen, the accused was seen using a hose in connection with his boot.
	
	
	In a circumstantial case, each fact informs one’s understanding of the significance of other facts, and the totality of one’s understanding of the combined significance of all of the facts will inform one’s verdict.
	
	
	Here, the undoubted tendency of the accused to treat young women in a certain way, combined with the circumstances in which he and the deceased were present in his motor vehicle, surely informs the presence of the hair with an mtDNA profile identical to that of the deceased in his boot.
	
	
	Similarly, the presence of the hair surely informs the use of a hose by the accused in the vicinity of his boot.
	
	
	So does the fact that the use of the hose occurred, not two weeks before or two weeks after the disappearance of the deceased, but no more than 48 hours after it occurred.
	
	
	Finally, the meaning of the hair is in turn informed by the use of the hose in the vicinity of the boot.
	
	
	In other words, in assessing the significance of the match between the hairs vacuumed from the boot and the hairs taken from the hairbrush, and the admitted use of the hose with regard to the boot, it is perfectly true that each fact on its own may mean little. But seen in the context of each other, and in the context of the established tendency of the accused, and the context of the surrounding chronology of events, they become a compelling, interconnected, inculpatory set of facts. And I say that bearing firmly in mind the legal restrictions that apply to finding that acts were done, or things were said, by an accused person with a consciousness of guilt, and the need for caution in reasoning in that way.
	
	
	As against a finding of guilty, defence counsel submitted that, if one is considering whether the accused did indeed cause the death of the deceased in the early hours of the morning of 24 September 1983, much of his subsequent conduct is bizarre to the point of stark inconsistency with that proposition.
	
	
	For example, reasonably soon after the alleged murder, he was content to attend a social event in the form of a champagne breakfast. He was also content to socialise with Ms Andrews in the evening, and indeed to have intercourse with her at his home. That is extraordinary behaviour, it was said, for a man who has allegedly committed murder in the early hours of that morning.
	
	
	Furthermore, if one is testing the proposition that the accused had used the boot of his vehicle to transport the body of the deceased in the early hours of the Saturday morning, it is remarkable that both Ms Newhouse and Ms Andrews spoke of him cleaning the car on the Sunday, and not the Saturday. And although Mr Ross Adams spoke of a cleaning on a Saturday, he could not be specific with regard to the particular weekend.
	
	
	Finally, if the accused was indeed washing the boot of his vehicle on the driveway outside his block of flats in order to remove from it traces of the deceased, that was a remarkably brazen, indeed irrational, thing for him to do in full public gaze.
	
	
	All of those submissions have force, and I have taken them into account. But the fact is that the accused did not and does not possess a conventional personality: he admitted many years ago that he raped and strangled Ms Moon, and I have found beyond reasonable doubt that he raped and strangled Ms Hyde and Ms Brown. Furthermore, in the ERISP of December 2013, he is to be seen and heard making a number of wryly humorous comments in the context of being accused of the murder of the deceased.
	
	
	Not only that, Ms Moon spoke of the accused suddenly changing after his crimes were completed, expressing remorse, and speaking of his need to obtain psychiatric help. Ms Brown also spoke of the change between the man who raped and detained her in hours of darkness, and his pleasant personality the following morning in daylight. Although Ms Hyde did not speak of a sudden change (she having fled very soon after the forced intercourse came to an end), one might infer that there was such a change: on his own version, the accused packaged her belongings in a bag in order to return them to her, and there was no dispute that it was he who was searching, in his vehicle and on foot, for Ms Hyde after her departure.
	
	
	In short, I accept that the conduct of the accused on the weekend in question does not sit entirely comfortably with him having murdered the deceased on the Saturday morning. But on a broader analysis of all of the evidence placed before me, I do not consider that his behaviour, by way of social events and sexual contact that weekend, stands in the way of me drawing the inferences for which the Crown contends.
	
	
	Separately, the chronology shows that there was in fact ample time, between the departure of the accused and the deceased from the Alpine Inn, and the next time at which his location was confirmed (at the earliest, 6.30 AM at the champagne breakfast), for the accused to have disposed of the body of the deceased, perhaps at a temporary location. As well as that, there was a period of many hours between the departure of Ms Andrews from the flat of the accused at (at the latest) about 1 AM on the Sunday, and the next time at which the accused was reliably sighted, that being at about 9.30 or 10.30 AM on the Sunday morning.
	
	
	It is quite true, as defence counsel has said, that the accused was not manipulating a hose within the vicinity of the boot until sometime after midday on the Sunday. But to my mind it is quite possible that the body of the deceased was quickly secreted at a temporary location very early on the Saturday morning, and thereafter it was permanently disposed of some time after midnight on the Saturday night. That would not have required a cleaning of the boot until Sunday. An alternative possibility is that it was not until the Sunday that the accused reflected on the possibility that some material had been left in the boot that could reveal the presence of the body of the deceased inside it.
	
	
	In short, I do not regard the seemingly delayed interaction of the accused with the boot and the hose as standing in the way of the inference that the Crown asks me to draw, namely that what was occurring was a cleaning of the boot, not a search for leaks.
	
	
	Finally, it is true that, if the interaction between the accused, the hose, and the boot was done with consciousness of guilt, it was done with remarkable brazenness. The inevitable reply to that submission is that, throughout the 1970s, the accused has brazenly raped and strangled three separate women, using his own name, his own vehicle, his own home, and eschewing the use of any disguise.
	
	
	Defence counsel also asked me to reflect on the fact that the accused has co-operated with police with regard to the murder. That includes by speaking to detectives on 29 September 1983; by engaging in a lengthy ERISP after he had been arrested on a charge of murder on 20 December 2013; by providing various bodily samples to them; and by facilitating them photographing his back in order to capture its very large tattoo.
	
	
	Again, I have reflected on those undisputed facts. But it will be recalled that the accused engaged in a record of interview with detectives with regard to the allegation of Ms Hyde in August 1975, in which he denied it. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his denials on that occasion were lies. It is also to be recalled that, when asked by detectives in 2013 about the allegation of Ms Brown, the accused gave a rather odd, non-committal answer. Again, my satisfaction that it was the accused who sexually assaulted Ms Brown means that I reject the truthfulness of that response to police during the ERISP.
	
	
	In other words, I consider that the seeming co-operation that the accused has offered to police with regard to the disappearance of the deceased is of negligible probative value.
	
	
	Defence counsel also pointed to the fact that the surveillance operation against the accused yielded no inculpatory evidence. That is perfectly true; on the other hand, whilst bearing firmly in mind that the onus of proof remains at all times on the Crown, I regard that as something that does not tell in favour of the Crown case, rather than as something that powerfully tells against it.
	
	
	In similar vein, I regard the inability of the handwriting expert to come to a position of inclusion or exclusion as neutral to my determination.
	
	
	Separately, defence counsel explicitly accepted in his final address that I could safely infer, on all of the evidence, that Ms Wallace is indeed deceased. But he put forward some alternative hypotheses for her death for my consideration. Again, of course, it was not incumbent upon him to do so in the slightest, and it is not incumbent upon the accused to establish anything.
	
	
	Bearing those fundamental propositions firmly in mind, some of those hypotheses, I respectfully think, can be rejected as being unlikely to the point of being fanciful. For example, I reject the proposition that the man who seemingly assaulted the deceased outside the Stoned Crow wine bar could have coincidentally come across her hours later, after she had alighted from the vehicle of the accused some distance away, and that man thereupon bashed her, killed her, and disposed of her body.
	
	
	I also reject the suggestion that the deceased suffered some kind of medical emergency after she left the deceased; if that were the case, she would readily have been found lying on the footpath or at home, unconscious or dead.
	
	
	Other alternatives, referred to fleetingly in the running sheets and occurrence pad entries from the original investigation, were in my opinion nothing more than wisps, not rational alternative hypotheses.
	
	
	Finally, there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that the deceased may have committed suicide.
	
	
	Defence counsel also asked me to consider further alternative hypotheses said to be rational. They were rather different, in that they featured inculpation of the accused, but not by way of felony murder based on the foundational offence of choking, strangling, or suffocating the deceased with the intent to have sexual intercourse with her without her consent.
	
	
	It was said, for example, that it is possible (contrary to the entirety of the version of the accused given in both 1983 and in 2013, and contrary to the whole defence case) that the accused could have had intercourse with the deceased whilst she was unconscious, bearing in mind her undoubted heavy intoxication with alcohol, and thereby accidentally killed her. That would constitute, it was said, the offence of sexual assault, but not the offence of murder.
	
	
	It was also said in the alternative that, if I were to find that the accused had inflicted physical violence on the deceased in order to force her to have sexual intercourse with him, but had not adopted the precise tactic of restricting her supply of oxygen, that would not fall within the foundational offence for felony murder either. The result would be that the accused could not be found guilty of murder, and manslaughter would need to be considered as an alternative.
	
	
	I consider that there are two responses to those ancillary submissions. The first is that, in the recent unanimous decision of The Queen v Baden-Clay (2016) 90 ALJR 1013; [2016] HCA 35, the High Court of Australia warned against speculation founded on hypotheses that are completely without anchor in the evidence and the issues joined between the parties in a criminal trial: at [46] and [58]. The High Court referred at [75] with approval to the same approach taken by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Lane v R (2013) 241 A Crim R 321; [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [111].
	
	
	Here, there is no evidence whatsoever that the accused had intercourse with the deceased whilst she was asleep or unconscious, and she accidentally died as a result.
	
	
	Nor is there any direct or indirect evidence, including from the accused, that he inflicted physical violence on the deceased, other than restricting her supply of oxygen, in an effort to overcome her resistance to intercourse, and that she died as a result.
	
	
	To the contrary, the position of the accused maintained over 30 years has been that he and the deceased had conscious and consensual sexual contact in his car, he fell asleep immediately thereafter, and he awoke to find that the deceased had departed.
	
	
	In those circumstances, in accordance with my understanding of the way in which the High Court has explained a tribunal of fact should approach the issues joined in a criminal trial, I consider that those alternative hypotheses should be put to one side.
	
	
	Secondly, if I am wrong in that legal analysis, I approach those alternative hypotheses as follows.
	
	
	It is not easy to see how the accused, by way of intercourse with the putative unconscious deceased, could have caused her death in doing so: although like everyone else she had a number of health issues, none of them were dangerous in an acute or chronic sense. In particular, I am satisfied that Raynaud’s Disease had nothing to do with her death. I do not regard the alternative hypothesis of sudden, non-violent death arising from intercourse as a reasonable one.
	
	
	As for violence other than airway restriction inflicted in order to overcome resistance to sexual intercourse without consent, the only evidence of how the accused might have done that speaks with one voice: manual strangulation.
	
	
	In short, I have considered all of the alternative hypotheses put forward by defence counsel, including the alternative positions that reflect badly on the accused. I reject them.
	
	
	In conclusion, considering all of the evidence placed before me as a set of individual facts, and as a whole – the proven tendency of the accused to rape and strangle women; the marked similarities between his interaction with the deceased and his interactions with women whom, I am satisfied, he had raped and strangled; the fact that the deceased has never been seen again after she was in the company of the accused; the fact that, within 48 hours of his interaction with the deceased, the accused undertook an activity relating to his boot that featured the use of a hose; the fact that hairs (which shared a reasonably rare profile with those of the deceased) were seized from the boot of his vehicle, and not disputed at trial to be from the deceased; and the fact that, on any analysis, the accused had ample time to dispose of the body; I am satisfied of the following beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Whilst alone in his car with the deceased early in the morning of 24 September 1983, the accused choked or strangled her with the intention of having sexual intercourse with her without her consent. That voluntary act of the accused caused her sudden death, and thereafter the accused disposed of her body, which was at some stage in the boot of his vehicle. By 25 September 1984, the deceased had regrettably been dead for many months. I reject all other explanations for the entirety of the evidence placed before me beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, the accused treated the deceased very much as an object, just as he had treated three other young women.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is not necessary for me to discuss the elements of the offence of manslaughter.
	


Verdict


	
	Robert John Adams, on the count alleging that on 24 September 1983 you did murder Mary Louise Wallace at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, I return a verdict of: guilty.

Cur Adv Vult
 
(delivering the judgment of the Board): At his trial before two judges of the High Court of the Republic of Singapore the appellant was convicted of an offence under s 3(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, of trafficking in 46.38g of morphine.
Trafficking for the purposes of the Act includes transporting and the penalty for the offence depends upon the nature and the quantity of the drug involved. In the case of morphine, if the quantity involved is more than 30g the mandatory penalty is death. The significance of the figure of 46.38g in the charge is that it is more than 50% greater than the minimum weight that attracts the death penalty.
The facts as found by the trial judges can be stated shortly. On 9 January 1976 the appellant was stopped at the frontier while travelling in a taxi to Singapore from Johore Bahru. He was searched and found to have concealed in his sock two packages, each containing a block of a brown substance. Together these weighed 75g. At first the appellant said that the packages contained a medicine for the stomach, that he was carrying for an acquaintance and, at the acquaintance`s request, he had concealed it in order to avoid paying import duty. Subsequently, however, after he had been arrested, charged and cautioned, he made a statement in Hokkien which was translated into English and signed by the appellant. In this statement he admitted the offence of trafficking in about 75g of morphine.
On the following day, the two packages were handed to the government chemist for analysis. He subjected them to a qualitative test, known as paper chromatography for the indication of the presence of morphine and afterwards to a quantitative test known as gas chromatography to ascertain the weight of morphine present in the two packages. The results of these analyses were that the morphine content of the two packages amounted to 46.38g. The chemist issued certificates to this effect which were produced at the preliminary bearing of the charge against the appellant in the subordinate court early in March 1976. By s 14 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, the certificates were prima facie evidence of the facts certified.
The appellant reserved his defence and was committed for trial in the High Court.
The hearing in the High Court was due to open on Monday 5 July 1976. On Thursday 1 July Dr Rintoul, a chemist instructed on behalf of the appellant, was given by the government chemist samples of the contents of the two packages for analysis. The government chemist also took occasion on that day to repeat his own analyses of the contents of the packages by gas chromatography. These new analyses produced the same results as before within less than 2% difference. This is within the margin of error to be expected with this method of quantitative analysis.
At the trial, the prosecution did not rely exclusively upon the certificates of analysis as evidence of the morphine content of the packages. The government chemist was called to give oral evidence of an the analyses which he had made. In the course of his evidence he mentioned that he had found a small quantity of codeine in addition to the 46.38g of morphine. Codeine is a methyl derivative of morphine.
For reasons which do not now call for mention, Dr Rintoul did not start his quantitative analysis until Tuesday 6 July although he had verified by qualitative analysis the presence in the sample of morphine and also of some codeine. When he started to use the apparatus for the quantitative test by gas chromatography, however, he found that it contained impurities remaining from the previous use to which it had been put. These impurities made it impossible to obtain accurate quantitative results, although it did indicate that morphine was present in greater quantities than codeine. On the following day, attempts were made by Dr Rintoul`s assistant to clean the apparatus, but these had not been successful by the time that Dr Rintoul was called as a witness for the defence on Friday 9 July. His examination was concluded on the afternoon of that day and he was recalled for cross-examination on Monday 12 July. His apparatus for the quantitative analysis was still unfit for use. The cross-examination lasted all day and at the end of it Dr Rintoul was asked how long it would take for him to purify his apparatus sufficiently to enable him to produce an accurate quantitative analysis. He expressed himself as unable to give any answer to this question. The appellant`s counsel then applied for an adjournment of the hearing until Dr Rintoul`s accurate quantitative analysis was available. This was refused by the court.
On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal two grounds of appeal were eventually relied upon. The principal ground was that the refusal of the judges to grant an adjournment to enable Dr Rintoul to complete his quantitative analysis amounted to a denial of justice to the appellant. The second ground, which although not abandoned, has not been stressed before their Lordships, was that the judges had ruled upon the admissibility of the appellant`s signed confession before they had given his counsel an opportunity to make submissions to them.
In a case in which the quantity of the morphine which is being transported may have such grave consequences on the penalty for the offence, it would seem at first sight to be wrong to deny to the accused an opportunity to present to the court the results of a quantitative analysis by his own expert witness, even though this may involve considerable inconvenience to the court by an adjournment of the hearing. It was for this reason that, on the material before them at the hearing of the appellant`s petition for special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, their Lordships allowed the petition.
Their Lordships have now had an opportunity of considering the detailed record of the expert evidence given at the trial. In the light of this, they are satisfied that the judges` refusal of the application for the adjournment of the hearing was justified, for by the time the adjournment was asked for there was no basis for suggesting that any relevant evidence could become available as a result of Dr Rintoul`s quantitative analysis by gas chromatography.
It was common ground between the two experts, the government chemist and Dr Rintoul, that morphine was present in the two packages which the appellant was transporting, so the only remaining question on which expert evidence was relevant was whether it was present in a greater quantity than 30g. It was also common ground that the most accurate way of measuring the quantity of morphine present was by gas chromatography. There was no suggestion that this method presented any difficulties of manipulation or observation so as to involve the risk of human error on the part of the analyst: and it was common ground that the margin of difference between one analysis and another was of the order of the 2% which existed between the government chemist`s two analyses at intervals of six months. It was never suggested to the Government Chemist in cross-examination or hinted at by Dr Rintoul in examination in chief or in the course of his very lengthy cross-examination that an error of the order of 36% in each of the government chemist`s analyses was within the bounds of possibility. An error of that order would have been required to reduce the quantity of morphine in the packages to below the critical figure of 30g.
At one point in the course of his evidence, Dr Rintoul did suggest that the morphine in the packages might have resulted from the disintegration of codeine into morphine. This theory would have been of little assistance to the appellant unless it could account for the production of 16.38g of morphine by the disintegration of codeine between 9 January 1976 and the first analysis by the government chemist a few days later - a process of disintegration which then stopped. The irresponsibility of this suggestion was brought out very clearly in the cross-examination of this witness as was his avoidance of having to answer every awkward question by reiterating that he did not wish to commit himself until he was in a position to say exactly, what quantity of morphine was disclosed by his own analysis by gas chromatography.
Their Lordships have only been able to scrutinise the transcript of the evidence. The judges at the trial had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses in the box. They took a most unfavourable view of Dr Rintoul`s reliability as an expert witness. They said: 
 
We regret to say that Dr Rintoul was of no assistance to the court. The results of the preliminary tests carried out by him were most unsatisfactory. He had not challenged or repudiated Mr Lim`s figures. Mr Lim, within a period of six months, had carried out two tests and obtained almost identical results. Dr Rintoul`s evidence failed to throw any doubt whatever on the accuracy of Mr Lim`s analysis. There was no suggestion by the defence that the quantitative analysis of Mr Lim was so inaccurate that there was a possibility or probability that the quantitative analysis of Dr Rintoul might prove that the weight of morphine to be less than 30g. We accepted the results obtained by Mr Lim. For these reasons the application for adjournment was refused.
 
 
 
Their Lordships see no reason for differing from this view. The evidence that Dr Rintoul had given was insistent on the accuracy of gas chromatographic analysis. It contained no suggestion that any further analysis of the contents of the packages by him might show a morphine content of less than 30g; and unless he could do this, any minor differences in the figures of morphine content would be irrelevant to the offence with which the appellant was charged.
Counsel for the appellant has not sought to urge that, if he failed on the question as to the adjournment, he could succeed in this appeal upon the second ground, viz that after hearing the evidence as to the circumstances in which the appellant`s confession was made, the judges ruled that it was admissible without giving to appellant`s counsel an opportunity to make submissions to the contrary.
The judges did in fact listen to counsel`s submission after they had indicated their initial ruling but, as they said, he failed to make them change their minds. Quite apart from this, however, there was ample evidence against the appellant without recourse to the confession. Their Lordships are satisfied that the appellant did not suffer any denial of justice at his trial. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

(delivering the judgement of the court): The appellant Lim Hong Yap was convicted by the High Court on the following charge: 
 
That you, Lim Hong Yap, are hereby charged that you on or about the 22 January 1976 at about 8.45am at 171 Upper Paya Lebar Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 to wit, 1032.7g of diamorphine (heroin) without authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and thereby committed an offence under s 3(a) and punishable under s 29 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973.
 
 
 
At the trial the prosecution led evidence that a team of Narcotics Officers, as a result of information received, kept surveillance on premises No 39 Lorong Paya Lebar and its vicinity. At about 8.35am on 22 January 1976 two of the team,A-G Senior Narcotics Officer Teo and A-G Senior Narcotics Officer Yeoh saw the appellant coming out of No 39 Lorong Paya Lebar carrying a parcel in a yellow netted bag. They followed the appellant who walked along Lor Paya Lebar into Upper Paya Lebar Road where he entered a provision shop known as Hua Tiang, No 171 Upper Paya Lebar Road. They saw the appellant place the parcel he was carrying on the top of a show case in the provision shop. They saw him talking to a male Chinese who turned out to be the proprietor by the name of Wang. They saw no one else in the shop at that time. They saw the appellant picking up a tin of lychees from a shelf and placing it beside the parcel on the top of the show case. The appellant then returned to No 39 Lor Paya Lebar with Teo following him while Yeoh remained in the vicinity of the provision shop to keep watch on the parcel.
A few minutes after returning to No 39 Lor Paya Lebar the appellant came out of the house and walked towards Upper Paya Lebar Road with Teo following about 30-50ft behind. The appellant noticed he was being followed and started running. Teo chased him, caught up with him, and, after a violent struggle, eventually overpowered and handcuffed the appellant and brought him to the provision shop where Yeoh joined them. At the provision shop, Wang the proprietor identified the appellant as the person who had earlier on left the parcel on top of the show case. Teo seized the parcel and they then left the provision shop and proceeded to No 39 Lor Paya Lebar. Before they arrived there the appellant told Teo and Yeoh that he had seen a person whose name he gave as Loh Kah place a large quantity of heroin in a school at Aljunied Road. On being told this, Teo instructed Yeoh to keep watch on No 39 Lorong Paya Lebar and he took the appellant to where his office car was parked where he met A-G Narcotics Officer Lio who was looking after the car. The three of them proceeded in the car to the school at Aljunied Road where on arrival the appellant led the narcotics officers to a bush. A search proved fruitless and so they returned to Lor Paya Lebar and the three officers. Teo, Yeoh and Lio entered No 39 Lorong Paya Lebar with the appellant who led Teo to his room on the first floor of the house. In the room the appellant pointed to a briefcase which was found to contain, 
 inter alia, 
the appellant`s passport and three packets containing some brownish substance which Teo suspected to be heroin.
Teo thereupon seized the briefcase and its contents and eventually the appellant was taken to the Central Narcotics Bureau where the Assistant Director, Ronald Naidu, charged the appellant with trafficking in a controlled drug. After the charge was read and explained to the appellant and after he had been duly cautioned the appellant made a statement to Ronald Naidu in answer to the charge. As the appellant was not English educated Senior Narcotics Officer Lee Tai Huat acted as interpreter. His cautioned statement as recorded reads as follows: 
 
The drugs that were seized this morning actually belong to one Loh Kah who is also known as Ah Heng. This morning I placed the bag containing the heroin at a provision store along Upper Paya Lebar Road. I was instructed by Loh Kah to leave the bag of heroin at this store. He told me that some strangers were watching his house and they had the appearance of police officers. He did not want the bag of heroin to be in the house for fear the house might be raided and he gave me instructions to place the bag of heroin on the counter of the provision store at Upper Paya Lebar Road. I did what he told me to do. That is all I wish to state.
 
 
 
The parcel inside the yellow netted bag which was left in the provision shop was found to contain 214 plastic packets of a substance which had the appearance of diamorphine hydrochloride. The total weight of the substance in the 214 plastic packets was 2700g. On analysis the total diamorphine content of the 2700g of the solids was found to be 1032.7g as stated in the charge. The three packets found in the appellant`s briefcase contained a substance which weighed 31.76g On analysis this substance was found to have a total diamorphine content of 11.84g.
The defence objected to the admission in evidence of the cautioned statement and also objected to the admission in evidence of the three packets as containing 11.84g of diamorphine. With regard to the cautioned statement the submission was that it was not a voluntary statement because it had been obtained under duress. After a trial within a trial this objection was rejected. With regard to the three packets found in the appellant`s briefcase the submission was that all evidence relating to it was prejudicial as the appellant was not charged with any offence in relation to the contents of these three packets. This objection was also rejected on the ground that when a person is charged with trafficking in heroin, any heroin found on his person or in his possession is relevant evidence.
The appellant raised two main defences at the trial. He denied on oath that when he came out of No 39 Lorong Paya Lebar on the morning of 22 January 1976 he was carrying the parcel in a yellow netted bag. He said that after leaving the house that morning he was arrested in Upper Paya Lebar Road, not by Teo, but by two other persons who handcuffed him, searched him and eventually took him in a car to the house where he was assaulted and asked questions about Loh Kah. He told them that Loh Kah had a friend who lived somewhere near a school in Aljunied Road and thereupon they took him to Aljunied Road to look for Loh Kah`s friend. When they could not find this person they took him to a field where they again assaulted him and then took him to the provision shop where Wang, the proprietor, in their presence said he could not recognise the appellant. They then returned with him to the house and subsequently they took him to the Central Narcotics Bureau where Teo gave him heroin to smoke and asked him to whom Loh Kah was giving the heroin. When he said he did not know he was again assaulted and left in the room for four hours before he made the statement without being first cautioned. Wang gave evidence for the defence. He said that at about 8am on 22 January 1976 he was alone tying up some parcels at the rear of his shop with his back to the front when he felt someone had entered the shop. When he turned around he saw the back of that person leaving the shop. He said he did not know who left the parcel inside the yellow netted bag on the show case.
The other main defence was that the prosecution had failed to prove the presence of diamorphine in the substance contained in the 214 plastic packets and had also failed to prove the quantity of diamorphine present in that substance. This contention depended upon the evaluation of the evidence of Mr Lim Han Yong, a Government chemist attached to the Department of Scientific Studies and the acceptance as correct and accurate of his report which was admitted in evidence and which reads as follows: 
 
I found the content of the exhibit to be as follows:
 
 
 
RN-1 ... One paper parcel containing the following: 
 
 
(i) Fourteen envelopes each containing ten packets of right brown solids which I analysed and found to contain diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin hydrochloride). I found the 140 packets of solids to weigh a total of 1773g. On further analysis, I found the solids to have an average diamorpine content of 39% weight by weight. The total diamorphine content of these solids is therefore 691.4g. After analysis the remaining solids were put into a plastic bag and marked `RN1`; 
 
(ii) Six envelopes each containing ten packets of purplish brown solids, one envelope containing nine packets of purplish brown solids and one paper packet containing five packets of purplish brown solids which I analysed and found to contain diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin hydrochloride). I found the 74 packets of solids to weigh a total of 930g. On further analysis, I found the solids to have an average diamorphine content of 36.7% weight by weight. The total diamorphine content of this exhibit is therefore 341.3g. After analysis the remaining solids were put into a plastic bag and marked `RN-1`.
  
 
 
Diamorphine hydrochloride is a salt of diamorphine and is therefore a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973.
 
 
 
With regard to the defence relating to the presence and quantity of diamorphine in the substance contained in the 214 plastic packets the defence obtained, before the trial commenced, some of that substance to enable it to be independently analysed by another expert. However, at the trial the defence did not call any expert witness as to whether or not the substance contained diamorphine or, if so, the diamorphine content thereof. The defence relied entirely on cross-examining the prosecution expert, Mr Lim Han Yong, to show that his report on the total diamorphine of the substance contained in the 214 plastic packets ought not to be accepted as proof that diamorphine was present in the substance or, if present, that its diamorphine content totalled 1032.7g in weight.
The trial judges, with regard to this defence, said at p 19 of their grounds of decision: 
 
Mr Lim Han Yong, the Government Chemist, was cross-examined at great length by counsel for the accused at the end of which counsel submitted that the tests carried out by Mr Lim were novel and unreliable and that the court should not therefore act on his evidence. We rejected this submission because it was groundless. We were satisfied with the qualifications, competence and integrity of Mr Lim and further satisfied that the tests he carried out were correct and reliable and we therefore accepted his evidence.
 
 
 
Before us counsel for the appellant raises several points. One contention is that the trial judges failed to recognise that the tests used to support the expert`s report were far from being adequately probative of the presence of diamorphine and still less of the quantity thereof. The evidence of the expert was that four groups of tests were conducted. The first test is known as the Marquis Test which is a colour test and if one of the narcotic drugs is present a violetish purple colour can be observed. In the present case the result was positive. The next test that was conducted is known as the Ferric Chloride Test. It is also a colour test. If diamorphine, which is commonly known as heroin, is present in the substance so tested there is no change in colour. In the present case the substance when tested did not change in colour and thus the presence of diamorphine is suggested. The third test that was conducted is a Salt Test to test for the presence or otherwise of chloride. If a whitish precipitate is observed then the presence of a chloride is indicated and, if the substance itself is soluble in water, it would also indicate the presence of a salt with diamorphine hydrochloride. In the present case the result was also positive. The fourth test that was conducted is known as the Paper Chromatography Test which is a test for the detection of narcotic drugs. Again this test produced a positive result. The expert`s evidence was that after the four abovementioned tests there is an extremely strong possibility that diamorphine is present in the substance found in the 214 plastic packets.
The next two tests conducted were the Nitrite Colour Test and the Liquid Gas Chromatography Test. The expert`s evidence was that the Nitrite Colour Test, if positive, would indicate the possible presence of diamorphine and, if considered in conjunction with positive results from the Paper Chromatography and the Colour Tests, he would say that diamorphine has been identified as being present in the substance so tested. It was also the expert`s evidence that the Nitrite Colour Test is also a test to measure the quantity of diamorphine, if present, in the test sample. In the case of the Nitrite Colour Test a positive result indicating the presence of diamorphine was obtained. Using this test the quantity of diamorphine present was also calculated from a standard calibration graph.
The final test conducted was the Liquid Gas Chromatography Test. The expert`s evidence was that this test by itself is a specific test and that it could be regarded as more than 96% reliable and accurate because in all statistical methods of calculation one could not be able to say it is absolutely accurate. His evidence was that in relation to the quantity of diamorphine present, the results from the Nitrite Colour Test and the Liquid Gas Chromatography Test were in close agreement with each other. The expert, after lengthy cross-examination, categorically said that he had no doubts after taking into consideration the results of all the tests that were conducted that the quantity of diamorphine present in the 214 plastic packets was, as stated in his report, 1032.7g.
In our judgment, the trial judges were entitled to find, and indeed could come to no other conclusion, that the substance found in these plastic packets contained diamorphine and that the diamorphine present in that substance weighed 1032.7g as set out in the charge. The defence called no evidence to challenge the evidence of Mr Lim Han Yong nor was his competence as an expert witness called in question. The only challenge was that the Liquid Gas Chromatography Test that was in fact conducted was not a universally recognised and accepted test to measure the quantity of diamorphine present in a substance that was subjected to that test. It was, however, unquestioned that the latest recognised and accepted method for the quantification of diamorphine which has been identified as being present in a substance is the Liquid Gas Chromatography Test. The only difference between the method used in the present case and the accepted method lies in the use of chemically unrelated (to diamorphine) agents as internal standards in the accepted method and the use of codeine, which is structurally related to diamorphine, as an internal standard in the present case. We are unable to say merely from the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant before us that the prosecution had failed to prove the quantity of diamorphine present in the 214 plastic packets.
Another contention raised before us is that the trial judges were wrong in refusing the defence request for adequate particularisation of the charge against the appellant. This contention is based on the definition of `traffic` in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973. `Traffic` is defined thus in s 2 of the Act: - 
 
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires -
 
 
 
`traffic` means - 
 
 
(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or 
 
(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in para (a) above, otherwise than under the authority of this Act or the regulations made thereunder; and `trafficking` has a corresponding meaning.
  
 
 
The submission is that s 153 of the Criminal Procedure Code makes it mandatory on the prosecution to give particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence, to traffic in a controlled drug, was committed because the charge as framed does not give the appellant sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged by reason of the wide definition of `traffic`.
The relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Code are: 
 
Section 151
 
 
 
 
(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the accused is charged. 
 
(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in the charge by that name only.
  
 
 
... 
(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be mentioned in the charge. 
(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.
 
 
 
Section 152
 
 
 
 
(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and the person, if any, against whom or the thing, if any, in respect of which it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.
  
 
 
Section 153
 
 
 
When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in ss 151 and 152 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose.
 
 
 
Section 155
 
 
 
No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge and no omission to state the offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error or omission.
 
 
 
It is clear that the charge as framed fulfilled the requirements of s 151 and s 152(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and in our opinion the particulars contained in the charge were sufficient to give the appellant notice of the matter with which he was charged. It is to be observed that under s 153 it is only when the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in ss 151 and 152 do not give an accused person sufficient notice of the 
 matter 
with which he is charged that the charge must also contain particulars of the 
 manner 
in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for the purpose of giving him sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged. In any event, even if there were insufficient particulars in the charge as framed, such omission cannot, in terms of s 155, be regarded as material unless it is shown by the appellant that he had in fact been misled by such omission. No such submission has been made before us on his behalf nor has it been argued that there has been a failure of justice as a result of such omission. Furthermore, in the present case it is clear from the verbatim record of the trial that he was aware of the matter with which he was charged and that he was in no way prejudiced in his defence to the charge.
Another contention raised is that the trial judges erred in law in holding that `by transporting or delivering the parcel which contained the diamorphine as charged from 39 Lor Paya Lebar to the provision shop the (appellant) had `trafficked` in the said drug within the meaning of `traffic` in s 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 ... and had thereby committed an offence under s 2 of the said Act`. The argument is that this amounted to an alternative finding which is not permissible in law. It is to be observed that this holding of the trial judges is based on their finding of fact, namely, that `it was (the appellant) who carried the yellow netted bag from 39 Lorong Paya Lebar to the provision shop and left it on top of the show case` (see pp 22-24 of the Grounds of Decision). In our opinion, having regard to that finding of fact, this contention fails.
It is also contended that a miscarriage of justice resulted in that the trial judges, in giving full credence to three material prosecution witnesses who were given copies of their statements to the investigating officer and of their evidence at the Preliminary Inquiry to refresh their memory before giving evidence at the trial, failed to recognise that the evidence of these prosecution witnesses was based on written statements made long after the event. Before we deal with the relevant evidence on this point it is, we think, useful to consider the relevant English law. In 
 R 
 v 
 Richardson 
[1971] 2 All ER 774 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Div, said at pp 776-777: 
 
Leaving such points aside it is however necessary to consider what should be the general approach of the court to there being shown in this way to witnesses their statements - which were not `contemporaneous` within the meaning of that word as normally applied to documents used to refresh memory. First, it is to be observed that it is the practice of the courts not to allow a witness to refresh his memory in the witness box by reference to written statements unless made contemporaneously. Secondly, it has been recognised in a circular issued in April 1969 with the approval of Lord Parker CJ and the judges of the Queen`s Bench Div (the repositories of the common law) that witnesses for the prosecution in criminal cases are normally (though not in all circumstances) entitled, if they so request, to copies of any statements taken from them by police officers. Thirdly, it is to be noted that witnesses for the defence are normally, as is known to be the practice, allowed to have copies of their statements and refresh their memories from them at any time up to the moment they go into the witness box - indeed counsel for the appellant was careful not to submit that there was anything wrong about that. Fourthly, no one has ever suggested that in civil proceedings witnesses may not see their statements up to the time they go into the witness box. One has only to think for a moment of witnesses going into the box to deal with accidents which took place five or six years previously to conclude that it would be highly unreasonable if they were not allowed to see them. Is there then anything wrong in the witnesses in this case being offered an opportunity to see that which they were entitled to ask for and to be shown on request? In a case such as the present is justice more likely to be done if a witness may not see a statement made by him at a time very much closer to that of the accident?
 
 
 
Curiously enough, these questions are very bare of authority. Indeed the only case which has a direct bearing on this issue is one which was decided not in this country but on appeal in the Supreme Court of Hong Kong in 1966: 
 Lau Pak Ngam v 
 
 R, 
which is compactly reported. In the view of each member of this court it contains some sage observations, two of which are apt to be quoted. One of them is: 
 
`Testimony in the witness box becomes more a test of memory than of truthfulness if witnesses are deprived of the opportunity of checking their recollection beforehand by reference to statements or notes made at a time closer to the events in question.`
 
 
 
The other:
 
 
 
`Refusal of access to statements would tend to create difficulties for honest witnesses but be likely to do little to hamper dishonest witnesses.`
 
 
 
With those views this court agrees. It is true that by the practice of the courts of this country a line is drawn at the moment when a witness enters the witness box and when giving evidence there in chief he cannot refresh his memory except by a document which, to quote the words of 
 Phipson on Evidence
, `must have been written either at the time of the transaction or so shortly afterwards that the facts were fresh in his memory.` (Incidentally, that definition does provide a measure of elasticity and should not be taken to confine witnesses to an over-short period). It is moreover a practice which the courts can enforce; when a witness is in the box the court can see that he complies with that practice. The courts, however must take care not to deprive themselves by new, artificial rules of practice of the best chances of learning the truth. The courts are under no compulsion unnecessarily to follow on a matter of practice the lure of the rules of logic in order to produce unreasonable results which would hinder the course of justice. Obviously, it would be wrong if several witnesses were handed statements in circumstances which enabled one to compare with another what each had said. But there can be no general rule (which incidentally would be unenforceable, unlike the rule as to what can be done in the witness box) that witnesses may not before trial see the statements they made at some period reasonably close to the time of the event which is the subject of the trial. Indeed one can imagine many cases, particularly those of a complex nature, where such a rule would militate very greatly against the interests of justice.
 
 
 
We agree that there can be no general rule that witnesses may not before trial see the statements they made at some period reasonably close to the time of the event which is the subject of the trial. Indeed one can imagine many cases, particularly those where the material witnesses are persons such as police officers or narcotics officers whose daily duties consist of investigating activities of a criminal nature, where such a rule would militate very greatly against the interests of justice.
In England, in 
 R v 
 
 Westwell 
[1976] 2 All ER 812 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Div, has also held that the fact that the prosecution has failed to inform the defence that witnesses had seen their statements before giving evidence can be no bar to conviction. In our opinion the law is the same in Singapore.
In the present case, the defence knew, before the prosecution case concluded, that the witnesses had seen their statements. They cross-examined these witnesses who admitted the fact. They could have asked the court to consider discontinuing the trial on the ground of possible prejudice or risk of injustice to the appellant. This the defence did not do. The defence could also have made whatsoever points they wished to make with the court about the weight to be attached to the evidence of these prosecution witnesses. This they did not do. In any event, having regard to the lengthy cross-examination on this aspect of the case, we have no reason to doubt that the court, which consisted of two very experienced judges, in accepting the evidence of these witnesses as reliable and in acting on their evidence, had in mind the fact that they had refreshed their memory before giving their evidence. We reject this contention.
Another ground of appeal is that the trial judges were wrong in admitting in evidence and basing their conviction on the contents of the appellant`s cautioned statement. After a trial within a trial, the trial judges found that the cautioned statement was a voluntary statement and rejected the appellant`s allegations of assault. They also rejected a submission made that the cautioned statement should not be admitted because it was recorded through the interpretation of an interested person. Having regard to the reasons, which are set out in the grounds of decision, given by the trial judges for admitting in evidence the cautioned statement, we are not persuaded that they were wrong in so deciding. It is also apparent from the grounds of decision that the conviction of the appellant was not based entirely on the contents of the cautioned statement. The evidence of the material prosecution witnesses which the trial judges accepted as true clearly proved that it was the appellant who carried the parcel containing the drug, diamorphine, from No 39 Lorong Paya Lebar to the provision shop and who placed the parcel on top of a show case in that shop.
Another contention before us is that the trial judges wrongly admitted in evidence and wrongly took into consideration the fact that the appellant was in possession of another three packets containing a brownish substance weighing 31.76g which on analysis was found to have a total diamorphine content of 11.84g. It is submitted, as it was before the trial court, that all evidence relating to the contents of these three packets was inadmissible as being prejudicial. We reject this submission and agree with the trial judges that the evidence relating to the contents of these three packets is admissible because it is relevant evidence.
Lastly, it is urged on behalf of the appellant that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence and the probability of the case. Having perused with care the verbatim record of the trial, we are satisfied that the trial judges were entitled and justified in accepting the evidence of the material prosecution witnesses and in rejecting the defence evidence and that on the evidence as a whole the trial judges arrived at a correct verdict.
For all these reasons the appeal is dismissed.

(delivering the grounds of decision of the court): The appellant, Visuvanathan s/o Thillai Kannu, was convicted by the High Court of the murder of one Madikum Puspanathan and was sentenced to death. We dismissed his appeal against his conviction and sentence at the conclusion of the appeal and stated we would give our reasons later. We now proceed to do so.
The deceased, Madikum Puspanathan, was found by the police lying dead on the road in front of no 67 Jalan Besar. He had two stab wounds, some minor abrasions and a superficial cut at the base of the right thumb. The pathologist who performed the autopsy certified the cause of death as a stab wound into the heart. That wound is described in the autopsy report as follows:
 Fatal gaping stab-wound 
 below left clavicle. 
 
External appearance: Triangular, base 11/2 cm sides 4 cm, with upper tip pointed to left shoulder. Margins were sharp.
 
 
 
Direction: downwards and inwards, to central portion of chest.
 
 
 
Depth: about 8 cm deep.
 
 
 
Damages: cut through third and fourth rib near left parasternal edge, penetrated left lung (near anterior margin of left upper lobe), then produced a 2 cm cut at the anterior surface of the heart. (Right ventricle, below pulmonary valve.)
 
 
 
The other stab wound was at the left subcostal margin and was externally a cut 2.8 cm long with a depth of 3.5 cm directed downwards, inwards and to the left side.
There were two eye-witnesses to the stabbing. They were Pakrisamy Loganathan and Karuppiah Suppiah who were friends of the deceased. They gave evidence at the trial and were the main prosecution witnesses. Loganathan testified that at about 6pm on 23 January 1976 the deceased had a drink with him at a toddy shop at Sungei Road. From there they went to a Chinese liquor shop at no 73 Jalan Besar at about 6.30pm sat at a table and ordered a bottle of Chinese liquor. Inside the liquor shop there were three male Indians, one of whom was the appellant, who were seated at another table. Soon after, the appellant from where he was seated asked the deceased why the deceased was staring at him to which the deceased replied that he was not. The appellant then stated he was the leader of the gangsters of Veerasamy Road, knew how to box and karate and had been in jail before. The deceased responded saying, ""If you are you can keep it to yourself.""
Soon thereafter, the appellant and his two companions left the liquor shop but ten minutes later the appellant returned alone and sat at the deceased`s table. The appellant then asked the deceased to buy him a drink whereupon the deceased ordered a quarter bottle of Chinese liquor which the appellant emptied into three glasses. While the three of them were drinking, Loganathan saw a friend, Suppiah, outside the liquor shop and he went out to speak to Suppiah and returned to the table. After that the appellant left the liquor shop and, soon after, the deceased also left the table and went outside but returned a few minutes later. After the deceased`s return the appellant also returned to the liquor shop, stood by the table, gulped down his drink and challenged the deceased to a fight. Loganathan separated them and then left the liquor shop to buy cigarettes. As he re-entered the liquor shop he saw the appellant pulling the deceased out on to the street and there started a fight with the deceased. Loganathan tried to stop the fight but while he was doing so the proprietress of the liquor shop shouted for her bill to be paid and so Loganathan returned into the liquor shop and paid the bill. After doing so Loganathan returned to the scene of the fighting and saw the deceased being stabbed on the left chest by the appellant using a knife. After stabbing the deceased the appellant ran into a back lane. The deceased, holding his left chest with his hand, ran towards the junction of Jalan Besar and Upper Weld Road.
Suppiah testified that soon after he had spoken to Loganathan outside the liquor shop the appellant hailed him and asked him what Loganathan had been speaking to him about and boasted to him that he (the appellant) was a secret society member in the Jalan Besar area. At this stage, the deceased came up to them and asked Suppiah what they had been talking about to which Suppiah replied, ""Nothing."" Suppiah then in answer to a question by the appellant said he had known the deceased since he was a small boy. The appellant and the deceased then started an argument whereupon Suppiah told them not to argue and tried to send them back into the liquor shop. Suppiah then left with his girlfriend and had coffee at a coffee stall nearby. Shortly thereafter on hearing a shout coming from the direction of the liquor shop, he went towards where the sound had come from and saw the deceased with Loganathan on one side of the road and the appellant on the other side. He saw the deceased and the appellant rushing towards each other. He then saw the appellant, holding a dark object, deliver a blow to the chest of the deceased as they were facing each other. At this stage his girlfriend came up to him and pulled him back to the coffee stall. At the coffee stall he saw the appellant running in front of a back lane and holding in his hand an object that looked like a knife. Then he saw Loganathan walking towards the direction of Serangoon Road. Then someone whom he knew came up to him and told him the deceased was lying down at Jalan Besar road and so he rushed there with his girlfriend and saw the deceased lying on the road and saw blood under the deceased`s body.
Tamil Mulai, a cousin of the appellant gave evidence for the prosecution. She said that at about 6.30pm on 23 January 1976 the appellant, who was staying at her mother`s house no 118 Veerasamy Road, came home, changed his shirt, took a kitchen knife and wrapped it in a piece of paper and left the house with it. Later that day, at about 7.15pm she saw the appellant at home with the same knife which had blood on it and she heard the appellant tell her mother that he had killed a man in Jalan Besar.
A cautioned statement made by the appellant after his arrest was admitted in evidence and reads as follows: 
 
I came to my aunty`s house on 19 January 1976. I stayed there for two days. On 23 January 1976 at 7pm I went to the Bar at Jalan Besar for some drinks. I was having my drink, two male Indian were sitting there. They were staring at me. I also asked them if they knew me. The one who stared at me replied that his look was always such. For about ten minutes nothing happened and we continued drinking. I did not look at them. After sometime, the deceased asked me if I wanted a fight. I refused. One of them came to my table poured some drink into my glass. Before doing so he forcibly brought me to his table. The deceased was the one who offered me some drink. Sometime later, the other male Indian left the table and walked towards Sungei Road and came back five minutes later. The deceased then patted my shoulder and asked me whether I would want to fight with him outside the Bar. I told him that I did not know him and so why was he asking me for a fight. Both of them were aggressive. I was terrified and ran to my aunty`s house. I feared that they might be armed. I saw the handle of a knife on the deceased`s friend. As such I took a knife from my aunty`s house and went back to the Bar. They were standing outside the Bar. On seeing me they ran towards me. They seemed intent on beating me. The deceased punched me. I was intoxicated and very angry. I stabbed him. I cannot remember where and how many times I stabbed him. I did not know what I was doing. Without realising myself I went back to my aunty`s place. I washed the knife and threw it somewhere in the house. I scolded my aunty`s daughter for misbehaving. My aunty told me that my father was seriously ill. She then brought me to the bus stop. I boarded a bus and went home to Kluang, Johore. My aunty does not know anything about the incident.
 
 
 
The appellant elected to give evidence on oath. He said that he was drunk when he arrived at the Chinese liquor shop with two Indian friends, having consumed half a bottle of Chinese wine and six pints of toddy on an empty stomach. While they were drinking at the Chinese liquor shop, the deceased and Loganathan came in, ordered drinks and started drinking. He exchanged some words with Loganathan and the deceased. Then Loganathan left the liquor shop and he noticed Loganathan had a knife by the side of his waist. His friends became frightened and so they paid for their drinks and went outside and remained outside for a while. He told his friends not to be frightened and to wait for him. He went to his aunt`s house, changed his shirt and took a kitchen knife for his protection and then returned to the same liquor shop. Not seeing his friends outside, he went in thinking they had gone into the liquor shop. On entering he saw Loganathan and the deceased seated at a table. The deceased called him to their table, asked him to sit down and to have a drink with them. Although he declined the offer of a drink, the deceased ordered a quarter bottle of Chinese wine, poured the contents into three glasses and started to drink. They talked aggressively to him. Then he saw Loganathan leave the liquor shop and saw him talking to Suppiah and then return to the table. Then he saw Suppiah beckoning him to come out. He went out and Suppiah spoke to him. The deceased also came out and spoke to him. Then Suppiah who was with a girl left and the appellant and the deceased returned into the liquor shop and he was asked to drink. After that all three left the liquor shop and outside Loganathan and the deceased started punching him. He tried to ward off their punches by swinging his arms wildly and vaguely remembered he had something in his hand. Suddenly the deceased took off in one direction and Loganathan in another. He saw people gathering around and he also ran back to his aunt`s house. He was drunk and dizzy and only vaguely remembered he was holding something. On arriving at his aunt`s house, he saw a knife in his hand and blood on his hands. Shortly after his aunt told him that his father was very sick and that he should return to his own home, which was in Johore. His aunt took him to a bus stop and put him on a bus to Johore Bahru. On arriving at Johore Bahru, he took a taxi home to Kluang.
The trial judges rejected the appellant`s evidence that he was assaulted by Loganathan and the deceased and that he defended himself by swinging his arms wildly. They accepted the evidence of Loganathan and found that the injuries the appellant inflicted on the deceased were not in exercise of any right of private defence. They found that it was the appellant who started the fight with the deceased in the course of which he stabbed the deceased in the chest and then ran away. They also found that the appellant inflicted the fatal stab wound, that the fatal injury was an intended injury and was not caused accidentally or otherwise unintentionally and was an injury which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased. They also found that the appellant was not so drunk as not to know what he was doing at the material time and was not so affected by alcohol as to be incapable of forming the specific intent under cl (c) of s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) (the Code). They also found that it was the appellant who provoked the deceased and picked up a fight with him. Accordingly, they found the appellant guilty of murder as charged as, on the evidence, the appellant was not entitled to the benefit of any of the general exceptions laid down in the Code nor to any of the exceptions to s 300 of the Code.
During the appeal, it was urged on behalf of the appellant that the trial judges erred in accepting Loganathan`s evidence and Suppiah`s evidence and should have accepted the appellant`s evidence. Our attention was drawn to some contradictions in the evidence of Loganathan and Suppiah but in our judgment these were immaterial contradictions in the context of the clear and undisputed facts that the appellant had returned to the scene armed with a knife and that it was the appellant who inflicted the stab wounds on the unarmed deceased. Another submission on behalf of the appellant which was rejected was that the trial judges erred in law and in fact in admitting in evidence the cautioned statement of the appellant. In our judgment the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them at the `trial within a trial` to find that there was no inducement, threat or promise and that the appellant`s cautioned statement was made voluntarily.
In our judgment the evidence was overwhelming that the appellant caused the death of the deceased in circumstances which amounted to murder under s 300 of the Code and we accordingly dismissed the appeal.

(delivering the judgment of the court): These two appeals arise out of a High Court action in suit no 932 of 1975 commenced by Wee Peng Whatt, the first respondent in Civil Appeal No 43 of 1977 and the respondent in Civil Appeal No 46 of 1977, against Singapore Transport Supply Service Pte Ltd, the appellant in Civil Appeal No 43 of 1977, Public Crane Co, the second respondent in Civil Appeal No 43 of 1977 and the appellant in Civil Appeal No 46 of 1977, and Lim Ah Soon, the third respondent in Civil Appeal No 43 of 1977. With the consent of all the parties, these two appeals were heard together and we propose to give one judgment covering these two appeals.
In this judgment we will refer to Wee Peng Whatt as the plaintiff, Singapore Transport Supply Service Pte Ltd, as the first defendants, Public Crane Co as the second defendants and Lim Ah Soon as the third defendant.
On 19 August 1972 the plaintiff and four co-employees of the first defendants were engaged in unloading cartons of milk from lorries on to a tongkang. The unloading was carried out by means of a mobile crane no SGC 3797 which was hired by the first defendants, who had a contract to unload these cartons on to a tongkang, from the second defendants. The mobile crane was owned by the third defendant. It had a crew of two, the driver and an attendant. The system used can best be described in the words of the plaintiff who said: 
 
Two men on the lorry and three men in the tongkang. Cartons of milk would be loaded on the pallet, taken by the crane, swung over the tongkang and then lowered into the tongkang. 48 cartoons per pallet. I was one of those in the tongkang. Standing at the bottom of the tongkang I could not see the crane driver. The crane attendant`s job was to give signals and instruction to the crane driver. I could see the signalman. In the tongkang there was a taikong and his assistant. These two assisted us in the stacking of the goods in the tongkang. Four of us were involved in taking hold of the pallet, bringing it to rest in the tongkang. Then we would take the strings and pull them and hook them back on the hook. At the signal from the signal man this would be lifted and the whole process would be repeated. Then off-loading from the pallet and thereafter stacking the cartons in the tongkang individually. The pallet is then pushed aside. We would wait for five or six pallets to accumulate when we would have them sent back to the lorry from which the goods were being unloaded.
 
 
 
During the course of the unloading, when the plaintiff was picking up a carton from a pallet resting in the hold of the tongkang, he was struck by another fully loaded pallet which was being lowered on to the tongkang. He sustained severe injuries for which the trial judge awarded him damages assessed at $177,305.
In his grounds of judgment the trial judge said: 
 
On the admissions, documents and evidence before me I made the following findings of fact -
 
 
 
 
(1) That the plaintiff at all material times was employed by the first defendants to unload goods from the first defendants` lorries into tongkangs at Boat Quay (not disputed); 
 
(2) That on 19 August 1972 the plaintiff was in a tongkang in the course of his duties as aforesaid when the said Teng Ann Teng (PW4), the crane operator of a mobile crane No SGC 3797, in the course of lowering cartons of milk laden on a pallet into the hold of the tongkang lowered the said pallet on the plaintiff thereby causing him injuries as aforesaid (not disputed); 
 
(3) That on the day and time in question the said crane was operated by one Teng Ann Teng (PW4) (disputed only as to whose employee he was) and an attendant (admitted that he was employee of second defendants), whose name did not come out at the trial; 
 
(4) On the evidence of Teng Ann Teng (PW4) whom I regard as an entirely satisfactory witness and the evidence of Toh Guan Leng (2 DW2), the Manager of the second defendants from 1970-1974, given under cross-examination by plaintiff`s counsel, I find that on 19 August 1972, the date of the accident, the crane driver, Teng Ann Teng (PW4) was in the employ of the second defendants and worked under their direction; 
 
(5) That the mobile crane No SGC 3797 on the date and time of the accident was under the care, custody, control and direction of the second defendants; 
 
(6) That the crane used to lift the goods into the hold of the tongkang was hired by the first defendants from the second defendants who were independent contractors and that the second defendants provided the same with a driver (Teng Ann Teng) and an attendant; 
 
(7) That the accident was caused through the negligence of the crane driver and/or the signalman, both employees of the second defendants, in the course of their employment and not contributed to by the plaintiff in any way; 
 
(8) That both the first and second defendants knew that the system of unloading goods from the lorries into the hold of the tongkang was for the crane to lift from the lorry on the quayside, the goods which had been stacked on pallets into the hold of the tongkang and for the plaintiff and other workers in the hold of the tongkang to stack the goods so lowered in the hold.
  
 
 
The trial judge went on to say: 
 
In the view I took of the evidence that the third defendant did not hire out the said crane to the second defendants nor that the crane driver and the signalman thereof were his servants, or agents I found no liability against the third defendant.
 
 
 
The trial judge also found the first defendants and the second defendants were equally to blame and gave judgment for the plaintiff against them for the amount awarded and made an order that amount and the costs of the plaintiff be borne equally between them.
The trial judge`s finding that the first defendants were liable for the plaintiff`s injuries is based, partly, on the undisputed evidence that the plaintiff was on that day engaged in a repetitive and dangerous operation of unloading goods from quayside lorries onto the hold of a tongkang and that no instructions were given to the workers by the first defendants and, partly, on his finding that there was no adequate supervision on that day. The trial judge came to the conclusion that no system of work, having in mind the safety of their employees, was considered at all by the first defendants.
It is contended on behalf of the first defendants in their appeal that the method employed on that day as described by the plaintiff to unload the cartons of milk from quayside lorries into a tongkang was not basically an unsafe system so long as the crane attendant, who acted as signalman, and the crane driver took due care and that there was no necessity for any supervision during the operation. It is to be observed that it is common ground that the second defendants were independent contractors and that the attendant and the crane driver were not under the control of the first defendants. Another observation to be borne in mind is that in an operation of this kind, as testified by the operations manager of the first defendants, the risk to the workers working in the hold of the tongkang is from a load falling on them when it is being lowered on to the tongkang by means of the crane.
The law is well settled. An employer is under a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of his workmen. Where the task is such as to call for the laying down of a system or mode of working in the interests of safety it is the employer`s duty to use reasonable skill and care to provide a proper and safe system of work. The test is that of what is reasonable and proper to be done for the safety of the workman in the circumstances of the particular case. (See Lord MacDermott in 
 Winter 
 v 
 Cardiff RDC 
 [1950] 1 All ER 819 at p 823.) In our judgment, in the circumstances of the present case, we can see no ground for disagreeing with the trial judge`s decision that the first defendants had failed in their duty towards the plaintiff.
We turn now to deal with the appeal of the second defendants. As we have said the mobile crane no SGC 3797 was owned by the third defendant. The crane was operated by a driver and an attendant who acted as signalman to the driver. On 19 August 1972 the crane, with its driver and attendant, was one of two mobile cranes hired by the first defendants, who had contracted to load goods on to a tongkang at Robinson Quay, from the second defendants, who owned mobile cranes for the purpose of letting them out on hire. The first defendants had on previous occasions hired mobile cranes from the second defendants.
The evidence of the plaintiff, which was not disputed at the trial, was that he was picking up a carton from a pallet resting in the hold of the tongkang when he was struck by another fully loaded pallet which was being lowered on to the tongkang. The evidence of the crane driver, whom the trial judge found to be an entirely satisfactory witness, was that he lowered the pallet which struck the plaintiff when the crane attendant gave him the signal to lower it. The attendant was not called to give evidence at the trial. On the evidence the trial judge found that the accident to the plaintiff was caused through the negligence of the crane driver and/or the signalman and not contributed to by the plaintiff in any way.
It is contended on behalf of the second defendants that there was no evidence to support the trial judge`s finding that the crane driver was negligent and that the trial judge, having found the crane driver to be an entirely satisfactory witness, ought to have found on the crane driver`s evidence that the crane driver was not guilty of any negligence in lowering the loaded pallet in response to the signal of the crane attendant. We accept this contention.
It is also contended on behalf of the second defendants that the trial judge erred in finding that the crane attendant was negligent as there was no evidence to support that finding. In our judgment, it must follow, on the trial judge`s acceptance of the crane driver`s evidence that he lowered the loaded pallet on a signal from his attendant, that the crane attendant was negligent in giving the signal to lower when the plaintiff was engaged in removing several cartons of milk on a pallet resting in the hold of the tongkang.
It is next contended that even though the crane driver and/or the attendant were negligent the second defendants were not vicariously liable for their negligence because the trial judge should have found on the evidence that they were servants of the third defendant, who owned the crane, and not servants of the second defendants. As we have come to the conclusion that the crane driver was not negligent the question of vicarious liability in respect of the crane driver does not arise in the present case. With regard to the crane attendant there is a clear admission by Toh Guan Leng, the then manager and partner of the second defendant firm, that the crane attendant was in the employ of the second defendants at the date of the accident. It is urged on behalf of the second defendants that the trial judge should have found on the evidence that Toh Guan Leng was the agent of the third defendant and in his capacity as such agent had employed the crane attendant so as to constitute the third defendant the master of the crane attendant at all material times. It is to be observed that Toh Guan Leng was a witness called on behalf of the second defendants and in answer to a question by the court and also during re-examination he unequivocally said that the crane attendant at the date of the accident was an employee of the second defendants.
In our judgment the trial judge was entitled to rely on the admission of Toh Guan Leng that the crane attendant was at the material date the employee of the second defendants and not of the third defendant. In any event, we are of the opinion that on all the evidence before the trial judge the crane attendant was bound to carry out his duties at the material date, in the words of Lord Esher MR in 
 Donovan 
 v 
 Laing, Wharton, and Down Construction Syndicate Ltd 
 
[1893] 1 QB 629
 at p 631, `according to the orders and under the absolute control of` the second defendants. It follows, in our opinion, that the second defendants must be vicariously liable for the negligence of the crane attendant which resulted in the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.
Accordingly, both appeals must be dismissed with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
(delivering the judgment of the court): The appellant, Lee Kin Kheong, was convicted by the High Court of unlawfully trafficking in 40.37g of diamorphine, a controlled drug, in contravention of s 3(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (the Act) and sentenced to death. He now appeals against his conviction and sentence.
The facts were very simple. On 22 April 1976 acting on information received, two narcotics officers kept observation at the junction of Kallang Road and Kampong Soopoo. At about 4.20pm they saw the appellant cycling along Kallang Road towards them and as he reached that junction they rushed towards him and ordered him to stop. He abandoned his bicycle and dashed off into Kampong Soopoo but was arrested by the narcotics officers about 150 metres from the junction.
The appellant was then taken to the Central Narcotics Bureau where he was searched by senior narcotics officer Lee who found on him two packets wrapped in Chinese newsprint. One packet contained five polythene sachets and the other contained two polythene sachets of a brownish solid substance. On analysis, the substance contained in the seven sachets was found to have a total diamorphine content of 40.37g. At the trial the appellant did not dispute these facts except that in cross-examination he said that he was cycling along Kampong Soopoo towards Kallang Road and when he reached the junction of those two roads he was pounced upon and arrested by two narcotics officers.
The trial judges, after a trial within a trial, also admitted in evidence a cautioned statement made by the appellant to senior narcotics officer Lee at about 5.40pm on the day of his arrest. The cautioned statement reads as follows: 
 
On 22 April 1976 at 1pm at Kampong Soopoo, one Malaysian Ah Hock handed to me two newspaper wrappings of heroin and asked me to hand over the same paper wrappings to one Botak. I accepted the two newspaper wrappings and concealed them inside my underwear. I earned a commission of $15 from each sachet of heroin I received from Ah Hock. Until the time I was arrested by the authorities I had accepted the similar type of newspaper wrappings from Ah Hock on four occasions.
 
 
 
The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf at the trial. He said that he was a heroin addict having started smoking heroin two years before his arrest. He said he had bought the two packets containing heroin which were found on him for his own consumption for $1,190, a price cheaper than the usual market price. He had bought such a large quantity as at that time he happened to win $4,000 in a lottery and when he met a drug pusher, Ah Hock, he bought from him the two packets of heroin. In cross-examination he said he had met Ah Hock first at 11am on the day of his arrest and later between 3pm and 4pm when he bought the heroin from Ah Hock `somewhere in Kampong Soopoo`. He was on his way home after buying the heroin when he was arrested.
The trial judges disbelieved the appellant. They found that although the appellant had retracted the cautioned statement he made to senior narcotics officer Lee it was a true statement and that `it showed quite clearly that by carrying the two packets of heroin on his person for the purpose of delivering it to another person, the (appellant) was guilty of an offence under s 3 of the Act of unauthorised trafficking in a controlled drug within the meaning of the expression laid down in s 2 of the Act`. The trial judges in their grounds of decision stated that on the evidence before them they `had no doubt at all that the (appellant) was guilty of the offence of unauthorised trafficking in a controlled drug under s 3(a) of the Act`.
First, it is contended that the trial judges were wrong in admitting the appellant`s cautioned statement in evidence against him at the trial. When the prosecution sought to introduce the cautioned statement in evidence counsel for the appellant objected to its admissibility and accordingly a trial within a trial was conducted. As is clear from the transcript of the evidence in the record of appeal the objection was based on the appellant`s assertion that before he gave a statement he was asked by the officer who was going to record it in what Chinese dialect he wished to speak. He said he wished to speak in the Cantonese dialect and he wanted a Cantonese interpreter to which the officer replied that there was no Cantonese interpreter available. He then made his statement, speaking in Cantonese, which the officer recorded. After he had finished his statement he said the officer read back, speaking in the Hokkien dialect, the statement to him. He said he did not understand what the officer said as he could understand a few words in Hokkien only and that he signed the statement because he was asked to sign it and for fear he might be assaulted if he did not sign it.
The recording officer, on the other hand, gave evidence that the appellant was offered a choice and chose to speak in Hokkien. He denied that the appellant requested for a Cantonese interpreter. He said the appellant spoke fluent Hokkien and understood him when he spoke to the appellant in Hokkien. He said that after he had finished recording the appellant`s statement he read it back to the appellant in Hokkien, that he invited the appellant to make any correction he wished and that the appellant said he had no correction to make after which the appellant signed the recorded statement.
The trial judges accepted the recording officer`s version as to what exactly happened when the statement was recorded and found that he was speaking the truth as to the circumstances under which the statement was recorded. They also found that the statement was made voluntarily without any threat, promise or inducement.
The submission before us is that the trial judges should have found on the evidence before them that the appellant was not given an opportunity to speak in Cantonese which is his native dialect, that the appellant did not understand the contents of the statement when he signed it because he could not understand the recording officer when he read back to him in Hokkien the contents of the statement and that the appellant was under duress at the material time. We do not accept this submission. There was evidence which the trial judges could properly act on in arriving at their decision to admit the appellant`s cautioned statement in evidence.
The next contention is that the trial judges erred in law in convicting the appellant under s 3(a) of the Act in that there was no evidence to support a conviction under that section. The charge on which the appellant was convicted reads: 
 
You, Lee Kin Kheong, are charged that on or about 22 April 1976 at about 4.20pm at Kampong Soopoo, Singapore, did unlawfully traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of Pt I of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973 (No 5 of 1973), to wit, 40.37g of diamorphine and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973 (No 5 of 1973), punishable under s 29 of the aforsesaid Act.
 
 
 
Section 3(a) of the Act reads: 
 
Except as authorised by this Act or the regulations made thereunder, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not such other person is in Singapore to -
 
 
 
(a) traffic in a controlled drug.
 
 
 
`Traffic` is defined in s 2 of the Act to mean, inter alia: 
 
 
(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or 
 
(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in para (a) above,
  
 
 
otherwise than under the authority of this Act or the regulations made thereunder.
 
 
 
The evidence, as accepted by the trial judges, showed that the appellant was carrying on his person two newsprint wrappings, containing seven packets of a substance, which on analysis had a diamorphine content of 40.37g, while riding a bicycle along a public street. He had obtained these two newsprint wrappings, knowing their contents, from a person known to him as Ah Hock and was carrying them with him to deliver to a person known to him as Botak. Diamorphine is a controlled drug within the meaning of the Act. In our judgment, on these facts, and having regard to the definition of `traffic` in s 2 of the Act, the appellant was properly convicted as charged and his appeal against conviction is dismissed. As the quantity of diamorphine in which the appellant unlawfully trafficked exceeded 15g his appeal against the sentence of death passed must also be dismissed.

On 13 January 1976, as a result of information received from an informer, a taxi SH 2381 U was stopped by three police officers. The taxi was searched and heroin was found in the taxi. The taxi-driver was arrested and charged. Subsequently a preliminary inquiry was held and the taxi-driver was committed for trial in the High Court on a charge of drug trafficking. The appellant, Chew Tak, was one of the three police officers who arrested the taxi- driver. In accordance with the usual procedure, the appellant gave a statement on 16 January 1976 to the police inspector conducting the police investigation into the case against the taxi-driver. Later, on 1 April 1976 the appellant made and signed a statement under s 139 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) for use at the preliminary inquiry. At the preliminary inquiry held on 9 April 1976 this signed statement was tendered and admitted in evidence.
Before the charge against the taxi-driver came up for trial in the High Court, as a result of a direction from the Public Prosecutor, the appellant and the other two police officers who took part in the arrest of the taxi-driver were required to and made statements to two police inspectors in relation to the charge against the taxi driver. The appellant`s statement was made to Inspector Sukhdev Singh 29 August 1976.
Subsequently, the appellant was charged, tried and convicted on the following two charges: 
 
 
 
 
 First charge 
 
 
 
You, Chew Tak, are charged that you on or about 9 April 1976 in the course of a Preliminary Inquiry held before the learned Magistrate of Court No 14 Subordinate, Courts, Havelock Road, Singapore with a view to committal for trial to the High Court of one Tan Sit Yang on a charge of trafficking in a controlled drug which is an offence under s 3(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (No 5 of 1973) and punishable under s 29 of the said Act, did intentionally state in evidence: 
 
`On 13 January 1976 at about 7.40pm, I received a phone call from Cheong Foo Thiong DPC 6758 of CID at my home at Block 33, No 38-C Jalan Tiga. He requested me to meet him at Lorong 6 junction Geylang Road. I then left with Ang Beng Kuan PC 8286 who was then in my house` 
 
and that you, on or about 29 August 1976 at CID Robinson Road, in the course of a Police Inquiry into the same case before Insp Sukhdev Singh, did intentionally state that: 
 
`I then left to look for DPC 6758 at his sister`s house at Blk 11, Jalan Batu. I met DPC 6758 there and told him that PC 8286 had information that a taxi-driver would be trafficking in drugs at 7.00pm along Lorong 6 Geylang on that day, I asked him whether he wanted to accompany us to arrest the taxi-driver, he agreed and we left the place together. I rode my own motorcycle whilst DPC 6758 used his. We went back to Block 4, Dakota Crescent and joined PC 8286 again in waiting for the telephone call. We waited for a few minutes and there was a telephone call which PC 8286 answered. I do not know what transpired between him and the party at the other end but I remember his asking for the taxi number. The conversation for less than two minutes after which he told us the taxi number as SH 2381 U, and said that the taxi would be coming in from the Mountbatten Road side to the Geylang Road side. He asked us to leave immediately as the taxi would go there anytime then. We then left Dakota Crescent on our motorcycles. I carried PC 8286 pillion whilst DPC 6758 rode his own motor cycle` 
 
one of which statements you either knew or believed to be false, or did not believe to be true, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 193 of the Penal Code, Ch 103. 
 
 
 
 Second charge 
 
 
 
You, Chew Tak, are charged that you on or about 9 April 1976 in the course of a Preliminary Inquiry held before the learned Magistrate of Court No 14 Subordinate Courts, Havelock Road, Singapore, with a view to committal for trial to the High Court of one Tan Sit Yang on a charge of trafficking in a controlled drug which is an offence under s 3(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (No 5 of 1973) and punishable under s 29 of the said Act, did intentionally state in evidence that: 
 
`Whilst searching the taxi, I discovered a polythene bag underneath the driver`s seat which is shown at photograph No 2. The polythene bag contained five packets of brownish substance` 
 
and that you on or about 29 August 1976 at CID Robinson Road, in the course of a police inquiry into the same case before Insp Sukhdev Singh, did intentionally state that: 
 
`I searched the taxi for about five minutes but I was unable to find anything incriminating. PC 8286 then showed us a bundle he had found in the taxi. He opened the bundle and there were five plastic packets containing some brownish substance` 
 
one of which statements you either knew or believed to be false, or did not believe to be true, and you have thereby committed an offence Punishable under s 193 of the Penal Code, Ch 103.
  
 
 
The appellant now appeals. The facts are relatively simple. As regards the first charge, the prosecution`s case was that the appellant, in his signed statement which was admitted in evidence at the preliminary inquiry held on 9 August 1976, stated that Cheong, Detective 6758, telephoned and requested him to meet Cheong at the junction of Lorong 6, Geylang Road and that he went there accompanied by PC 8286 and met Cheong and then all of them waited in ambush for taxi SH 2381 U. This taxi was stopped and a polythene bag containing five packets of a brownish substance (which was later ascertained to contain diamorphine) was found under the driver`s seat. In his statement to Inspector Sukhdev Singh on 29 August 1976 he stated that it was at the request of PC 8286 that he went to Lorong 6, Geylang Road and there with PC 8286 and Detective Cheong an ambush was laid for taxi SH 2381 U. This later statement also contained an admission that the information which led to the arrest of the taxi-driver was supplied by PC 8286 and not by Detective Cheong. It also contained his explanation why he had not told the truth as to the informant being PC 8286 and not Detective Cheong. The explanation was that PC 8286 had obtained information about the taxi-driver from the taxi-driver`s mistress and because of this he had been persuaded by PC 8286 not to reveal in his statement to the investigating officer which was made three days after the taxi-driver`s arrest that it was PC 8286 who had supplied him with the information about the taxi-driver.
The appellant, at his trial, did not dispute that in truth it was PC 8286 and not Detective Cheong who informed him about the taxi-driver. The trial judge found that he `had given false evidence in a judicial proceeding` and in my opinion the only inference from that finding is that the trial judge had accepted the explanation contained in the appellant`s statement to Inspector Sukhdev Singh and the appellant`s evidence at the trial. In my judgment that was the only possible finding on the evidence before the trial judge.
However, on the statements available to the prosecution, the proper course would have been to charge the appellant with intentionally giving false evidence at the preliminary inquiry instead of a charge in the alternative as framed. Clearly, there was no difficulty in proving that the statement tendered in evidence at the preliminary inquiry as to the identity of the appellant`s informant was not true. However, in my judgment the error in the form of the charge did not occasion a failure of justice. The evidence was clear and indeed the appellant in his evidence admitted that his statement on that point as tendered in evidence at the preliminary inquiry was not true. As regards the sentence different considerations apply. Having regard to the appellant`s reason for giving this piece of false evidence, which was to prevent disclosure that the taxi-driver`s mistress had informed on her lover, a sentence of nine months` imprisonment, in the circumstances of this case, is manifestly excessive. It appears to be entirely irrelevant to the successful prosecution of the taxi-driver for evidence to be given why an ambush was laid. Accordingly, I set aside the sentence of imprisonment and impose a fine of $1,000 in respect of the first charge.
As regards the second charge, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider the totality of the contents of the three statements, including the circumstances under which they were made by the appellant following on the arrest of the taxi-driver and the discovery of the five packets of diamorphine in the taxi. It is to be observed, had this been done, that the statement to Inspector Sukhdev Singh made after the taxi-driver had been committed to trial in the High Court was a more detailed statement than the first statement made by the appellant to the investigating officer, Sgt Makhan Singh, and the statement tendered in evidence at the preliminary inquiry.
In the context of the ambush and the search of the taxi, which was beyond doubt conducted by the appellant and PC 8286, and the explanation given by the appellant at his trial the finding of the district judge that the appellant made an untruthful statement as to who discovered the diamorphine in his statement tendered in evidence at the preliminary inquiry cannot be sustained. While the latter statement may not be the whole truth, having regard to all the circumstances, there was in my judgment a reasonable doubt that the appellant had intentionally given false evidence as defined in s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) when in his latter statement he stated that `whilst searching the taxi, I discovered a polythene bag under the driver`s seat`. Accordingly, the conviction on the second charge must be set aside.
 Order accordingly.",1978-03-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

We dismissed the appeal of Loong Phong Hoy against his conviction by the High Court on the following charge: 
 
Loong Phong Hoy, you are charged that you on or about 10 March 1977, at about 7.15am at the Woodlands checkpoint, Singapore, without being authorised by the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, No 5 of 1973, or the regulations made thereunder, did traffic in a controlled drug specified under Class `A` of Pts I of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, No 5 of 1973, to wit 392.6g diamorphine, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3 sub-s (a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, No 5 of 1973, and punishable under s 29 of the said Act.
 
 
 
We now proceed to give our reasons. The evidence at the trial was as follows. At about 7.15am on 10 March 1977 a Singapore/Johore Express bus No SH 115 arrived from Johore Bahru at the Woodlands Checkpoint. The appellant was a passenger who had boarded the bus at Johore Bahru. He was seen by two Central Narcotics Bureau officers alighting from the bus and being cleared through Immigration and Customs without being searched. He was then stopped by one of the Central Narcotics Bureau officers, Ooi Hock Aun, who identified himself as an officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau. Noting that the appellant`s midriff was bulging, Ooi Hock Aun lifted the shirt and inner singlet of the appellant and saw two packets each wrapped up in newsprint lodged between the appellant`s abdomen and the waist band of his trousers. One newsprint was a Thai and the other a Chinese newsprint.
At this juncture the appellant told Ooi Hock Aun in the Hokkien dialect that he was carrying two packets of `Peh hoon` and asked for forgiveness. Evidence was led that diamorphine is referred to in the Hokkien dialect as `peh hoon`. Ooi Hock Aun then arrested the appellant.
The appellant was subsequently taken to the offices of the Central Narcotics Bureau where the two packets were then taken from his person. An analysis of the contents of the two packets showed that they contained diamorphine totalling 392.6g.
In his defence the appellant testified that he had arrived at Johore Bahru by bus from Bukit Mertajam at about 6.30am on 10 March 1977 with a friend, Tan Chin Nam, and after breakfast in Johore Bahru he had bought two bus tickets and boarded a Singapore/ Johore Express bus with his friend. They sat at the back of the bus side by side. When the bus arrived at Woodlands Checkpoint and as the other passengers were alighting from it Tan Chin Nam asked him to keep two packets of Chinese medicine and take them through the Customs checkpoint. His friend asked him `to smuggle them because if they were found duty would have to be paid`. At first he refused but his friend told him that it was not serious. He agreed to smuggle them through Customs because they had been friends for many years and he then tucked the two packets at his waist. He did this when the other passengers were getting down from the bus.
The trial judges did not believe the appellant`s evidence. They found the appellant was an evasive witness who contradicted himself under cross-examination. They rejected his claim that the two packets were handed to him by a friend, Tan Chin Nam, and that he did not know that the packets contained diamorphine. They accepted the evidence of the prosecution that the appellant admitted at Woodlands carrying two packets of diamorphine.
At the appeal it was contended on the appellant`s behalf that the trial judges erred in law in admitting in evidence the oral statements made by the appellant to the narcotics officer contrary to the provisions of s 121(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which reads as follows: 
 
Save as herein provided, no statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under this Chapter shall be used in evidence other than a statement that is a written statement admissible under s 140.
 
 
 
We rejected this contention as the statements made by the appellant were not made `to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under [Ch XIII] of the Criminal Procedure Code`. An officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau exercising any of his powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act is plainly not a police officer within the meaning of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In any event, having regard to the presumption under s 16(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and the trial judges` total rejection of the appellant`s evidence, the appellant`s statements, even if they were improperly admitted, did not, in our judgment, occasion a failure of justice.
The other contention raised on behalf of the appellant was that the trial judges erred in holding that the appellant knew that the contents of the two packets wrapped in newsprint contained diamorphine. We rejected that contention as there was ample evidence before the trial judges to support their finding. Apart from the appellant`s own admission, the circumstances under which the two packets were carried by him through the Customs counter at Woodlands were such that the proper inference was that he knew the nature of their contents. We agreed with the trial judges that his defence that he was given the two packets by a friend who was travelling with him from Bukit Mertajam to Singapore who told him that the contents were Chinese medicine was `an incredible one`.
Finally we were in no doubt that on all the evidence before them the trial judges were justified in finding the appellant guilty as charged and for all these reasons we dismissed the appeal.

The respondent was charged with and pleaded guilty in the district court to three charges under ss 3(1), 5(1) and 6(1)(a) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 1993 Ed) (`the CMA`), for unauthorised access to computer materials, unauthorised modification of the contents of a computer and unauthorised access to a computer service respectively. Fifteen other charges under the same provisions of the CMA were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. After calling for a pre-sentence report, the district judge ordered the respondent to undergo six months of intensive probation and 24 months of supervised probation with the following added conditions: 
a a time restriction from 10pm to 6 am; 
b the performance of 200 hours of community service; and 
c a requirement for the respondent`s parents to sign a bond of $5,000 for his good behaviour.
The prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by the district judge. After hearing arguments from both sides, I allowed the prosecution`s appeal and quashed the order for probation made by the district judge, substituting it with a term of imprisonment of two months on each of the three charges. I now give my reasons.
 The charges 
 
 
 
The respondent was charged as follows: 
 
DAC 20070/99
 
 
 
You, Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin, m/17 yrs NRIC No S8140891B, are charged that you, in the month of July 1998, in Singapore, did knowingly cause the computer of Swiftech Automation Pte Ltd, namely, the server 
 Cloud4
, to perform a function, to wit, processing and granting access request, for the purpose of securing access without the authority of the system administrator, to the computer files held in the said computer and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A).
 
 
 
DAC 20076/99
 
 
 
You, Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin, m/17 yrs NRIC No S8140891B, are charged that you, in the month of July 1998, in Singapore, did knowingly secure access without authority to the computer of Swiftech Automation Pte Ltd, namely, the server 
 Cloud4
, for the purpose of obtaining a computer service, to wit, you did utilise port 31337 of the said computer to gain access to the Internet Relay Chat, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(1)(a) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A).
 
 
 
DAC 20082/99
 
 
 
You, Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin, m/17 yrs NRIC No S8140891B, are charged that you, in the month of July 1998, in Singapore, did knowingly cause an unauthorised modification to the contents of the computer of Singapore Cable Vision Ltd, namely the server Brahms, to wit, by modifying the content of the computer file, namely, `inetd.conf`, without the authority of the system administrator, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A).
 
 
 
 
 
 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
These were contained in the statement of facts read out in the court below to which the respondent admitted unreservedly without qualification. They were as follows.
On 7 July 1998, one Walter Klomp, the system manager of Swiftech Automation Pte Ltd (`Swiftech`) lodged a police report with the Criminal Investigation Department (`CID`), informing them that someone had gained unauthorised access to Swiftech`s proxy server and had modified its contents. Swiftech is a Value-Added Service Provider for SingNet, from which it is sub-licensed to operate a full range of Internet services ranging from Personal dial-ups, Network dial-ups, Internet integration and Network integration etc. It operates from its own web servers, proxy servers and modem pools.
On 4 August 1998, the respondent was arrested at his home by a team of police officers from the Computer Crime Branch of the CID. Investigations revealed that sometime between October and December 1997, during the year-end school vacation, the respondent started to read up extensively on computer security and soon developed an interest in the subject. In time, he discovered that certain flaws existed in Linux operating systems, in consequence of which he began to learn about the ways of checking for vulnerabilities in computer networks. Sometime in June 1998, the respondent decided to `hack` into various foreign servers, believing that such conduct would not be easily detected or traced by the relevant system administrators who were mostly located abroad. He managed to hack into four foreign sites successfully without being detected by their system administrators. As a result of this `achievement`, the respondent became more confident about hacking and subsequently decided to test his skills on local servers.
 Facts relating to DAC 20070/99 
 
 
 
Sometime in June 1998, the respondent detected certain vulnerabilities in some of the servers comprised in Swiftech`s network whereupon he decided to hack into one of the proxy servers of the network, namely 
 Cloud4 
, as its role was of the least importance and consequently any intrusion would be less likely to be detected by the system administrator. In July 1998, the respondent downloaded an exploit known as `ROTShB` (Riders Of The Short Bus) from the Internet. He compiled the program codes of this exploit into a program which he executed on Swiftech`s network, via the server 
 Cloud4 
. The execution of the program caused the server 
 Cloud4 
to process and grant access request to the respondent, allowing him to secure access to the computer files contained in 
 Cloud4 
. All the accesses made by the respondent to the computer files of 
 Cloud4 
 were done without the authority of Swiftech`s system administrator.
 Facts relating to DAC 20076/99 
 
 
 
After gaining root access to the server 
 Cloud4 
 of Swiftech, the respondent executed a program known as `bounce` which he uploaded to 
 Cloud4 
. Upon execution of `bounce`, the port 31337 of the server 
 Cloud4 
 was automatically reconfigured to allow the respondent to utilise the server to gain access to the Internet Relay Chat (`IRC`). The respondent had thus successfully created a user account for himself in the server
 Cloud4 
, which account he made use of to connect to the IRC. While on the IRC, the respondent indicated to the other users on the channel that he was able to compromise a server which ran on a Linux operating system.
 Facts relating to DAC 20082/99 
 
 
 
At or around the same time that the respondent did the above acts, he also hacked into the File Transfer Protocol (`FTP`) server 
 Brahms 
 of Singapore Cable Vision Ltd (`SCV`). The respondent had earlier applied to SCV for an Internet account but was rejected as the cable modem service was not then available to his estate. As such, he decided to gain unauthorised access to the server
 Brahms 
 in order to make use of the cable network`s high-speed link to download files from the Internet. Upon gaining access to 
 Brahms 
, the respondent amended several files in the server and later configured a backdoor known as `nightman` at port 22 of the server which allowed him to access the server 
 Brahms 
 in future without having to hack into the system again. He would remove his trails from the server 
 Brahms 
 by deleting the system logs every time before logging out from the server.
No tangible damage was caused to the computer systems of both Swiftech and SCV.
In mitigation, the respondent, who was unrepresented in the court below, said that he was remorseful. He also informed the court that he would be sitting for his GCE `O`-Level examinations at the end of the year and pleaded for a second chance.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
In ordering the respondent to be placed on 30 months` probation, the district judge took into account what he considered to be the mitigating factors present. These were the respondent`s early plea of guilt and concomitant show of remorse, his youthful age of 17, his lack of antecedents and the fact that he was unrepresented in the court below. Despite noting that offences under the CMA were serious offences necessitating the imposition of deterrent sentences for the protection of the public, the district judge was nevertheless of the view that the degree of severity varied for different offences under the CMA. In particular, he was influenced by the fact that the computers and network systems which the respondent had hacked into in this case were not `protected computers or systems` under the CMA. As such, neither national security nor public security had been breached and no tangible damage was caused by the respondent`s actions. In addition, the district judge also found that the respondent`s intention all along was only to check for vulnerabilities in computer networks. In light of the above, a custodial sentence was felt to be inappropriate. The district judge concluded that what the respondent needed was close supervision by his parents and the proper authorities to lead him along the right path.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The prosecution contended that the district judge had erred in fact and in law in coming to his decision to impose a probation order on the respondent. This was manifestly inadequate given the circumstances of the case.
First, the prosecution submitted that the finding of fact that the respondent`s intention was merely to check for vulnerabilities in computer networks was erroneous as the statement of facts showed clearly that the respondent`s intention throughout was both self-serving and criminal. Secondly, the district judge did not attach sufficient weight to the fact that the respondent had taken active steps to conceal his criminal acts in order to avoid detection. Such conduct, the prosecution contended, clearly demonstrated that the respondent was fully aware of the criminality of his actions. Thirdly, the district judge also failed to appreciate the true distinction between tangible and intangible damage in cases of computer-related crimes, thereby omitting to consider the obvious inconvenience caused to the companies affected by the respondent`s actions, the time and expense incurred by the police and the victims` staff to trace and apprehend the respondent and to establish the extent of his intrusion into their systems, the inherent damage which computer-related crimes cause to the national interest and the effect which such conduct has on the public confidence, particularly in the context of Singapore`s efforts to position itself as an intelligent island. Finally, the district judge had erred in wrongly giving consideration to the fact that the computers hacked into were not `protected computers` under the CMA.
In response, counsel for the respondent submitted that his client did not commit the offences out of greed nor did he at any time harbour any evil or sinister intent. He was not a gang member and the offence in question was not violent in nature. Counsel also urged me to bear in mind that rehabilitation was the dominant consideration where the offender is under 21 years of age as the chances of reforming such offenders into law-abiding adults are better. Compassion is often shown to young offenders on the assumption that the young `don`t know any better` and may not have had enough experience to realise the full consequences of their actions. Finally, counsel stressed that probation had previously been ordered in cases involving far more serious crimes like culpable homicide.
 Principles of sentencing 
 
 
 
Section 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252) (`the Act`) provides as follows: 
 
 
 Probation
 
 
 
 
5(1) Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the opinion that 
 having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so
, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision of a probation officer or a volunteer probation officer for a period to be specified in the order of not less than 6 months nor more than 3 years (emphasis mine).
 
 
 
Probation under the Act is intended to be used to avoid the sending of offenders of not very serious offences to jail, where they may associate with hardened criminals, who may lead them further along the path of crime. The Act recognises that many of these crimes are committed through ignorance or inadvertence or due to the bad influence of others. The offenders, but for such lapses, might be expected to be good citizens in which case a term of imprisonment might have the opposite effect to what is intended to be served by the imposition of the sentence. The traditional and broad rationale of probation therefore has always been to wean offenders away from a life-time career in crime and to reform and rehabilitate them into self-reliant and useful citizens. In the case of youthful criminals, the chances of effective rehabilitation are greater than in the case of adults, making the possible use of probation more relevant where young offenders are concerned. Nevertheless, the above-italicised portions of s 5(1) of the Act make it clear that probation is never granted as of right, even in the case of juvenile offenders. In deciding whether or not probation is the appropriate sentence in each case, the court still has to take into account all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender.
Having heard the submissions of both sides, I came to the view that probation is not suitable for offences of the type with which the respondent was charged under the CMA. Probation orders based on the simple concept of rehabilitation, with the usual restrictions on the offender to remain at home between dusk and dawn are not realistic solutions for these new crimes, which more often than not are committed by the offenders from home. Hitherto probation orders have been granted to what, for lack of a better term, might be called `amateur offenders`, in respect of traditional `blue-collar` Penal Code offences. The rationale for this was to keep these youngsters off the streets in order to prevent them from mixing with the wrong company outside and from engaging in gang activities or other harmful and self-detrimental exploits. For probation to work, a not inconsiderable amount of responsibility is placed on the parents of offenders to ensure that their children comply with the time restrictions imposed in order that these teenagers stay at home and out of trouble with the law.
The inherent nature of offences under the CMA makes probation orders ineffective, as keeping the offender at home in such cases does not guarantee that the offender will not repeat his actions. There is no doubt that a majority of these computer-related crimes are committed at home, and certainly this was the case here. That the parents have failed to avert the commission of these offences in the first place, despite the fact that they were committed at home, fortifies the view that responsibility for the offender`s future behaviour can no longer be left in the hands of his parents. The public interest requires that offenders such as the respondent be put away in a place where access to the major instrument of his crime is not available to him in order that he is not afforded any opportunity to re-offend.
With respect to the district judge, I disagreed with his finding of fact that the respondent`s only intention in accessing the various networks was to check for vulnerabilities in them. I agreed with the prosecution that the statement of facts revealed clearly that the respondent had made a conscious decision to use his hacking skills on local servers after having gained confidence from his success at hacking into foreign sites. He not only gained unauthorised access to the local servers, but also went further and modified the programs in the server 
 Brahms 
 which action enabled him to access the server in future without having to hack into the system again. Thereafter, he made use of SCV`s computer services for his own purposes and even had the presence of mind to obliterate all traces of his intrusions so as to avoid detection. It is pertinent that the respondent had hacked into the server 
 Brahms 
 only after SCV had rejected his application for cable subscription. The obvious inference to be drawn from this was that the respondent, being dissatisfied with SCV`s response, deliberately set out to get around the problem by utilising illegal means. His arrogance was also evident in the fact that he had proudly proclaimed to the other IRC users that he was able to compromise a server running on the Linux operating system. It was not correct therefore that he did not possess any criminal intent when committing the offences for which he was charged. A teenager of 16 or 17 years who commits such offences must be intelligent enough to know that it is wrong and dishonest of him to do so and the punishment for these offences must be brought home to him directly. In any case, this is an area of activity in which there can be more teenagers involved than adults. As a result, when offences such as these are committed, the courts may well have to apply the principles of strict liability so that the offender`s state of mind is irrelevant to a finding of guilt.
In addition to the need to deter the respondent from repeating his actions, I was also mindful of the need to deter other like-minded individuals from doing the same. In this respect, it is relevant to repeat the pronouncement I made in 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
  that considerations of general deterrence must in certain instances take precedence over those of specific or individual deterrence, particularly where the public interest demands that this be so. In my view, such anti-social conduct on the part of the respondent not only undermines public and international confidence in the commercial integrity and viability of our computer systems, it also gravely compromises Singapore`s efforts to position itself as a global e-commerce hub. The potential for which these cyber-crimes have in undermining Singapore`s burgeoning information technology (IT) industry cannot be ignored. IT security is a major consideration which many foreign companies take into account before deciding whether or not to develop and invest in the local IT sector.
Even though the respondent`s acts took place just before the coming into effect of the recent amendments to the CMA on 1 August 1998, the policy considerations highlighted during the Parliamentary debates relating to these amendments remain pertinent and are similarly applicable to the case at hand. In particular, during the second reading of the Computer Misuse (Amendment) Bill on 30 June 1998, the Minister noted at column 392 that: 
 
... crimes committed through the electronic medium and through use of computers are difficult to detect but they are just as serious as traditional crimes and we must equally protect our population against such crimes. To ensure that Singapore remains an attractive place for investors and businesses to operate effectively and securely, computer crimes must be treated as seriously as other criminal offences.
 
 
 
In the result, I had no hesitation that a deterrent sentence had to be meted out on the respondent in order to give effect to Parliament`s express intention that all computer crimes will be dealt with severely in Singapore.
Counsel for the respondent urged the court to give weight to the fact that no tangible damage was caused to the servers of both Swiftech and SCV as a result of the respondent`s actions. In my view, the absence of tangible damage caused to the victim companies was counterbalanced by the immeasurable inconvenience which they had to put up with in establishing the extent of the respondent`s intrusion into their systems. At the same time, there is no telling the amount of resources which the companies had to expend to reinstate their systems. Much time and expense was also incurred by the CID in tracing and apprehending the respondent and thereafter in investigating into the extent of his criminal activity. In any case, the offences for which the respondent was charged are conduct-crimes, liability for which is not dependant upon the occurrence of a prohibited result. Rather, criminal liability is imposed simply because the offender has done something which is prohibited by law. If damage had indeed been caused to the computer systems of the victim companies, different provisions in the CMA carrying heavier punishments would have been applicable. The fact that no damage was caused therefore cannot be used as a mitigating factor where the charges are brought under the already more lenient provisions of the CMA.
I also took issue with the district judge`s finding that mitigating value should be attached to the fact that the computers intruded into were not `protected computers` under the CMA and that neither national nor public security was breached in this case. In my opinion, there was no question that the respondent escaped facing a heavier punishment in view of the fact that the servers of Swiftech and SCV did not fall within the definition of `protected computers` under the CMA. However, the fact remained that the offences committed by the respondent were in themselves serious enough for me to take a stern view of the matter. In any case, that the respondent did not commit a more serious offence under the CMA is not ground for showing him leniency when sentencing him for a separate offence for which a distinct set of punishment is prescribed by law.
It was also relevant that the offences in question were not one-off isolated incidents committed out of boredom or curiosity amidst the throes of harmless youthful rebellion. Rather, the respondent had pleaded guilty to three separate offences and had in addition admitted to 15 other offences of a similar nature. I was thus called upon to take into account a persistent course of conduct which clearly evidenced a felonious intent on the part of the respondent.
Finally, the fact that the respondent was unrepresented in the court below was irrelevant. Article 9(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore states unequivocally that every accused person has the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. As such, the fact that the respondent chose not to exercise a right given to him by the State cannot now be used as a mitigating factor in his favour to the prejudice of the State.
 The appropriate sentence 
 
 
 
Policy considerations, the far-reaching effects which the offences have on the public interest if their pervasion is not halted at an early stage, and the seriousness with which Parliament views cyber-crime, all mandated the imposition of a custodial sentence. In determining the proper length of that sentence, I kept in mind the respondent`s youth, the generally favourable report given by his form teacher regarding his conduct and the fact that he was a first offender. Having considered all the circumstances of the case, I allowed the prosecution`s appeal and quashed the probation order made by the district judge on the ground that the district judge had passed a sentence which was wrong in principle (see 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 129
 
 
[1986] SLR 126
 ) in that it failed to take into account the need for deterrence and the fact that probation was not suitable for offences of the type with which the respondent was charged. I then substituted the lower court`s order with a sentence of imprisonment of two months on each of the three charges against the respondent. In view of the mandatory requirement laid down in s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), I ordered that the sentence of imprisonment on the first two charges should run consecutively while that on the third charge should run concurrently with those on the first two charges, making a total of four months` imprisonment.
I recognise that the respondent is an intelligent and resourceful young man whose true talent and potential, when harnessed under the right conditions, can be of immense value to the country. It is hoped therefore that the experience of life in prison will instil in him a sense of maturity and responsibility, and teach him to put his computing skills to legitimate use upon his release, thus enabling him to contribute usefully to society.

S RAJENDRAN J
 By an agreement dated 20 April 1993 the plaintiffs (Esso) appointed Nanyang Electric Co (Nanyang), a sole proprietorship of the first defendant, to distribute liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from the first defendant`s depot at Jalan Kayu (the Jalan Kayu agreement). By another agreement also dated 20 April 1993 the plaintiffs agreed to construct a depot at Defu Lane for Nguan Huat LP Gas Supplier, a partnership firm belonging to the first defendant and his wife, the second defendant (the Defu Lane agreement). Nguan Huat LP Gas Supplier was an authorised gas LPG gas distributor of Nanyang and carried on its business from the same depot at Jalan Kayu.
 2.On 29 September 1993 the plaintiffs gave notice of termination of the Jalan Kayu agreement and three months` notice of termination of the Defu Lane agreement. In the Defu Lane agreement it is provided that the agreement is terminable upon giving three months` notice of the termination of the Jalan Kayu agreement.
 3.The plaintiffs allege that they terminated the agreements because the defendants had committed breaches of the Jalan Kayu agreement by, inter alia, tampering with and decanting LPG gas from the cylinders supplied to them and brought these two suits to recover losses arising from the alleged breaches. The plaintiffs also seek damages against the defendants for conspiracy to commit the unlawful act involved in selling decanted LPG and/or injuring the reputation and economic interests of the plaintiffs by their decanting activities.
 4.The events that resulted in the termination occurred in September 1993. On 1 September 1993 the plaintiffs` senior sales engineer, Wong Tuck Wah (Wong), received a complaint from a hawker that he had been supplied with an LPG cylinder that was underweight and which had a defective seal. Wong asked Tan Jwee Meng (Tan) the Bukit Timah depot manager of the plaintiffs, to investigate. Tan went to see the hawker. He found the cylinder to be underweight and its seal came off easily. The underweight cylinder was marked `Nguan Huat`.
 5.On 16 September 1993 there was another complaint from the hawker. Wong and Oh Chee Koon (Oh), the plaintiffs` corporate security advisor, went to investigate. This time they could not ascertain if the cylinders were underweight (as they did not have a weighing machine with them) but the seals on the cylinders came off easily. In the car park in the vicinity they saw a Nguan Huat truck. They inspected the LPG cylinders on the truck and found that the seals on the cylinders came off easily. Oh knew that Nguan Huat obtained its cylinders from Nanyang and decided to do a spot check at the Jalan Kayu depot.
 6.On 18 September 1993, Oh, Tan and a technician went to the Jalan Kayu depot to do a spot check. At the depot they saw a truck (belonging to the first defendant) with a load of LPG cylinders marked `Nguan Huat`. They checked the cylinders and found that the tops of all the seals were easily removable. Ten cylinders were selected at random and weighed. They were all found to be short weight. When the spot check was going on the second defendant arrived at the scene and invited Oh to have a cup of coffee with her at a nearby coffeeshop. At the coffeeshop the second defendant claimed that everyone in the business was decanting LPG and that the business could not survive just on the plaintiffs` margins.
 7.On 20 September 1993 Oh reported the result of the spot check to Tsui Kee, the industrial and wholesale manager. On 21 September 1993 a meeting was arranged at the plaintiffs` office at which the defendants were present. Representing the plaintiffs were Tsui Kee, David Loke and Wong. Evidence was led by the plaintiffs that at this meeting the defendants admitted that they had decanted LPG cylinders and promised to stop doing so. Tsui Kee told the defendants to surrender all unused imitation seals that they had and to segregate all LPG cylinders that had been tampered with for return to the plaintiffs. The first defendant agreed to do so.
 8.After the meeting Oh, Wong, David Loke and Tan went to the Jalan Kayu depot to retrieve the decanted cylinders and imitation seals. There they came across a stack of LPG cylinders kept separate from the other stacks. The tops of the seals of all these cylinders were easily removable. Evidence was led that these were not the original seals but imitation. The plaintiffs` team also checked the cylinders on two trucks that were parked at the depot. They found that the tops of the seals on the cylinders on these trucks also came off easily. The first defendant was told that the plaintiffs wanted to remove all the cylinders with defective seals. The first defendant agreed but as the lorry that the plaintiffs had arranged for the purpose could only load 240 cylinders, a total of only 240 cylinders with the imitation seals were removed. Evidence was led that of these 240 cylinders, 238 were found to be underweight. The plaintiffs agreed that of these 238, 16 were used cylinders. Oh testified that, at the premises, the first defendant handed to him two plastic bags of imitation seals and told him that these imitation seals were manufactured in Japan by a company called `Fujiton`.
 9.On 22 September 1993 the defendants met Tsui Kee, David Loke and Wong at the Chatterbox Restaurant at OUB Centre. The defendants protested that what they did was not so serious and that other dealers in Singapore were doing the same but were told that the plaintiffs would terminate their agreements with the defendants and that it was inevitable that a report to the authorities would be made. The first defendant then asked that termination should not affect his reputation and asked for three months` notice. He was told that the request would be considered and he was asked to negotiate with a group of dealers nominated by the plaintiffs for the take over of his customers. At a meeting on 25 September 1993 between the plaintiffs` employees and the defendants, a draft termination agreement in which the defendants were to be given one month`s notice of termination was given to the first defendant and he was given up to 27 September 1993 to sign and return the agreement. The first defendant failed to return the draft and, on 29 September 1993, the plaintiffs gave notice of termination of the Jalan Kayu agreement and three months` notice of termination of the Defu Lane agreement.
 10.On 2 October 1993, when an employee of the plaintiffs called the first defendant`s `hot-line`, he discovered that the first defendant had switched to selling BP gas. On 4 October 1993 Oh made a police report with respect to the supply by the first defendant of short weight LPG cylinders and the use of imitation seals on the plaintiffs` LPG cylinders.
 11.The first defendant was subsequently charged in court under s 19(3) of the Weights and Measures Act (Cap 349). Section 19(3) provides as follows: 
If, in the case of any goods pre-packed in or on a container marked with a statement in writing with respect to the quantity of the goods, the quantity of the goods is at any time found to be less than that stated, then any person who has those goods in his possession for sale, shall be guilty of an offence.
 Under s 20 of the Weights and Measures Act it was a defence to a charge under s 19(3) to show that the goods were bought from another person who warranted that the goods conformed to that quantity and that the person who bought the goods had no reason to believe that the warranty was inaccurate.
 12.The first defendant claimed trial. His defence was that he had been framed by employees of the plaintiffs. However, when his defence was called, the first defendant elected not to give evidence. The district judge found that the prosecution had proved its case against the first defendant beyond all reasonable doubt and convicted the first defendant. Mr Alvin Yeo, counsel for the plaintiffs, submitted that this conviction was, under s 45A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), prima facie proof that the first defendant was in knowing possession of the underweight cylinders for the purposes of sale.
 13.In this court too the defence raised to the allegation of decanting was essentially the same as that suggested at the criminal trial: the defendants denied having decanted the LPG cylinders; they denied having made any admissions to employees of the plaintiffs regarding the cylinders; and they alleged that they had been framed up by certain of the plaintiffs` employees. The first defendant testified that sometime in June 1993 he was approached by Wong to sell to his customers re-pumped LPG cylinders that Wong would supply on a private basis. The profits were to be shared between the first defendant, Wong and some other employees of the plaintiffs. The first defendant said that he turned down the offer.
 14.The first defendant told the court that at about this time the first defendant informed Wong that he was negotiating with a third party for the sale of his LPG business for $9m. Wong told him not to proceed with the negotiations and that Wong would find a buyer for him. The first defendant was subsequently told by the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs would object to a sale to any third party and proposed taking over the business themselves for $900,000. The first defendant rejected this offer as he already had an offer of $6.5m.
 15.The first defendant claimed that immediately after his rejection of the plaintiffs` offer he was called up by the plaintiffs to attend a meeting to answer allegations of tampering with or decanting LPG cylinders. He told the court that he denied the allegations and informed the meeting about Wong`s approach but the plaintiffs paid no attention to what he said.
 16.The first defendant testified that, whilst he was at the meeting with the plaintiffs on 21 September 1993, about 240 LPG cylinders were delivered to his Jalan Kayu depot. He and the second defendant had no knowledge about these 240 cylinders. It was his evidence that the plaintiffs or their agents had caused the 240 cylinders to be delivered to his depot. These were the 240 cylinders that the plaintiffs subsequently retrieved from the Jalan Kayu depot. As for the imitation seals which the first defendant had handed over to the plaintiffs, the first defendant`s evidence was that these were imitation seals which had been given to him earlier by Wong. The first defendant also denied the claim by the plaintiffs that he had not given to the plaintiffs his customer records as required by the Jalan Kayu agreement.
 17.With regard to Suit No 439/94 relating to the Defu Lane agreement, the first defendant claimed that although in the written agreement it was provided that Nguan Huat LP Gas Supplier would construct the depot and the plaintiffs would reimburse to Nguan Huat the construction costs in full, he had subsequently discussed the matter with Mdm Lim Poh Hong, who was then the plaintiffs` officer in charge of the Defu Lane project, and variations to the Defu Lane agreement were orally agreed upon. These variations, he claimed, were extensive and amounted to a new contract. According to the first defendant, the substantial terms of this new oral contract were: (a). the plaintiffs, not the defendants, would construct the depot and related facilities on their own specifications and at their own expense;
 (b). the construction was to be completed by the end of October 1993, time being of the essence;
 (c). the defendants would not be consulted as to cost quotes, construction plans and drawings. The plaintiffs would independently appoint contractors and architects for the work; and
 (d). the defendants would not be liable for any reimbursement of construction costs.
 The second defendant`s evidence in respect of both suits was substantially similar to that of the first defendant. Mdm Lim was called as a witness by the plaintiffs. She categorically denied the defendants` claim that she had orally agreed to a substantial variation of the Defu Lane agreement. Mdm Lim agreed, however, that as a matter of convenience, instead of the defendants undertaking the construction of the depot in accordance with plans approved by the plaintiffs and then seeking reimbursement from the plaintiffs as provided in the agreement, the plaintiffs undertook the construction directly.
 18.The notice of termination of the Jalan Kayu agreement given to the first defendant was a notice purporting to be given under cl 14(c)(ii) of the agreement which reads: 
Clause 14(c)
 
This agreement may be terminated by the company forthwith by written notice to the licensee if: 
(i) 
(ii) the product and/or other products supplied by the company are contaminated, adulterated and/or decanted.
 In his closing submission, Mr Chellam, counsel for the defendants, submitted that the plaintiffs had not adduced sufficient proof that the first defendant had decanted the LPG cylinders.
 19.That the LPG cylinders that were retrieved were short weight was not in dispute. What was in dispute was whether the short weight was due to the first defendant or his agents having decanted the gas. Having heard the defendants and having heard the witnesses called by the plaintiffs, I had no hesitation in accepting the evidence of the plaintiffs` witnesses that the two defendants admitted having decanted the cylinders. I found the evidence of the two defendants and, in particular, the evidence of the first defendant, to be shifty and unreliable and I had no doubt that the allegation of a frame-up by the employees of the plaintiffs was no more than a desperate attempt by the defendants to get out of the difficult situation they found themselves in. This conclusion is reinforced by the first defendant`s inability to give any credible explanation as to why he did not attempt to invoke s 20 of the Weights and Measures Act in defending the criminal charge against him. The plaintiffs, in my view, had amply proved that the first defendant had decanted the cylinders. Prima facie, the plaintiffs were entitled, under cl 14(c)(ii) of the Jalan Kayu agreement, to give notice of immediate termination.
 20.Mr Chellam, however, submitted that the provisions of cl 10(d)(xii)(ee) read with cl 14(b) of the Jalan Kayu agreement, precluded the plaintiffs from giving immediate notice of termination. He submitted that by virtue of these clauses the plaintiffs were obliged to give written notice to the first defendant to remedy the breach and could terminate the agreement only if the first defendant failed to remedy the breach. The clauses read as follows: 
Clause 10(d)(xii)(ee)
 
Not, without the written consent of the company having been first obtained, by itself or any other person than the company`s authorized representative, repair, attempt to repair or tamper with any cylinder in its possession or release or replace the contents thereof partly or wholly.
 
Clause 14(b)
 
If the licensee commits a breach of any of the other provisions 
 except the provisions referred to in para (c) of this clause
, the company shall give written notice to the licensee to remedy such breach and if the licensee fails or neglects to remedy the said breach within one (1) calendar month after the receipt of such notice, the company may, on written notice to the licensee, terminate this agreement forthwith without prejudice to any right of the company under this agreement or the law conferred. [Emphasis mine.]
 Mr Chellam submitted that the decanting of gas from the cylinders fell within the purview of cl 10(d)(xii)(ee). He submitted that as cl 10(d)(xii)(ee), read with cl 14(b), required the plaintiffs to give the licensee a warning in respect of such conduct whilst cl 14(c) provided for immediate termination, the two clauses were inconsistent with each other. He submitted that, in such a case, the court should apply a construction that reconciles the apparently inconsistent clauses instead of rejecting one or other of them. He submitted that cl 14(c)(ii) was in the nature of an `escape clause` for the plaintiffs in the event that the product was contaminated, adulterated and/or decanted before supply. On that construction, he submitted, the plaintiffs were not entitled to invoke cl 14(c) and should instead have given notice of warning under cl 10(d).
 21.I could not accept Mr Chellam`s submission that cl 14(c) should be construed as an `escape clause` in the manner suggested by Mr Chellam. On such a construction the first defendant would, although he was entirely innocent, be at risk of having his contract terminated forthwith if the plaintiffs supplied him with cylinders that had been decanted whilst, if the first defendant was himself guilty of decanting, the plaintiffs would not be able to terminate the contract but would have to first give him an opportunity to remedy the breach. I agree with the submission of Mr Yeo that such a construction is illogical. In my view, the two clauses were not inconsistent. Clause 10(d)(xii)(ee) covered a very much wider ground than just decanting. In my view, where the licensee was guilty of decanting, cl 14(c) gave the plaintiffs the additional remedy of immediate termination. In such a case the plaintiffs could elect to give the licensee a warning under cl 14(b) or could exercise their rights under cl 14(c) of immediate termination. This is made clear by the fact that cl 14(b) itself specifically excludes the necessity to give a warning where cl 14(c) is invoked. On the facts of this case, I was satisfied that the plaintiffs lawfully terminated the Jalan Kayu agreement when they gave the notice of termination.
 22.Mr Chellam submitted further that even if it be proved that the defendants committed illegal acts and that the termination of the Jalan Kayu agreement was lawful, that would be insufficient to make the defendants liable for the tort of conspiracy unless it be shown that the motive of the defendants was to injure the plaintiffs. Mr Chellam, relying on the case of 
Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No 2)
 
[1982] AC 173
, submitted that at the highest the acts of the defendants were aimed at securing illegal profits for themselves and not to injure the plaintiffs. I rejected this submission. What the defendants did in this case was unlawful. In such cases, it need not be established that the intention to injure was a predominant motive of the defendants (see 
Lonrho plc v Fayed & Ors
 
[1992] 1 AC 448
). By involving themselves in the decanting operations the defendants were clearly intending to cause injury to the plaintiffs although that may not have been their predominant motive. The two defendants were therefore liable to the plaintiffs for the tort of conspiracy.
 23.In the Defu Lane agreement it was provided, vide cl 14(d), that should the Jalan Kayu agreement be terminated, the Defu Lane agreement could be terminated by giving three months` notice. This is what the plaintiffs did. As the plaintiffs, by their notice dated 29 September 1993, had lawfully terminated the Jalan Kayu agreement they were entitled, by cl 14(d), to terminate the Defu Lane agreement in the manner they did.
 24.I found no merit whatsoever in the defendants` claim that there had been a substantial oral variation of the Defu Lane agreement. The only variation that occurred was that instead of the defendants undertaking the construction work and claiming reimbursement from the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs undertook the construction and made payments therefor directly. This variation did not affect the other terms of the Defu Lane agreement.
 25.For the above reasons, I gave judgment for the plaintiffs in both the suits and dismissed the counterclaims. Mr Yeo submitted that this was a case where there was no merit whatsoever in the defences raised and asked for costs on an indemnity basis. I agreed that this was a case where costs on an indemnity basis should be ordered. At the conclusion of the hearing in respect of the reliefs claimed by the plaintiffs, I made the following orders in respect of Suit No 2039/93: 1. The first defendant pay the plaintiffs:
 (a). liquidated damages of S$146,153.85 pursuant to cl 15(a) of the Jalan Kayu agreement and interest thereon at 6% per annum from 29 September 1993 to the date of actual payment;
 (b). damages to be assessed in respect of the breaches of the following clauses in the Jalan Kayu agreement:
 (i). clauses 10(d)(xii)(ee) and 14(c)(ii) - for tampering with the plaintiffs` LPG cylinders and decanting LPG;
 (ii). clause 10(d)(xii)(ff) - for interfering with markings placed on the LPG cylinders by the plaintiffs in breach of the plaintiffs` copyright therein;
 (iii). clauses 10(d)(xi)(bb) and 15(b)(vi) - for failing to keep and maintain an updated and accurate customer list and failing to surrender their customer list to the plaintiffs on termination of the Jalan Kayu agreement;
 (iv). clause 15(b)(vii) - for failing to return all empty LPG cylinders on termination of the Jalan Kayu agreement; and
 (v). clause 16(a) - for failing to negotiate in good faith and to give the plaintiffs the option of matching the offer of a bona fide third party for the plaintiffs` takeover of the first defendant`s customers.
 2. The second defendant pay the plaintiffs damages for conspiracy to be assessed.
 3. The first and second defendants pay the plaintiffs the following:
 (a). interest on the amounts of damages assessed; and
 (b). costs on an indemnity basis.
 4. The first and second defendants deliver up forthwith to the plaintiffs, for destruction, all imitation seals or parts thereof (which are used, have been used or intended to be used on the plaintiffs` LPG cylinders).
 5. The plaintiffs be entitled to set off the sum of S$56,089.24, being the total amount payable to the defendants under their counterclaim herein, against the sums awarded to them under para 1(a) of this judgment.
 And in respect of Suit No 439/94 I made the following orders: 1. Liquidated damages of S$191,514.17 pursuant to cl 14(c)(ii) of the Defu Lane agreement and interest thereon at 6% per annum from the date of the issue of the writ of summons to date of actual payment; and

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the trial judge convicting him of two counts of outraging modesty under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment on the first charge and two months` imprisonment on the second charge. In addition, he also pleaded guilty to a third charge of possessing undesirable materials under the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338). He was fined a sum of $1,000. I allowed the appeal in respect of the first conviction and dismissed the appeal against the second conviction but altered the sentence to a fine of $2,000. I now give my reasons for so doing.
 2.
 The charge
The appellant was charged with two counts of outraging modesty as follows: 
(i) That you, Soh Yang Tick @ Soh Yang Kok, m 49 yrs, are charged that you, on 30 April 1996 between 3pm and 4.20pm, at No 1 Keong Siak Road #01-01 AIA Tanjong Pagar Building, Singapore, did use criminal force on one [PW2], , intending to outrage the modesty of the said person, to wit, by using your right hand to touch her back and abdomen and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). 
(ii) That you, Soh Yang Tick @ Soh Yang Kok, m 49 yrs, are charged that you, on 7 May 1996 at about 7.30pm, at No 1 Keong Siak Road #01-01, AIA Tanjong Pagar Building, Singapore, did use criminal force on one [PW2], , intending to outrage the modesty of the said person, to wit, by using your right hand to hit her buttock and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

 The prosecution`s case
The victim in this case was a 27 year old married female (`PW2`). She was the main prosecution witness, the others being her husband (`PW1`) and her close and personal friend (`PW3`). Insofar as PW1 and PW3`s evidence were material and relevant, they supported PW2`s version of the events after the offences had been allegedly committed by the appellant. The prosecution also called four other witnesses, and they were, in order, Mangat Ram (`PW4`), Lim Cheng Wah (`PW5`), Gan Kim Kee (`PW6`) and Veronica Tan (`PW7`). However, their evidence was formal in nature and immaterial to the offences in question, as they were either investigating officers in charge of the investigation of the offences or officers of the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (`TAS`), who verified the truth and authenticity of the numerous telephone records adduced as evidence in the court below by both the prosecution and the defence.
 4.At the time of the alleged offence, PW2 was working as a secretary of the appellant. She had been employed only recently, and her job as a secretary was mainly administrative. It was not in dispute that PW2 first met the appellant while she was still a passenger services agent at Changi Airport. Then, the appellant had asked if she was interested in becoming an insurance agent, an offer which she declined. Nevertheless, they exchanged their contact numbers.
 5.A few days later, the appellant contacted her again. They met up once, at the Europa Lounge in the East Coast, but the appellant left shortly after arriving there as he found the place too rowdy to his liking.
 6.In January 1996, the appellant placed an advertisement for a secretary in the papers, after one of his two secretaries left the job. PW2 responded to this advertisement, and the appellant hired her subsequently, as he felt, amongst others, that she was willing to learn, had realistic salary expectations and seemed keen to upgrade her skills. On the evening of 1 February 1996, after the appellant had interviewed her, they had dinner at his house with one Wendy Tan (`DW6`), a close friend of the appellant`s. That same night, DW6 did a facial on PW2 using `Nuskin`, a skin care product which the appellant was promoting as part of his diversion into the cosmetic business with DW6. PW2 subsequently started working for the appellant on 26 February 1996.
 7.On the day of the first offence, 30 April 1996, PW2 claimed she arrived at the office slightly late that morning. She therefore went and apologised to the appellant, who was already in his room. PW2 recounted the events which occurred. According to her, the appellant asked her to close the door. He said there were rashes on her face and asked if she was stressed, and, if so, why. PW2 replied that it was due to the heavy workload. The appellant then asked when was the last time she made love with her husband, a question which she did not reply to. He persisted in his questioning but she kept quiet.
 8.At this juncture, this conversation was interrupted by a telephone call. Consequently, the appellant left for a meeting. Although PW2 could not confirm what meeting it was, she maintained that it was a meeting which was held within the AIA premises. She also confirmed that she did not, at that time or at any time soon after tell anyone about what had just happened with the appellant.
 9.That afternoon, PW2 lunched with Sharon Chan (`DW2`), who was the other secretary of the appellant. PW2 made no mention of what occurred in the morning. Thereafter, DW2 left for the AIA headquarters at Raffles Place. PW2 also remembered that DW6 came to the appellant`s office while he was still at his meeting. One Anna Toh (`DW7`), who was helping DW6 to sell Nuskin products, was also in the office at that time.
 10.PW2 testified that the appellant returned to his office after the meeting at about 1pm. He proceeded to have lunch with DW6. At about 3pm, he returned again to the office. At this time, only DW7 and her friend, Stella Goh, were in the office.
 11.The appellant then asked PW2 to come to his room. Again, he asked her to shut the door. This time however, PW2 said the appellant asked her if she believed he could satisfy her. He also made several suggestive comments. All this while, PW2 kept quiet, as she was afraid and confused.
 12.The appellant then started describing the things that he would do to her if they were alone in a hotel room. He continued making lewd remarks, and often pestered PW2 for her reactions to these remarks. PW2 claimed she felt disgusted with the appellant, and thus kept quiet. However, after much pestering from the appellant, she finally replied, thinking that some reaction would silence the appellant. It did not.
 13.At this moment, the appellant stood up and walked towards his safe, from which he took out a pornographic book, and he read the entire foreword to her. Just before this, the appellant also asked her to close the blinds in this office, but he finally had to do this himself when she had difficulty closing them. Thereafter, the appellant took out another book and proceeded also to read parts of the foreword to her. While reading, PW2 claimed that the appellant tried to touch her, but she moved away. During the trial, PW2 identified these two books and confirmed the forewords which were read to her.
 14.After reading the two books, the appellant got up and asked PW2 to embrace him. She refused, and only gave him a light touch on his arm. The appellant sat down and asked PW2 to walk towards him. She did so. He put out his hand to reach for PW2`s private parts. She stepped backwards and stopped his hand. PW2 then said that the appellant re-assured her, and put his hand inside the jacket which she was wearing and touched her back. He moved his right hand slowly from her back towards her abdomen.
 15.PW2 explained she was really frightened and lost, and did not know what to do. She did not scream, nor did she put up any resistance. The appellant continued touching her, moving his right hand from her abdomen and towards her breasts. At this moment, PW2 came back to her senses and instinctively pushed his hand away. She felt very offended. Just then, they were interrupted. During the trial, PW2 admitted she could not remember what it was that interrupted them. Thereafter, the appellant opened the blinds and PW2 left his room.
 16.PW2 claimed that, after she came out of the appellant`s room, she immediately told DW2 what had happened. DW2 had now returned to the office from the AIA headquarters. According to her, DW2 warned her about the appellant. During the trial, however, DW2 denied ever being approached by PW2 to confide in her, nor did she warn PW2 to be careful of the appellant.
 17.PW2 continued to work until past 7pm that day. Before she left that evening, she alleged the appellant came up to her from behind and put his hand on her shoulder. He whispered into her ear that she was like a little girl.
 18.Two days after this incident, PW2 took medical leave. This was on 3 and 4 May 1996. The following week, she told a good friend, Cindy Ng (`Cindy`) about what had happened. Cindy`s advice was that she should resign and lodge a police report. PW2 also confided in PW3 about the appellant`s behaviour, and PW3 confirmed this. PW3`s reaction was that she should either report the matter to AIA`s headquarters or lodge a police report. Since PW2 was not keen to report the matter to the police, PW3 therefore wrote a letter to AIA`s headquarters on her behalf complaining about the appellant`s behaviour. However, PW2 did not see the contents of this letter. In the trial below, this letter was exhibited as part of the prosecution`s case.
 19.Other than Cindy and PW3, PW2 also mentioned the same incident to PW1 and Anthony Ng, another friend of hers.
 20.On 7 May 1996, less than a week after the first alleged incident, PW2 claimed that the appellant outraged her modesty again. This time however, the circumstances were quite different. That day, at about 7.30pm, just before PW2 was about to leave the office with DW2 after work, the appellant came out of his office and was surprised to see DW2 and PW2 still there. The appellant then remarked to PW2 that she would make a good insurance agent even though she had taken several off days for medical reasons prior to that day. He also remarked that if she was not punctual, he would beat her buttock. He then used his right hand and slapped PW2 lightly on her buttock.
 21.PW2 said that she felt humiliated by the whole incident, especially since there was a small crowd around, including DW2, DW6, DW7 and two other insurance agents, Jane Kow (`DW8`) and Jasmine Chon (`DW9`). She therefore decided to lodge a police report, and did so on 8 May 1996 with PW3. Before that, she also resigned from her job with effect from 7 May 1996. Her letter of resignation was tendered on 9 May 1996.
 22.The police report which PW2 made was exhibited in the court below. It was of relevance that, when this report was made, a day after the alleged second offence on 8 May 1996, the second offence was not complained of. It has now transpired that the only reason why the appellant was charged for the second offence was because he admitted to having some physical contact, albeit a minor one, with PW2 on 7 May 1996 when he was subsequently questioned by the police. This thus was the background out of which the second charge in the present case arose
 23.During the trial, it also transpired that, before the alleged offences were committed, PW2 claimed that she had suffered constant sexual harassment from the appellant. In addition, a private investigator had allegedly impersonated the role of a doctor to try and induce her to give details of her sexual life to him. PW2 stated that she suspected that the appellant was behind this latter incident. Finally, during PW3`s evidence in the court below, it came to the attention of the trial judge that the appellant had previously molested PW2 by brushing his arm against her breasts during her earlier interview with the appellant for the job as his secretary. However, PW2 made no mention of this in her evidence at all. In my view, these previous incidents of ungentlemanly behaviour or conduct by the appellant towards PW2 were neither relevant nor useful. It was never part of PW2`s case. In fact, as far as I could see, these allegations against the appellant were very much unsubstantiated and, if they were worth anything, they only served to cast the appellant as an undesirable character so as to damage his credibility. This was both unfair and prejudicial, for the appellant should be tried for the alleged offences, without reference to his previous conduct which, in any event, could not be supported. For these reasons, I will not bother myself with setting out any of these facts in detail, and will restrict myself to the events of the alleged offences.
 24.
 The defence`s case
The appellant was a senior district manager of AIA when the allegations of the alleged molestation of PW2 surfaced. Since his conviction by the trial judge in the court below, he had lost his job. His defence in respect of the first charge was one of alibi. His evidence was that he was not in his office at the time when the alleged first offence took place. On 30 April 1996, he had spent most of the afternoon with DW6 and had a hair cut at his regular hair salon, HairGraphics, at Amara Hotel. He did not return to his office until well after 6pm that day. He also disputed PW2`s allegations that he was in the office that morning, and had made lewd comments to her before he was interrupted to go for a meeting. In support of his alibi, he called DW2, Ho Pei Loon (`DW3), Paulyn Soon (`DW4`), Robin Ho See Siong (`DW5`), DW6, DW7 and one Stella Goh to confirm this. At the trial, although the defence gave their alibi notice in respect of Stella Goh, they did not call her to give evidence. The appellant also adduced several documents including telephone records and attendance books of insurance agents` meetings to show he could not have been in the office in the morning and at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed.
 25.As for the second charge, the appellant did not deny being in the office on 7 May 1996, when he saw PW2 and DW2 who were about to leave. This was about 7pm in the evening. However, he put a slightly different gloss on the version of events which happened. According to him, DW6, DW7, DW8 and DW9 were waiting for him to leave together with him for dinner. When he saw that DW2 and PW2 were still around, he remarked that it was late. In response, PW2 said that they were always working late. The appellant then turned to her, reached out his hand and tried to squeeze her neck while jokingly commenting that she was always late for work and yet still dared to complain about having to work late. He also said that PW2 should go and do insurance sales since that would not require her to follow strict working hours. He admitted that he used his hand and tapped her on the buttock and said `Go and do sales`. The whole atmosphere was very relaxed in the office at that time, and everyone was in the mood for jokes. In fact, the appellant claimed that PW2 even laughed at his comments. After that, they all left the office. The appellant protested that he did not mean to outrage PW2`s modesty, nor was he guilty of any crime of that sort. Although there were a lot of people around that evening, no one saw exactly what had happened.
 26.As for the rest of the defence`s witnesses, DW2`s evidence was relevant only to the extent that it materially supported the appellant`s stand that he was not in the office for most of the morning and nearly the whole of the afternoon on the day of the alleged first offence (ie 30 April 1996). She claimed that she was present in the office the whole day and did not see the appellant either in the morning or the afternoon, although the appellant did return to his office briefly just before lunch. In addition, she made a call to the appellant sometime late that morning to ask whether he would be coming into his office. This phone call was recorded in a telephone bill which the appellant produced at trial. She also denied that PW2 told her that she had been molested by the appellant. As for the incident on 7 May 1996, DW2`s evidence was also similar to that of the appellant, and she agreed that the atmosphere was relaxed. She admitted that she was a good friend of PW2, and they often confided in each other. However, PW2 had the bad habit of not being on time for her work, having a bad work attitude and constantly chatting on the phone for long periods. Further, PW2 frequently took medical and annual leave without prior approval, although DW2 always covered for her in such situations. She thus often received complaints from various insurance agents as a result. During the trial, the defence also tried to argue this was the motive behind PW2 framing the appellant, for the appellant had on numerous occasions been unhappy with her work performance. This argument was rejected by the trial judge.
 27.DW3 and DW4`s evidence was mostly similar, in that they confirmed that the appellant was at HairGraphics on 30 April 1996. However, DW3`s recollection of this was based on a receipt dated 30 April 1996. She admitted that she could not remember the exact time when the appellant was at the salon, and was told by the appellant that it was some time close to 3pm. As for DW4, she recalled attending to the appellant personally, and, as it was an especially busy day, the appellant had to wait for quite a while before he was served. He even bought cakes for the staff of the hair salon, and DW4 put this time at somewhere between 3pm and 4pm.
 28.There was also the evidence of DW5, and he confirmed that the appellant was not in his office from 2.30pm to 5pm. He was one of the appellant`s insurance agents and had come to the office to fill up some forms. When he left the appellant`s office after 5pm, the appellant had still not returned. He also confirmed that there was no insurance agents` meeting that morning, contrary to what PW2 claimed. He said that PW2 had a bad work attitude, and he had previously complained about her.
 29.DW6 was the appellant`s long time friend, and they shared a common business interest. She gave evidence that on 30 April 1996, the appellant fetched her from her house to his office at about 12pm. Thereafter, they went for lunch. At about 2pm, the appellant went to get his hair cut, and she borrowed his car to run a few errands. Just after 4pm, she used the car`s mobile phone and called the appellant on his handphone to see if he was finished with his haircut. In fact, she did so several times. All these calls were documented in the appellant`s phone receipts. The appellant explained that on 30 April 1996, he drove his wife`s car, therefore there was an additional mobile phone in the car other than the one which he always carried with him. DW6 used this car`s mobile phone to call him on his handphone.
 30.When DW6 returned to Amara Hotel to pick up the appellant, he was still not ready. She therefore waited for him at the car park. Coincidentally, she also met DW7 and Stella Goh, DW7`s friend. All three of them then waited for the appellant to finish his haircut, since DW7 and her friend wanted to catch a lift back to the appellant`s office with them. When he finally came out, they all went back to his office. Subsequently, the appellant met one Amelyn, who had been waiting at the office for his return. DW6 and DW7 both testified that by the time they reached the appellant`s office, it was almost 6 pm.
 31.As for PW2`s accusations, neither DW 6 nor DW 7 could add anything material to what had already been said. This was the same for DW 8 and DW 9`s evidence.
 32.
 The trial judge`s decision
The trial judge convicted the appellant after an extensive trial lasting more than two weeks. Her decision, stated briefly, was that she accepted PW2`s version of the facts, despite there being no material or relevant corroboration in respect of her version of the events. However, the trial judge felt that this was not important, for PW2 had related the two incidents to both PW1 and PW3. She was satisfied that this constituted the material corroboration needed for PW2`s evidence. As for the appellant`s evidence, she rejected it outright. In respect of the first charge, she found that none of his six alibi witnesses could be believed, and that they had all fabricated their evidence to suit the appellant. Even the various documents did not assist the appellant`s case. She also held the same for the second charge, and dismissed the appellant and his witnesses` testimonies. As she held in the last paragraphs of her very lengthy grounds of decision (from _ 369 to 392), which I shall summarise briefly, the trial judge felt that PW2 was a simple and forthright witness, despite having been subjected to hard and relentless cross-examination by the defence. The same could also be said of PW1 and PW3, the other prosecution witnesses. In contrast, the appellant was a skilful liar who had fabricated his evidence in full. Not only that, his alibi evidence could also not be believed, and none of his witnesses in support were credit worthy for they were in some way connected or related to him.
 33.
 The appeal
In the appeal before me, several issues were raised. I shall address them in turn. As a starting point, before I turn to consider the appeal proper, it was useful to recall that in a case such as the present one, where the prosecution relied solely on the word of the victim (ie PW2), a court of law must be extremely cautious before convicting the accused (ie the appellant) of the charge he stood accused. The prosecution`s burden in this case, as in all other criminal cases, was proof beyond reasonable doubt, and before a court could arrive at this conclusion, the trial judge must have regard to all the circumstances and facts of the case. As I reiterated in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  (at p 58 _ 44): 
In my view, the right approach is to analyse the evidence for the prosecution and for the defence, and decide whether the complainant`s evidence is so reliable that a conviction based solely on it is not unsafe. If it is not, it is necessary to identify which aspect of it is not so convincing and for which supporting evidence is required or desired. In assessing the supporting evidence, the question then is whether this supporting evidence makes up for the weakness in the complainant`s evidence. All these would, of course, have to be done in the light of all the circumstances of each case and all the evidence, including the defence evidence, as well as accumulated knowledge of human behaviour and common sense.
 34.I continued, in the same case (at p 63 _ 68): 
Hence, in a case involving sexual offences, it is essential to identify the relevant issues first. It will then be possible to isolate the areas of a victim`s testimony which the court feels are not so convincing that a conviction can be based solely on it, ie that the victim`s testimony is not so convincing that the court can say that that aspect of the case has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Only when the reason for this is identified will it be possible to examine other evidence that will support the witness`s and the accused`s respective testimonies. Applying an overly technical approach without relating the legal principles to the evidence given will give rise to the danger of insufficient weight being given to relevant evidence and too much weight being assigned to insignificant or irrelevant evidence.
 35.I was also alive to the fact that in the present case, just as in 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
, the crux of the appellant`s contentions lay on the basis that the trial judge erred in arriving at her conclusion that the prosecution had proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeal was thus focused on facts. In the process of arriving at her conclusion, the trial judge made many findings and drew certain inferences from those findings. These were now challenged by the appellant. Insofar as the approach to appeals against findings of fact made by a trial judge in the court of first instance are concerned, it is trite that an appellate court should be slow to overturn those findings unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or `against the weight of the evidence`. This is borne out by s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which reads: 
No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court or Magistrate`s Court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.
 36.In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, held at p 719 (_ C): 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 37.I subsequently endorsed this principle in the case of 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 .
 38.Similarly, in the case of 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratma Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , in which findings of fact depended on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, Lord Diplock, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held that an appellate court should be reluctant to overturn findings made by the trial judge because they are in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour.
 39.The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons. To do so would be contrary to the function of an appellate court, for its duties lie in correcting errors, and not in the reviewing of facts.
 40.Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings which have been ascertained, a different situation exists. In this case, the settled law is that an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. Inferences can only be drawn from established facts in the court below and, that being the case, to quote myself in the case of 
PP v Choo Thiam Hock
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 248
 , (at p 253 _ C): `an appellate court is of course in no worse position than the trial court to assess the same material`.
 41.With the law firmly in mind, I turned to the appellant`s appeal proper. I dealt with each conviction separately, since each offence was distinct in itself with minimal overlap.
 (a) The first charge
 42.The first ground of appeal raised by the appellant related to the issue of corroboration. Throughout the trial below, counsel for the appellant argued before the trial judge that PW2`s evidence in this respect should be treated with caution, as it was suspect and was not corroborated. In particular, it was argued that PW2 had an axe to grind against the appellant, and these same arguments were put before me during the hearing of the appeal. The trial judge rejected these arguments in totality. She felt that there was good corroboration of PW2`s evidence arising out of both PW1 and PW 3`s evidence (at _ 255 and 256 of her grounds of decision).
 43.In the local context, the current position on the law in respect of corroboration is this. Although we do not have legislation, unlike the position in England expressly abolishing the need for corroboration warnings which judges in courts should bear in mind, nevertheless we should not be over concerned about the technicalities of the concept of corroboration. Rather, it is important to realise that, especially in cases of sexual offences, one should not convict an accused on the word of the victim or complainant alone unless the evidence is unusually convincing. It matters not whether the complainant is a male or female, similar rules should equally apply to both. A passage from 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
 best sets this out. At p 60 (_ 53), I held, after reviewing several cases on the need for corroboration: 
These cases, although couched in the traditional language of corroboration, show that it is important to identify the issues at hand, and then to examine the evidence before the court in the light of these issues. To recite mechanically that it is unsafe to convict without corroboration and to delve into what is or is not, technically speaking, corroboration without relating the evidence to the relevant issues would be to obfuscate the matter, which essentially a factual one. It would be a true instance of not seeing the wood from the trees.
 44.In the present case, the trial judge held that there was corroboration of PW2`s evidence on the basis that she subsequently repeated the incidents to both PW1 and PW3. In view of what I have set out above, I could not agree. Although by virtue of s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) such previous statements made by PW2 could technically be considered `corroborative evidence`, they, in my mind, did not command as much weight as the trial judge appeared to give them. In this respect, I saw a similarity with the case of 
Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP
 [1995] 2 SLR 676 and drew a parallel with it. In 
 Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP 
, the victim, having been molested, subsequently told her sister what had happened. In dismissing her complaint to her sister as corroboration in the strict sense, I said (at p 776 _ F): 
Now, it is not controversial that the complainant`s previous complaint to her sister and the lodging of the police report are technically corroboration, in view of s 159 of the Evidence Act. However, the fact remains that these are not corroboration by independent evidence. All the complaints originated from the complainant. They therefore have little additional evidential value. Otherwise, by the same token, the appellant`s previous denials made to the police are also technically corroboration under s 159 of the Evidence Act.
 
In the classic case of 
 R v Baskerville
, Lord Reading CJ emphasised that in order for evidence to amount to corroboration, the evidence must be independent of the testimony which is sought to be corroborated. It is clear that had it not been for s 159 of the Evidence Act, a recent complaint cannot be corroboration of the complainant`s testimony. This was so held in 
 R v Whitehead
. The reason simply is that the complaint originated from the complainant as well, and is not independent.
 
The position in Singapore is of course as stated in 
 PP v Teo Eng Chan & Ors
. Hence, a previous complaint goes beyond the question of consistency and is admissible evidence. In my view, although s 159 has the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is not corroboration by independent evidence. It would be dangerous to equate this form of corroboration with corroboration in the normal sense of the word. I can see no reason why a s 159 corroboration of a complainant`s testimony should necessarily carry more weight than a s 159 corroboration of the accused`s denial. Both appear to be equally self-serving.
 45.For supporting evidence to carry weight, an essential ingredient which it must possess is that of independence. Like the situation in 
 Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP 
, this was exactly what was lacking in the present case in respect of PW1 and PW3`s evidence. Their testimonies in court only narrated events to the extent of what PW2 had told them. Their evidence was not perceived in any way by themselves individually without PW2 telling them. In the circumstances, it was my view that the trial judge erred in considering their evidence to be good supporting evidence for PW2`s allegations against the appellant. In my opinion, their evidence was nothing more than a repeat of what PW2 had told them. Accordingly, the trial judge erred when she placed much emphasis on their evidence without warning herself that such evidence was essentially self-serving.
 46.Having reached the above conclusion, a conviction in the present case could only be sustained and justified if PW2`s evidence could be said to be so reliable or unusually convincing that a court could be satisfied that the prosecution had made out its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This was the core of the present appeal and counsel for the appellant drew my attention to many details of the case which he argued that the trial judge erred in considering. The gist of it all was that, had the trial judge evaluated the whole case objectively and drawn the proper and necessary inferences, she would not have convicted the appellant. The conviction of the appellant on the first charge was therefore unsafe.
 47.I started first with the trial judge assessments of the various witnesses of the appellant. As I set out earlier, the appellant called various witnesses to support his defence that he was not in the office in the morning and afternoon of 30 April 1990, the day the first incident took place.
 48.The trial judge came to the conclusion that none of the appellants` witnesses, with the exception of one (ie DW3), were credible. In her grounds of decision, she explained that the main reason for her so deciding was because they were in some way connected or related to the appellant. In my judgment, this could not be right and I failed to see the basis for the trial judge`s finding in this respect. Prima facie just because the appellant`s witnesses were in some way related or connected to him did not render their testimonies suspect. There must be additional grounds for rejecting the evidence of such witnesses, or alternatively the testimonies of these witnesses were so littered with inconsistencies that they could not be believed. In my view, neither of these was present. Although I was aware that I did not have the chance, unlike the trial judge, to observe the demeanour of the witnesses, and that I should be reluctant to overturn such findings, the trial judge`s reasoning for rejecting their evidence was clearly unacceptable. In my view, the trial judge made a fundamental error when she rejected the evidence of the appellant`s witnesses for the reasons which she gave. In particular, I observed that, while all but one of the appellant`s witnesses testimonies were rejected by the trial judge, she nevertheless accepted the evidence of PW2`s witnesses to support the prosecution`s case. This was in spite of the fact that her witnesses were also related to her, and indeed on a much closer basis. If any supporting evidence should be cautioned against, it should have been that of PW2`s, as her witnesses were her husband and a long-time friend, both of whom were close to her. In my view, it was difficult to justify accepting the evidence of PW2`s witnesses while at the same time rejecting those of the appellant. As the trial judge pointed out, all had inconsistencies in their evidence.
 49.Having reviewed all the defence witnesses` evidence in its totality again, I disagreed with the trial judge on her assessment of the appellant`s witnesses and her consequent rejection of their testimonies in the court below. I saw no justification for disbelieving all of the appellant`s witnesses. Even though the trial judge did point to some inconsistencies in the testimonies of some of the defence witnesses, these inconsistencies did not seem to me to be grave enough to reject their evidence. In my judgment, most of the appellant`s witnesses, with possibly the exception of DW6, provided independent material evidence which should have been taken into account by the trial judge. A good illustration in this respect was the assessment by the trial judge of DW2 as a witness. DW 2 was called by the defence to refute PW2`s claims that the appellant was in the office on the morning of 30 April 1996 when the appellant made lewd remarks to PW2 and also that the appellant was in the office that same afternoon, when the appellant allegedly molested PW2. In particular, PW2 testified that, soon after the alleged offence in the afternoon of 30 April 1996 took place, she had confided in DW2 who warned her to be careful of the appellant. The trial judge rejected DW2`s evidence. She held (at _ 285): 
DW 2 was the first alibi witness that the [appellant] called. She was not an independent witness as she was still working for the [appellant] as his secretary.
 50.As I have already explained, the evidence of DW2 should not have been rejected by the trial judge and should have been considered. Other than being the secretary of the appellant, DW2 had no other relation to the appellant. The fact that DW2 was the appellant`s secretary was neither here nor there. By itself, this was not a reason for her to fabricate a story to cover up for the appellant. In fact, PW2 herself said that she and DW2 got along very well and often confided in each other. All the more there should have been no reason for DW2 to lie for the appellant. The relationship which PW2 claimed that she had with DW2 was particularly telling, for, if DW2 was PW2`s good friend and confidante, there should have been no explanation why DW2 would lie to cover up for the appellant. The fact that DW2, as a good friend of PW2, could still come to court and contradict the evidence of PW2 must mean that PW2`s evidence should be treated with caution.
 51.For reasons which I have already explained, I also took into account the evidence of the rest of the defence witnesses, namely, DW3, DW4, DW5 and DW7, in determining the validity of the appellant`s appeal. These witnesses` evidence, to a large extent, only showed that the appellant was not in his office in the afternoon of 30 April 1996. As for the evidence of DW6, as she is a close friend of the appellant, I considered her evidence separately, to err on the side of caution. As for the remaining the defence witnesses, namely, DW8 and DW9, their evidence was only relevant to the second act of molestation and had no bearing here.
 52.During the hearing of the appeal, as far as the circumstances of the first offence were concerned, counsel for the appellant first contended before me that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant was in his office in the morning of 30 April 1996. The appellant`s version of the facts, as will be recalled, was that he was at home. This was in contrast to PW2`s story, that the appellant called her into his room and made lewd remarks to her that morning. To support his story, DW2 and DW6 were called to testify. More pertinent though were several telephone records which he produced in the court below which showed telephone calls being made from his home to various overseas destinations. His contention was that all this while, in the morning of 30 April 1996, he was at home making those calls.
 53.Dealing with the telephone records (exh D17) first, the trial judge rejected the evidence as unhelpful. Her reasoning, as stated at _ 271 of her grounds of decision, was: 
The accused said that exh D17 showed that he was at home that morning for he made six overseas calls from his house between 11.13am and 11.40am. D17 only showed that these calls were made. There was no evidence that the accused made these calls. In any case, the offence took place in the afternoon.
 54.In my judgment, the trial judge took a too simplistic view here. She should not have rejected the documentary evidence (D17) exhibiting the telephone calls which the appellant claimed that he made from his house in the morning of 30 April 1997. In the absence of any contrary explanation, it was reasonable to infer that, if these calls as exhibited in D17 were indeed made from the appellant`s home, then the appellant made those calls. In his evidence, the appellant gave some details of the calls which were made. True, there was no direct evidence which showed that the appellant did in fact make the calls, but this was immaterial, for it could be safely deduced that the appellant in all likelihood made them. This was simply a logical step following the conclusion that calls were made (as exhibited in D17) to various businesses in which the appellant had an interest. The prosecution did not challenge the authenticity of D17, nor did they give any alternative explanation as to who may have made the calls. In the circumstances, the appellant`s claim that he was at home on the morning of 30 April 1996, coupled with the other defence alibi evidence, must be given due consideration.
 55.While the offence in question took place in the afternoon, the events in the morning were important in determining the truth and credibility of PW2`s testimony. The events in the morning according to PW2 might not have been essential to her claim of molestation later in the afternoon, but should they be found inaccurate, it would be adverse to her in terms of the weight to be given to her testimony. Hence, the trial judge should not have given the impression, as she did in her grounds of decision, that simply because the offence occurred in the afternoon, therefore what transpired that same morning was neither important nor relevant. It was vital that all facts be considered and PW2 and the appellant`s respective stories be weighed against each other carefully.
 56.Coming to the evidence of DW2 and DW6, DW2 claimed that she called the appellant around noon to ask him if he was coming into his office, while DW6 said the appellant called her in the morning, picked her up subsequently and had lunch with her.
 57.The trial judge dismissed DW2`s evidence. At _ 286 of her grounds of decision, she said: 
Although she might have telephoned the accused at 11.56am, I did not think that she called the accused in order to ascertain whether he was coming to the office on 30 April 1996. This piece of evidence was inconsistent with her evidence during cross-examination that she would not keep track of when the accused was in Singapore or his appointments. It was odd that DW2 should develop an interest on 30 April in knowing whether he had returned to Singapore and whether he was coming to the office. I also found her evidence that she did not have to maintain his schedule unbelievable.
 58.She came to a similar conclusion on DW6`s evidence.
 59.As regards DW2`s evidence, I was of the view that the trial judge`s reason for dismissing it was unconvincing, and to have rejected it as she did was unsafe. It appeared that the trial judge was more concerned with why DW2 called the appellant, instead of finding out whether she did in fact call him. The crucial issue was whether DW2 did in fact call the appellant because he was not in his office, and somewhat curiously, the trial judge did not make a finding on this. The fact that she left this matter undecided, thus opening the possibility that DW2 did in fact call the appellant left little choice but to infer that there was every likelihood that DW2 did call the appellant because he was not in his office. The explanation for the call was immaterial. Accordingly, the trial judge`s rationale for rejecting DW2`s evidence could not be accepted. The end result was that it was only possible to conclude that DW2 did in fact call the appellant because he was not in his office, for, if he was, there would have been absolutely no need for DW2 to have called him on his handphone.
 60.At this juncture, it was appropriate to consider DW6`s evidence to determine whether it was rightly rejected by the trial judge. It was unnecessary to delve into the details of her testimony, save to caution that as she was a close and personal friend of the appellant, her evidence might be tainted in that she might want to cover up for the appellant. For this reason alone, I placed less emphasis and reliance on her evidence. This was also in line with my earlier approach giving less weight to PW2`s witnesses` testimonies partly because they were closely related to PW2, although I qualified this by saying that PW2`s witnesses did not give independent evidence, while DW6 might have. Nevertheless, having said that, even without DW6`s testimony, the result of the appellant`s appeal on the first conviction was still unaffected, and accordingly, I relied on the other defence witnesses` testimonies which were much stronger in their nature. Although these witnesses also knew the appellant, they were not close to him. The possibility that they would fabricate their evidence to cover up for the appellant was unlikely.
 61.The appellant also sought to refute PW2`s claim that he was in a meeting in the morning of 30 April 1996 by producing a meeting attendance book which he claimed recorded all the meetings which he attended. In this attendance book, there was no entry of any meeting on 30 April 1996. Thus, the appellant argued that he could not have been at any meeting as no meeting was recorded in this book.
 62.Having looked at this attendance book in detail, and considered the appellant`s testimony in this respect, I had to agree with the trial judge that this attendance book was not an accurate reflection of the meetings that had taken place. It was therefore not advisable to place much weight on it. This did not mean that the attendance book did not merit consideration. It did, but only with the totality of the evidence supporting the defence case. By itself, the attendance book showed nothing new, but, considered with the rest of the evidence, the prosecution`s case became dubious.
 63.Before leaving the events which occurred on the morning of 30 April 1996, of which both PW2 and the appellant gave different conflicting accounts, I noted that, while the appellant had provided several witnesses and documentary evidence to support his side of the case, the same could not be said of PW2. In fact, although PW2 admitted there were other people present in the office on the morning of 30 April 1996, she still relied very much on her own evidence, and chose not to call anyone who could assist her by supporting her version of events. This failure on her part to bolster up the strength of her case, coupled with the fact that the appellant could provide substantial evidence to show that he was not in his office that morning, suggested to me that the testimony of PW2 was questionable. It is trite that in such circumstances, a judge has a discretion whether or not an adverse inference is appropriate. Having given due consideration to this matter, under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), I found that it was indeed appropriate to draw such an adverse inference against her. PW2`s allegations against the appellant needed much support, and, in the absence of any further evidence which could confirm her allegations, I was not prepared to afford them much weight. As far as I could see, it did not take much to call other people to support her evidence, but in spite of that, PW2 failed to do so.
 64.The main issue in question was whether the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had molested PW2 in the afternoon of 30 April 1996. The appellant relied on telephone records which provided details of various overseas destinations which he called from his handphone. The crux of his argument was that, since he made those calls using his handphone, it could be inferred that he was not in his office in the afternoon. In addition, the appellant also had alibi witnesses in DW3, DW4, DW5, DW6 and DW7. His defence was that he had a haircut which took up the best part of the afternoon, and, by the time he returned back to his office, it was past 6pm.
 65.Just as the trial judge dismissed the telephone records earlier, likewise she did so here too. In particular, two such telephone calls which were highlighted by counsel for the appellant, occurring at 2.56pm and 2.58pm on 30 April 1996 respectively, appeared in the prosecution`s own evidence. At exh P28, two calls were recorded to have been made to the appellant`s Malaysian office from the appellant`s own handphone. The appellant argued that, since he made those calls, therefore he could not have been in his office, as there was no reason to use his handphone when he had easy access to the office phone, a much cheaper way for communication. In contrast, PW2`s testimony was that the appellant was already in his office during the time those calls were made.
 66.The trial judge held, rejecting the exhibit containing these two calls (at _ 280-282 of her grounds of decision): 
280 Exhibit P28 also showed that a call was made from the car phone to the office at 12.15pm on 30 April 1996. Equally fascinating was the fact that P28 also showed that there were two calls to Kuala Lumpur from the car phone at 14.56 and 14.58pm. The prosecution had not put these calls to the accused during his cross-examination. It was remarkable that the accused could now remember these calls without the help of any records. 
281 The puzzle was solved when PW6 revealed that the accused had on 26 December 1996 almost immediately after the trial was partheard applied to Singapore Telecommunication Ltd for records of the calls received by or made from his handphone and car phone on 30 April 1996. The records were supplied to him. 
282 The accused was therefore fully aware of the details of the calls made on these two mobile phones on 30 April. Yet he claimed that he had no records of these calls. He also pretended that he remembered these calls on what the prosecution put to him. The accused was clearly lying although he could have come clean on the matter.
 67.I was not satisfied with the trial judge`s reasoning in rejecting the telephone records. Clearly, even though the appellant might have concealed his knowledge that he knew about these calls which were made to his Malaysian office, which he did not disclose to the prosecution until the commencement of the trial, this did not warrant the dismissal of these records as evidence proving the appellant`s story that he was not in his office. The appellant might have been a liar, but this still did not detract from the fact that the calls were made. The probative value of P28 lay not in the appellant`s behaviour as to why he did not disclose his knowledge of the telephone calls to the police or prosecution before the trial, rather it confirmed that such calls were made. The finding which the trial judge should have made was whether the appellant did in fact make these calls, and whether he made them although he was in his office. Both these questions remained unanswered. As such, I was unwilling to discount the possibility that these calls were made by the appellant because he was not in his office.
 68.More significantly though, apart from the two telephone calls just mentioned, there were eight calls which were either made or received by the appellant between the period from 3.05pm to 4.29pm that afternoon. These calls were recorded in the appellant`s handphone records at exh P27. Counsel for the appellant emphasised these calls to contradict PW2`s claim that the appellant was in his office. According to the prosecution`s case, this time period coincided with PW2`s claim that she was in the appellant`s room, when he molested her. Her evidence, as will be recalled, was that she was asked to go into the appellant`s room sometime after 3pm, and stayed there until well past 4.30pm. She also claimed that the appellant was disturbed by only one phone call during that time.
 69.In considering P27, the trial judge took a selective approach. She disregarded the majority of the calls, choosing only to deal with two calls which she thought were relevant. At _ 338 and 339 of her grounds of decision, she held: 
338 PW2 testified that she was rushing to meet the 4 o`clock deadline when the accused summoned her into his office. She remembered roughly that it was about 3 plus pm when she went into his office. But she recalled when she came out of his office, it was way beyond the deadline. She also testified that they were interrupted by something but she could not recall what it was. 
339 In view of her evidence, I believed that the accused must have molested PW2 between the two incoming calls at 3.47pm and 4.19pm. I believed that they were interrupted by the incoming call at 4.19pm. Hence I amended the time of the offence from `3 to 4pm` to `3 to 4.20pm`.
 70.In my judgment, P27 completely contradicted PW2`s story that she was in the appellant`s room sometime between 3pm and 4.30pm in the afternoon of 30 April 1996. To begin with, the trial judge should not have selectively considered only some calls which were recorded in P27 and not others. There was no justification taking this approach in evaluating this piece of evidence. The totality of P27 simply indicated, even assuming the appellant was in his office that afternoon that he was interrupted on more than a few occasions. This was in direct conflict with PW2`s evidence that the appellant was only disturbed by one, if not two phone calls. I could not believe that PW2 could have been mistaken as to the number of calls which the appellant made or received when she claimed that she was with him in his room, especially when he was using his handphone instead of his office phone. The fact that a total of eight calls were received or made by the appellant, as compared to only two which PW2 vaguely recalled, was cogent. If PW2 could remember the other finer details of the case, like what exactly the appellant told her throughout that day, she should have no problem recalling that the appellant made or received a number of calls using his handphone in his office room. I did not expect PW2 to have remembered the exact number of phone calls made or received by the appellant, but in this case the discrepancy was too serious to be ignored. In my view this inconsistency severely damaged the prosecution`s case.
 71.Throughout the trial below, while all the documentary records of telephone calls were adduced, with the appellant arguing that he made those calls, the prosecution did not seek to dispute these contentions by arguing the contrary. Even during the hearing of the appeal before me, when the same arguments about the documentary evidence were advanced, the prosecution only referred to the trial judge`s decision and urged me to accept that the trial judge had evaluated the evidence carefully and that her findings should be upheld. While I agreed that the trial judge conducted a meticulous examination of all the evidence in the present case, she had made a few fundamental errors which could not be overlooked. These errors went to the substance of the charge against the appellant. Further, the prosecution could provide no reasonable explanation to dispute the appellant`s documentary evidence and the necessary inferences to be drawn. In the circumstances, it left me little choice but to accept the appellant`s contentions. Even without the benefit of the various defence witnesses, the documentary records produced by the appellant had cast sufficient doubt on the prosecution`s case in that he was not in his office for most of the morning or afternoon of 30 April 1996.
 72.I also considered the evidence of the remaining defence witnesses evidence, namely, DW3, DW4, DW5 and DW7. Starting with DW3, she was an assistant working at HairGraphics, the hairdressing salon where the appellant claimed that he had a haircut in the afternoon of 30 April 1996. She gave evidence that the appellant arrived at HairGraphics at about 2.45pm that afternoon. However, as the trial judge rightly concluded, her evidence could not be accepted, as this time frame was arrived at as a result of the appellant telling her when he was at HairGraphics. What had actually transpired was that, when the appellant arrived at HairGraphics, he was issued with a receipt. There was initially no time stated on this receipt. Subsequently, when the appellant was accused of the offence, he went back to HairGraphics to claim the receipt and DW3 put the time of 2.45pm down then after talking to the appellant.
 73.More notable though was the evidence of DW4, who was the hairdresser who attended to the appellant. She stated that while the appellant was waiting for his haircut that afternoon, he bought some snacks for the staff of HairGraphics. In addition, as it was a particularly crowded afternoon, the appellant had to wait a while before his turn came. This explained why the appellant spent a rather longer time at HairGraphics than he usually did.
 74.I found, unlike the trial judge, nothing contradictory or inherently wrong about DW4`s evidence. DW4 merely stated what had taken place while the appellant was at HairGraphics. It therefore made perfect sense to accord this testimony due consideration. While the trial judge claimed that DW4`s evidence was contradictory and unreliable, she did not give any reasons for coming to this conclusion. In the circumstances, and in the light of some basic errors which the trial judge made in assessing witnesses in the present case, I found DW4`s evidence acceptable.
 75.Finally, there was the evidence of DW5 and DW7. DW5 testified that the appellant was not in his office in the afternoon of 30 April 1996, as he was there. He also confirmed that no meeting had taken place that morning. As for DW7, she met the appellant and DW6 outside Amara Hotel, where the appellant had his haircut, and followed him back to the office, by which time it was almost 6pm. Both their evidence simply served to reinforce the appellant`s claim that PW2 was lying, and that he was not in his office to molest her that fateful afternoon of 30 April 1996. There was no reason why either of them should fabricate his evidence, since neither was particularly close to the appellant, he being their employer. Having reconsidered their evidence again, it was my view that the evidence should be accepted, and that the trial judge should not have rejected their evidence because of the employer-employee relationship they had with the appellant. Although the trial judge did also point out that DW5 was nervous when he gave evidence, indicating the possibility that he was not telling the truth, the actual rationale for rejecting DW5`s evidence was unconvincing, if this was only because he could not explain in detail the reason why he was at the appellant`s office on 30 April 1996 (see _ 325 of the grounds of decision). This was not a valid ground for rejecting DW5`s testimony.
 76.Having examined the prosecution and the defence cases respectively, I was of the view that this was a case where a great injustice would be done should the conviction be upheld. However one looked at it, the prosecution had not made out a case with a sufficient degree of certainty. There was hardly any evidence to support PW2`s case, except for her own testimony. The prosecution`s case contained too many doubts, and too many questions remained unanswered. In the light of the overwhelming evidence from the defence, it was my opinion that the prosecution had not satisfied their burden of proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt. PW2`s evidence might, on its own, seem convincing enough, but once the appellant gave his defence and produced the evidence to support it, her case had to fall. Having analysed all the evidence in relation to the conviction on the first charge, I was not convinced that it was safe to convict the appellant for what he stood accused of. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal against the first conviction.
 77.Before I leave the appeal against the first charge, there is something which I would like to make clear. As with most molest cases which I have heard, counsel often argue that the victim did not make a police report sufficiently early enough after the alleged incidents. The contention is that this is pertinent, because a person who has had his/her privacy infringed would want to report the matter to the police as soon as is possible so that the culprit is caught and punished. The fact that there is a time lapse between the alleged incident and the making of the police report must mean that the victim had something to hide. In the present case, this was exactly what counsel for the appellant sought to argue.
 78.I have combed through many previous cases and in my view, this argument must be rejected. In the local context, the failure to make a police report within a reasonable time after the incident is neither here nor there. I have noted that often, the main reason, amongst others, for not making a police report soon after such an incident is not because the victim has something to hide, rather it is because the victim is afraid of the shame it would bring to the family, should others know about the incident. Making a police report and subsequently having the case dealt with by the courts often attracts undue attention which can be very traumatic for the victim as well as for the family. Also, some victims may be afraid that their word may not be believed. Therefore, they would rather suffer in silence than to see that the culprit is punished. It is for this reason that victims are often reluctant to report any matters to the police. In view of this therefore, the failure to make an early police report will no longer be seen as fatal to the prosecution`s case, unless it can be ascertained with certainty that this failure was due to other reasons which might cast doubt on the victim`s claim of the offence. To quote myself from the recent case of 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 (Unreported) , at _ 29: 
While it is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint to her family or friends, the same cannot be said of a failure to make a prompt police report. In my experience, there is a natural reluctance on the part of victims of sexual offences to make a police report. This stems from a variety of reasons. The victim may keep silent for fear of being stigmatised or disbelieved. She may view the police investigation and the court process, both of which are potentially intrusive and distressing, with trepidation, or she may have been so traumatised by the experience that reporting the offence is simply a very low priority. She may even have been threatened with retaliation if she reported the offence. Her first recourse will invariably be her family and friends rather than the police. Indeed, many of those who do eventually make a police report do so only after they have been persuaded to do so by their family and friends
 (b) the second charge
 79.That just left me with the appeal against the second conviction. I need not repeat the circumstances as to how the appellant came to be accused of the offence, nor do I need to repeat both PW2 and the appellant`s version of facts. The appellant did not deny having come into some, albeit slight, physical contact with PW2. What he denied was that he intended to outrage her modesty.
 80.In view of the appellant`s implied admission, I was of the view that the appeal against the second conviction had to be dismissed. The appellant`s defence here was not that he did not touch PW2. The fact that he intended to have some physical contact said it all. He intended to touch her, but unfortunately did not realise the consequences of his actions. Singapore, by many standards, is still a conservative society. Physical contact between persons who do not know each other well is not appropriate and should not be encouraged. No doubt there are those who are more liberal and do not mind such physical contact, but for those who wish to protect their privacy, the law should do its bit to see that this is respected. Further, the appellant in the present instance came into contact with PW2`s buttock, a private part of PW2`s body. All the more this kind of behaviour should not be excused.
 81.However, I was also of the view that the sentence meted out for the appellant`s conviction was manifestly excessive. It is well established that in cases of a similar nature, where the act is a seemingly innocent act with no aggravating factors, a sentence of a fine is sufficient punishment. In the present case, it was quite clear that although the appellant had touched PW2`s buttock, this was an act which, unlike most outraging modesty cases, was for the shortest of moments and had no aggravating factors. The appellant did not force himself on PW2, nor was any hurt or injury caused. This was not a premeditated act on the appellant`s part, and in most likelihood was done on the spur of the moment. Unfortunately, the appellant`s behaviour could not be condoned or excused. In the circumstances, I thought it appropriate to reduce the appellant`s sentence from that of imprisonment to a fine of $2,000. In my opinion, this was a just punishment for the appellant, who had to understand and learn his lesson that not all people will approve of the physical contact which might be acceptable to some others.
 82.
 Conclusion
For the above reasons, I allowed the appellant`s appeal against the first conviction and dismissed the appeal against the second conviction, reducing however the sentence from one of imprisonment to a fine of $2,000.",1998-01-14 00:00:00,SG High Court

LIM TEONG QWEE JC
 On 29 August 1994 at about 1pm a motor cycle driven by the third party collided with a motor pick-up driven by the defendant. The plaintiff was a pillion passenger on the motor cycle. He was thrown off the vehicle and was injured. He brings these proceedings against the defendant to recover damages for the defendant`s negligence. The defendant denies negligence and alleges that the collision was caused solely by or contributed to by the third party`s negligence. The third party denies negligence and alleges that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant.
 2.Shortly before the accident the third party`s motor cycle was travelling north along a straight stretch of Canberra Rd and the defendant`s motor pick-up was travelling south on the same road. That stretch of the road was only about 6.8m wide. There was a pedestrian crossing and on each side of the pedestrian crossing the road was marked with a zigzag line in the centre. About 10 m south of the pedestrian crossing there was a `T` junction on the west leading to an unmetalled road. There were some shops in the vicinity which were accessible from the unmetalled road. That side of Canberra Rd had a pavement for pedestrians. At some point in time the defendant`s motor pick-up turned right on Canberra Rd to enter the unmetalled road and the third party`s motor cycle collided with it on its left side. It was a clear day. The road was dry. The defendant described the traffic as moderate in his police report made the following day on 30 August 1994. The third party and the plaintiff both described the traffic as light in their separate police reports made on 31 August 1994 and 8 September 1994.
 3.In his affidavit the plaintiff said that the defendant`s motor pick-up `suddenly made a right turn across [the motor cycle`s] path` to go into the unmetalled road. He said the third party applied brakes but as the motor pick-up was too close he could not avoid the collision. That is substantially what he said in his police report. Under cross-examination he said that from his position on the motor cycle he did not see the motor pick-up making a right turn or see it at all.
 4.The defendant said in his affidavit: 
At the material time, the flow of traffic was moderate and the road surface was dry. The weather was fine and visibility was clear.
 
I turned on my right turning indicator and stopped my said pick-up to allow a motor pick-up from the opposite direction to pass.
 
After checking that the road was clear, I proceeded to negotiate a right turn.
 
Suddenly, a pedestrian dashed across my path. I immediately jammed my brakes. At the same time, I heard a loud sound at the rear of my said pick-up. I subsequently noticed that [the third party`s motor cycle] had collided into the rear of my said pick-up.
 5.The defendant was asked under cross-examination what he meant when he said that the road was clear. This is part of his evidence: 
Q: Toh (1). Para 5. Road was clear? 
A: Within safety distance there was no vehicle on road. 
Q: Safety distance? How far? 
A: About 100 metres.
 I pause here to observe that a vehicle travelling at 50 km/h would take only a little over seven seconds to cover a distance of 100 m.
 6.Continuing under cross-examination the defendant said: 
Q: How long stationary and turned down to time of collision? 
A: Less than 15 seconds to time I heard collision. 
Q: 15 seconds. How long stationary? 
A: About 10 seconds. Not more than 11 or 12 seconds. 
Q: Toh (1). Para 4. While you were stationary motor pick-up only vehicle passed you from opposite side? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Put: If motor cycle was travelling from opposite direction you would have seen it in 10-12 seconds from time you became stationary? 
A: Don`t agree. Don`t know whether came from opposite direction or from side. Don`t really know.
 According to the defendant he did not know whether the third party`s motor cycle came from the opposite direction or from the side. If that was so he could hardly have kept a proper lookout.
 7.The defendant also said under cross-examination that he only saw the third party`s motor cycle when it collided with his motor pick-up. He was referred to his police report where he said `After the said pick-up has drove pass (sic) me, I noticed a motor cycle travelling from a distance at the opposite direction.` This is his evidence: 
Q: `A-1`/9. Sentence 5. Said saw motor cycle from opposite direction? 
A: I saw there were vehicle or vehicles quite a distance away from me but did not notice what kind of vehicle. 
Q: Agree motor cycle referred to in report was motor cycle that collided with your vehicle? 
A: Can`t say for sure.
 8.It was not just `vehicle or vehicles` the defendant saw or noticed according to his police report. What he said there was that he noticed a 
 motor cycle 
 and it was `travelling from a distance at the 
 opposite direction 
`. I think he did see a motor cycle coming from the opposite direction and it was the third party`s motor cycle that he saw. He knew where it came from.
 9.The third party said in his affidavit: 
On 29 August 1994 at about 1pm I was riding motor cycle bearing registration no: JDE 9423 along Canberra Road in the direction of Admiralty Road. At or near the Indian Temple along the said Canberra Road a motor pick up bearing registration no: GJ 2730C driven by the defendant from the opposite direction suddenly made a right turn across my path towards the said shophouses.
 The temple was near where the shops were and Admiralty Rd was to the north. This was consistent with his police report and his evidence under cross-examination.
 10.The third party also said in his affidavit: 
I did not see any pedestrian trying to dash across the road (as claimed by the Defendant in his police report) just prior to the accident.
 Under cross-examination he said the road he referred to in his affidavit was Canberra Rd. If anyone dashed across the road he would in all probability have seen that. However that was not what the defendant said in his police report. He said the pedestrian dashed across the junction. In his affidavit he said the pedestrian dashed across his path. I think he meant the pedestrian dashed across the unmetalled road at the junction so that he could not drive into it.
 11.The defendant`s intention was to drive into the unmetalled road. There was a pavement for pedestrians on that side of Canberra Rd. He should have looked to see if there were any pedestrians on the pavement and if there was anyone crossing the junction before he began his turn to enter the unmetalled road.
 12.On the evidence before me I find that the defendant saw the third party`s motor cycle coming towards his motor pick-up from the opposite direction. He thought it was what he considered a safe distance away. He intended to turn right to go into the unmetalled road and he took a decision to do so before the third party`s motor cycle came too close. I think he did not stop before he turned or if he did he did not wait for any significant length of time. He turned and his motor pick-up came across the path of the third party`s motor cycle and the third party had no time to avoid the collision. He was wrong. The motor cycle was closer than what was a safe distance away.
 13.The defendant turned without ascertaining that it was safe to drive into the unmetalled road. Even if a pedestrian did dash across the junction as he alleged it was still his negligence that caused the collision. He said in his affidavit that he immediately `jammed` his brakes and at the same time he heard the loud sound of the collision. There was hardly any interval of time between his noticing the pedestrian dashing across the junction and the collision. The third party`s motor cycle was already close to his motor pick-up when he noticed the pedestrian. It was already close to his motor pick-up when he turned. Mr Eu suggested that the third party would be at least 10-15% to blame but I do not agree. In my judgment the defendant was wholly to blame. I find that he was negligent as claimed.
 14.The plaintiff sustained the following injuries: (a). fracture of the lateral side of the left patella with mild displacement; and
 (b). multiple lacerations of the left knee.
 Dr Low Yin Peng said in his report: 
Mr Visvalingam a/l Arumugam has sustained a fracture of his left patella and many lacerations of his left knee. Though the fracture has united, the patient is experiencing pain and discomfort due to early osteoarthritis of the patello-femoral joint.
 
In my opinion he is not capable of heavy manual work permanently. He is, however, able to perform light manual or sedentary work.
 15.For the early onset of osetoarthritis Mr Ramasamy Chettiar referred to DC Suit No 2532 of 1994 where $6,000 was allowed. I see no reason for departing from the amount usually allowed under this head and I accordingly allow $5,000.
 16.At the time of the accident the plaintiff was employed as a steel worker on board ships. In the course of his work he had to climb up and down ships very often and he had to carry heavy materials and equipment. He cannot do this kind of work now. He returned to his previous employment when his medical leave was over but left it on 13 August 1996. From 16 August 1996 to the end of that year he was employed as a labourer but since 5 February 1997 he has been employed as a rigger earning less than when he was a steel worker. He was born in August 1964 and it is not disputed that at the time of the hearing of this action he would probably have continued to work for another 32 years until 65.
 17.The plaintiff is a Malaysian and Mr Eu conceded that if he continued to work in Singapore he would suffer a loss of $1,000 per month in his earnings but if he worked in Malaysia his loss would be $500 per month. He submitted that there was a probability of the plaintiff working in Singapore for the next seven years ie until he was 40 and in Malaysia for the next 25 years. He submitted that I should adopt a multiplicand of $9,000 after allowing for contingencies and a multiplier of three for Singapore. For Malaysia he submitted a multiplicand of $6,000 and a multiplier of five. On this basis he submitted compensation for loss of future earnings of $57,000.
 18.Mr Ramasamy Chettiar agreed with the approach but as to the plaintiff being a Malaysian he referred to 
Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 513
  where Prakash J said at p 519: 
I do not think that in present circumstances a distinction should be drawn between a Malaysian and a Singaporean construction worker on the basis that the Malaysian worker may have a shorter working life because his work permit may not be renewed in the event of a downturn in the construction industry. For many years the construction industry in Singapore has been dependent on foreign workers and I think I may take judicial notice of the fact that this situation is going to continue in the foreseeable future.
 In the event that I did draw a distinction he submitted that the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of working in Singapore for the next 22 years until he was 55 and the remaining ten years in Malaysia. On this basis he submitted a multiplier of 12 for Singapore and five for Malaysia. He used a multiplicand of $12,600 for Singapore and $9,600 for Malaysia and submitted compensation for loss of future earnings of $199,200.
 19.Compensation for loss of future earnings is awarded for real assessable loss proved by evidence. See 
 Fairley v John Thompson (Design and Contracting Division) Ltd 
 [1973] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 40 at p 42 per Lord Denning MR. The loss suffered by the plaintiff depends on whether he can continue to work in Singapore or if he can continue to work but has to work in Malaysia. The question then is whether he can obtain a work permit to work in Singapore or renew it from time to time.
 20.In 
Soon Pook Seng Arthur v Oceaneering International Sdn Bhd
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 531
  the loss depended on among other things whether the plaintiff a professional diver would have gone on to become a supervisor. Warren LH Khoo J said at p 543: 
So long as there is or was a fair possibility, as opposed to a mere fanciful speculation, that something will or would have happened, that possibility must be taken into account, with due allowance made for the possibility that it might not happen or that it might not have happened.
 He cited with approval a passage from Lord Diplock`s speech in 
Mallett v McMonagle
 
[1969] 2 All ER 178
 at pp 190, 191. I think it bears repeating at least in part. Lord Diplock said at p 191: 
in assessing damages which depend on its view as to what will happen in the future or would have happened in the future if something had not happened in the past, the court must make an estimate as to what are the chances that a particular thing will or would have happened and reflect those chances, whether they are more or less than even, in the amount of damages which it awards.
 21.I respectfully agree. I cannot find as a fact whether in the future the plaintiff will obtain a work permit or will be able to renew it and if so for how long. He was working in Singapore at the time of the accident. He continued to work in Singapore after the accident. I think there is a fair possibility that he could have continued to work in Singapore. While it will not be possible to say for how long this will continue to be the case I think the chances will diminish with time. Mr Eu`s submission puts it at seven years more in Singapore and thereafter in Malaysia. I think apportioning the loss on this basis fairly reflects the chances of the plaintiff`s being able to continue working in Singapore with the corresponding level of loss and I would adopt this as a basis of assessing the loss.
 22.For the Singapore portion of the loss I would accept the multiplicand of $12,000 and a multiplier of three as submitted by Mr Eu. That gives a capital sum of $36,000. For the Malaysia portion I would accept the multiplicand of $6,000 as submitted by Mr Eu but I would adopt a multiplier of 12. That gives a capital sum of $72,000 and a total sum of $108,000. I think this is a fair sum to award as compensation for loss of future earnings. No submission was made on the effect of income tax but I think it is right that I should mention that while I have taken income tax into account I think the plaintiff`s liability would not be significant and I have not made any deduction on this account.
 23.In the result I gave judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for the amount agreed between the parties in respect of various heads of damages and for $5,000 for the early onset of osteoarthritis and $108,000 for loss of future earnings and costs. I dismissed the defendant`s claim against the third party with costs.",1998-01-26 00:00:00,SG High Court

This is quite obviously a case where no re-trial ought to be ordered; the charge is bad and the essential ingredient of the charge is not contained in it. Merely using abusive words is not an offence under any law so that an accused person must be charged under that particular subsection of the Minor Offences Act with either using abusive words with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or if it is a case where the abusive words are such whereby they are likely to cause provocation, those words must be in the charge and as had happened in this case the appellant had been convicted of using abusive words then that is not an offence known to our law.
It is said that there ought to be a re-trial. Looking at the nature of the evidence in this case and the use of the words complained of in the circumstances in which they arose it is not a fit case where a re-trial ought to be ordered and therefore the appeal is allowed, the conviction quashed and the fine to be refunded.

Section 108A Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Rev Ed)
 
The respondent, Isaac Paul Ratnam, an advocate and solicitor, who had been in private practice since March 1972 and prior thereto had been a State Counsel in the Attorney General`s Chambers for five years, was on his own plea of guilty convicted on 24 October 1972 in the First Magistrate`s Court of the following charge, namely: 
 
That he, Isaac Paul Ratnam, on or about 3 August 1972, did instigate the General Manager, Gemini Chit-Fund Corp Ltd, Malaysia Branch, Kuala Lumpur to dishonestly remove property, to wit, five cars and other movable properties, belonging to the said company, and he had by virtue of s 108A of the Penal Code committed an offence punishable under s 424 read with s 116 of the said Code.
 
 
 
The respondent immediately after his said conviction through his counsel applied with the consent of the Deputy Public Prosecutor for another charge to be taken into consideration by the court as provided for by s 171(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed). This charge reads as follows: 
 
That he, Isaac Paul Ratnam, on or about 2 August 1972, having reason to believe that a certain offence, to wit, criminal breach of trust by an agent has been committed by the Gemini Chit-Fund Corp Ltd, and that such offence was abetted by its directors, Abdul Gaffar and VKS Narayanan, which offences are punishable with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and also with a fine, did cause certain evidence of the said offence to disappear, to wit, files containing the Gemini Chit-Fund Corp Ltd`s correspondence, vouchers, bank statements, chit fund receipts and Abdul Gaffar`s personal correspondence, with the intention of screening the said Gemini Chit-Fund Corp Ltd, Abdul Gaffar and VKS Narayanan from legal punishment, and he had thereby committed an offence punishable under s 201 of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
The court, after hearing a plea of mitigation by the respondent`s counsel who also tendered a statement written by the appellant in mitigation, sentenced the appellant to one day`s imprisonment and a fine of $4,000 or in default 15 months` imprisonment. As a consequence of his conviction of a serious criminal offence and his admission of having committed another serious criminal offence he appeared before a disciplinary committee duly appointed under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed) to hear and investigate the matter and to determine whether cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under s 84 of the said Act. Under s 84(1) all advocates and solicitors are subject to the control of the Supreme Court and on due cause shown are liable to be struck off the roll or suspended from practice for any period not exceeding two years or censured. Under s 84(2)(a) such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor `has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession`. Under s 84(2)(b) such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor `has been guilty of ... grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty ...`.
In his reply to the statement of case the respondent in effect admitted all the material allegations of fact alleged in the statement of case and admitted the fact of his conviction and that he had admitted to having, committed another offence. At the hearing and investigation before the disciplinary committee, counsel on behalf of the Law Society relied on the conviction as proof of his conviction of a criminal offence within the meaning of s 84(2)(a) of the Legal Profession Act and relied on his admission of another criminal offence as proof of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty within the meaning of s 84(2)(b) of the said Act. The respondent was present and represented by counsel but did not give evidence before the disciplinary committee. His counsel tendered a written submission and elaborated on it. We quote from the report of, the disciplinary committee: <6>
 Submissions and Facts 
 
4 At the hearing before us the respondent was represented by counsel, who handed in a written submission, which he read and elaborated on.
(5) In essence, the submissions made on behalf of the respondent were as follows. It was suggested that even though he pleaded guilty to the charge referred to it did not follow therefrom that he was in fact guilty of the criminal offence in question, because people sometimes plead guilty, as the respondent did, so as to avoid the chance of being sent to prison. It was also said that the respondent did not in law cause the document in question to disappear, because disappearance would amount to an offence only if the evidence in question cannot be utilised in court, whereas in this case the documents were missing for only two weeks. With regard to the letter of 3 August 1972, it was submitted that the respondent merely acted as a `conduit pipe` and cannot be said to have instigated the disposal of the property of Gemini then in West Malaysia. It was also said that the winding-up petition in Singapore had no effect in Malaysia and the respondent therefore took the view (without giving the matter much thought) that the assets in Malaysia were not affected by the petition. 
(6) Apart from these points, the rest of the submissions presented on behalf of the respondent went to mitigation.
 
 
 
The disciplinary committee found that the respondent had been convicted of a criminal offence implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession within the meaning of s 84(2)(a) of the Legal Profession Act and also found that in causing or attempting to cause the documents referred to in the second criminal charge to disappear he was guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty within the meaning of s 84(2)(b) of the said Act.
Before us, similar submissions were advanced by Mr Hilborne who appeared for the respondent. With the leave of the court the respondent put in an affidavit sworn by him a few days before the hearing on which he was cross-examined before us by counsel for the Law Society. In the affidavit the respondent, for the first time, asserted that he had erroneously and unintentionally referred in his letter of 3 August 1972, which letter was the subject matter of the criminal charge on which he was convicted, to the movable properties as the property of Gemini Chit-Fund Corp Ltd when the instructions he received from Gaffar, the managing director of the company, was to dispose of Gaffar`s movable properties. He was cross-examined on this and in our opinion his explanation was most unsatisfactory. We disbelieved his continued assertion that it was an unintentional error. His demeanour when cross-examined on his new revelation was in our judgment that of a witness who knew he was not telling the truth.
Mr Hilborne submitted that it is open to this court to look behind the conviction if on the face of the record the conviction is bad 
 e.g. 
if he could show that on the admitted facts before the magistrate`s court the respondent could not be found in law to have committed the offences as set out in the criminal charge or if no offence is disclosed in the criminal charge. Assuming that this court is entitled to look behind the conviction in the present proceedings, which are disciplinary in nature, where the allegation is based upon the respondent`s `conviction of a criminal offence` we are of the opinion that there is no error on the face of the criminal charge and that the admitted facts before the magistrate`s court justifies its acceptance of the respondent`s plea of guilty.
Mr Hilborne`s submission was that s 108A of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) is not applicable because on the admitted facts the movable properties of the company were situate outside Singapore and it was permissible in law for the movable properties situate outside Singapore of a company, against which a winding-up order has been made by a Singapore court, to be disposed of. We rejected this argument as fallacious. In our judgment s 108A of the Penal Code was properly invoked. That section reads as follows: 
 
A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Code who, in Singapore, abets the commission of any act without and beyond Singapore which would constitute an offence if committed in Singapore.
 
 
 
A person who commits in Singapore an act which constitutes dishonestly removing property will have committed an offence punishable under s 424 of the Penal Code. The offence is committed whether or not the property that has been dishonestly removed is situate in or outside of Singapore.
The charge to which the respondent pleaded guilty is that by virtue of s 108A he had committed an offence punishable under s 424 of the Penal Code read with s 116. It mattered not that the movable properties specified in the charge are foreign assets of the company. Section 108A in clear terms would apply if it can be proved that the respondent abetted in Singapore the commission of any act without and beyond Singapore which would constitute an offence punishable under s 424 of the Penal Code if committed in Singapore.
In the present case the respondent pleaded guilty and so the prosecution was not put to prove abetment on the part of the respondent.
The other submission was that the respondent could not be said to `instigate` the general manager of the company to dishonestly remove certain movable properties of the company because he was merely carrying out the instructions of his client, Gaffar, and was thus merely an agent. This submission we also rejected because we are unaware of any principle or of any authority for the proposition that a solicitor who passes on the instructions of his client to another person which instructions when carried out by that other person amounts to the commission of a criminal offence does not `instigate` that other person to commit that criminal offence. The respondent pleaded guilty and admitted in the magistrate`s court the facts placed before the court. The facts showed that the respondent dictated the said letter of 3 August 1972, signed it and personally handed it to someone with instructions to hand it to the general manager of the Kuala Lumpur branch of the company. These facts having regard to the contents of the said letter constitute prima facie sufficient evidence of instigation by the respondent.
It was lastly submitted on behalf of the respondent that on the facts and having regard to all the circumstances his conviction could not be said to imply a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession. We rejected this submission. In our judgment it is the nature of the offence which is the sole criterion in determining whether or not an advocate and solicitor comes within the provisions of s 84(2)(a) of the Legal Profession Act. In our judgment the offence of which the respondent was convicted is one which clearly implies a defect of character which makes him unfit for the profession of an advocate and solicitor.
Finally, having considered all the circumstances including his admission of having committed another serious criminal offence we were in no doubt that the extreme penalty ought to be imposed and we accordingly ordered that the respondent be struck off the roll and that he should bear all the costs of the Law Society.

The second defendant in Suit 899/71, who is a taxi driver, has appealed against my decision therein finding him wholly negligent in respect of a three-cornered collision which took place between the taxi driven by himself, a military truck driven by the first defendant and a motor van driven by the third plaintiff as a result of which the first and third plaintiffs were injured. Damages were agreed. The only question I had to decide was the question of liability as between the first defendant and the second defendant/appellant, ie, whether the first defendant or the second defendant or both were negligent.
There was no question of any negligence on the part of the third plaintiff who drove the motor van.
Shortly after noon on 16 June 1970 under good weather conditions and with hardly any other traffic on the road, the three vehicles came into collision in the following circumstances.
The third plaintiff was driving his motor van in the direction of Changi along Upper Changi Road when near the 12th milestone, his van was involved in an accident with a military truck which, according to him, came over to his side of the road and collided with him immediately after colliding with the taxi which had previously been travelling ahead of the truck. He stated that on seeing the collision between the truck and the taxi in front of it he slowed down and stopped on the grass verge on his own side of the road. Although he was not a satisfactory witness particularly as to his recollection of exact distances, he was quite emphatic that both the taxi and the truck were travelling towards him at a speed of about 30 mph in each case. He also seemed quite certain that the taxi `slowed down suddenly` which he further clarified by stating that `it jerked to a halt for a fraction of a second and then moved on`. He was quite positive that the taxi did not give a signal before it stopped. He also said that he saw people hailing the taxi. As I have already said, his memory as to distances left a good deal to be desired and he kept changing his estimate of the distances between the two vehicles, when he first saw them approaching him, from 20 feet to 120 feet and to 100 feet and then back again to 20 feet. Too much reliance cannot therefore be placed on this witness.
I was therefore left mainly with the evidence of the first and the second defendants and the police reports made by all three drivers and the sketch plan in the agreed bundle to say nothing of the photographs.
I now turn to the evidence of the first defendant, Handley, who was the driver of the military truck. He claimed that he had driven actively in the British Army in the United Kingdom, Germany, Europe and in Singapore for seven years during which he was never involved in any motor accident. He said he held a heavy goods vehicles licence and could drive any vehicle. I had no reason whatsoever to doubt his veracity as a witness. He gave his evidence with complete candour.
He said that he was driving his truck at approximately 30 mph, which was the speed-limit there, from Changi toward the direction of the city intending to turn left into Tenah Merah Besar on his way back to camp and that he was in no hurry because he had finished his work. He said that he followed the taxi in question for about a mile at a steady 30 mph at a distance of about 20 yards behind it which he kept up. He had no intention of overtaking it at all.
After passing the double white lines at the end of a bend to the left he was on the straight with the taxi still 20 yards in front of him when it suddenly stopped in front of him causing him to brake sharply whereupon his truck skidded and collided with the rear of the taxi. The truck then slewed round in a clockwise direction to the right and ran into the on-coming van which was then stationary practically opposite to the point of collision with the taxi but on the other side of the road.
He claimed that he kept his vehicle under control by keeping straight until it hit the taxi which was stationary whilst he was still skidding.
He said that he could not swerve right because of the on-coming van nor swerve left because of the monsoon drain, a bus stop, lamp-post and trees.
He agreed that he left two brake marks of 100 feet and 80 feet approximately and said that although he did not look at his speedometer his speed did not exceed 30 mph.
He denied that he was coming so fast down the bend that, on seeing his path obstructed by the taxi and the van as he came out of the bend, he braked because owing to his speed he could not pull up in time. He said that he followed the taxi all the way round the bend and was out of the bend before the taxi started to brake. He denied that the taxi never stopped,
At this stage, in dealing with his evidence, I would draw attention to the fact that the plan AB1 does not give any indication of the distance between H (the end of the double lines of the bend) and W (the commencement of the brake marks). I do so for the reason that this witness stated that he was 200 feet past the white lines when he realised that the taxi was applying its brakes. Assuming he is right in this, then the plan is misleading because HW on the plan appears to be far shorter than it actually would have been had the plan been drawn to scale. In view of the very unsatisfactory evidence of the taxi driver, with which I shall shortly be dealing, and of the excellent impression I formed of the first defendant as a witness. I found that the truck was well out of the bend and on the straight before the first defendant saw the taxi brake to a halt. I also accepted it as a fact that the truck hit the taxi on reaching the end of the brake marks and that it `slewed` round to its right thereafter and hit the van which was then almost in line with the point of impact between the taxi and the truck.
The brake marks show clearly that the truck`s nearside wheels were close to the left edge of the road and I rejected any suggestion that it was attempting to overtake the taxi. In fact UA is two feet only.
On the other hand, the second defendant was a witness in whom I could repose no confidence. He too, perhaps more so than the van driver, was useless in his estimate of distances. One has only to consider his evidence that it was 100 feet from the entrance to Selarang Barracks to where he was hit with his evidence in the very next breath that the distance from the entrance to Selarang Barracks to the end of the bend at H was 110 or 120 feet.
He said that he was collided into from the rear by the truck. He described the bend as a blind bend which sloped downwards from the entrance to Selarang Barracks below H to south of the plan at AB1. The rest of his evidence was that he seldom used this road as a taxi driver, his speed was 30 mph and that he did not apply his brakes at all as there was no reason to do so and nobody hailed him.
He also denied seeing the approaching motor-van at all, an unusual utterance in view of what he said in his report and in view of the fact that it must have been straight in front of him though on the other side of the road before he was hit.
He said that the impact was not hard and that it occurred as he was keeping straight ahead after straightening out from the bend.
He said he never looked into his rear-view mirror whilst `going downhill` though he admitted seeing no vehicle in his rear-view mirror when he did look into it before reaching the entrance to Selarang Barracks and that he then never saw the truck.
He claimed that, with his windows down in the taxi, he could ordinarily hear trucks like the truck that hit him make a noise but denied hearing any noise from this truck at any time nor did he hear the sound of brakes or skidding behind him. He never saw or heard the truck at all before the collision.
I accepted the first defendant`s version of how the collisions occurred. I rejected the second defendant`s. I found him to be an untruthful and unreliable witness in more respects than one. The only substantially correct statement he made was about his taxi`s being run into by the truck but beyond that he was of no assistance. I concluded that he was a complete liar about not braking or stopping at all. I found that he applied his brakes suddenly and stopped without any warning to vehicles such as the truck which he must certainly have known was behind him in such circumstances that he was entirely to blame for both the collisions which took place.
His counsel relied on the propositions stated by the Court of Appeal in 
 De Cotta v Tan Hock Lee 
 
 
 [1972-1974] SLR 101 
 to the following effect: 
 
In our opinion, the real reason for the respondent being unable to avoid colliding with the van when it suddenly pulled up, was that he was travelling too close behind the van. The distance of 30 feet which separated the two vehicles was not a safe distance in the circumstances of this case. A reasonable prudent man riding a motor scooter at 30 mph would have kept much further away from the van because it is impossible for a scooter travelling at that speed to pull up in 30 feet. Quite apart from the fact that the respondent did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed by this want of care to his own injury, the respondent in the circumstances of this case owed a duty to the appellant to move with due care and on his own evidence he was clearly in breach of that duty.
 
 
 
Earlier, observations had been made to the effect that a two-wheel vehicle (a scooter) which the respondent was driving requires double the distance required by a four-wheel vehicle and that from 
 Bingham`s 
tables in 
 Motor Claim Cases 
, 6th Ed page 86, a scooter travelling at 30 mph would require 120 feet within which to pull up (including a `thinking` distance of 30 feet).
Mr Yap for the second defendant contended that heavy motor vehicles, like scooters, also require double the distance required by private cars and other four wheel vehicles.
The first defendant conceded that heavy trucks like his would leave longer brake marks than civilian vehicles.
Mr Coomaraswamy drew attention to the fact that on p 86 
 Bingham 
gives slightly shorter braking distances for vehicles at 30 mph than 45 feet which 
 Bingham 
cites from the Highway Code at p 87.
A distance of 30 feet which separated the following vehicle from the vehicle ahead of it was held not to be a safe distance in the circumstances of 
 De Cotta`s 
case.
In the circumstances of 
 De Cotta`s 
case the Court of Appeal found that it was common ground that the road at the scene of the accident sloped downwards and that it was also conceded `that it was dangerous for a scooterist to jam his brakes and come to a dead stop because he may overturn`.
On the facts of the case before me I did not find that the road sloped downwards as the second defendant contended but that there was `practically no gradient after the double lines as one travels north or AB1. Before that there is - downwards. Almost automatically I would ease foot off accelerator if there is a slope downwards. But this slope was so gradual I didn`t have to ease`. This is what the first defendant said in evidence and I accepted what he said. I rejected the contention that he was speeding down a slope and was accordingly unable to pull up in time behind the taxi which I did not find to be in motion.
Secondly, I did not consider that, by acting as he did, the first defendant knew or should have known that by following the taxi 50 to 60 feet behind it at 30 mph he could not in an emergency stop suddenly without endangering his own life as the Court of Appeal found in the case of the scooterist.
I found that, in the `agony of collision` as it is sometimes called, the first defendant braked sharply and went into a skid for which he was not responsible at a time when he deemed it unsafe to swerve to the left or the right, because of the sudden action of the taxi driver which left him no alternative in the matter at all.
I found that there was no excuse whatever for the second defendant`s sudden stop and that this took the truck by surprise as it had followed him previously for a mile without mishap at approximately the same speed in the case of both vehicles and at a distance between them of 20 yards.
Counsel for the second defendant submitted that the truck should have kept at least 75 feet behind the taxi if they were both travelling at about 30 mph and that on his own version there was negligence on the part of the first defendant. If the taxi moved forward some 60 feet before coming to a stop and if the truck had been some 60 feet behind it this would have given the truck a total distance of 120 feet within which to pull up. The first defendant said that it was difficult to be exact about distances when he very frankly altered his original estimate of 60 feet between them to 50 feet. He also very frankly said that 50 feet would be a safe distance unless the vehicle ahead pulled up abruptly without warning. I did not hold this statement against him because this was what the court had to decide.
Having regard to his unblemished record as a military driver and the favourable impression I formed of him as the only credible witness in the case I decided that he was not to blame for the collisions even if a rigid application of the distances given by him might have suggested that he was not within the braking distances set out in the Highway Code which are themselves, at best, guidelines. I did not regard his own estimates of distances as absolutely infallible. I found it difficult, in all the circumstances, to hold that he was following so closely behind the taxi or at such a high speed that culpability on his part had been established. The emergency was created by the wanton conduct of the taxi driver himself whose undoubted negligence both from the point of view of causative potency as well as blameworthiness was the causa causans of the collisions.
I considered the fact that brake marks of 80 and 100 feet long had been left on the road by the truck and that these might suggest a higher speed on the truck`s part than 30 mph. Counsel for the truck-driver said that brake marks of 90 feet were consistent with his evidence. I did not accept the contention of counsel for the taxi-driver that the truck`s speed was excessive on the basis of the brake-marks alone. I found it difficult to draw an inference from the Highway Code figures alone which are cited by 
 Bingham 
at p 87 that the truck must have been travelling at much more than 30 mph in view of the very favourable impression I formed of the truthfulness of the truck-driver as a witness although I am aware of the tendency of drivers generally to minimise the gravity of their own performances as drivers and to exaggerate that of those with whom they collide. The first defendant showed a refreshing departure from this tendency. For example, he altered his original estimate of the distance between the taxi and his truck from 60 feet to 50 feet to his own disadvantage when there was no necessity to do so.
I did not therefore find as a fact that the truck`s speed had been proved to be greater than 30 mph although it might have very slightly exceeded it, as his counsel said. Even the van-driver, for what it is worth, said that the truck`s speed was the same as the taxi`s, ie 30 mph.
On all the probabilities of the case, including my assessment of the credibility of witnesses, I held the truck-driver to be blameless.
I therefore found the second defendant solely to blame for the accident and gave judgment against him in the agreed damages with costs.

A car owned by the plaintiff company whose office was a few doors from the defendant`s petrol kiosk in Geylang was allotted to the use of its managing director, one Lim Tuan Meng, who left it at that kiosk for washing and cleaning at about noon on 3 December 1971. It was clearly understood that he would be returning to collect it at about 5pm that day as he informed his regular car washer, one Hussein, a defence witness (employed by the defendant) who confirmed this.
When he arrived at the kiosk earlier than expected shortly before 4pm he found it missing as did Hussein himself who said he last saw it at the kiosk at about 3pm. When questioned by Lim whether some employee of the defendant might have taken it for a drive, the latter replied that it was unlikely, a strange statement to make if it was locked after washing. Shortly afterwards, Lim reported its loss to the police in the hope that it could be traced.
He was a valued client of the petrol kiosk which he had patronised from the time the car was purchased 18 months earlier. He bought his petrol from this kiosk and also had his car serviced there. Furthermore, he paid $12 pm additionally to have the car washed and cleaned by the servants of the defendant at the kiosk including the regular washer, Hussein.
I have to decide on all the evidence whether this car was in fact entrusted to the care and custody of the defendant by way of a bailment for reward and whether its loss was due to the latter`s negligence.
Considerable efforts were made to establish that no keys had been left behind by Lim to enable Hussein to move the car around in the limited area reserved for washing cars known as the `wash area` to prevent obstruction owing to congestion. After claiming that Hussein `seldom drives` the defendant said that Hussein was not licensed to drive cars. The defence also tried to show that cars sent for washing and cleaning were washed with the aid of pails of water and not hoses from stand-pipes in that area.
Having considered all the evidence, I find that Lim left the car with its keys in the custody of Hussein that day for washing and cleaning and that Hussein ascertained from Lim when he would be collecting the car and was told that Lim would come for it at 5pm.
The defendant and Hussein gave evidence to the effect that no keys were ever left behind with them by Lim. Hussein said he locked the car without keys by pressing buttons inside the Mercedes car after washing it and left it in the wash area that day.
I do not accept their evidence either as to the method of washing employed or as to the fact that no keys were entrusted to Hussein. I did not believe the defendant that only those who sent cars for greasing, servicing and incidental washing left their keys behind and that these were left with the cashier for collection by owners later. There was a further calculated attempt by the defence to absolve itself of all responsibility for the custody of cars left at the kiosk for washing by its insistence that only casual passers-by whose cars were taken in for washing were required to surrender their keys. The reason given by the defendant was that this was done to ensure payment of the fee of $2 per wash for services rendered before collection.
An attempt was also made by producing photographs at AB5 to show that notices denying liability for damage to vehicles left on the premises were posted in prominent places therein by the defendant from 1970. I accept the evidence of Lim however that he only noticed these posters a week or ten days after the loss of his car and that when he questioned the defendant about why such notices had not been posted before 3 December 1971 the latter made no reply. I do not find that such notices were in existence before 3 December 1971. Lim may not have been a very satisfactory witness in one or two other respects which appear on the record but I accepted his evidence on this particular aspect as well as other aspects material to the issues in this case.
It was clear that the defence was utilising all the ammunition available in its armoury to deny acceptance of responsibility of any kind for Lim`s actions with regard to this car when left behind at the kiosk.
I do not believe the defence version that Lim took advantage of his position as a financier to throw his weight around and abuse privileges accorded him occasionally to park his car at the kiosk. I do not find that he did so frequently and for unduly long hours. I have to consider, however, the facts relating to the events which occurred on 3 December 1971. I do not believe the defendant that bad blood existed between him and Lim as a result of an ugly incident after the car was found missing or that Lim warned the defendant that if he would not compensate him he would `look for him later`, ie give him trouble. Lim, on the other hand, said that he was still on friendly terms with the defendant but that, to be on the safe side, he had decided to take his custom elsewhere to another kiosk nearer where he lived. I accept what he said on this aspect of the matter.
He also gave evidence that the defendant had paid him three visits on 15, 16 and 18 May 1973 respectively just before this trial began, that they were friendly visits but that, knowing that the defendant was involved in this litigation, he deemed it prudent to make a note of these visits in his desk diary. This was confirmed by the diary and these visits were unchallenged. A futile effort was made later during the defence to show that the defendant visited Lim at the latter`s request though this was never put to Lim earlier. No one said a word about the actual discussions at these visits and I am not prepared to conclude that these were other than cordial visits. The plaintiffs led this evidence of visits with a view to showing that Lim and the defendant were still on friendly terms notwithstanding this litigation which was instituted at the instance of Lim`s insurers who have already paid Lim. The defendant did not succeed in rebutting this evidence in any way.
Finding the facts as I do, I now turn to the law. All the necessary ingredients for the creation of a bailment of the car were proved to be present, ie first, a delivery of possession of the car to the defendant at his kiosk for the purpose of washing and cleaning it on 3 December 1971. This involved a temporary transfer of its custody on the clear understanding that the car should be returned to the bailor, Lim, at about 5pm that day after the specific work thereon undertaken by the defendant had been completed.
This car was not merely parked there at the risk of Lim Tuan Meng who left it there. It was left there with its keys to enable cleaning to be effected for which he paid $12 per month in addition to providing the kiosk with his custom as purchaser of petrol and in addition to using the kiosk for greasing and servicing his car. I hold that there was a bailment for reward and not a mere right or licence to park simpliciter or a purely gratuitous bailment. 
 Ashby v Tolhurst 
 [1937] 2 All ER 837 can be distinguished on its facts because, in that case, a mere licence to park was conferred at a fee and liability for damage was negated by conditions on the parking ticket itself.
Nor was this, for obvious reasons, only a gratuitous bailment. Even if the fee for washing cars was only $12 pm the bailor brought business to the defendant in other respects. It was held that a landlord of a block of service flats who accepted a trunk for storage without charge from tenant`s wife was 
 not 
a gratuitous bailee merely but subject to the same rules as a bailee for reward, 
 Andrews v Home Flats 
 [1945] 2 All ER 698. I find that it suited the defendant`s business purposes and prospects to accord more facilities to regular customers like Lim than he otherwise need have done and that he did undertake for 18 months at least the responsibilities of looking after the car whilst left in the custody of the kiosk and to return it when required after, as in this case, washing and cleaning it. He did not employ a ticket system as in 
 Ashby`s 
 case in order to make it quite clear to customers that he was not accepting responsibility for the safety of cars left in his kiosk`s premises and in order to make it clear that, if so left, they were entirely at the customer`s own risk. I find that it was the shock precipitated by the loss of this car on 3 December 1971 which caused him to exhibit the notices shown in the photographs AB5. I am satisfied that he did not do so earlier because he never thought of it until then.
The onus of disproving negligence is on the bailee once a bailment has been shown to exist. The defendant did not discharge that onus.
A bailee is required to take that degree of care which may reasonably be looked for, having regard to all the circumstances. In the circumstances of this case he is liable at least for ordinary negligence since the bailment was for the benefit of both parties.
In my judgment, the defendant failed to take all reasonable precautions to protect the car from theft; that if, as in this case, he entrusted that duty to his servant or agent, he is answerable for that servant`s carelessness in carrying out that duty. If he had taken the elementary precaution of ensuring the safe-keeping of the keys of the car, after it had been cleaned and locked, by adopting the same procedure as he says he did in the case of cars sent there for greasing and servicing, this loss could have been prevented. Even Hussein said that he saw the car in the place where it had been left (the `wash area`) at about 3pm. Thereafter he was elsewhere in the premises under some trees whilst this car was out of his sight. He had been alert enough to see some friends of Lim take this car away on previous occasions and he did not stop them. If he had exercised the same vigilance on this occasion he should have been able to see that some unauthorised stranger was tampering with the car and/or removing it, particularly if, as he says he did in fact lock it.
Judgment will accordingly be entered for the plaintiffs in the agreed sum of $9,500 with costs.

These three consolidated actions were commenced by the plaintiffs in 1968 and in each of them they claimed damages in respect of the damage to their goods which were shipped from Karachi to Singapore on board two ships owned by Dampskibsselskabet AF 1912, Aktieselskab (hereinafter referred to as the first defendants). Vayna Suppiah & Sons (hereinafter referred to as the second defendants) are lighterers and their lighters were used to convey the said goods from the said ships, when they were anchored in the outer roads, to the Port of Singapore Authority godowns.
The facts are these. Under seven bills of lading, particulars whereof are given in the plaintiffs` statement of claim, there were shipped from Karachi, in apparent good order and condition, nylon piece goods on board the vessel Lars Maersk for carriage to and delivery at Singapore. These seven bills of lading are the subject matter of the In Rem Admiralty Suit No 109 of 1968 which is against the first defendants.
Under two bills of lading, particulars whereof are given in the plaintiffs` statement of claim, there were shipped from Karachi, in apparent good order and condition on board the vessel Jens Maersk, 400 bales of bleached white cotton cambric and nine cases containing 12,802 yards metallic fancy shirting for carriage to and delivery at Singapore. These bills of lading are the subject matter of Suit No 2479 of 1968 which is against both defendants.
The third Suit is No 1961 of 1968 which is against the second defendants for damages for breach of duty and negligence in the carriage of the aforesaid goods.
The Lars Maersk and the Jens Maersk are sister ships owned by the first defendants who also own the Lexa Maersk which was seized by the plaintiffs in Singapore and released upon a guarantee in lieu of bail having been given by the first defendants.
The Lars Maersk arrived in Singapore on or about 29 November 1967 and anchored in the outer roads of the eastern anchorage from where all the cargo deliverable at Singapore unloaded into the second defendants` lighters and conveyed to the Port of Singapore Authority wharves and discharged into Godown No 19 for the purpose of delivery.
The Jens Maersk arrived in Singapore on or about 24 December 1967 and anchored in the outer roads of the eastern anchorage from where all the cargo deliverable at Singapore was unloaded into lighters and conveyed to the Port of Singapore Authority wharves and discharged into Godowns 20 A/D and R for the purpose of delivery.
On 4 and 5 January 1968 the agents of the plaintiffs went to PSA Godown No 19 for the purpose of taking delivery of the said goods ex the Lars Maersk and found that almost all the wooden packing cases in which the said goods were packed showed external dry stains and some external damage. They called for a survey before taking delivery and after a joint survey they took delivery of 121 cases of the said goods. On these 121 cases being opened internal dry stains were found in the wooden packing cases and the goods were all stained throughout to varying degrees. The plaintiffs contended at the trial that the staining of the wooden packing cases and of the goods were caused by sea water and the extent of sea water damage was claimed to be sixty-five per cent.
On 17 January 1968 the agents of the plaintiffs went to PSA Godowns 20 A/D and R for the purpose of taking delivery of the goods ex the Jens Maersk and found that some of the bales covered by the bill of lading No 10 were dry stained and most of the wooden cases in which the metallic fancy shirting covered by the bill of lading No 53 were packed were externally dry stained and damaged. They called for a survey before taking delivery and after a joint survey they took delivery of the 400 bales and the nine cases covered by bills of lading Nos 10 and 53 respectively. When these 400 bales and nine cases were opened and further examined it was found that the contents of 65 bales were dry stained and five out of the nine cases were internally dry stained and their contents were also dry stained in varying degrees. The plaintiffs contended at the trial that the staining of the contents of the said 65 bales and of the contents of the five cases was caused by sea water and the extent of the sea water damage was claimed to be sixty-five per cent.
The plaintiffs claimed for breach of contract the sum of $108,233.44. Alternatively they claimed damages and interest and costs.
The plaintiffs` case was that by the terms of the bills of lading the first defendants had acknowledged that the said goods had been shipped on board their vessels in apparent good order and condition unless otherwise indicated thereon; that there was no statement in any of the said bills of lading to the effect that the said goods when shipped on the Lars Maersk and Jens Maersk were otherwise than in apparent good order and condition; that the first defendants by the terms of the said bills of lading undertook to deliver the said goods in the same good order and condition as they were in when shipped; that it was the duty of the first defendants to deliver the said goods in the same good order and condition as they were in when shipped and that they had failed to do so.
The plaintiffs claimed that the second defendants as lighterers were the agents of the first defendants and whether the sea water damage occurred during the ocean carriage or during the lighter carriage the first defendants were nonetheless liable in damages to the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs also contended that if, which they did not admit, the liability of the first defendants ceased on the goods being unloaded into the lighters of the second defendants from the vessels Lars Maersk and Jens Maersk in the outer roads of the eastern anchorage and the sea water damage to the goods occurred during the lighter carriage, it was the duty of the second defendants to exercise due care and diligence in conveying the said goods from the side of the Lars Maersk and Jens Maersk respectively and discharging the said goods into the godowns of the PSA. The plaintiffs claimed that in breach of the said duty the second defendants did not safely or securely convey the goods from the side of the Lars Maersk and Jens Maersk and discharge the goods into the godowns of the PSA and by their want of due care and diligence allowed the said goods to be damaged by sea water in consequence of which the second defendants were liable for the damage caused to the goods.
The first defendants denied that any damage occurred while the goods were in their custody. They contended that if such damage did occur, then it occurred while the goods were in the custody of the second defendants or of the Port of Singapore Authority or of the plaintiffs.
The first defendants denied that the second defendants were their servants or agents. They contended that the second defendants were independent contractors for whose negligence they were not responsible.
The first defendants claimed that their liability, if any, ceased when the goods were discharged from their vessels.
The second defendants denied that the goods were damaged by sea water or at all while being loaded into, carried or discharged from their lighters. They denied that the goods were damaged by sea water or at all during conveyance from the vessels to the wharves of the PSA. They maintained that they did not owe any duty to the plaintiffs, contractual, or otherwise, and that if they did owe any such duty, they were not in breach of it.
The first defendants having disputed the plaintiffs` claim on the aforesaid grounds, asserted that in the event of their being held liable to the plaintiffs, they were entitled to be indemnified by the second defendants against the plaintiffs` claim. In the alternative, they claimed that they were entitled to damages for breach of contract and/or duty on the part of the second defendants, such damages to include any damages and interest awarded to the plaintiffs and all costs incurred by the first defendants in defending this action.
The first defendants` case against the second defendants was that the second defendants having been engaged as independent contractors, it was an express and/or implied term of their engagement that they would convey the goods with reasonable care and skill and deliver them at the wharves or godowns of the PSA in the same order and condition as they were in when they were delivered from the vessel into the custody of the second defendants. The first defendants claimed that the goods were delivered from the vessels into the custody of the second defendants in good order and condition and were subsequently conveyed from the side of the said vessels to the wharves of the PSA in the second defendants` own lighters. The first defendants claimed that if, which they did not admit, the goods were damaged when they were delivered to the said wharves of the PSA the second defendants were in breach of the aforesaid implied term and/or were negligent and/or in breach of duty. They cited the following particulars of the second defendants` breach of duty and /or negligence: 
 
1 Failing to take adequate steps to protect the goods against loss or damage by rain and/or by sea water.
 
 
 
 
(2) Allowing the goods to be loaded on to their lighters and/or remain uncovered thereon when rain and/or discharge of water from the ship`s side was likely to occur. And the ocean carriers will rely upon the maxim res ipsa loquitur.
  
 
 
The second defendants denied that the goods were in good order and condition when they were delivered into their lighters. They denied that the damage to the goods arose from any breach of any implied term or negligence or breach of duty on their part.
A number of witnesses were called on both sides and lengthy submissions were made on behalf of all three parties. Both defendants strenuously denied liability. I accepted the evidence of the witnesses called by the plaintiffs, namely, Oh Kean Hock (PW1), MA Abdul Majid (PW2), Capt Rivers (PW3), Dr Walter Rintoul (PW4) and Frederick Jones (PW5). In my opinion they were all speaking the truth. Indeed there was no suggestion that any of them was not speaking the truth.
As far as the Lars cargo was concerned there was incontrovertible evidence, namely, the report of Herring & Co a well-known firm of professional cargo surveyors, to the effect that the contents of the 121 cases were `subjected to contact with sea water, most probably during transit`. On page 3 of their report they stated: 
 
All the above cases were superficially examined whilst being collected by the consignees from the PSA Godown No 19. The carrier`s agents representative, Mr Charlie, made a brief attendance but did not remain throughout the inspection. In view of the condition of the cases which were externally dry stained with some showing evidence of external damage, samples of their contents were drawn at random from cases and were submitted to a salinity test by precipitation which proved positive. Subsequently these samples were submitted for analysis to confirm cause of damage and the following is an extract from the analytical report.

PM 5.8 Sodium Present
 
 
 
Chlorides Present Potassium Present
 
 
 
Sulphates Present Magnesium Present
 
 
 
Bromides Present Calcium Present
 
 
 
Analysis of the above sample submitted showed the presence of the major elements of sea water in the correct proportions.
 
 
 
We were instructed to carry out a detailed examination of the contents of the cases. This inspection was effected at the consignee`s premises. Each case was opened in our presence and the contents verified against the Packing Lists. The damaged pieces were carefully examined and the nylon cloth was noted to be stained throughout to varying degrees. The affected pieces were found to be, generally speaking, adjacent to the dry stained planks. The middle sections of the cases were, in most instances, dry, as a consequence of which a number of pieces were accepted as being in good condition.
The total yardage affected was certified by Herring & Co as 93,748 yards and although the plaintiffs requested them to certify 65% loss based on the insured value, they expressed the opinion that there was a 50% loss in sales value which should also cover the cost of reconditioning the material.
It is true that JC Jones who made the survey was not called by the plaintiffs and counsel for the first defendants made much of this fact. He complained that he was deprived of the opportunity of cross-examining Jones. That is true but the fact remained that Herring & Co`s report was proved by the plaintiffs in accordance with the Evidence Act and it was admissible in evidence. The first defendants have only themselves to blame for not being able to present any counter evidence. Before the plaintiffs took delivery they detected that there was something wrong with their goods and they informed the first defendants that they were going to have a survey carried out. They asked the first defendants to send a representative to witness the survey. The first defendants did send a Mr Charlie but he refused to stay and witness the survey. It would appear that the first defendants were not interested in the matter. Nor were they or their representative present at the subsequent detailed examination of the damaged goods carried out at the plaintiffs` premises at 88 High Street, Singapore. In consequence the first defendants were unable to challenge the report of Herring & Co. There was no suggestion that it was a false or a fraudulent report. As pointed out by their counsel, the plaintiffs acted perfectly above board and gave the first defendants a reasonable opportunity to witness the survey so that they could see the extent of the damage and bring in their own independent surveyor if necessary. Herring & Co`s report when considered together with the evidence of Dr Rintoul clearly substantiated the claim of the plaintiffs that 93,748 yards from the 121 cases were damaged by sea water.
It must also be borne in mind that when the first defendants received the plaintiffs` claim based on the Herring report, they did not question it, challenge it or call for a further survey of their own. Furthermore, the first defendants were fully aware of the standard practice applicable in the survey of damaged cargo in Singapore. The external examination is always made at the PSA godown and detailed examination at the consignee`s premises. As stated earlier, the first defendants were just not interested in the matter. If they were they should have taken steps to be present at both surveys. In my judgment, the report by Herring & Co on the Lars cargo, which report I accepted as true, was under the circumstances of the case, conclusive evidence that the said cargo was damaged by sea water.
I accepted the evidence of Capt Rivers and agreed with his opinion, for the reasons given by him, that the 121 cases were damaged by sea water before they were offloaded from the Lars Maersk. If sea water had come into contact with the 121 cases in the lighters in Singapore, some sign of wet stains would have been noted. It was unlikely that wet stains would go unnoticed when the 121 cases were unloaded from the lighters. Furthermore, the plaintiffs` goods were all mixed up with goods of all other consignees in three different lighters in Singapore and as only the plaintiffs` goods were found to be damaged by sea water, it follows that the plaintiffs` goods must have come in contact with sea water before they were put into lighters in Singapore. As the bills of lading did not disclose any external damage or staining of the cases and there was in that regard no letter of indemnity issued by the shippers to the first defendants, it follows that the damage by sea water must have occurred on board the Lars Maersk during transit from Karachi to Singapore.
Counsel for the first plaintiffs submitted that the evidence of Ho Chin Cheow (DW2) who surveyed the goods from the ship to the lighter, the evidence of Lim Teck Whatt (DW3) who was the surveyor when the goods were carried from the lighter into the PSA godown and the PSA inward surveyor`s report all negatived any external stains on the 121 cases. The evidence showed that Ho was the only survey clerk on board the Lars Maersk. He had to note the damage, that is, breakages, tears and stains when the goods were being discharged into two lighters simultaneously and from different hatches. He made the most perfunctory inspection of the goods for stains. As regards Lim who was the surveyor on the wharf when the goods were being taken out of the lighter and carried into the PSA godown, again he was the only surveyor who had to take note of goods coming out of two lighters. Most of the time he was in the godown surveying the damaged goods which were brought into the godown on separate pallets. The separation of the damaged from the undamaged goods was done by the port labourers on the wharf apron and they were more concerned with separating the broken cases and torn bales from the unbroken cases and untorn bales. They were not looking for external stains. The same applies to the PSA surveyor. The fact that these three persons did not record stains in their reports does not go to prove that the contents of the cases were not stained by sea water.
Counsel for the first defendants submitted that there was no certainty of whether the dry sea water stains were or were not on the cases at Karachi; that the goods were packed in second-hand cases and that the plaintiffs must show that when the goods arrived in Singapore, the exterior of the cases showed damage of the kind that would not have been apparent at the port of loading. In my judgment the plaintiffs were perfectly entitled to rely on the bill of lading and if it was the first defendants` case that the goods were damaged before shipment, it was for them to prove it.
As stated earlier, there being no other evidence of the condition of the contents of the 121 cases, the Herrings report was conclusive evidence that the said 121 cases which arrived on the Lars Maersk were damaged by sea water. In my judgment, on the evidence in this case, it was more probable than not, that the sea water damage occurred when the goods were on board the Lars Maersk.
As regards the monetary loss suffered by the plaintiffs in respect of the Lars cargo, counsel for the first defendants submitted that there was no evidence as to how the surveyor from Herrings arrived at 50% damage and also that the plaintiffs had not shown at what price they sold these damaged goods. The plaintiffs were claiming 65% damage and one of them, namely Abdul Majid, was in the witness box for two days and not one question was put to him to challenge his claim of 65%. The assessment of 50% damage was quite obviously based on the extent of damage the surveyor from Herrings saw with his own eyes and this was borne out by the evidence of Capt Rivers who explained the method by which Herrings normally assessed the value of damaged cargo. I found no reason for rejecting the assessment of 50% damage certified by Herring`s surveyor and I accepted it as correct. The plaintiffs had given evidence of the sound value of their goods which was not challenged. They were therefore awarded 50% of the sound value of the Lars cargo and this amounted to $56,298.80. They were also awarded interest at 8% per annum from 7 October 1968.
As regards the Jens cargo, there was overwhelming evidence and it was freely admitted by the second defendants and corroborated by the PSA survey report that rain fell on the goods while they were in the lighters in Singapore. Counsel for the second defendants submitted that the second defendants were not liable on two grounds: First, he contended that as the plaintiffs` pleading alleged that the damage was caused by sea water and there was no evidence whatsoever that the damage was caused by sea water, the plaintiffs could not succeed. The second ground on which liability was denied was that there was very heavy rain on the relevant dates and that in the circumstances the plaintiffs could not succeed unless they proved negligence on the part of the second defendants. Counsel submitted that there was `not one scintilla of evidence in this case` that the second defendants had been negligent. Counsel claimed that such a busy port as Singapore could not do its work if work has to stop every time dark clouds appeared on the horizon.
As regards the first submission of counsel for the second defendants, the claim against his clients was based on breach of duty and as far as their liability was concerned, it did not matter whether the goods were damaged by sea water or rain water. The crucial point was that the goods had been damaged by water while in their custody. Furthermore counsel for the plaintiffs applied to amend para 13 of his statement of claim by striking out the word `sea`. I did not consider this necessary. Had it been necessary I would have allowed the amendment. The real question was, as far as the second defendants were concerned, whether or not there had been a breach of duty on their part. The second defendants, as sub- bailees of the plaintiffs` goods were under a duty to take care of them during the time the goods were in their physical possession and to deliver them in the same order and condition in which they had received them. By allowing the goods to get wet, they were clearly in breach of this duty. In my opinion the unprecedented rain during the relevant period and the sudden showers which fell when the goods were in the lighters did not absolve the second defendants from liability. Had they been fully prepared and vigilant - and they should have been because they knew that there was continuous rain over the relevant period, the goods would not have got wet when they were in their custody. The fact that it took half an hour to shelter the goods in two lighters when rain came speaks for itself. In my opinion the goods could have been guarded against damage by rain water by the crew of the lighters by the exercise of reasonable care and precaution. I rejected the defence of `act of God` raised by counsel for the second defendants in his submissions because it had no application in the circumstances of this case. In my judgment, the second defendants were clearly in breach of duty and were therefore liable for the damage caused to the plaintiffs` goods ex Jens Maersk.
As regards the monetary loss to the plaintiffs in respect of their Jens cargo, it was again submitted by both defendants that there was neither evidence of the extent of the damage nor as to the amount the damaged goods fetched when sold by the plaintiffs. The plaintiff Abdul Majid stated in his evidence that 93,600 yards of cloth contained in 65 bales were damaged. The Anglo-American survey report at Bundle C p 170 confirms that 65 bales were damaged. Abdul Majid also stated that 5,592 yards of fancy shirting were damaged. He stated that this material was measured by his staff at his premises at 88 High Street, Singapore. He also claimed $147.50 for four pieces of metallic fancy shirting which was short delivered. All this evidence was not challenged by either the first defendants or the second defendants. Here again, the plaintiffs` claim was for 65% damage in respect of the damaged material. Abdul Majid was not questioned on this figure. As the plaintiffs had also claimed 65% damage in respect of the Lars cargo which had in fact been examined by Herring & Co who were able to certify only 50% damage, which assessment I accepted as correct, I was of the opinion that on the same basis it was fair and reasonable in the circumstances to allow the plaintiffs only 50% damage in respect of the Jens cargo instead of the 65% damage claimed by them. Accordingly the plaintiffs were entitled to $26,845 as damages in respect of their Jens cargo. They were also entitled to interest at 8% per annum from 7 October 1968.
As the second defendants were sub-bailees for reward of the plaintiffs` Jens cargo, they were both on principle and authority liable for the damage caused to the plaintiffs` goods. The principal modern authority as to the liability of a sub-bailee to the first bailor is 
 Morris v CW Martin & Sons 
 
[1966] 1 QB 716
 where a mink stole sent by the plaintiff to a furrier to be cleaned was, with the consent of the plaintiff, sent on to the defendants as cleaning specialists for them to clean it under a contract between them and the furrier. The mink stole was stolen by a servant of the defendants whose duty it was to clean it. It was held that the defendants had a non-contractual liability to the plaintiffs. Lord Denning MR after citing a passage from Pollock and Wrighton 
 Possession 
, said at p 729: 
 
By which I take it that if the subbailment is for reward, the sub-bailee owes to the owner all the duties of a bailee for reward: and the owner can sue the sub-bailee direct for loss or damage to the goods; and the sub-bailee (unless he is protected by any exempting conditions) is liable unless can prove that the loss or damage occurred without his fault or that of his servants.
 
 
 
Diplock LJ said at p 731: 
 
Duties at common law are owed by one person to another only if there exists a relationship between them which the common law recognises as giving rise to such duty. One of such recognised relationships is created by the voluntary taking into custody of goods which are the property of another. By voluntarily accepting from Beder the custody of a fur which they knew to be the property of a customer of his, they brought into existence between the plaintiff and themselves the relationship of bailor and bailee by subbailment. The legal relationship of bailor and bailee of a chattel can exist independently of any contract ...
 
 
 
Salmon LJ said at p 737: 
 
When the defendants received the plaintiff`s mink stole from the furrier, Beder, for cleaning, they knew that this stole did not belong to him but to one of the customers. They did not know the customer`s name. Nevertheless by taking the fur into their possession in these circumstances they became bailees to the plaintiff for reward.

. In that case two cases of clocks were shipped from Hamburg for delivery to the plaintiffs at Sydney. On arrival of the ship at Sydney the goods were unloaded and stacked into a shed on the wharf by the defendants who were the ship`s agents and stevedores. When the plaintiffs` agents sought to take delivery of the two cases, one was missing and was never found. The plaintiffs sued the defendants for damages on grounds of negligence. On the question whether the defendants owed the plaintiffs a duty of care as bailees, it not being contested that if the defendants had exercised reasonable care the loss would not have occurred, it was held that although there was no contractual relation or attornment between the defendants and the plaintiffs the defendants by voluntarily taking possession of the plaintiffs` goods assumed an obligation to take due care of them and were liable to the plaintiffs for the failure to do so. Lord Pearson who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee, after reviewing the authorities, observed at p 1270: 
 
Both on principle and on old as well as recent authority it is clear that although there was no contract or attornment between the plaintiffs and the defendants, the defendants by voluntarily taking possession of the plaintiffs` goods in the circumstances assumed an obligation to take due care of them and are liable to the plaintiffs for their failure to do so (as found by the trial judge). The obligation is at any rate the same as that of a bailee, whether or not it can with strict accuracy be described as being the obligation of a bailee. In a case such as this the obligation is created by the delivery and assumption of possession under a sub bailment. In the English courts the word `bailment` has acquired a meaning wide enough to include this case. It may not have acquired such a wide meaning in the Australian courts. It is to be observed, however, that there is no express reference to bailment in count 3 of the particulars of claim on which the plaintiff succeeded. On a reasonable construction of that count this case falls within it. The plaintiffs have rightly succeeded in their action.
 
 
 
The second defendants were also liable on another ground to make good the loss suffered by the plaintiffs. Independently of any bailment, the second defendants as lighterers owed the plaintiffs a duty of care under the well-known doctrine of 
 Donoghue 
 
 v Stevenson 
 
[1932] AC 562
 by virtue of their proximity to the goods. This is clear from the decision in 
 Lee Cooper v CH Jenkins & Sons 
 
[1967] 2 QB 1
. In that case the plaintiffs, a firm in England, ordered goods from New York. When the goods arrived in England, the plaintiffs instructed the Anglo-Overseas Transport Co who carried on business as shipping, forwarding and customs agents in London, to clear the goods through the customs and place them in a warehouse pending shipment to Eire. Anglo-Overseas in turn instructed the defendants, transport contractors, to provide a vehicle to collect the plaintiffs` 38 cartons of goods from the docks and to deliver them to the Anglo-Overseas Transport warehouse five or six miles away. The defendants` driver collected the goods from the dock but, when some three miles from the warehouse, he left the lorry, unattended and unlocked, on the road and went into a cafe for a cup of tea. The lorry was stolen and when recovered was found to contain only 19 cartons. In an action by the plaintiffs against the defendants for loss of goods it was held that since the defendants knew that the goods were the plaintiffs`, they owed to the plaintiffs a duty of care in respect of them and since, in the circumstances, the defendants could reasonably have foreseen the loss which in fact occurred, they were liable to the plaintiffs for the value of the stolen goods. Marshall J in considering whether the doctrine in 
 Donoghue v Stevenson 
 applied to the facts of the case, said at p 9: 
 
The test is not one of physical proximity but of foresight. Care must be taken to avoid acts or omissions which can be reasonably foreseen would be likely to injure your neighbour, who is a person who should be reasonably in contemplation as being so affected when directing the mind to the acts or omissions called in question.
 
 
 
In the present case the second defendants were bailees for reward of the plaintiffs` goods. They knew from an extended period of dealings with the first defendants` local agents, that the goods which were unloaded from the Jens Maersk and placed in their lighters, belonged to consignees and not to the first defendants or their local agents. They may not have known the names of the consignees but that in my opinion is irrelevant. In my judgment, on the facts of this case, the plaintiffs come within the ambit of the above mentioned test. The defendants owed a duty of care to the consignees of the goods, ie the plaintiffs. That duty was breached by serious negligence which resulted in loss to the plaintiffs. The second defendants must make good the loss suffered by the plaintiffs.
Were the plaintiffs entitled to recover damages from the first defendants in respect of the Jens cargo? That was the next question that I had to decide. Counsel for the first defendants submitted that the second defendants were independent contractors; that the first defendants were not responsible for the lighterage phase and that the contention that the first defendants were liable for the damage to the Jens cargo was untenable. Counsel further submitted that the plaintiffs could only succeed against the first defendants under the Hague Rules; that these Rules had not been proved to apply in this case because there was no evidence in this case of Pakistan law and that furthermore it has never been expressly decided that the ship is responsible for the lighterage phase under the Hague Rules, assuming that they applied.
The Hague Rules have been adopted by Pakistan by virtue of the Indian Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1925 which appears in Pakistan`s Statute Book with `Pakistan` substituted for `British India`. See Carver on 
 Carriage by Sea 
, 12th Edn vol 2, p 1522, art 1619 and the note at the bottom of the page. See also the Pakistan Supreme Court case of 
 East & West Steamship Co v Hossain Brothers 
 [1968] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 145.
It was contended that the transit covered by the bill of lading and the carrier`s responsibility for the due performance of his contract had come to an end when the goods were discharged into the lighters at Singapore and that the Hague Rules did not apply after that stage. In my view, the obligations of the first defendants did not cease when the goods were discharged into lighters. No doubt it is possible to terminate the carrier`s obligations at this point, by including an appropriate stipulation in the bill of lading, but I can see nothing to that effect in the present bills of lading. There are, it is true, certain provisions which purport to exclude the carrier`s liability for loss or damage whilst the goods are in lighters. See cll 6, 10, 11 and 26. These are however mere exempting clauses. Their function is to protect the first defendants from liabilities which would otherwise have fallen on them by virtue of their possession of the goods under the contract of carriage, and they do not go so far as to provide that whilst the goods are in the lighters they are not at all in the carrier`s possession under the contract. This being so, the carrier`s primary obligation to deliver the goods to the consignee - an obligation created by the `shipped` clause on the front of the bill of lading - remained in force throughout the period when the goods were in the lighters. Accordingly, the first defendants still retained responsibility for the goods whilst they were in the lighters.
The next question that I had to consider was, to what extent, if any, were these responsibilities modified by the Hague Rules and the exempting provisions of the bill of lading. The Rules apply to all operations which the carrier has undertaken to perform in relation to `loading, handling, carriage, custody, care, stowage discharge` of the goods. It follows that no matter what obligations the carrier may undertake to perform at the port of destination, the Rules cannot continue to apply after the completion of `discharge`. This was emphasised by Devlin J in 
 Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co v Adamastes Shipping Co 
 
[1957] 2 QB 233
 at p 251 when he said: 
 
The Act is concerned (see s 1(e)) with the period beginning with the loading and ending with the discharging of the goods.
 
 
 
And Wright J in the earlier case of 
 Gosse Millard 
 
 v Canadian Government Merchant Marine 
 
[1927] 2 KB 432
 expressed a similar view when he said, at p 434: 
 
The word `discharge` is used, I think, in place of the word `deliver` because the period of responsibility to which the Act and the Rules apply (Art I(e) ) ends when they (the goods) are discharged from the ship.
 
 
 
I now come to the most difficult question of law that arose in this case and related to it were two other questions which were equally crucial. What is meant by the word `discharge`? When was the discharge of the goods completed in this case? Was the lighterage phase a part of the discharge operation? In this connection the following comment is found in Scrutton on 
 Charterparties 
, 17th Edn (1964) at p 409: 
 
It has not yet been decided whether the use of the word `ship` has the effect of excluding from the `carriage of goods by sea` to which the Rules relate the lightering of goods out to a ship at the port of loading or their removal to shore by lighter at the port of discharge. If the carrier undertakes to perform these operations it seems possible that they might be considered as part of loading and discharging respectively. If he does not, it seems probable that the Rules would have no application to these operations: the terms of Art I(d) lend some support to this view.
 
 
 
In the old days discharge meant `release of the goods from the tackles of the ship` or `free from the ship`s tackles`. That is not so now. As was observed by Devlin J in 
 Pyrene Co 
 
 v Scindia Navigation Co 
 
[1954] 2 QB 402
 at p 419, `... the ship`s rail has lost much of its nineteenth century significance ...` This observation has been amply borne out by several later cases.
Although the word `discharge` may, as observed by Wright J, appear at first sight to have been used in place of the word `deliver`, it has been shown in a later case that the persons responsible for the drafting of the Hague Rules used the word `discharge` deliberately and they did so in order to distinguish between the obligations which the shipowner undertakes in his capacity as carrier by sea and those which rest upon him after the conclusion of the sea carriage simply because he is in possession of the goods. This distinction was clearly brought out by Wee Chong Jin CJ in his judgment in 
 Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co v Rambler Cycle Co 
 
 
 
[1964] MLJ 443
  where he stated at p 450: 
 
... The operation of discharge is different from the operation of delivery. If the intention and object of the Hague Rules were to also provide for the responsibilities and liabilities, rights and immunities of a carrier in relation to the delivery of goods under a contract of carriage of goods by sea to which the Hague Rules apply, nothing would have been simpler than to insert the word `delivery` after `discharge` in Art II ...
 
 
 
It was held in that case by the Federal Court of Malaysia that as the goods had been discharged from the ship and placed in storage in a godown, the discharge operation was clearly over and that the liability of the carrier which it was sought to enforce for wrong delivery, arose after the expiration of the period during which the Hague Rules applied.
The earliest case, after the coming into operation of the Hague Rules, which throws some light on the meaning of `discharge`, as used in the said Rules, is 
 Goodwin, Ferreira & Co 
 
 v Lamport & Holt 
 [1929] 2 All ER Rep 623. This case concerned a consignment of cotton yarn which had been safely placed by the ship`s tackles into a lighter at the port of destination. Following that, a case containing heavy iron pipes was raised from the hold by the ship`s tackles to be put into the same lighter. While being lowered the bottom of the case broke and the pipes fell into the lighter and holed it. Sea water entered and damaged the cotton yarn. Roche J held that the carrier was liable because the cotton yarn had not been `discharged` from the ship within the meaning of the Hague Rules. He said, at p 625: 
 
In my judgment, the discharge of these goods was not finished when they were put into a lighter when other goods were being discharged into the same lighter to make up the load which was to start for the shore. When it is contemplated that these goods are to form the lighter load with other goods, the discharge of the goods themselves within the meaning of Art I(e) and Art II in the schedule to the Act of 1924, is, in judgment, going on so long as other goods are being raised into the lighter and stowed in the lighter alongside or on top of them.
 
 
 
This does not appear to be a very convincing case but it shows that the Hague Rules have been applied to a situation where the goods had been released from the ship`s tackles. The decision was referred to, apparently with approval, by Devlin J in
 Pyrene v Scindia Navigation Co 
supra, where he stated, at p 418: 
 
If loading under the Rules does not begin before the ship`s rail, by parity of reasoning, discharging should end at the ship`s rail; but so to hold would be contrary to the decision of Roche J in 
 Goodwin, Ferreira & Co v Lamport & Holt.
 
 
 
There are two other reported cases which throw some light on the meaning of `discharge`. First, there is the decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
 East & West Steamship Co v Hossain Brothers, 
 supra, which was cited by counsel for the plaintiffs. In this case the problem raised was somewhat similar to the one raised in the present case. The parties had agreed that the damage was caused when the goods were in a lighter after discharge from a vessel at Chittagong. Evidence was given that the lighter had no fixed cover to protect the cargo. The shipowner contended that under the conditions of the bills of lading, the liability ceased once the goods were `free of ship`s tackle`; that, under art I(e) of the Hague Rules, sea transit ended as soon as goods were put into the lighter; and further, that the damage occurred outside the period of carriage by sea. The plaintiff`s claim was allowed by the subordinate judge and the defendant`s appeal was dismissed by the Pakistan High Court. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court. It was held by the Pakistan Supreme Court that the carriage of goods under the Hague Rules did not cease when the goods were discharged from the ship and placed in the lighter; that the shipowner was under a duty to see that the lighter was seaworthy and properly equipped for the purpose; that the lighter was not properly equipped for reception of the goods and therefore the shipowner was guilty of lack of due diligence; that the exception clauses in the bills of lading were limited to losses or damage where there was no negligence on the part of the shipowner and that if there was a clause exempting the shipowner from liability for loss or damage resulting from negligence it would have been null and void under art Ill of the Hague Rules.
The other case where the meaning of `discharge` was in issue is 
 Falconbridge 
 
 Nikel Mines v Chimo Shipping 
 [1969] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 277 a decision of the Canadian Exchequer Court. In this case, a tractor and a generating set which were unloaded from a steamer on to a barge to take them ashore, fell overboard from the barge and sank. The plaintiffs as owners claimed damages from the defendant carriers alleging negligence and breach of contract to deliver the equipment. The defendants denied liability. It was held by the court that the cargo slid off the barge while in the custody of the defendants; that the defendants were negligent in failing to ensure that the equipment was adequately secured and that as the defendants carried barges for use in lightering cargo and were bound to lighter the goods by the contract of carriage, the lightering should be considered as a part of the discharging operation and the Rules should apply to it. Kerr J said, at p 296: 
 
In the present case the carrier carried barges on the Crosbie for use in lightering cargo from that ship to shore, and it used the barges for that purpose. It was bound to lighter the goods by its contract of carriage. In that situation, it is my view that the Rules applied to the lightering. The lightering should be considered as a part of the discharging operation, but even if the discharging of the goods concerned from the Crosbie was completed when they were put on the barge, the barge was a ship used by the carrier in performing its obligation to carry the goods by water under the contract of carriage covered by the bill of lading and consequently, in my view, the Rules applied to that portion of the carriage.
 
 
 
In the present case the first defendants` obligations included the operation of `discharge`. The Hague Rules make them liable for losses sustained during that operation. The cases show that `discharge` no longer means `release of the goods from the tackle of the vessel named in the bill of lading`. In my judgment, both on principle and authority, the line should be drawn, not when the goods leave the ship, but when the carriage by sea is concluded. The first defendants discharged the goods into lighters for some reason best known to them. They apparently did so to suit their own convenience. In those circumstances, in my opinion, the carriage by sea had not yet been concluded when the goods were in the lighters and were damaged by rain water. In my judgment the Hague Rules continued to apply whilst the goods were in the lighters. And under art III r 2 the first defendants were under a duty to see that the lighters were seaworthy, properly equipped and properly handled. There was a clear duty to `properly and carefully care for` the goods while they were in the lighters. As the damage resulted from lack of care on the part of the lightermen, the first defendants were liable for the damage.
As regards the submission of counsel for the first defendants that his clients were not liable because it has never been expressly decided that a ship is responsible for the lighterage phase under the Hague Rules, it may be that there is no previous decision fitting the facts of this case, but that in my opinion is no answer. Where the court finds that in order to do justice between the parties, the facts warrant the breaking of new ground and the law permits it the court should not hesitate to do its duty.
In my judgment the Hague Rules continued to apply whilst the goods were in the lighters and therefore I did not consider it necessary to examine the question whether the exceptions printed on the back of the bills excluded the first defendants` liability for losses suffered during lighterage. If the exceptions are wider than those conferred by the Rules, they are nullified by art IIIA r 8.
The final question which I had to decide in this case was, whether the first defendants were entitled to an indemnity from the second defendants in respect of all the monies which the first defendants were called upon to pay to the plaintiffs in respect of the Jens cargo. In my opinion they were so entitled, on the authority of 
 The Winkfield 
 [1902] P 42 and 
 Gilchrist Watt v York Products 
.
It was for these reasons that the following judgments were entered in this case:
 
 
(1) Judgment for the plaintiffs against the first defendants in respect of the Lars cargo for $56,298.80 and interest thereon at 8% per annum from 7 October 1968 to date of judgment and costs as taxed. 
 
(2) Judgment for plaintiffs against the first and second defendants in respect of the Jens cargo for $26,845 and interest thereon at 8% per annum from 7 October 1968 to date of judgment and costs as taxed. 
 
(3) Judgment for the first defendants against the second defendants in respect of all moneys paid by them to the plaintiffs in respect of the Jens cargo and costs as taxed. 
 
(4) The plaintiffs` claim against the second defendants in respect of the Lars cargo was dismissed with costs.

Whether independent contractor liable in damages to workman of another independent contractor working on the same premises

Whether failure to remove dangerous scaffolding despite warnings amounted to a breach of duty
 
This appeal poses the question whether an independent contractor responsible for the erection of scaffolding in the front of a high building is liable in damages to the workman of another independent contractor responsible for the erection of scaffolding at the back of the same building in respect of injuries suffered by the workman whilst using the scaffolding in front which was in a dangerous condition and collapsed, as a consequence, when so used.
The appellants claimed an indemnity in the district court under s 20(b) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 130, 1970 Ed) for compensation amounting to $3,327.96 paid by them as his principals under s 19(1) thereof from the respondents on the ground that they were entitled to be so indemnified if the respondents were, in fact, under a legal liability in negligence to pay damages for the injuries sustained by the workman concerned.
The district judge found that there was no evidence that the respondents knew that the appellants` workers or any others apart from their own workers, for whom the scaffolding was constructed, used the scaffolding in front. He found as a fact that `the appellants` contract was confined to the back of the building while the respondents` was at the front of the building ... There was no evidence of any restriction or authority to other workers not to use or to use the scaffolding in the front of the building`.
The district judge accordingly held that a duty of care did not extend to the workman, that there was accordingly no breach of duty to take reasonable care towards him and that in the circumstances there was no negligence on the part of the defendants.
The architects` site representative and clerk of works, Ng Meo Ling (PW3), said that there was no restriction on the use of the respondents` scaffolding by other workers on the site. He recommended the removal or repair of this scaffolding just over a week before its collapse on the occasion when the workman of the appellants was injured. He said that during that week or more no workman used the front scaffolding but he added that workmen `were using the other section`.
The appellants` contracts supervisor, Ang (PW2), said that he had only warned the workman`s immediate employer that the scaffolding in question was dangerous. There was no evidence that he had warned the workman himself or that the workman himself knew of this danger. Counsel for the respondents had earlier asked this witness a pertinent question in cross-examination as follows: 
 
Q: Did you tell the (appellants`) workmen that the scaffolding was dangerous and no attempt should be made to climb it?
 
 
 
Why this question was put when the stand taken by the respondents was that the appellants or their workmen had no right or business to use the scaffolding of the respondents in front is not clear.
The respondents gave no evidence during their defence to show that the right to use their scaffolding was confined to their own workmen or at least, that others were excluded. In fact no evidence was given by the defence at all except to show that their scaffolding was in a dangerous structural condition, a fact which had already been established at the close of the plaintiffs` case.
It is clear from all the evidence that both the appellants and the respondents and their respective workmen were invitees of the hotel whilst engaged in carrying out their respective tiling contracts relating to the outer walls of the building. None of them were accordingly trespassers in respect of the building and they had a right to be there even though some of the scaffoldings at the rear, according to the clerk of works, Ng, were erected and maintained by the appellants and the scaffolding in front was maintained by the respondents. This was the scaffolding which collapsed. These were the only two contractors who put up scaffoldings and it follows that the respondents also put up scaffoldings at the back (see also para 3 of exh P2).
Possession or control of any particular part of the building was not therefore shown to be exclusively in one or the other alone of these contractors.
When an invitee creates a danger (whilst fulfilling his contractual duties) to which other invitees to the building are exposed there is a duty on his part to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances to prevent such others from coming to harm as a result of the danger he has himself created and for which he is responsible.
A person who, though not an occupier of premises, actually creates a danger and has reason to expect that other persons will be lawfully on the premises during the existence of that danger owes them a duty to take reasonable care. This duty `arises quite independently of the occupation of premises. It does not arise out of any invitation or licence`. (vide Bankes LJ in 
 Kimber v Gas Light & Code 
 [1918] 1 KB 445).
Furthermore, as Atkinson J in 
 Hawkins 
 
 v Thames Stevedore Co 
 [1936] 2 All ER 472 at page 476 held `there is also a common law obligation upon one invitee working upon the premises to warn another invitee working there of any danger which he may have created, and for which he is responsible`.
That case involved a breach of statutory duties as well but I accept the principle cited so far as negligence at common law is concerned as between invitees, one of whom creates a dangerous situation.
As Lord Denning said in 
 Miller 
 
 v South of Scotland Electricity Board 
 1958 SC (HL) 37 at p 37: 
 
We are not here concerned with the obligations of occupiers of land - as occupiers - or with the special rules applicable to trespassers thereon. We are concerned with the duty of care that is owed by a person doing work - or anything else - on land: and that duty is today best found by resort to the general principle enunciated by Lord Atkin in 
 Donoghue
 
 v Stevenson
. Such a person - be he occupier, contractor or anyone else - owes a duty to all persons who are so closely and directly affected by his work that he ought reasonably to have them in contemplation when he is directing his mind to the task.
 
 
 
The principle enunciated by Lord Atkin in 
 Donoghue 
 
 v Stevenson 
 
[1932] AC 562
 at p 580 therefore can properly be invoked in support of the duty of care ordinarily owed by a non-occupier to others lawfully on the premises. Lord Atkin said: 
 
The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer`s question: Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellants laid special emphasis on this principle in support of the contention that the district judge erred in law in finding that the respondents did not owe the workman any duty to take care. He contended that the aforesaid rule applied so as to make the respondents liable in damages for the workman`s injuries through their negligence.
Counsel for the respondents replied to the effect that the particular relationship between the workman and the respondents did not create a duty of care. He also contended that the workman knew of the defects in the scaffolding by inspection and therefore voluntarily undertook the risk with full knowledge of the consequences of what he was doing. He further submitted that the workman was a trespasser. He also said that there was no common interest between the injured workman and the respondents.
As I have already stated, there was no evidence that the workman had been warned or that he undertook the risk of standing on the scaffolding with such knowledge as to exonerate the respondents from their duty towards him as contractors engaged in a common hotel project, together with the appellants of laying mosaic tiles on the outer walls of the Hilton Hotel building. They were all fellow-invitees at the Hotel during the performance of their tiling contracts. The workman was not a trespasser whilst on the premises and there was no evidence that he was excluded from the use of the respondents scaffolding in any way nor were the appellants` contracts` supervisor or the clerk of works for the whole project so excluded from the scaffolding erected by the other. Nor, significantly, did anyone on behalf of the respondents say so.
Finally the appellants were under no obligation in a claim such as this to give any notice under reg 13 to the respondents (who were outside the scope of s 19(2)) nor was any question requiring determination of the amount payable ever referred to arbitration at the instance of the respondents as was open to them under s 20(b).
In my judgment, the respondents by their failure to repair or remove their dangerous scaffolding after being repeatedly warned by the architect of the hotel project to do so created a situation which they could reasonably foresee would be likely to injure persons like the workman in question who clearly fell within the proximity rule.
The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs.

Hawker picking up knife when public officer tried to seize his goods Whether fine of $200 manifestly inadequate

Section 506 Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Rev Ed)
 
There is really no mitigating circumstance in this particular case. Although the respondent was trying to earn a living, it must have been well known to him that he could not hawk without a licence and therefore doing something unlawful. The complainant was merely doing what his duties required him to do, namely, preventing persons like the respondent from hawking without a licence. It is one thing trying to earn a living by hawking in spite of a law which says it cannot be done without a licence. That is wrong, and normally an offender would be punished, if found guilty, by a fine. But it is quite another thing if a public officer, in the carrying out of his duties, is prevented by a person who is already guilty of a statutory criminal offence, not only from carrying out his duties, but also is threatened in the way the respondent threatened him.
Now the threat was to cause injury to the complainant because the respondent picked up a dangerous weapon; he picked up a knife and beyond doubt anyone faced with the respondent holding that knife near to him while trying to do his duty must have been gravely alarmed. But the respondent`s actions went further than that: when stopped, instead of realising that the law had to be enforced, when another attempt was made to seize the goods, in this case mere sugar cane water which the respondent was attempting to sell, the respondent again picked up another knife.
Now quite obviously the magistrate was wrong in finding that the respondent picked up the knife merely to warn the complainant not to seize the goods and that he did not at any time attempt to hurt the complainant. The fact that when the complainant moved up towards where the respondent was, the respondent picked up the knife, pointed it at the complainant and used the words that he used is evidence that an attempt had commenced. It can also be inferred from his actions and the words uttered that it was not only a warning to the complainant but it was a warning accompanied by a threat that: `If you do it, you see I have got a knife in my hand which I will use.`
This sort of offence under our criminal law carries with it a term of imprisonment up to a maximum of two years, and if it is accompanied by a threat to cause grievous hurt it can even extend to seven years. Of course if one picks up a knife and threatens harm to another, then the threat is to cause grievous hurt because a knife can cause grievous hurt.
In those circumstances, obviously a fine of $200 is manifestly inadequate. Public interest comes in, but the real gravamen of the offence are the very facts themselves: the fact that he picked up one knife and, when stopped, picked up another knife again. No court can ignore it and say that he was so upset because he had lost his means of livelihood. All he had lost was the prospect of continuing to sell iced sugar cane water on that day - morning, afternoon or night - but he could continue to earn a livelihood in any other way, a thousand other ways.
In those circumstances, on the facts of this case, the sentence must be varied. But I will temper it with mercy in his case, and I hope the message will go to those who hawk in those circumstances: that if they do try to intimidate public servants they are almost certainly bound to be sent to prison, that it will be a real deterrent.
So I will impose a term of imprisonment for one week, besides the fine.
 Order accordingly",1973-11-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

CHOOR SINGH J
 The appeals of the three appellants in this case depend substantially on the same facts and involve the same questions of law. Their appeals require a decision on the construction and true effect of s 10(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed) which provides that `every proceeding in the High Court and all business arising thereout shall, save as otherwise provided by any written law for the time being in force, be heard and disposed of before a single judge`. One of the written laws which provides otherwise is s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) which lays down that `in all cases where the accused is charged with an offence in respect of which punishment of death is authorised by law, the accused shall be tried by a court consisting of two judges of the High Court, one of whom shall be the presiding judge.` Based on these provisions of the law certain questions have been raised as affecting the validity of the trial and the convictions of the three appellants.
 The main question of law raised is, whether or not, a court, consisting of two judges of the High Court, constituted under s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which proceeds to hear a charge in respect of an offence punishable with death, can, at the close of the prosecution case, substitute for the said charge a charge in respect of an offence punishable with imprisonment and proceed to bear the defence of the accused on the substituted charge.
 In order to examine this question of law, it is necessary to trace, in the briefest manner possible, the course of the proceedings before the trial court in this case. The trial of the three appellants commenced before a court of two judges of the High Court, constituted under s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code. There were three charges against each of the appellants alleging that they had in furtherance of their common intention:
(a) first, abducted one Ong Beang Leck at 7.30pm on 24 May 1968 with intent to hold him for ransom, an offence punishable under s 3 of the Punishment of Kidnapping Ordinance 1961; 
(b) secondly, that all three of them abducted the said Ong Beang Leck at the same time on the same date in order that the said Ong Beang Leck may be murdered, an offence punishable under s 364 of the Penal Code; and 
(c) thirdly, that they had committed murder by causing the death of the said Ong Beang Leck, an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code. The time alleged in the third charge was `some time between 7.30pm and 12 midnight` on the same day, that is after they had abducted him.
 The offences mentioned in the first and second charges are punishable with death or imprisonment for life and the offence mentioned in the third charge is punishable with death. As all the three offences carry the death penalty, the court was, as required, constituted in accordance with the provisions of s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code and was therefore competent to try the appellants on the three charges which they faced.
 All the three appellants claimed trial on all the three charges and the prosecution proceeded to call their evidence in support of the charges. At the close of the prosecution case, the court found that the prosecution had made out a case against all the three appellants on the second and third charges which if unrebutted would warrant their conviction; that the prosecution had failed to make out such a case against all three appellants on the first charge and that a prima facie case of extortion in contravention of s 386 of the Penal Code had been made out against all of them. The presiding judge, after giving the court`s reasons for coming to this decision, observed: 
... We therefore do not propose to call upon the accused for their defence on this first charge. But there is evidence before us which makes it a prima facie case of extortion under s 386 of the Penal Code, and we propose to frame a new charge in substitution of the former one. There will be a formal verdict of acquittal on the first charge. All three accused are acquitted on the first charge but there is a new charge which we have framed in substitution.
 The following charge was then read out and explained to all the appellants: 
... You are charged that you, between 26 May 1968 and 5 June 1968 together with two other persons, namely, Richard Lai Choon Seng and Chow Siew Cheong, alias Ah Cheong, in furtherance of the common intention of you all committed extortion by putting one Ong Yew Kee in fear of grievous hurt being caused to Ong Beang Lek, and thereby dishonestly induced the said Ong Yew Kee to deliver to you $20,000 an offence punishable under s 386 of the Penal Code (Cap 119) read with s 34 of the said Code.
 At this stage there was some discussion between the presiding judge and the deputy public prosecutor as to whether this charge was in substitution for the first charge or an additional charge and the court finally ruled that it was an additional charge.
 As all the three appellants claimed trial on this new charge, they were called upon to enter upon their defence on this charge as well as on the second and third charges. In view of the new charge they were given the usual facilities of recalling any witness who had already given evidence for the prosecution and there is no complaint at all in this respect. The trial proceeded and at its conclusion all three appellants were convicted on all three charges. They were sentenced to death on the charges of murder and kidnapping for murder and the sentence on the charge of extortion was suspended.
 On these facts, it is contended on behalf of the appellants that the trial court had no jurisdiction to try the appellants on the two existing capital charges together with the substituted non-capital charge and that, therefore, the whole trial was a nullity. In support of this contention, the judgment of this court in 
 Chow Kim Hoong v PP 
 
 [1969-1971] SLR 171 is relied upon. In that case this court held that a court of two judges as constituted under s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code has no jurisdiction to try an accused person on two charges, one of which is a charge in respect of a non-capital offence. In that case, from the commencement of the proceedings, one of the charges was in respect of a non-capital offence and in those circumstances this court held that the whole trial was a nullity and ordered a re-trial.
 Reliance is also placed upon a decision of the Court of Appeal of Malaya in 
 Lee Chee Wan v PP 
 
 
[1961] MLJ 62
 where the Malayan Court of Appeal held that the trial of six persons before a jury on two charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder was a nullity because the trial of an accused person on a non-capital charge is to be had before a judge alone. In 
 Lee Chee Wan`s 
 case the non-capital charge of attempted murder was before the jury at the very commencement of the proceedings.
 On the other hand, counsel for the Public Prosecutor contends that the convictions of all the appellants on all the three charges on which they were convicted are valid in law and he relies on the decision in 
 Khalid Panjang & Ors 
 
 v PP 
 
 
[1964] MLJ 67
 which is a decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia concerning jury trials. It was decided in that appeal that at some stage prior to the commencement of a trial in the High Court the question of the mode of the trial must be decided, ie whether it is to be tried by jury or by a judge alone; that the criterion is that contained in s 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides that `in all cases where the punishment of death is authorised by law the accused shall be tried by a jury""; that the only practicable time at which the criterion is to be applied is the commencement of the trial; that once a trial has commenced before a jury it can only be terminated, apart from questions of irregularity and so forth by a verdict of the jury which must be either that the accused person is guilty or not guilty of either the offence with which he was originally charged or any other offence for which he could be convicted on the original charge by reason of the provisions of the Code as a whole.
 The report of the judgment in 
 Khalid Panjang 
 `s case does not reveal the full facts of the case, but it is quite apparent that when the trial commenced there was one charge only - a charge of murder - which required that the trial be by jury. In the course of the trial the charge was amended in the case of three of the appellants and an additional non-capital charge was framed against the other appellant. The Federal Court held that what was done in that case was not legally wrong but expressed the opinion that the addition of the non-capital charge although legally correct was something that was undesirable. In dismissing the appeals of all the appellants, Thomson LP, who delivered the judgment of the court, said, at p 68: 
The effect of what we have said therefore is that we consider the grounds of appeal arising from the amendment of the charge in the case of three appellants and the additional charge in the case of the other one are without substance.
 The Federal Court referred to its earlier decision in 
 Lee Chee Wan & Ors v PP 
, that a trial by jury for two capital offences together with a non-capital offence is a nullity and emphasised that that decision must be read in the light of what the court had just then decided, namely that the time at which the criterion as to the mode of trial is to be applied is the commencement of the trial.
 Counsel for the Public Prosecutor contends, on the strength of 
 Khalid Panjang 
 `s case, that if at the commencement of the trial on a charge in respect of a capital offence, the court is properly constituted and competent to try that charge, then the court is, during the course of the same proceedings, entitled to try the accused person on any lesser charge which, by reason of the provisions of s 156 of the Criminal Procedure Code, it is entitled to substitute for the existing charge or add as an additional charge to the existing charge. Counsel`s submission is that the substituted charge or the additional charge need not be a capital charge; that the criterion as regards the mode of trial, ie whether the trial should be before a court of two judges or before a single judge is to be applied at the commencement of the trial and that once the trial has commenced before a competent court, the accused person can be tried and found guilty on the original charge or any other charge which the court is competent to frame against the accused by reason of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. Counsel argues that in this case, when the trial commenced before a court of two judges, all the charges against all the three appellants were in respect of capital offences; that at the close of the prosecution case the trial court was entitled by virtue of the provisions of s 156 of the Criminal Procedure Code to substitute the charge of extortion in contravention of s 386 of the Penal Code in place of the first charge on which all the three appellants were acquitted; and that there was no question of the competency of the court to try the appellants on this new charge under s 386 of the Penal Code because on the authority of 
 Khalid Panjang 
 `s case that question must be considered at the commencement of the trial.
 Much was made before us, by counsel for the first appellant, of the fact that the appellants were acquitted on the first charge at the close of the prosecution case. Counsel submitted that such acquittal was a final judgment and that from that stage onwards there were new proceedings incorporating a new charge. Although the trial court ruled that the charge under s 386 of the Penal Code was an additional charge, we are of the opinion that in effect and in law it was a charge in substitution for the first charge of kidnapping for ransom; that the substitution took place in the same proceedings and that it is completely wrong to suggest that new proceedings commenced when the charge under s 386 of the Penal Code was framed and explained to the appellants. Furthermore, in our opinion it is immaterial whether the charge under s 386 of the Penal Code was in substitution for the first charge or was an additional charge, because the framing of the said charge against the appellants was well within the powers of the trial court by virtue of the provisions of s 156 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The crucial question however is whether the trial court, after having framed the substituted charge and taken the plea of the appellants on it, was competent to continue the proceedings.
 We find that the position in the present case is similar to what happened in 
 Khalid Panjang 
 `s case. In both cases, when the trial commenced, the court was properly constituted and competent to hear the charge or charges against the accused persons. In 
 Khalid Panjang 
 `s case there was one charge only and it was a charge of murder which required that the trial be by jury. In the present case there were three capital charges which required that the trial be before two judges of the High Court. In both cases, in the course of the trial, a non-capital charge was introduced which charge in both cases was ordinarily triable by a single judge. The Federal Court of Malaysia held that what was done in 
 Khalid Panjang 
 `s case was not legally wrong because the court was entitled to convict the accused `of any other offence for which he could be convicted on the original charge by reason of the provisions of the Code as a whole`.
 In the present case, the trial court being a court of two judges constituted under s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code, was expressly authorised by s 185(3) of the Code to convict the accused `of any lesser offence of which he could have been charged based on the same facts`. Under the circumstances the trial court was in our opinion acting well within its powers in framing the charge of extortion under s 386 of the Penal Code, taking the plea of the appellants on it, hearing their defence and convicting them on the said charge. For these reasons we hold that the point taken on behalf of the appellants fails. We have not been into the merits of their appeal except so far as it was necessary to consider the point of law. We will now hear counsel upon the merits.

WEE CHONG JIN CJ
 A well nourished Chinese 58-year-old widow lived alone in a hut situated right by the sea on a small island, Pulau Ubin, off Singapore. Her nearest neighbour was about 100 yards away. On 23 April 1972 at about 9.30am her dead body was found floating in the sea about 200 yards from Pulau Ubin. She was found clad in a blue striped Chinese blouse but naked below her waist. There were five button spaces on the blouse but only the top one remained as a half button. The other button spaces had bare threads showing.
 An autopsy was performed and the pathologist`s evidence is that death occurred at around midnight of 22 April 1972. There were 15 external injuries on the deceased and these were: 
(1) Multiple bruises over the whole forehead with small abrasion on the left side.
 
(2) Multiple small bruises over the bridge of nose with small abrasions. 
(3) Haemorrhages in both eyes especially on the right side with bruise around the right eye. 
(4) Multiple small bruises and abrasions on the lower lip and chin with laceration on the right corner of lower lip. 
(5) Bruises on left chin. 
(6) A small irregular laceration 0.5cm long on the left side of upper neck. Further down the left side of the lower neck another similar laceration. 
(7) Small bruises on lobe of left ear. 
(8) Right face appears swollen as compared with left face. 
(9) Extensive bruising on the radial side of right wrist 7 [yen ] 5 cms and back of right hand at base of index finger. 
(10) Multiple abrasions and bruises along left forearm wrist and back of left hand, 
(11) Bruise and abrasions on left hip with some linear scratches. 
(12) A group of three rounded bruises about one cm in diameter on the inner side of right knee consistent with finger tip marks. 
(13) Another group of four similar bruises on the inner side of left knee. 
(14) Right elbow shows abraided skin with no vital reactions indicating injury made after death. 
(15) Left elbow shows similar abraided skin without vital reactions.
 His evidence is that some of these external injuries were caused by a blunt object or blunt instrument and that the injuries on the mouth and chin were consistent with the application of a hand with force over the mouth or a combination of a blow to the mouth with a blunt object such as a fist and the application of a hand to the mouth. He said some of the injuries were defensive injuries and some could have occurred through contact with a rough surface like the ground. He said injuries 14 and 15 could have been caused by the dead body knocking on to rocks while floating in the sea.
 He also found fractures of the left second to the fifth rib and of the right second to the sixth rib, at mid-clavicle line anteriorly on both sides. There was also bruising of the pleura but there were no external injuries over the fractured ribs and no free blood flowing in the chest cavity. In his opinion the internal injuries he found were consistent with compression from in front such as someone sitting on the deceased`s chest with force and the deceased lying down on the floor. He was of the opinion that independent of the other injuries the injuries on the ribs were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and that the deceased died through a sudden cardiac arrest because of the pain and shock caused by the simultaneous fracture of the nine ribs. He was positive that the deceased did not die of drowning and that there was no evidence of manual strangulation.
 A detailed examination of the deceased`s hut disclosed that the bedroom was in disorder with two drawers of a cabinet having been forced open and left on the floor. In the kitchen a gold coloured ear-ring, a pin for cleaning ears, three white buttons and two hair clips were found on the floor.
 On 9 February 1973 one Harun bin Ripin was arrested in connection with the deceased`s death. On 10 February 1973 the appellant Mohamed Yasin bin Hussin alias Rosli was also arrested. They were subsequently charged and tried before the High Court consisting of two judges of having caused the death of the deceased in circumstances amounting to the offence of murder. The charge reads as follows: 
That you, 1. Harun bin Ripin
 
2. Mohd Yasin bin Hussin alias Rosli
 
between 10.00pm on 22 April 1972 and 9.30am on 23 April 1972 at no 836-X Pulau Ubin, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, committed murder by causing the death of one Poon Sai Im, and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 At the conclusion of the trial, Harun bin Ripin was acquitted of the offence of murder but was convicted of robbery by night and sentenced to a term of imprisonment and to caning. The appellant was convicted of the offence of murder and sentenced to death. He now appeals against his conviction.
 At the trial, the case for the prosecution against each of the two accused persons depended solely on a statement which each of them had made before a magistrate. The appellant made his statement the day after his arrest. At the trial counsel for each accused objected to its admissibility and in consequence there was a trial within a trial to decide the question of admissibility. After hearing evidence the trial judges admitted in evidence the statements made by both accused. The only relevant statement for the purposes of the present appeal is the statement of the appellant which reads as follows: 
I came here to admit that I was wrong. I had a meeting with two other friends Harun and Maarof. The discussion centred around going to a female Chinese`s house. It was Harun who asked Maarof whether he wanted to go. Maarof did not want to. When he asked me I told him I wanted to. I went to fetch a sampan at about 7.30pm. Harun and I then went to the house of the female Chinese. The female Chinese was about to sleep when we arrived. Harun and I circled the house. The female Chinese was silent and the lights were being dimmed.
 Harun and I then looked for a spot from where we could climb into the house. There was no entrance where I could enter. So I went to disturb the chickens at the chicken coop. The chickens made a lot of noise which woke up the female Chinese who came out with a small light.
 Immediately when she opened the door, Harun jumped at her. The female Chinese at this stage shouted but her voice was faint. Harun grabbed the female Chinese after which he asked me to grab hold of this woman. When I took over and grabbed this woman, Harun entered the room. When I grabbed the woman she put up a fight I had no intention of killing her. I just hit her. Whilst I was warding off her attacks, her trousers accidentally slipped off. When I saw this my desire was aroused. I then wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. Before I could start to play her she gave a blow at me. I warded it off. When my penis penetrated into her vagina she suddenly fell silent.
 After I had played her I pulled out my penis. The female Chinese was still quiet. Whilst I was doing all these Harun was ransacking the room. When Harun came out of the room he found nothing inside it. He then asked me to carry the woman into the sampan. After putting the body into the sampan we left the shore. I was rowing the sampan. Half way across Harun suggested that we throw the woman into the sea. After doing so, ie throwing the woman into the sea, I went back to the jetty.
 From the jetty Harun and I went to Bedok for some food. After having some food Harun asked me to follow him to Desker Road. He wanted to give me a treat. There I played another woman, ie had sexual intercourse. From Desker Road Harun asked me to go back to Changi. Then I went back to the motor-boat where I slept. That is all.
 The appellant, when called to enter upon his defence to the charge of murder, elected to make an unsworn statement from the dock, the material portions of which read as follows: 
Harun then came into the sampan and I rowed it to Pulau Ubin. When we were about to reach Pulau Ubin I pointed the house where we wanted to steal, to Harun. We landed on the beach and pulled the sampan ashore. I walked ahead of Harun and he followed me. We circled the house two or three times. Then I went to disturb the fowls. The fowls made a lot of noise. I heard a voice of a Chinese woman inside the house. Harun was standing by the side of the door. When the door was opened I went straight into the house and I saw a woman lying on the ground. I placed my hand on this woman`s mouth and Harun went into the house. The woman was struggling. I tried to grab the torchlight which she was holding. She hit my hand with her hand. I shut her mouth with my hand. Again I tried to grab her torchlight. She pushed my hand away and she shouted. I shut her mouth with my hand again and then I managed to grab the torchlight from her. She was struggling. So I hit her hand with the torchlight. With her hand she hit me on my face. So I pressed my hand on her mouth again. Harun then came out and took the torchlight away from my hand. Harun went back into the house. I shut this woman`s mouth with my hand. She again struggled and pushed my hand away but I managed to shut her mouth with my hand. Then suddenly she was motionless. I lifted her hand and she did not make any movement. I shook her. Then I saw that she was dead. I became worried. I then stood near the kitchen door. Harun came out and shorn the torchlight at this woman. Harun asked me what had happened to this woman. I told him that I shut her mouth with my hand and that she died. Then Harun wanted to hit me. I told Harun that I had no intention to kill this woman. I was only preventing her from shouting. Harun then said what we were to do then. I then suggested that we carry her to the beach, place some water on her face and try to revive her. We carried the woman and placed her on the beach.
 ... I went to Pulau Ubin to steal and I had no intention to kill anyone.
 There can be no doubt whatsoever from the evidence that the only person that evening who laid hands on the deceased before she was `placed on the beach` was the appellant. The vital questions were whether or not her death was caused by an act of the appellant and, if so, whether or not he had caused her death in circumstances amounting to murder as defined in s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed).
 The material provisions of s 300 read as follows: 
Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder:
 
(a) ... ... ...
(b) ... ... ... 
(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death;`
 The trial judges held that the appellant caused the death of the deceased within the above definition and convicted him of the offence of murder. Their findings and their reasons for arriving at their verdict of guilty were expressed by the presiding judge in the following passage of their oral judgment: 
After careful consideration of all the evidence in the case, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the injury which caused the death of the deceased was inflicted by the second accused.
 According to Dr Chao, whose evidence we accept, this injury comprised fractures of nine ribs in the front of the chest, caused by compression of the chest with some force. The sudden pain and shock suffered by the deceased as a result of these fractures brought about the cardiac arrest, causing her death within one or two minutes. According to Dr Chao, the fractures of the nine ribs was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, independently of other injuries found on the deceased.
 On the evidence before us, we have no doubt at all that the aforesaid fatal injury was intentionally caused by the second accused and that it was not caused accidentally or otherwise unintentionally. Consequently, the act of the second accused in causing the fatal injury was an act which clearly falls within the third limb of the definition of murder, because he intended to inflict that injury within the meaning of the said third limb, and we accordingly find him guilty of murder as defined in the Penal Code.
 The main contention raised before us on behalf of the appellant is that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that the fatal injury, ie the simultaneous fracture of the nine ribs in the front of the chest was intentionally caused by the appellant. It is argued that the appellant used violence on the deceased with the intention of subduing her to enable him to rape her and not with the intention to cause the fatal injury. We reject that contention. While it is clear that the evidence also establishes that the appellant used violent means with the intention of subduing her in order to commit rape, it is also clear that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the appellant also intended to inflict the fatal injury. The trial judges found that the fatal injury was neither accidentally nor otherwise unintentionally caused by the appellant and in the circumstances it is clear that the subjective test involved in the third limb of s 300 has been satisfied. The law is clear. If the injury that the offender intends causing and does cause is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death the offence is murder as defined in the third limb of s 300.
 The only other point raised is that the trial judges, at the trial within a trial, had failed to take into consideration the evidence that five days after the appellant had made a statement before a magistrate on 11 February, he had again appeared before another magistrate but, after preliminary questions had been put to him by the magistrate, had told the magistrate that he did not wish to make a statement. It is argued that his refusal to make another statement was sufficient corroboration of his evidence during the trial within a trial that he had been threatened, assaulted and promises and inducements had been given to him by police officers before he made his statement on 11 February to a magistrate and that the trial judges had failed to take that into consideration in arriving at their finding that his statement of 11 February was a voluntary statement.
 We reject this contention. The trial within a trial lasted several days and all the evidence including the point now taken was before the trial judges and in our opinion there is no sufficient reason for this court to take the view that the trial judges had failed to consider all the evidence before them, including the evidence relating to the unproductive appearance of the appellant before another magistrate, in arriving at their decision to admit in evidence the appellant`s statement of 11 February.
 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

I suppose this appeal has served one, I think, very useful purpose in that it shows the importance for both the prosecution as well as the accused person in a criminal charge to exercise extreme care and diligence in placing before the court the full facts which may be relevant both to the charge as well as to the sentence. In this particular case the accused, who had decided to plead guilty to the charge under s 32(a) of the Enlistment Act (Cap 229, 1970 Ed) which is a charge for failing to report for enlistment, when the facts were outlined to the court in terms of the complaint that on the day as specified in the enlistment notice he had not turned up at the appropriate place to report for enlistment, admitted to that vital fact. Unfortunately, prosecuting counsel subsequently went on to stress to the court that the appellant had failed to report and then drew the attention of the court to the many problems that arose out of such failure and asked that this case be treated as a serious case. Had the real facts been brought to light, namely that he in fact on the day in question duly reported for enlistment, it is clear that no court would have convicted the appellant even on his guilty plea on the charge as it stood.
Ever since national service was introduced in Singapore and this has been many years ago, it has been made, I think, absolutely clear to everyone concerned that any evasion on the part of anyone who is liable to render national service, is a serious offence - clear because the Legislature has specified a heavy maximum punishment for it. The duty of the court is to administer the law having regard to what I have just said and to the facts of the particular case. The extent of the punishment must depend on the facts of the particular case.
Now, in this case the appellant has brought the present months of uncertainty on himself but on the facts as they are now before me, in exercise of my powers of revision I set aside the conviction and sentence.

The two appellants were convicted at a joint trial by the High Court of unlawfully trafficking in 55.25g of diamorphine in contravention of s 3(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973 and sentenced to death. They now appeal against their conviction and sentence.
The evidence led by the prosecution was as follows: On 9 March 1976 at about 7.20pm a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) were at Block 157 Mei Ling Street, Singapore from which place they kept observation on Block 156 Mei Ling Street. The party was led by Acting Senior Narcotics Officer Francis X Jeyaraje. At about 8.25pm three male Chinese were seen on the tenth floor of Block 156 talking to each other. The narcotics officers immediately went to the lift entrance on the ground floor of Block 156 and waited there. A few minutes later the two appellants came out of the lift. They were arrested by the narcotics officers and taken to the CNB Hq. At the CNB Hq the first appellant was taken to a room by Jeyaraje while the second appellant was made to sit in the corridor outside the room where he was guarded by a narcotics officer. In the room the first appellant was questioned by Jeyaraje whereupon the first appellant unzipped his trousers and from within his underwear produced a bundle which contained two plastic packets of a brownish substance. The contents of these two packets were later examined and found to weigh 19.5g of which 9.08 were diamorphine (heroin) and the rest a mixture of adulterants and contaminates. The first appellant was then asked by Jeyaraje whether he had anymore similar packets. The first appellant replied that he had a few more placed in a letter box at Block 151, Mei Ling Street. Jeyaraje then asked him for the keys to the letter box and was told that they were with the second appellant. Jeyaraje then brought the first appellant to where the second appellant was. The first appellant asked the second appellant for the keys. The second appellant took out from his trousers pocket a bunch of three keys and handed it to the first appellant who in turn handed it to Jeyaraje.
A party of CNB officers left with the first appellant for Block 151, Mei Ling Street. There the first appellant led them to an area on the ground floor where there were a number of letter boxes and pointed out the letter box with marking `11-H`. With one of the three keys in the bunch given to him by the first appellant, Jeyaraje opened this letter box. In it were found parcels of a substance weighing a total of 95.41g which contained in all 43.3g of heroin.
Shortly afterwards, the narcotics officers proceeded with the first appellant (in the absence of the second appellant) to a one room apartment numbered 11-H on the eighth floor of Block 151 Mei Ling Street of which the tenant was the mother of the second appellant and the second appellant was one of the `authorised occupants`. This apartment was opened with one of the three keys in the bunch handed earlier to Jeyaraje by the first appellant. The first appellant pulled out a gramophone record from the stack of records in this apartment and from within its cover took out a packet of substance weighing 6.17g which contained 2.82g of heroin.
On a search of the room by the narcotics officers, they found two phials on top of the flat surface of a shoe rack containing substances weighing 0.12g with a total heroin content of 0.05g. The total heroin content of the exhibits seized was 55.25g.
The charge on which the two appellants were jointly tried and convicted reads as follows: 
 
You,
 
 
 
1. Poon Soh Har
 
 
 
2. Gan Chye Koon
 
 
 
are charged that you, on or about 9 March 1976 at about 8.35pm at Blocks 151 and 156 of Mei Ling Street, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, did traffic in a controlled drug, to wit, 55.25g of diamorphine and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
The material ingredients of this charge are that on 9 March 1976 the two appellants:
 
 
(a) at about 8.35am 
 
(b) at Blocks 151 and 156, Mei Ling Street 
 
(c) in furtherance of a common intention 
 
(d) did unlawfully traffic 
 
(e) in 55.25g of diamorphine.
  
 
 
The expression `traffic` is defined in s 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act as follows: 
 
`traffic` means -
 
 
 
(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or
 
 
 
 
(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in para (a) above otherwise than under the authority of this Act or regulations made thereunder; and `trafficking` has a corresponding meaning.
  
 
 
It is clear that on the facts already set out, there was no evidence at all of the appellants or either of them, in furtherance of their common intention, having done, on the day and at the time stated in the charge, any act in relation to or concerning the 55.25g of diamorphine seized which fell within the definition of `traffic` laid down in s 2 of the Act. To bring home the charge, the prosecution therefore tendered evidence of other past criminal acts of the two appellants and also invoked some of the presumptions laid down in the Act. This further evidence and the presumptions that were invoked and utilized must now be examined.
The prosecution led evidence which showed:
 
 
(a) that on 4 March 1976 the two appellants together with one Lilian Tan and Lim Ah Geok had smoked heroin in the Apartment No 11-H, Block 151; 
 
(b) that on 7 March 1976 the second appellant had sold a quarter phial of heroin to Lim Ah Geok for $6.50; 
 
(c) that on 9 March 1976 at 2.30am Lim Ah Geok, Lilian Tan and the two appellants smoked heroin in the Apartment No 11-H, Block 151; 
 
(d) that on 9 March 1976 one Tan Lye Seng had come to No 11-H, Block 151 to purchase heroin from either of the two appellants; 
 
(e) that Tan Lye Seng had on one other occasion a few weeks earlier purchased heroin from the two appellants; 
 
(f) that on 7 March 1976 one George Low was recruited by the two appellants to be a distributor of heroin for them and that on that day the first appellant in the presence of the second appellant gave him ten straws packed with heroin; 
 
(g) that on 8 March 1976 the first appellant gave George Low another ten heroin-filled straws for distribution; and 
 
(h) that on 9 March 1976 the two appellants went to George Low`s apartment where they gave him another 20 heroin-filled straws for distribution.
  
 
 
No objection appears to have been taken by counsel for the defence to the admission of this massive prejudicial evidence and it was not only admitted by the trial judges but also believed and acted upon for they made the following finding: 
 
Apart from the presumptions that had been raised against both accused there was also the evidence of Lim Ah Geok, Tan Lye Seng and George Low which proved that the two accused had earlier sold, given, delivered or distributed heroin.
 
 
 
In our judgment the evidence in respect of past criminal activities of the appellants was inadmissible. It offended against the principle laid down in 
 Makin v Attorney General Of New South Wales 
 [1984] AC 57, in that first, it plainly tended to show that the appellants had been guilty of criminal acts other than that with which they were charged, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that they were persons likely from their criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which they were being tried and secondly, it could not be said to be relevant to any issue in the case. Because of the precise definition of `traffic` in s 2 of the Act which is restricted to the commission of a number of specific acts, evidence of such past acts was irrelevant as it could not prove the offence of trafficking on the day and time in question. The fact that the appellants had trafficked in heroin in the past did not mean that they were trafficking when arrested. Evidence of trafficking in heroin in the past merely raised the suspicion that they were having the heroin for purposes of trafficking and did not prove that they `did traffic` on the day in question. The admission of evidence of past criminal acts could not be justified on any ground and should have been rejected.
The crucial presumption invoked by the prosecution and utilized by the trial judges to convict the appellants on the charge is that laid down in s 15(c) of the Act which provides as follows: 
 
Any person who is proved or presumed to have had in his possession more than-
 
 
 
(a) ....
 
 
 
 
(b) .... 
 
(c) 2g of diamorphine (heroin) contained in any controlled drug or 
 
(d) ....
  
 
 
shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had such controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking therein.
 
 
 
By invoking this section the trial judges made this finding: 
 
... that by s 15 of the Act the two accused were, until the contrary was proved, presumed to have had the heroin the subject matter of the charge in their possession for the purpose of trafficking therein ...
 
 
 
And after referring to the evidence of past criminal acts of the appellants and that they `had earlier sold, given, delivered or distributed heroin`, the trial judges made the following final finding: 
 
The evidence of the prosecution clearly established that the two accused acted harmoniously and closely together in the trafficking of heroin.
 
 
 
It seems to us that the trial judges equated the phrase `have had such controlled drug in his possession for the purposes of trafficking` in s 15 of the Act with the word `traffic`. To possess a drug for the purpose of trafficking therein, is, as already pointed out, something totally different from the act of `trafficking` as defined in s 2 of the Act. In our judgment the words of s 15 are clear and unambiguous. If Parliament had intended that the presumption should be that the possessor was trafficking in the drug possessed, it would have used the words `traffic in such controlled drug` instead of the words `have had such controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking`.
In our judgment the evidence in this case was inadequate to convict the appellants on the charge on which they were tried. Counsel for the Public Prosecutor has very correctly conceded that the conviction of the two appellants is wrong in law and that he is unable to support it. Accordingly their conviction under s 3(a) of the Act is quashed and the sentence of death imposed on them is set aside.
It now remains to consider what other offence, if any, had the appellants or either of them committed on the admissible evidence in this case. We propose to consider the evidence against each appellant separately.
In the case of the first appellant there was undisputed evidence that when he was arrested as he came out of the lift on the ground floor, he was carrying concealed on his person, 9.08g of heroin. He was clearly in possession of it and therefore guilty of an offence under s 6(a) of the Act in respect of 9.08g of diamorphine.
The first appellant had admitted to Jeyaraje that he had kept heroin in the box marked 11-H on the ground floor of Block 151, Mei Ling Street. This heroin was found to be in all, 43.4g. The first appellant was undoubtedly in possession of this 43.3g of heroin and in respect of it he was guilty of the offence of possession of a controlled drug in contravention of s 6(a) of the Act.
The first appellant was also guilty of a similar offence in respect of the 2.82g of heroin which he produced to the narcotics officers from within the cover of a gramophone record in the Apartment No 11-H on the eighth floor of Block 151, Mei Ling Street. The total amount of heroin in respect of which he was guilty under s 6(a) of the Act therefore amounts to 55.2g.
The only admissible evidence against the second appellant was that on the day in question he was in possession of a bunch of three keys, one of which fitted the letter box in which was found 43.3g of heroin, another fitted the entrance door of the Apartment No 11-H and the third fitted a cupboard in the apartment. At his trial the prosecution claimed and the trial judges accepted it as correct that by virtue of the fact that he had a key to the letter box, he was, under s 16(1)(b) of the Act presumed, until the contrary was proved, to be in possession of the heroin found in the letter box. Likewise it was accepted by the trial judges that because one of the keys in the bunch of three keys was a key to the Apartment No 11-H, the second appellant was, under s 16(1)(c) of the Act presumed to be in possession of the 2.82g of heroin found in the cover of the gramophone record.
The relevant parts of s 16(1)(b) and (c) read as follows: 
 
(1) Any person who is proved to have had in possession or custody or under his control -
 
 
 
 
(b) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug; 
 
(c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found
  
 
 
shall until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had such drug in his possession.
 
 
 
There was evidence before the trial court that there were in all two keys to the letter box and two to the entrance door of the Apartment No 11-H. The second appellant was only one of the four `authorized` occupants of the apartment and the other three occupants had access both to the letter box and the apartment with the other relevant keys not in the possession of the second appellant. In our judgment the expression `the keys` in cll (b) and (c) of s 16(1) of the Act requires strict proof and the presumptions under the said clauses are applicable only if it was first proved that the second appellant had possession of all the relevant keys. On the evidence in this case the said presumptions are inapplicable and it was erroneous for the trial court to hold that the heroin found in the letter box and in the Apartment was in the possession of the second appellant.
It was submitted by counsel for the Public Prosecutor that the first appellant could not have kept the heroin in the letter box without the knowledge and consent of the second appellant and that therefore the provisions of s 16(4) applied. Section 16(4) reads as follows: 
 
Where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.
 
 
 
There was no evidence before the trial court that the heroin in the letter box was kept by the first appellant with the knowledge and consent of the second appellant and it would be wrong to draw the inference that the second appellant knew and consented to the keeping of the heroin in the letter box from the fact that he had one of the two keys to the letter box because it could have been kept in the letter box by using the other key to the letter box without the knowledge and consent of the second appellant.
Finally, there is the finding of the trial judges `that by s 16(4) of the Act the heroin which was concealed on the person of the first accused was deemed to be in the possession of the second accused`. If this finding is correct, the second appellant is guilty of possession of the said 9.08g of heroin under s 6(a) of the Act. We have examined the record of the case with care and we cannot find any evidence to support the said finding of the trial judges. There was no evidence before them that the first appellant had the heroin concealed on his person with the knowledge and consent of the second appellant and s 16(4) of the Act was therefore inapplicable.
We find that there was no evidence in this case on which the second appellant could have been convicted of any offence under the act. His appeal is allowed and he is discharged.
For the reasons already given, we convict the first appellant of the offence of possession of 55.2g of heroin in contravention of s 6(a) of the Act and sentence him to ten years` imprisonment.

This appeal arises from a claim in the High Court by the abovenamed respondents to be reimbursed by the appellants the sum of $11,160 which they had paid on behalf of their insured, Cheng Meng Furniture Co (Pte) Ltd, in respect of the death of their workman, one Sitaram son of Shonlal under the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 130, 1970 Ed). By judgment date 26 April 1977 the High Court ordered the appellants to pay the respondents the sum claimed. The appellants now appeal against the said judgment.
The facts are these. The respondents are an insurance company. The appellants are contractors and were at the material time the main contractors for the construction of a large shopping-cum-residence complex in Beach Road known as the Woh Hup Complex. The accident which gave rise to this claim occurred when the said complex was still under construction and a number of other contractors were carrying out various works at the site. On 19 February 1973 the deceased Sitaram s/o Shonlal, a labourer employed by the said Cheng Meng Furniture Co (Pte) Ltd which had a contract to do some work in one of the penthouses on the top floor of the complex, was pushing a wheel barrow laden with some bags of cement along a path in the open yard at the work site of the said Woh Hup Complex when the said wheel barrow in going over some electric cables lying on the ground in its path cut the insulation of one of the cables whereupon the said Sitaram s/o Shonlal was electrocuted.
The respondents as insurers of Cheng Meng paid out a sum of $11,160 in respect of the death of the deceased on a claim under the Workmen`s Compensation Act and sought to recover this sum from the appellants on the ground that, they were entitled to be indemnified by the appellants by right of subrogation under the Workmen`s Compensation Act.
The trial judge found on the evidence that the appellants as the main contractors were the occupiers of the work site where the accident occurred; that the appellants knew that the deceased`s employers Cheng Meng were doing some work for the owners of a penthouse on the top floor of the complex; that Cheng Meng`s workmen were carrying materials across the open yard to the lift in the complex; that at the time of the accident there were electric cables lying on the ground across the path which the deceased was using to take bags of cement on a wheel barrow to the lift; that the deceased was therefore not a trespasser but a licensee; that the appellants were under a duty of care to the deceased, that the duty owed by the appellants to the deceased was to warn him of concealed dangers actually known to them but neither known or obvious to the deceased; that the electric cables lying across the path used by the deceased were live cables which carried electricity from the switchboard in the complex to another part of the work site; that the electricity which passed through the cables constituted a concealed danger; that the appellants were under a duty to protect workmen using the path from the concealed danger by erecting a barrier or giving a warning or otherwise that there were live cables running across the path; that at the time of the accident there was no danger sign placed near the cables to warn users of the path and that the appellants had therefore failed in their duty of care to the deceased. Accordingly the trial judge gave judgment for the respondents.
The point was taken, both before the trial judge and before us, that the respondents were not entitled to sue the appellants in their own name. It was contended that since the respondents claimed by right of subrogation, the proper plaintiffs were Cheng Meng. The trial judge held that the short answer to this submission was that s 20(b) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 130) which was in force at the material time enabled the respondents to sue in their own name. The said s 20(b) provided as follows: 
 
Where any injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employers to pay damages in respect thereof -
 
 
 
(a) ...
 
 
 
 
(b) if the workman has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid, and any person who has been called upon to pay an indemnity under sub-s (2) of s 19 of this Act, shall be entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay damages as aforesaid and all questions as to the right to and amount of any such indemnity may, in default of agreement, be settled by an arbitrator.
  
 
 
On the facts of this case, the respondents were `the person by whom the compensation was paid`, and they were therefore entitled to be indemnified, under s 20(b) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act. We agree with the trial judge that the respondents` statutory right to be indemnified included the right to sue in their own name.
The next point taken before us was that the trial judge `erred in finding that the appellants owed a duty of care to the deceased to warn him of the alleged concealed danger of the electric cable and that the appellants failed in that duty`. In our opinion the facts which speak for themselves are overwhelmingly against the appellants. They know or should have known that by allowing cables carrying electricity to lie on the ground across the path used by workmen, they were creating a concealed danger to all workmen using that path and should have taken appropriate measures to warn them of such danger. As they failed to do so, the appellants were clearly in breach of their duty to the deceased who as a licensee was entitled to be warned of such a concealed danger.
Another point taken before us is that `the learned judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the deceased was not in anyway to be blamed for the accident`. In our opinion the facts on this issue are again entirely against the appellants. Photographs taken at the scene of the accident immediately after the accident and tendered at the trial show quite clearly that at the site of the accident, on both sides of the path used by the deceased there were a lot of discard materials, junk and rubbish lying around which concealed the cables lying on the ground, and it would be unreasonable to expect anyone using the path to realize that the exposed portion of cables across the path were live cables carrying electricity and not bits of discarded cables. The deceased was pushing a heavily laden wheel barrow with the assistance of two other workmen and thus concentrating on the task assigned to him and in the absence of any danger sign or warning had no reason to assume that it was dangerous for him to push the wheel barrow over the cables. In our judgment there was no contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.
The last submission before us by counsel for the appellants is based on the provisions of s 20(b) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act which we have already set out. The submission is that the trial judge `erred in law in failing entirely to consider the omission of the respondents to adduce any evidence whatsoever that the payment by them on behalf of their insured was justified under the provisions of the Workmen`s Compensation Act`. The decision in 
 County Council of Galway v County of Galway Board of Health and Public Assistance 
 [1931] IR 547 is cited in support of this submission. In this Irish case, Meredith J had to construe sub-s 2 of s 6 of the Workmen`s Compensation Act 1906 which is substantially in terms with s 20(b) of our Workmen`s Compensation Act. Meredith J held that the right to be indemnified conferred by the subsection was subject to the concluding words, `and all questions as to the right to and amount of any such indemnity may, in default of agreement, be settled by action or by consent of the parties, by arbitration`; that these words qualify the employer`s title to be indemnified; that the first part of the subsection was merely intended to give the employer a right over against the stranger in respect of his original liability to the workmen; and that questions as to the right to, and the amount of, the indemnity are left open and at large for settlement, if necessary by action. Meredith J went on to add that the right conferred by the subsection `was limited to the amount which the workman might have recovered as damages had he brought his action against the defendants`.
Although counsel for the appellants has not put it so clearly, his submission really is that as the respondents in this case did not tender any evidence at the trial to show that in a claim at common law, made on behalf of the deceased, a sum of $11,160 could have been recovered as damages, the trial judge should have dismissed the respondents` claim for want of evidence. It is true that in his judgment the trial judge has not dealt with this aspect of the case although submissions on this issue were made by both counsel. There is, however, evidence on record which shows that the claim before the Commissioner for Workmen`s Compensation was a dependency claim made on behalf of the widow of the deceased; that the average monthly earnings of the deceased at the time of his death were $155 per mensem; that the Commissioner for Labour made a claim on behalf of the widow under s 8(2) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act for a lump sum payment of 72 months wages amounting to $11,160 and that this claim was accepted by the deceased`s employers and by the respondents as their insurers. In our opinion this was sufficient evidence to shift the burden of proof on the appellants. It was open to the appellants to show by evidence at the trial that in a common law action, the widow of the deceased, could not have recovered as much as $11,160 as damages in a dependency claim. This they failed to do and therefore have only themselves to blame.
In our judgment the trial judge came to a right decision in allowing the claim of the respondents and entering judgment for $11,160 against the appellants. The appeal is dismissed with costs.

The company was the owner of a motor van No SGB 2099 which was being driven by one Yong Chan Seng, a driver employed by the company. The first and second plaintiffs were by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment with the company travelling as passengers in the motor van which was being driven by Yong Chan Seng from the premises of the company, which was their employer, to a worksite where they were to carry on work as employees of the company. Owing to the negligence of Yong Chan Seng the motor van ran off the road and crashed into a tree resulting in the first and second plaintiffs sustaining bodily injuries. The third plaintiff who was the father of the second plaintiff was put to loss and expense.
The three plaintiffs commenced two separate proceedings claiming damages against the owner of the motor van and Yong Chan Seng. The two actions were consolidated and eventually judgment for damages was obtained by all three plaintiffs against the owner of the motor van and Yong Chan Seng.
The motor van was insured under a policy issued by the defendants and the present action has been brought by the three plaintiffs who are relying, inter alia, on s 4(3) and s 8(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 88, 1970 Ed) (the Act).
It is submitted by counsel for the defendants that because of the wording of exception (ii) to s II of the policy the defendants are not liable to make any payment to the plaintiffs.
Exceptions (ii) and (iii) to s 11 read as follows: 
 
The Company shall not be liable in respect of
 
 
 
(i) ...
 
 
 
 
(ii) death of or bodily injury to any person in the employment of the Insured arising out of and in the course of such employment 
 
(iii) death of or bodily injury to any person (other than a passenger carried by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment) being carried in or upon or entering or getting on to or alighting from the motor vehicle at the time of the occurrence of the event out of which any claim arises.
  
 
 
The wording of these two exceptions is based on the first two provisos to s 4(1) of the Act.
In my opinion the effect of the words in brackets in exception (iii) is to make the defendants liable in respect of injuries sustained by the first and second plaintiffs who were passengers `carried by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment`. In the case of 
 Izzard v Universal Insurance Co 
 
[1937] AC 773
 Lord Wright said at p 779: 
 
It is clear that though passenger risk in the full sense of the term is excluded, a certain limited class of passenger risk is specifically covered - namely, that described in the words in brackets in (c) quoted above which is in the form of an exception, and thus constitutes a positive cover.
 
 
 
Another matter which arises for consideration is the effect of cl 2 in s II of the policy. Clause 2 reads as follows: 
 
In terms of and subject to the limitations of and for the purposes of this section the Company will indemnify any authorized driver who is driving the motor vehicle provided that such authorized driver
 
 
 
(i) shall as though he were the Insured observe fulfil and be subject to the Terms of this Policy insofar as they can apply
 
 
 
 
(ii) is not entitled to indemnity under any other policy.
  
 
 
There is no doubt that Yong Chan Seng was the authorized driver of the motor van. It has also been conceded by counsel for the defendants that Yong Chan Seng was not entitled to indemnity under any other policy. The first and second plaintiffs were clearly employees of the company and not of Yong Chan Seng. As to the meaning of the phrase `the Terms of this Policy` it is relevant to refer to the words `Now this Policy Witnesseth That in respect of events occurring during the Period of Insurance and subject to the terms, exceptions and conditions contained herein or endorsed hereon (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Terms of this Policy).`
It is clearly stated in cl 2 in s II of the policy that the company, ie the insurance company will indemnify any authorized driver who is driving the motor vehicle provided that certain conditions are observed. In my opinion all the relevant conditions have been complied with. Judgment having been entered against Yong Chan Seng in the consolidated action, the defendants must now indemnify him against the claims of the three plaintiffs. The facts of this case bear some resemblance to the facts in 
 Richards v Cox 
 [1942] 2 All ER 624.
There will be judgment for the first plaintiff for the sum of $120,343.64, for the second plaintiff for the sum of $11,159.50, for the third plaintiff for the sum of $58.27 and in addition for all the plaintiffs for the sum of $12,853.27 being their costs in respect of the consolidated action. The total sum of $144,413.68 is to be paid to the Public Trustee to hold in trust for the persons entitled to the benefit thereon. There will also be the usual orders as to costs.

The plaintiff`s claim in this suit was for damages for personal injuries and consequential loss suffered by him on 6 March 1971 when he was injured while working on board a lighter anchored at Ponggol.
The facts are these. The plaintiff was employed by the first defendant as a labourer on a lighter owned by the first defendant who had a contract with the second defendant to transport the second defendant`s crushed granite from Pulau Ubin to Ponggol.
On 6 March 1971 the lighter on which the plaintiff was employed arrived at Ponggol fully loaded with crushed granite. It anchored alongside the defendant`s yard where the granite had to be unloaded and unloading commenced by means of a grab crane operated by a servant of the second defendant. The crane was positioned some 10 ft away from the water`s edge. The operator of the crane sat in the cabin of the crane from which position he could not see the bottom of the lighter. The method of unloading was for the crane driver to swing the boom of the crane over the lighter, lower the grab into the lighter, and when the grab had grabbed a load of granite, it was lifted and swung over to the yard where the load of granite was dropped. This procedure was repeated by the crane driver without anybody`s assistance but when the lighter was almost empty, the remnants of the granite on the floor of the lighter were raked together into a heap by the plaintiff to enable the crane driver to pick up this heap and thus complete the unloading of the lighter.
The accident happened when the crane driver lowered the grab to pick up a load of granite. The plaintiff was raking the remnants of granite into a heap on the outer front half of the hold of the lighter, which portion of the lighter had been unloaded, when the grab came and hit the plaintiff`s head causing him to fall. The grab fell on his right leg causing a compound fracture of the right tibia and fibula.
At the time of the accident, there were only four persons at the scene of the accident, namely, Wong Yam Poo the crane driver, the plaintiff, one Goh Lim who is a brother of the first defendant, and one Goh Tiong who was from another lighter and had come to help Goh Lim to repair the rudder. Goh Lim and Goh Tiong were at the rear of the lighter repairing the rudder. They did not see the accident. They heard the plaintiff`s scream and rushed to his help. They saw the plaintiff lying on the floor of the lighter with injuries on his right leg and shouting in agony. He was carried ashore and later sent to hospital.
The crane driver`s evidence was that he had seen the plaintiff leave the hold of the lighter and go to the cabin of the lighter; that after that he continued lifting loads of granite for 20 to 30 minutes; that he never saw the plaintiff returning to the hold of the lighter and that he was surprised when he heard shouts from Goh Lim that someone was injured in the hold of the lighter. The crane driver contended that at the time of the accident he did not know that the plaintiff was in the lighter; that it was low tide and the lighter was lower than the jetty; that his crane was 10 ft away from the edge of the jetty and that from his cabin he could see the bottom of the lighter at the outer edge but could not see it at the inner edge. Under cross-examination the crane driver admitted that he never checked whether or not the plaintiff had come back into the hold of the lighter. He explained that he never expected the plaintiff to come back because there was enough granite on the inner side of the lighter for him to work on. He contended further that the plaintiff should have notified him when he came back into the hold of the lighter.
The plaintiff denied leaving the hold of the lighter and going to the cabin. He maintained that he was in the lighter all the time. Goh Lim admitted that when he and Goh Tiong were repairing the rudder at the back of the lighter, behind the cabin, the plaintiff did come there to see what they were doing and left a short while later.
It was contended on behalf of the second defendant that once the need for raking the remnants had arisen, the labourers on the lighter would commence raking and as soon as they had raked the granite into a heap, one of them would signal to the crane driver to lower the grab. The plaintiff denied that it was his duty to give a signal to the crane driver. But his fellow worker Goh Lim admitted it. It was suggested to the plaintiff that when the grab was lowered, the plaintiff or his fellow worker would then catch hold of the grab and direct it to the heap or pile of granite. This was denied by the plaintiff and also by Goh Lim.
The evidence showed that the accident was caused by the negligence of the crane driver. Having seen the plaintiff leave the hold of the lighter, he should have kept a look-out for his return to the hold of the lighter. The crane driver failed to notice that the plaintiff had returned to the hold and was working on raking the remnants into a heap on the outer front edge of the lighter. He admitted that he could see the bottom of the lighter at the outer edge and yet he failed to see the plaintiff working there. He was negligent in lowering the grab at the spot where the plaintiff was working because he had no reason to lower it at that spot. The plaintiff had not yet completed raking the remnants into a heap nor had he given any signal for the grab to be lowered at that spot. The crane driver was working on unloading the inner portion of the lighter and had negligently swung the grab to the outer front portion where the plaintiff was working. In my opinion the accident was due entirely to the negligence of the crane driver and he was the sole cause of the accident.
It was submitted that the first defendant was also liable because he had not provided a safe system of work for the plaintiff who was his servant. In my opinion the plaintiff was at the time of the accident the servant of the second defendant company because he was doing work for them and not for his general employer the first defendant. According to the contract (exh P1) signed between the first defendant and the second defendant for the transportation of the granite from Pulau Ubin to Ponggol, the unloading of the granite at Ponggol was the responsibility of the second defendant. This was also admitted by Wong Yam Poo the crane driver and the second defendant`s supervisor Phillip Sng. The first defendant merely supplied the lighter and two labourers to bring the lighter from Pulau Ubin to Ponggol point. The first defendant had nothing to do with the unloading of the lighter at Ponggol.
I accepted the evidence of Goh Lim, that at the end of the unloading. He and his co-worker the plaintiff merely helped to rake the remnants of the granite into a heap so as to help the crane driver to complete the unloading because the second defendant company had only one person to unload the lighter 
 i.e 
 the crane driver. The fact that in raking the remnants of granite into heaps, the plaintiff and Goh Lim were merely helping the second defendant company was admitted by their supervisor, Phillip Sng. Under the circumstances, at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was not doing the work of his employer, the first defendant, but was doing the work of the second defendant company and was therefore their servant.
In 
 Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) 
 
[1947] AC 1
 which was a crane case which went to the House of Lords, Lord Parker said, at p 17: 
 
It is true that in most cases no orders as to how a job should be done are given or required: the man is left to do his own work in his own way. But the ultimate question is not what specific orders, or whether any specific orders, were given but who is entitled to give the orders as to how the work should be done.
 
 
 
In this case, the unloading of the lighter at Ponggol was the responsibility of the second defendant company which had the direction and control of the unloading operation and they were the only ones entitled to give orders as to how the work of unloading the lighter should be done. The first defendant had nothing to do with the unloading of the granite from the lighter and there was therefore no question of his having to provide a safe system of work for the plaintiff who was at the time of the accident helping the crane driver in his work of unloading the lighter. It was for the second defendant company to provide a safe system of work. They should have provided a signalman. The accident happened because of the negligent way in which the crane driver worked his crane, and it followed that his employers the second defendant company were liable for his negligence. The crane driver made a mistake with which the first defendant had nothing to do and consequently he was not liable.
General damages having been agreed between all the parties in the sum of $6,500. I assessed special damages at $3,800 and entered judgment for the plaintiff against the second defendant in the sum of $10,300 and costs as taxed. The plaintiff`s claim against the first defendant was dismissed with costs to be paid by the second defendant.

According to Senior Aircraftsman Cook, a colleague of the plaintiff, he and his wife boarded a taxi from the Singapore Airport after all three of them and a Mr Bell had seen a friend, Mr Kemp off there. Cook and his wife sat in the rear of the taxi with Bell in front and, as the plaintiff did not know the way to the Cellar Bar in the city which was their destination, Cook took great pains to ensure that the plaintiff on his motorcycle was in fact following their taxi as he in fact did. On reaching the traffic lights at the junction of Paya Lebar Road with Geylang Road, Cook saw that the plaintiff, Nock was immediately behind the taxi.
After the lights changed in their favour the taxi moved off into Guillemard Road followed by the plaintiff. There were three lanes on that side of the dual carriageway which carried traffic citywards and both the taxi and Nock`s motorcycle were in the centre lane. Nock was in the middle of the left hand half of that centre lane as one faces the city. Cook was positive that he first noticed the defendant`s lorry accelerating away from the traffic lights at the junction in question. He said that the lorry was on the inside lane to the left of both of them as one faces the city but nevertheless behind them. The taxi was travelling at about 30 mph with the motor cycle and the lorry at a slightly slower speed but more or less keeping pace behind the taxi.
Just before the accident which took place on a slight right hand bend towards the city not far from Lim Ah Woo Road the lorry accelerated slightly faster than the motorcycle on the inside lane, got abreast of the motorcycle and cut sharply to its right for some inexplicable reason when slightly more than halfway past the motorcycle. It clipped the left handle bar of the motorcycle with the flat back of the lorry or slightly under there about a third of the way from its rear. The plaintiff fell to his left and the motorcycle to its right and the rear wheel ran over the head of the plaintiff. Fortunately Nock was wearing a crash helmet.
He nevertheless suffered injuries to his head and face including fractures to the base of his skull, the left mandible, left zygoma and his 11th rib and the left ilium or pelvic bone. He also developed severe visual defects, double vision and a squint as well as diabetes insipidus of a permanent nature.
Although the defendant (the driver of the lorry) gave evidence before me whereas Cook did not, I am satisfied from Cook`s deposition in London, where he was subjected to cross-examination, that his version is the more acceptable one. Cook`s evidence is, for what it is worth, supported by his wife`s evidence though she seemed to have a hazier recollection of events than her husband and was not too sure of anything except that she was sure the lorry overtook the motorcyclist and knocked him down.
The first defendant said that he did not really know how the accident happened by which he said he meant that he did not see the accident. Otherwise, he claimed that he was travelling in the centre lane all along till the accident occurred. He said the traffic was heavy and that his speed was 15 to 16 mph because of that.
He claimed that the taxi overtook him and that he heard the loud sound of a motorcycle from his rear and then a bang towards the rear of his lorry and then the sound of something dragging on the road. He said he later saw a superficial scratch on the rear offside tyre. He said he saw the taxi in his rear view mirror overtaking him and that he did not look into the rear view mirror after that. When pressed on this, he said he could not see any vehicle in the lane behind the taxi because there was a slight bend in the road but I would observe that the road actually bends slightly to the right there and if the motorcycle had been overtaking him on his right there was nothing to prevent him from seeing it (see AB18, a more accurate sketch plan prepared by Mr Hilborne, than that at AB4).
He called a witness who said he sat in the rear of the lorry but who could not remember if he heard any sound approaching the lorry from the rear. He was engrossed in conversation with his friend. All he heard was the sound `doop` followed by a dragging sound. He could not say if the `doop` sound came from the rear itself or the rear offside of the lorry. He also said the lorry`s speed was 15 to 20 mph - it was crawling along - and that normally lorries do that speed. He was not sure if it was light or dark and he did not see traffic. I am satisfied that he does not throw any light on the accident which helps the driver.
Mr Tan Thian Chua, on behalf of the defendants, suggested that Cook was `helping the plaintiff to achieve monetary gain`. The suggestion is that Cook was lying. Although I never saw Cook in the witness box I am not prepared to hold on the evidence before me that he was lying. His version under cross-examination gives me no cause to believe that it has been fabricated. It sounds genuine. I see no good reason to doubt his version. This is not what I can say about the first defendant or his witness who did give evidence before me. Neither was observant or attentive nor can they remember anything about the accident which shakes my confidence in Cook`s evidence. Cook of course had reason to have a good view of what was taking place behind him and I am prepared to believe that he kept a special watch over the plaintiff`s movements behind him because he was anxious that the plaintiff should not lose contact with the taxi. It was when the taxi started pulling away from the plaintiff that he observed the lorry from the inside lane cutting to its right as it overtook the motor cycle. It is reasonable to infer that the lorry was taking the opportunity of getting into the centre lane from the lane on the extreme left.
I do not consider that the fact that the plaintiff was in the middle of the left half of the centre lane makes him guilty of any contributory negligence. If the lorry had remained in the inner lane this accident would not have taken place. The fact that he pulled to a stop in the centre lane much further away does not prove that he was always in the centre lane.
I do not believe the story about the scratch mark on the rear offside tyre of the lorry or that the lorry driver showed the police officer who took his report a sketch plan of the scene of the accident. I cannot believe that the plaintiff, in overtaking the lorry on its right as suggested, hit the rear offside tyre and had his head run over by that tyre! It is much more likely that the lorry cut to its right from the inner lane and clipped the motorcyclist`s left handle bar as he was in front of that rear offside wheel thereby throwing him to his left under that wheel and causing the motor cycle to fall to its right and be dragged by its own momentum to its final position. I do not believe that the lorry was crawling along at a slow speed because of heavy traffic - it was a one-way lefthand carriage way with three lanes. If the traffic was so heavy as to cause the driver to crawl along it is difficult to understand how the motorcycle left scratch-marks 43 feet long in the outer lane to the right of the centre lane.
I agree with Mr Hilborne`s submission that the evidence is all one way, ie in favour of the plaintiff. The particulars of negligence as pleaded by the defence, presumably drafted on instructions, suggest that the lorry driver gave an entirely different version of what occurred from that given in court. His report does not help him at all. There never was any question whatsoever of oncoming traffic in that half of Guillemard Road and in that report he did not say one word about the motorcyclist`s overtaking him or what their respective positions in that road were.
I accordingly find that total liability has been established to my satisfaction by the plaintiff as against the defendants.
The matter which remains for decision is the quantum of damages as a whole which I should award, general damages in respect of the injuries themselves having been agreed at $20,000 which seems to me a reasonably generous sum for pain and suffering and loss of amenities in all the circumstances of this case. The difficult problem that arises is with regard to the loss of earnings incurred by the plaintiff who joined the RAF as an apprentice on 12 August 1966 at the age of 17 years and, after the accident on 11 March 1970, was medically discharged therefrom on 17 December 1970. It is agreed that his longevity has not been affected and that he is fully employable.
Mr Hilborne`s written submission on damages is an ambitious one and is based on the calculations which received approval in the case of 
 Parry v Cleaver 
 
[1969] 2 WLR 821
, a House of Lords decision, more particularly on whether contributory pensions should not be taken into account in assessing loss of future earned income. In all he suggests a total of $130,000 in general damages (including $20,000 as agreed for the injuries) and a further $20,000 in special damages for loss of earnings etc between his discharge and the date of this judgment.
Mr Tan on the other hand emphasizes that this is a grossly exaggerated claim which does not follow the trends in our courts. He justifiably maintains that the plaintiff is fully employable in the private sector. He claims that the private sector pays more than the RAF. He suggests a nominal sum of between $5,000 to $7,500 for future loss of earnings and agrees to the other two sets of $20,000 each, one for the pain and suffering etc, and the other for special damages prior to date of judgment making a total of $47,500 in all at the most.
Although Flying Officer Katherine Mary Anderson said that it is easy to project a career in the Air Force and that promotion is automatic once a person like the plaintiff becomes a Junior Technician which in 1970 the plaintiff was not, it is clear that the plaintiff was required to pass certain qualifying examinations before being phased into fitter training and to undergo training thereafter, if he passed, in a fitter`s course before reaching the position of Junior Technician. Even Miss Anderson could not be sure that he would pass or if he would be put on another course if he did not pass. Although she said that he was bound to become a Junior Technician, the longest period being six years from date of joining for anyone, this is not borne out by AB8 from the Air Officer Commanding, RAF which states that his promotion to the rank of Junior Technician could be forecast for March 1974 assuming he continued in the service until the expiration of his nine year engagement. Moreover, it says that March 1973 would be the earliest when he could be phased into fitter training. Mr Hilborne`s submissions at Sch C assume that he would have become Junior Technician on 1 January 1973. According to AB9 his weekly pay would have been Â£24.17 until March 1974 and not Â£39.34. According to AB13 it would have been Â£29.30, ie Â£4.18 per day. There is some obscurity here. Moreover, these are gross weekly rates from which contributions towards the pension scheme were deducted.
The private sector paid at least in respect of 1 July 1974 onwards Â£35 per week as against Â£29.30 being the gross weekly rates until March 1974 (AB13) which he would have received in the RAF before promotion to Junior Technician. The figures in the letter dated 13 August 1975 are not understood and do not make sense on comparison with figures at AB8, 9, 13 and 14. Perhaps this is why Mr Tan says the private sector pays more!
It is unfortunate that no oral evidence was given as to the details of the actual pay he would have received in each year subsequent to 1970. The letter of 13 August 1975 was handed up without explanation nor did Miss Anderson say anything about it which helps me. In fact, the references to A, B and C in AB6, 8 and 13 were never produced and these letters are to that extent obscure. The plaintiff has accordingly not succeeded in satisfying me that he would have necessarily earned very much more in the RAF than in the private sector on the letters submitted or on the evidence of Miss Anderson. The figures which purport to be revised gross weekly rates came into force on 1 April 1975 are also obscure in relation to the plaintiff`s potential earnings after 1970.
It must be remembered that unlike Parry who had served for about 12 years in the police force before the accident and the plaintiff in 
 Ti Huck v Mohamed Yusof 
 
 
 
[1973] 2 MLJ 62
  who had served for about 16 years in the Malaysian Police Force before his accident, the plaintiff in the case before me had served in the RAF only for a little over three years before this accident and he was accordingly in the very early stages of his career therein. He still had to pass examinations and thereafter to undergo a fitter`s course of training before being eligible for engagement for 22 years until 1989. This again depended on vacancies and other factors at the end of the nine years` engagement he commenced in 1967. The plaintiff himself said that advancement meant how hard one worked although there was not a high failure rate. He did not really know how long over all he intended to stay in the RAF because although he was planning to stay in the RAF he `could not say what it would be`.
Further, in my opinion, merely to deduct a static Â£35 per week from now until 1989, being his projected earnings in civilian employment, at his last drawn rate of pay with Arrow Air Services which he left on 11 July 1975, is unrealistic. There is no reason why he should not go on earning progressively more until 1989.
The rates worked out for the plaintiffs earnings had he remained in the Air Force until 1989, ie the expiration of the 22-year period of engagement and the pension he would earn from 1989 until he reaches the age of 70 years may seem fair enough, subject to contingencies such as the uncertainties relating to his future earnings which depend on whether he would remain in the RAF until 1989, provided a reasonable deduction is also made in respect of his projected earnings in civilian employment at a non-static rate, not as submitted on his behalf up to 1989 only but also for his expected span of working life including whatever contributory pension to which he might become entitled in the private sector.
It is reasonable to suppose that he will work till about the age of 55 to 60 years and it is also reasonable to expect that he will be able to make arrangements to work with some firm in civilian employment which would also have a graduated pension scheme such as the Air Force does.
In my opinion it would be unfair to the defendants to work out his projected earnings in civilian employment at a static figure of Â£35 per week whereas the Air Force figures submitted have been worked out on rising rates based on increments from time to time as well as rises as a result of inflation presumably from now until his retirement.
Doing the best I can in all the circumstances I find myself unable to do more than to assess his future loss of earnings at a figure of an average of about Â£7 a week at the most, representing the difference between what he would have got from the Air Force until the age of 60 years including pension and what he would earn in the private sector until then including pension, if any, less deductions for tax as well as his own contributions to any pension scheme. I propose to leave out of consideration any further pension he would receive from the Air Force or elsewhere until he reaches the age of 70 years for the purposes of my assessment because some allowance must be made for the fact that he may not necessarily complete his normal span of 70 years.
I do not know why he left Arrow Air Services just before the trial. Presumably he is employable at similar rates to those received then with prospects of corresponding rises in pay subsequently such as he would have received in the Air Force with prospects of pension if he makes up his mind to join a firm having a graduated pension scheme.
In my view, this approach to his loss of future earnings having regard to the various contingencies including those relating to his future career with the Air Force which have to be considered in view of his comparatively short service with the Air Force before the accident, would not do him an injustice. He may never have remained in the Air Force; he may have failed to pass his examinations or he may not have been reengaged for a 22-year period in which case he would have had to enter the private sector with 
 no consequent loss of earnings 
 at all to speak of.
To summarize, in assessing his future earnings, I have borne in mind three crucial matters which must necessarily affect any computation thereof:
 
 
(1) the fact that one cannot assume that he would succeed in remaining in the Air Force or would necessarily want to so remain; 
 
(2) the fact that comparison between the Air Force rates of pay and rates of pay in the private sector must necessarily be highly speculative if not odious and that the only yardstick I have at the moment which I can apply as to the future is in respect of the rates of pay prevailing around the time the plaintiff left Arrow Air Services at Â£35 per week in July 1975 when had he remained in the RAF he might not have qualified yet to be a Junior Technician, if he did remain in the RAF, and he might have earned no more than he did with Arrow Air Services; 
 
(3) the fact that between 1971 and 1974 he seems to have got off after a slow start in the private sector, which is understandable, to a rapid increase in pay from Â£27 per week to Â£35 per week within four months by July 1974. He was moving from one firm to another. He was, however, always in employment and was no doubt trying to improve his earnings notwithstanding his handicapped appearance which he did succeed in doing until he left before the trial for reasons unknown. He does not seem to have done too badly in all the circumstances and his prospects of doing better are always there and, so far as I can see, he can work beyond the age of 40 years if he does not obtain pensionable employment with one employer. If by temperament he is a rolling stone he may not have lasted very long with the RAF and he must, if that is so, consider himself a fortunate young man.
  
 
 
In all the circumstances, an award of about Â£7 per week until he reaches the age of 60 years would, in my judgment, be far from unfair. This would give him 34 years` purchase at approximately $160 per month which will, because he will receive the full amount now, necessarily be less (according to the Murphy tables which the courts have been using for a very long time) than the sum reached by multiplying the average monthly loss by the total number of months in 34 years. I would accordingly award him $31,084.80 for future loss of earnings.
I might add that, although special damages in respect of past loss of earnings have been agreed at $19,842.35, this figure, in my opinion, is on the generous side.
Judgment will accordingly be entered for the plaintiff in the total sum of $70,923.15 to be paid to the Public Trustee on his behalf with costs.
 Order accordingly

rr 3 & 8 Motor Vehicles (Restricted Zone and Area Licences) Rules 1975
 
On 10 May 1975 the Minister for Communications in exercise of the powers conferred by s 70 and s 90(1) of the Road Traffic Act (the Act) made the Motor Vehicles (Restricted Zone and Area Licences) Rules 1975 (the Rules) which were duly published in the 
 Government Gazette 
 and presented to Parliament as required by s 91 of the Act.
The relevant provisions of the Rules read as follows: 
 
1 These Rules may be cited as the Motor Vehicles (Restricted Zone and Area Licences) Rules, 1975 and shall come into operation on 2 June 1975.
 
 
 
 
(2) In these Rules, unless the context otherwise requires - `area licence` means a licence issued in respect of a motor vehicle authorising such vehicles to enter the restricted zone during restricted hours;
  
 
 
`restricted hours` means the period from 7.30am to 10.15am daily except on Sundays and public holidays;
 
 
 
`restricted zone` means any road or part thereof within the area described in the First Schedule.
 
 
 
3 No person shall drive a motor vehicle into the restricted zone as described in the First Schedule during restricted hours unless there is in force in respect of such vehicle an area licence issued under these Rules.
 
 
 
5(2) The fee for an area licence shall be three dollars per day or sixty dollars per month.
 
 
 
8 The following vehicles shall be exempted from the provisions of these Rules:
(a) Ambulances; 
(b) Fire engines; 
(c) Police Vehicles; 
(d) Military Vehicles except saloon cars and station wagons; 
(e) Motor cycles; 
(f) Omnibuses; 
(g) Taxis; 
(h) Private Cars (School Transport); 
(i) Goods vehicles, except passenger cars, station wagons and other passenger vehicles with a seating capacity of less than twelve persons which are licensed as goods vehicles; 
(j) Private buses and mini-buses with a seating capacity of twelve or more persons; and 
(k) Motor-cars including station wagons and other passenger vehicles, carrying at least four persons at the time of entry into the restricted zone.
 
 
 
The `restricted zone` as demarcated in the First Sch comprises the heart of our city and it is common knowledge that, prior to the enactment of the Rules, during morning and afternoon peak hours the volume of vehicular traffic entering and leaving the `restricted zone` was such as to cause serious traffic congestion, a problem common to all big cities everywhere. The authorities tackled this problem by the enactment of the Rules which came into operation on 2 June 1975. Seventeen days later, on 19 June 1975, taxis were taken out of the categories of vehicles exempted from the provisions of the Rules. On 11 July 1975 the `restricted hours` were extended from `between 7.30am to 9.30am` to `between 7.30am to 10.15am` by amendments to the Rules.
At about 8.40am on 11 December 1975 the respondent, MM Pillay, drove his car into the `restricted zone` without first obtaining an area licence by paying the then prescribed fee of $3. Accordingly he was charged for having contravened r 3. At the trial counsel on his behalf, before any evidence was led, raised a preliminary objection to the charge. It was contended that the Rules were ultra vires in that s 90(1) of the Act did not confer any power on the Minister to make rules to prohibit, except upon payment of a fee, motor vehicles from using any road. The magistrate accepted this contention and acquitted the respondent. The Public Prosecutor now appeals and the sole question for determination is whether or not s 90(1) of the Act gives power to the Minister to make the Rules.
It is contended on behalf of the Public Prosecutor that the Rules have been validly made and are within the powers conferred on the Minister by s 90(1) of the Act which reads as follows: 
 
The Minister may make rules for prescribing the language and script in which any traffic sign, notice, record, application, return or other documents shall be written and may make rules for any purpose for which rules may be made under this Act and for prescribing anything which may be prescribed under this Act and generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect and in any rules made by him may prescribe penalties (not exceeding those provided by s 82 of this Act) for any breach or failure to comply with any such rules.
 
 
 
Reliance is placed upon the words `and generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect`, and the long title of the Act as an enactment `to make provisions for the regulation of traffic on roads and of motor vehicles and otherwise with respect to roads and vehicles thereon...`.
It is argued that in construing the extent of the powers conferred on the Minister to make rules by the words `and generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect` in s 90(1) it is proper to look at the long title of the Act. Looking at the long title, it is submitted that as the Act provides, inter alia, for the regulation of traffic on roads and otherwise with respect to motor vehicles on roads, the power conferred on the Minister by the words `and generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect` enables the Minister lawfully to make rules the purpose of which is to regulate traffic on roads. It is further submitted that the Rules in question are rules for the purpose of easing traffic congestion on roads within defined parts of the city and accordingly are rules the purpose of which is to regulate traffic on roads within the defined parts of the city. On behalf of the respondent it is contended that the primary purpose of the Rules is to impose a fee on motor vehicles entering the `restricted zone` and that s 90(1) of the Act does not empower the Minister to collect fees for entering any road.
In my opinion, it is plain that the combined effect of rr 3 and 8 prohibits only two categories of motor vehicles from entering the `restricted zone`, except upon payment of a fee. The two categories are (a) private buses and mini-buses with a seating capacity of less than twelve persons and (b) private cars, taxis and other passenger vehicles licensed as goods vehicles carrying less than four persons. All other motor vehicles are not affected by the Rules. It follows, in my opinion that prima facie the purpose of the Rules is not to collect fees but to reduce the number of motor vehicles entering the `restricted zone` in order to ease traffic congestion on the roads within the `restricted zone` during the `restricted hours` and the imposition of a fee for entering the `restricted zone` during the `restricted hours` is the means adopted to achieve the desired purpose and is merely incidental thereto.
It is also contended on behalf of the respondent that the power conferred on the Minister to make rules to regulate traffic on roads does not include the power to make rules prohibiting traffic on roads and that the Rules on their true construction prohibit traffic on roads within the `restricted zone`. I am unable to accept this contention. In my judgment the Rules, truly interpreted, do not do so. It is clear from r 8 of the Rules that not 
 all 
 motor vehicles are prohibited from entering the `restricted zone`. It is also clear that vehicles which are in the `restricted zone` are not prohibited by the Rules from using, during the ""restricted hours"", the roads within the `restricted zone`. Accordingly, in my opinion, the Rules do not prohibit traffic on roads within the `restricted zone` and on their true construction they are rules which regulate traffic into and within the `restricted zone`.
Lastly, it is to be observed that s 91 of the Act provides for all rules made under the Act to be published in the 
 Gazette 
 and to be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after publication and for Parliament, if it thought fit, by due resolution to annul any rules made under the Act.
Accordingly, in my judgment the Rules are within the powers conferred on the Minister by s 90(1) of the Act. The appeal is allowed and the case remitted to the trial court for hearing on its merits.

On 19 February 1973 one Sitaram s/o Shonlal (the deceased), a labourer employed by Cheng Meng Furniture Co (Pte) Ltd (Cheng Meng), was pushing a wheelbarrow containing some bags of cement along a path at a building operations work-site known as Woh Hup Complex at Golden Mile, Beach Road, Singapore, when the wheelbarrow went over live electrical cables running along the ground across the path and the said Sitaram was electrocuted. The electrical cables were used for supplying electricity to a motor driving a concrete pump. The work-site was the extension car park annexed to the Woh Hup Complex.
The plaintiffs are an insurance company. The plaintiffs as insurers of Cheng Meng have paid out a sum of $11,160 in respect of the death of the deceased on claims under the Workmen`s Compensation Act.
The plaintiffs say that they are entitled to be indemnified by the defendants and to recover the said sum of $11,160 by rights of subrogation and under the Workmen`s Compensation Act and the plaintiffs claim against the defendants the said sum of $11,160.
The following facts are not in dispute:
 
 
(1) At the material times the defendants were the main contractors in respect of the construction of the Woh Hup Complex and the construction work of the extension car park was sub-contracted to Mr Voon Siong. 
 
(2) The concrete pump was at all material times owned by defendants and used in connection with the construction work at the extension car park. 
 
(3) The electrical cables were used for supplying electricity to the motor driving the concrete pump. 
 
(4) The deceased was a labourer employed by Cheng Meng and that he died on 19 February 1973 as a result of electrocution. 
 
(5) That the plaintiffs as insurers of Cheng Meng have on behalf of Cheng Meng paid out the sum of $11,160 under the Workmen`s Compensation Act in respect of the death of the deceased.
  
 
 
The parties have agreed that the Act applicable to this case is the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 130, 1970 Ed) (the Act).
The accident to the deceased occurred in the following manner.
On 19 February 1973 at 11.45am five employees of Cheng Meng, including the deceased, went in a lorry to the Woh Hup Complex to deliver some bags of cement to a flat on the top floor of the complex where Cheng Meng was carrying on some interior decorating work for the owner of the flat. The bags of cement were unloaded from the lorry and placed on a wheelbarrow, four bags at a time, and wheeled to a place near the lift. The route taken was along a path through the work-site and up a wooden ramp to where the lift was. On the fourth trip to the lift the deceased was pushing the wheelbarrow with two other labourers helping him and near the foot of the wooden ramp the accident happened. The deceased gave a cry and collapsed. Basant Singh one of the labourers tried to pull the wheelbarrow away and he got an electric shock.
Work had been going on in the flat for two weeks before 19 February and during the two weeks things had been brought up to the flat by employees of Cheng Meng almost daily.
According to Basant Singh (PW3) they were told by the security guard to use that route to deliver the goods and they used the same route everytime they went there. He also said that there was no warning sign and no barrier there and there was no sign prohibiting them from entering. He also said that everytime they went there they had to ask the permission of the security guard on duty to use the lift.
After the accident Mr Tan Hwa Peng (PW1), a factory inspector attached to the Ministry of Labour, visited the scene at 3pm. He saw some electrical cables under the wheelbarrow. He noticed that there was some damage to the cables - the insulation had been broken and the conductors within the cables were exposed. The cables originated from a switch box and from the switch box they led to the concrete pump and the cables were lying on the ground just in front of the wooden ramp. He said that the `Danger` sign in Chinese placed near the cables appearing in photo exh P1 was not there where he visited the site.
Mr Tan Seng Siew (PW2), an electrical inspector in the Electricity Dept of the PUB, visited the scene at 2.45pm on the day of the accident. He saw that the cables running from a switch box and they ran first along the wall and then came down to the ground. He cannot recollect if the `Danger` sign in Chinese, appearing in photo exh P1 was there. As far as he could recollect there was no barrier to prevent people from entering the area and there was no sign prohibiting people from entering the area.
Mr Eric Lee Choon Yong (PW4), who was employed as foreman in February 1973 by the defendants, said that his job was to supervise and co-ordinate the construction work that was going on at that time at the Woh Hup Complex and that some of the works were sub-contracted to others to do; that at that time the defendants were not directly involved in the work carried out at the work-site where the accident took place; that the path taken by the deceased up the wooden ramp was one of the routes that people used to take goods to the lifts; that anyone could use the path if they wanted to; that he had no occasion to stop anyone from using that path and that he had not stopped anyone using it; that he did not know if anyone had been stopped using the path; that he could not recall if the cables were lying on the ground before the accident and that he could not recollect if the `Danger` sign in Chinese appearing in photo exh P1 was near the cables before the accident took place.
The plaintiffs allege that the death of the deceased was due to the negligence of the defendants in laying live electrical cables across the path without proper protection, fence or guard and to a breach of statutory duty by the defendants in failing to warn the deceased and others by posting and maintaining proper warning signs in the four official languages that such an electrical circuit existed as required by reg 16(1) of the Building Operations and Works of Engineering Construction Regulations 1971 (the Regulations).
The evidence adduced by the defendants was this. They were the main contractors of the Woh Hup Complex and they sub-contracted all the construction work to Voon Siong. The cables connection from the switch box to the concrete pump was done by Voon Siong`s servants. The cables ran along the wall from the switch box and at the site where the accident took place the cables were hung up on poles six feet above the ground up to the concrete pump. The switch box supplied electricity not only to the concrete pump but also to other equipments and to the quarters of Voon Siong`s workers with the result that the switch had to be left on all the time. On the day of the accident no concreting work was being done, in fact concreting work had stopped a few days previously. Mr Yong Mee Hin (PW1), a director of defendant company, last saw the cables on 16 February, three days before the accident, and the cables were strung up. There were signs at the work-site like `Work in Progress`, `No Trespassing` and `Danger` displayed at the entrance and other prominent places. The employees of Cheng Meng should have used the paved road to get to the lift. The defendants did not employ any security guard at the work-site. During the construction of the extension car park the work-site was under the control of Voon Siong.
It is first submitted on behalf of the defendants that since the plaintiffs claim by right of subrogation the proper plaintiff should be Cheng Meng. The short answer to this submission is that s 20(b) of the Act enables the plaintiffs to sue in their own name.
It is next submitted on behalf of the defendants that there is no right of action in this case for breach of statutory duty as there was no breach of statutory duty towards the deceased as he was not a person for whose benefit the Regulations were made. I agree with this submission.
Regulation 4(1) of the Regulations provides: 
 
It shall be the duty of every contractor and every employer who is undertaking any of the operations or works to which these Regulations apply - (a) to comply with such of the requirements of these Regulations 
 as affect him or any person employed by him ...
 
 
 
It is clear that the Regulations are intended only for the protection of workmen employed by the contractor or employer concerned and a person not so employed has no right of action as a result of a breach of the Regulations.
The main question in this case is whether the defendants are liable at common law for the death of the deceased.
It is submitted on behalf of the defendants that they were not the occupiers of the work-site where the accident took place. In my view there is no substance in this submission.
`Occupier` (as Lord Denning said in 
 Wheat v E Lecon & Co 
 
[1966] AC 552
) is simply a convenient word to denote a person who had sufficient degree of control over premises to put him under a duty of care towards those who came lawfully on the premises. Further on in his judgment Lord Denning said (at p 578): 
 
Wherever a person has a sufficient degree of control over premises that he ought to realize that any failure on his part to use care may result in injury to a person coming lawfully there, then he is an `occupier` and the person coming lawfully there is his `visitor`: and the `occupier` is under a duty to his `visitor` to use reasonable care. In order to be an `occupier` it is not necessary for a person to have entire control over the premises. He need not have exclusive occupation. Suffice that he has some degree of control. He may share the control with others. Two or more may be `occupiers` ...
 
 
 
In Salmondon 
 Torts
, 14th Ed (1965) p 372, it is said that an `occupier` is `he who has the immediate supervision and control and the power of permitting or prohibiting the entry of other persons`. This definition was adopted by Roxburgh J in 
 Hartwell v Grayson, Rollo and Clover Docks Ltd
and by Diplock LJ in the present case. There is no doubt that a person who fulfils that test is an `occupier`. He is the person who says `come in`. But I think that test is too narrow by far. There are other people who are `occupiers,` even though they do not say `come in`. If a person has any degree of control over the state of the premises it is enough.
 
 
 
What are the facts in this case. The defendants were the main contractors for the construction of the whole of the Woh Hup Complex and the defendants sub-contracted the construction work of the extension car park to Voon Siong. The defendants had overall supervision over the sub-contractor and their foreman (PW4) had access to the extension car park and his job was to supervise and co-ordinate the construction work that was going on there.
In my view the defendants were occupiers of the work-site where the accident took place.
Next it is submitted that the deceased was a trespasser and the defendants have no duty to take reasonable care for his protection even from concealed danger. On the facts of this case I am of the view that the deceased was not a trespasser but a licensee. I accept the evidence of Basant Singh (PW3) that they were told to make use of the path to take the bags of cement to the lift. The defendants know that Cheng Meng was doing work for the owner of the flat and that Cheng Meng`s workmen were carrying things to the flat and were going through the work-site. The deceased went there lawfully to bring cement to the flat.
The defendants say that if the deceased was a licensee the only duty owed by them to him was to warn him of concealed dangers actually known to them but neither known nor obvious to the deceased. It is submitted that the cables lying on the ground were large and not concealed and could easily be seen and was not a concealed danger.
There is no dispute that on the day of the accident the cables were lying on the ground across the path. The concealed danger here is not the cables but the electricity which runs along the cables. The concrete pump was not in use and one would not expect that the cables were alive even if one were to see the cables. The evidence of the defendants is that the concrete pump had not been used for a few days prior to the accident. One would except that electricity to the concrete pump would be switched off when the concrete pump was not in use. The reason given by the defendants why this was not done was because the switch box supplied electricity to other parts of the work-site, but that does not mean that the electricity supply to the concrete pump could not be cut off.
The defendants were under a duty of care to the deceased. The defendants had occupational control of the work-site and they were able to see the state of the work-site and what was being done or omitted therein. If anything was wrong they could take steps to rectify it or have it rectified. If there were any danger they could protect the people making use of the path by erecting a barrier or giving a warning or otherwise that there were live cables there.
I find that there was no `Danger` sign in Chinese placed near the cables before the accident. Even if the `Danger` sign was there that was inadequate as it was only in Chinese. I also find that there was no barrier and no signs prohibiting persons from entering the work-site. The evidence is that any person could make use of the path up the wooden ramp. In fact the defendants have failed in their duty of care.
I find that the deceased was not in any way to be blamed for the accident.
For these reasons there must be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum claimed and costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In this suit the plaintiff`s claim was for damages for personal injuries and consequential loss suffered by him and caused, during the course of his employment by the first defendants as a labourer at a worksite in Boat Quay, Singapore, on or about the 19 August 1972 by the negligence of the first and/or the second defendants and/or the third defendant, their servants or agents and/or breach by the first defendants of their duty to the plaintiff as employers of the plaintiff to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff as their servant with costs. This was an action against all three defendants or any of them in the tort of negligence arising out of a general duty of care and or alternatively against the first defendants in their capacity as master arising out of the specific common law duty of a master to take reasonable care for the safety of his servant.
The plaintiff, who was 30 years old at the date of accident, was employed by the first defendants as a labourer to unload goods from their lorries on the quayside into the holds of tongkangs at Boat Quay. The system of unloading goods from such lorries into the holds of the tongkangs was for a crane to lift from such a lorry the goods stacked on pallets, and to lower the laden pallets into a tongkang and for the plaintiff and other workers in the tongkang to stack the goods thus lowered in the holds of the tongkang properly.
On 19 August 1972 the first defendants had a contract to unload cartons of milk into a tongkang at Boat Quay and for this purpose they hired two mobile cranes from the second defendants, one of which was mobile crane No SGC 3797, whose driver was Teng Ann Teng (PW4).
The plaintiff was in a tongkang carrying out his duties as aforesaid in the unloading of the said milk cartons when the said Teng Ann Teng in the course of lowering the cartons of milk stacked on a pallet into the tongkang lowered it on the person of the plaintiff thereby causing him the following injuries as stated by Dr N Balachandran, Senior Orthopaedic Surgeon in his report: 
 
 
(1) Fracture-dislocation of the first lumbar vertebra on the second lumbar vertebra. There was gross displacement and the body of the second lumbar vertebra was crushed. There were associated fractures of the transverse processes of these vertebrae. 
 
(2) There was clinical evidence of complete transection of the lower end of the spinal cord and nerve roots. 
 
(3) Due to the injury to the spinal cord there was total paralysis of all modalities of sensation from the level of the 19th thoracic dermatome downwards (level of waist and umbilious). There was also complete motor paralysis and loss of voluntary control of bladder and rectal function.
  
 
 
The plaintiff was hospitalized immediately and was treated conservatively as a paraplegic. The medical conclusion on the plaintiff, which was uncontested by any of the defendants, was that
 
 
(i) he had sustained a traumatic paraplegia due to injury to his spine, 
 
(ii) he had total loss of sensation and motor power from the waist downwards, 
 
(iii) his bladder and rectal functions were automatic, he having no voluntary control over them, and 
 
(iv) he had lost sexual function.
  
 
 
The case for the plaintiff against the first defendants was that the said accident was caused by the negligence of the first defendants, their servants or agents and/or by the breach of the first defendants of their duty to the plaintiff as employers of the plaintiff as their servant. The case for the plaintiff against the second and/or the third defendants was that the said accident was caused by the negligence of the second and/or the third defendants, their servant or agents.
It was alleged by the plaintiff that the said system was unsafe in that:
 
 
(i) the goods were swung over the heads of the workers in the tongkang; and 
 
(ii) the crane driver was in a position where he could not see the workers in the tongkang.
  
 
 
It was contended for the plaintiff that a safe system of work would have provided that:
 
 
(i) nobody beneath a load that was in the course of being lowered; and 
 
(ii) the crane operator be in full view of the workers in the tongkang and vice versa.
  
 
 
The defence of the first defendants was that the accident was caused wholly or contributed to by the plaintiff`s negligence in that he:
 
 
(a) failed to keep a proper or any look-out for the goods being unloaded; 
 
(b) failed to take reasonable precaution for his own safety; 
 
(c) failed to take reasonable action to avoid the accident.
  
 
 
The first defendants further pleaded in the alternative that the accident was caused wholly by the negligence of either the second defendants, their servants or agents or the third defendant, his servants or agents. They contended that on 19 August 1972 the crane used to lift the goods into the hold of the tongkang together with its two operators, namely, the crane driver, Teng Ann Teng, and signalman, were hired by them from the second defendants and that the second defendants vis-a-vis themselves were independent contractors.
The defence of the second defendants, in the main, was that the said crane did not belong to them and was not operated by their crane driver but by one in the employ of the third defendant, the registered owner of the said crane and that they were merely agents of the third defendants for the purpose of hiring out the said crane to third parties.
The case for the third defendant, while admitting ownership of the said crane, in the main, was that the said crane was at all material times hired to the second defendants and has in their exclusive care, custody control and direction.
It will be noted that none of the three defendants seriously contested the plaintiff`s claim to damages in respect of the injuries suffered by him. What each of them was saying was that in the circumstances of his own case he was not liable but that the other defendant or both were liable to the plaintiff.
On the admissions, documents and evidence, before me I made the following findings of fact:
 
 
(1) that the plaintiff at all material times was employed by the first defendants to unload goods from the first defendants` lorries into tongkangs at Boat Quay (not disputed); 
 
(2) that on 19 August 1972 the plaintiff was in a tongkang in the course of his duties as aforesaid when the said Teng Ann Peng (PW4), the crane operator of a mobile crane No SGC 3797, in the course of lowering cartons of milk laden on a pallet into the hold of the tongkang lowered the said pallet on the plaintiff thereby causing him injuries as aforesaid (not disputed); 
 
(3) that on the day and time in question the said crane was operated by one Teng Ann Peng (PW4) (dispute only as to whose employee he was) and an attendant (admitted that he was employee of second defendants), whose name did not come out at the trial; 
 
(4) on the evidence of Teng Ann Teng (PW4) whom I regard as an entirely satisfactory witness and the evidence of Toh Guan Leng (2 DW2), the manager of the second defendants from 1970-1974, given under cross-examination by plaintiffs counsel, I find that on 16 August 1972 the date of the accident, the crane driver, Teng Ann Teng (PW4) was in the employ of the second defendant and worked to their direction; 
 
(5) that the mobile crane No SGC 3797 on the date and time of the accident was under the care, custody, control and direction of the second defendants; 
 
(6) that the crane used to lift the goods into the hold of the tongkang was hired by the first defendants from the second defendants who were independent contractors and that the second defendants provided the same with a driver (Teng Ann Teng) and an attendant; 
 
(7) that the accident was caused through the negligence of the crane driver and/or the signalman, both employees of the second defendants, in the course of their employment and not contributed to by the plaintiff in any way; 
 
(8) that both the first and second defendants knew that the system of unloading goods from the lorries into the hold of the tongkang was for the crane to lift from the lorry on the quayside the goods which had been stacked on pallets into the hold of the tongkang and for the plaintiff and other workers in the hold of the tongkang to stack the goods so lowered in the hold.
  
 
 
In the view I took of the evidence that the third defendant did not hire out the said crane to the second defendants nor that the crane driver and the signalman thereof were his servants or agents I found no liability against the third defendant. It now remains for me to deal with the liability of the first and second defendants.
 Liability for accident 
The first defendants admitted that the plaintiff was their employee and that it was during the course of such employment while carrying out his duties that the accident took place. It was accepted by the first defendants that it was their duty, in so far as the plaintiff and their other workers in the hold of the tongkang were concerned, to ensure for them a safe system of work. The first defendants also acknowledged that the unloading of goods into the hold of the tongkang entailed the risk of the load falling on the workers whilst working in the hold. The evidence of Tan Tian Hock (1 DW1), the manager of the first defendants, was that no instructions had been given to the crane driver as to how he was to operate the crane nor did any of his workers interfere with the crane driver in his work. His evidence was confirmed by Teng Ann Teng (PW4), the crane driver, when he said `The manner in which I operated the crane is entirely under my control. Nobody from first defendants interfered with my work.` Tan Tian Hock (1 DW1) also said he did give general instructions to the kepala as to how his workers should conduct themselves but no evidence was given as to whether these instructions had been conveyed to the workers in the hold of the tongkang. He admitted that no special instructions were given to the workers nor did he give instructions that there should be a signalman or attendant. He also gave as his view that `the accident perhaps happened because the crane was being lowered too fast`. In answer to question by the court he said, `The most important man is the crane assistant who acts as a signalman as to when to let the load down into the tongkang. The crane driver is entirely dependent on signalman. The speed at which the load is being lowered is the next important.` The crane driver in his evidence said, `When the accident took place I could not see the pallet inside the tongkang. When the last load which caused the accident was being handled I received a signal from the attendant. The workers were on the edge of the tongkang. I can`t say how many. I heard shouts that someone was pinned under the pallet. He gave me signals to lower.`
The plaintiff with regard to the accident said: 
 
I was one of those in the tongkang. Standing at the bottom of the tongkang I could not see the crane driver. The crane attendant`s job was to give signals and instruction to the crane driver. I could see the signalman in the tongkang there was a taikong and his assistant. These two assisted us in the stacking of the goods in the tongkang. Five of us were involved in taking hold of the pallet, bringing it to rest in the tongkang. Then we would take the strings and pull them and hook them back on the hook. At the signal from the signalman this would be lifted and the whole process would be repeated. Then off-loading from the pallet and thereafter stacking the cartons in the tongkang individually. The pallet is then pushed aside. We would wait for five or six pallets to accumulate when we would have them sent back to the lorry from which the goods were being unloaded. When the accident took place there were still several cartons of milk on the pallet. While I was doing this I did not suspect any pallet overhanging me. If I had suspected this I would not have gone underneath. Normally while a pallet was coming over the tongkang I would be standing near the stern out of line of the crane`s movements. I have never experienced goods falling off a pallet. It would be safer to do so. I went down to pick up one such carton, I heard someone shouting `Run, run.` I became frightened. When I was trying to run away I was hit at the back. I knew I was hit by of wood. I don`t know what it was or where it came from. I have since learned that I was hit by a pallet loaded with cartons of milk.
 
 
 
From the above evidence it is clear that the accident was caused by the negligence of both the crane driver, Teng Ann Teng and the signalman, or one of the two jointly responsible for the crane operations, namely, the signalman, both of whom were employees of and under the control of the second defendants. It follows therefore that the plaintiff must succeed in his claim for damages against the second defendants as employers of both the crane driver and the signalman.
Mr Tan Tee Seng, counsel for the first defendants, submitted that, on the authority of 
 Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v Coggins & Griffiths (Liverpool) Ltd and McFarlane 
 [1946] 2 All ER 345 the first defendants are not at all liable but that liability should fall on either the second or third defendants or both. The 
 Mersey Dock`s 
case, in my view, is authority only for saying that, as the crane driver and signalman in the instant case were the employees of the second defendants and under their control and not that of the first defendants, the first defendants would not be liable for the negligent acts of the crane crew committed in the course of their duties. This absolves the first defendants of the first defendants of the first charge against them namely that of causing injury to the plaintiff by their negligence or that of their servants or agents. However, the main charge against the first defendants is that they were in breach of their duty to the plaintiff, as employers, to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff as their servant by failing to provide and maintain a safe system of work, in that he was required to work under a suspended load, and to provide any or adequate supervision. Now, the first defendants admit that in the instant case they had to provide for their employee, the plaintiff, a safe system of work and did not dispute the plaintiff`s claim as to what that safe system should be. But Mr Tan Tee Seng urges on me that, as it was the second defendants who carried out the crane operations as independent contractors and not as agents or servants of the first defendants, on the authority of 
 Winter v Cardiff District Council 
[1950] 1 All ER 819 the first defendants could not be liable and that ultimate liability in the instant case should fall on either the second or the third defendants or both.
Mr Cashin, while conceding that the accident crane and its crew of two had been hired by the first defendants from the second defendants and that the second defendants acted on that occasion as independent contractors, yet urges me to accept the proposition that even where an employer employs an independent contractor and that contractor through the negligence of one or other of his servants or agents causes injury to a servant of the employer, who owes a duty to such servant to provide for and maintain a safe system of work and to provide adequate supervision of such servant in his work, then that employer is also liable to the servant jointly with the independent contractor and cites in his aid the same case of 
 Winter v Cardiff Rural District Council 
 [1950] 1 All ER 819 and that of 
 Basted v Cozens & Sutcliffe 
(1954) 22 Lloyd LR 132.
Generally speaking, an employer is not vicariously liable for the negligence of an independent contractor or his servants in the execution of his contract.
The employer, however, is liable for his own act, neglect and, accordingly, if he contracts with an independent contractor to do some act which he is not entitled to do, or to perform some duty which is thrown upon him, either by statute or common law, he will be liable for the way in which the contractor has performed the act or the duty, even though it be done negligently. Salmon J expressed this view thus: `There are, of course, cases where, by virtue of a contract or by the operation of law, an obligation may be imposed on a man to do an act or to ensure it is done carefully. In such cases the defendant cannot shelter behind any independent contractor, whom he may have employed. If he breaches the obligation he is liable, not in negligence, but in contract ... or by reason of some breach of duty other than a duty to take care ... In such cases the contractor may be regarded as the agent of the employer to perform the primary duty of the employer himself whose liability in such circumstances cannot be vicarious, properly so called. It follows that the employer is liable because he has himself broken his own duty and not because he is liable for his contractor`s negligence.` This principle is conveniently summarized by Denning LJ in these words: `I take it to be clear law, as well as good sense, that, where a person is himself under a duty to use care, he cannot get rid of his responsibility by delegating the performance of it to someone else, no matter whether the delegation be to a servant under a contract of service or to an independent contractor under a contract for services.` (
 Charlesworth on Negligence 
 (6th Ed para 114).
The driver of the crane (PW4) was inexperienced; he had only started to operate a crane for the first time on 16 August 1972 and the accident occurred on 19 August 1972. Further, although the plaintiff was on that day engaged in a repetitive and dangerous operation of loading goods from a quayside lorry into the hold of a tongkang no instructions were given to the workers by the first defendants nor was there any adequate supervision on this particular occasion. I am satisfied that no system of work having in mind the safety of the employees was considered at all by the first defendants. In my judgment the first defendants had failed in their duty to the plaintiff as his employers to take reasonable care for his safety as their servant and are liable in damages to him for the injuries suffered by him as a result of the accident due to such failure.
For the reasons stated above the plaintiff is entitled to succeed against the first and second defendants. It seemed to me that there was nothing to choose between the negligence of the two defendants and that they were equally to blame (
 Basted`s 
case [1954] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 132 at pp 135 and 146).
I gave judgment for the plaintiff by way of damages in the sum of $177,305 and costs, such damages and costs to be equally borne by the two defendants. I dismissed the claim against the third defendant with costs, such costs to be recouped by the plaintiff from the second defendants after payment thereof by the plaintiff.

 R v Faulkner 
 (1972) 56 Cr App R 594; [1972] Crim LR 577 the first one cited to me, in considering whether or not having regard to these two offences, possession of firearms and of some rounds of ammunition, the aggregate sentence of six years, the effect of the consecutive sentence, was much too much. I do not think so. The fact that the district court was limited by law, which is not the same as the maximum which is permissible under the Firearms Act itself, to imposing a term of imprisonment for three years in respect of each offence whether under the Firearms Act or under any other criminal law does not make it a sufficient ground for me to say that the sentence in this particular case, the consecutive sentence, was wrong in principle.
The appeal must be dismissed.

From 1926 until 30 December 1960 the respondent was the sole managing proprietor of a shipping business which he carried on under the style of the Hua Siang Steamship Co. From 1954 until the end of 1960, one of his regular customers was Tiang Seng Chan (Singapore) Ltd (TSC). TSC bought goods which were loaded on to the respondent`s ships at the Sarawak port of Sibu for carriage to Singapore where they were destined to be sold. TSC financed these purchases through loans from the first appellants, who were its bankers in Sarawak. When the goods were loaded on board, Mate`s receipts were used instead of bills of lading. The Mate gave TSC receipts for the goods acknowledging that they had been received on board in apparently good condition and designating the second appellants, who were the first appellants` agents in Singapore, as the consignees of the goods. The Mate`s receipts were passed on by TSC to the banks who advanced money against them. The delivery on board in the above circumstances constituted a delivery to the ship as bailee for the banks and gave the banks a good possessory title to the cargo. It follows that if, on arrival at Singapore, the ship delivered the cargo to TSC or to anyone else without authority from the banks, this would constitute a conversion for which the respondent would be responsible. Nevertheless the respondent pursued a deliberate policy of delivering cargoes to TSC in Singapore without production of the Mate`s receipts, or an authority from the banks or anything else other than an indemnity from TSC. This means that the respondent habitually converted the goods comprising the cargoes and would have been liable in damages had the banks suffered any damage as a result of the conversion. Fortunately for him this did not happen because the goods were turned over quickly in Singapore and TSC were able to make the necessary payments to the banks, and the banks then released the Mate`s receipts which in due course were returned to the respondent.
On 30 December 1960 the respondent caused the Hua Siang Steamship Co Ltd (HSC) to be incorporated. He became Chairman and Managing Director of this company which took over the whole of his shipping business. He, however, retained ownership of the ships which had been used in the business and chartered them to HSC.
From 31 December 1960 onwards, the business was carried on by HSC without any change of policy. More particularly HSC continued the policy of accepting goods on board for which a Mate`s receipt was given designating the banks as consignees and thereafter delivering the goods to TSC in Singapore on their indemnity and without production of Mate`s receipts or any authority from the banks. After the incorporation of HSC the respondent concerned himself with finance, freight-rates and ship repairs whilst his son Chan Kim Yam concerned himself with decisions as to whether or not to release cargo on indemnity. Early in 1961 only a few weeks after the incorporation of HSC the respondent was told by his son of prolonged delays between the delivery of the goods to TSC and the production by TSC of the relevant Mate`s receipts. This suggested that TSC were experiencing difficulties in meeting their obligations to the banks. The respondent immediately went to see the directors of TSC and came to an agreement with them that HSC would thereafter continue to release goods to TSC as before, but only if the directors would on demand give their personal indemnity to HSC against any liabilities which that company might incur arising from such release.
Four shipments of goods were made from Sibu in Sarawak arriving in Singapore between the end of May and the beginning of July 1961. The usual practice was followed. On the arrival of those goods in Singapore, they were all delivered to TSC without the production of any Mate`s receipts or authority from the banks. In order to obtain this delivery, the directors of TSC had, in accordance with the agreement made between them and the respondent early in 1961, given their personal indemnity to HSC, in addition to the indemnity of their company, against any liability which HSC might incur as a result of so delivering the goods to TSC.
Unfortunately, TSC failed to discharge their obligations to the banks in respect of the money which had been advanced by the banks on the security of those goods and of the Mate`s receipts relating to them. The banks then brought an action in the High Court of Malaysia against the respondent and HSC claiming damages for conversion of the goods in question. This action was originally tried before Kulasekaram J who, for reasons to which it is unnecessary to refer, dismissed the claim and entered judgment in favour of both defendants. The banks then appealed to the Federal Court of Malaysia. That appeal was allowed and the judgment of Kulasekaram J was set aside. The Federal Court held that the evidence clearly established conversion against HSC, ordered that judgment should be entered against that company for damages to be assessed and that `the remaining issue as to whether [the respondent] is also liable in conversion be remitted for a retrial.` HSC and the respondent then appealed to this Board from that decision and both appeals were dismissed on 29 March 1971. By that date, the damages against HSC for conversion had been finally assessed as $570,500 and judgment entered for that amount. That judgment remains wholly unsatisfied.
The issue as to whether the respondent was jointly responsible with HSC for the now undisputed conversion by HSC was retried by Winslow J. At that trial the banks put in evidence certain passages from the testimony given by the respondent before Kulasekaram J at the original trial. The banks contended that this evidence afforded strong prima facie proof that the respondent had procured the commission of the conversion by HSC. It is possible that if the respondent had gone into the witness box, he might have explained this evidence away or adduced other evidence which would have thrown a new light on the case exculpating him from liability. On the other hand, his evidence might have made the case against him even stronger than it is, if that is possible. However this may be, the respondent elected not to give any evidence himself nor to call any witness on his behalf. Winslow J held that the respondent was responsible for the conversion but that the action against him was barred by the judgment already entered in favour of the banks for $570,500 against HSC. The banks appealed and the Court of Appeal of Singapore dismissed that appeal on the ground that the action against the respondent was barred as Winslow J had found and also on the ground that Winslow J had erred in holding that the respondent had been a party to the conversion by HSC. From that decision the banks now appeal to this Board.
The facts set out in this judgment are uncontradicted and mostly taken from passages in the respondent`s own evidence before Kulasekaram J. Their Lordships consider that these facts speak for themselves and lead irresistibly to the conclusion reached by Winslow J namely that the respondent was a party to the conversion. In their Lordships` respectful view the Court of Appeal had no grounds for reversing the judgment of Winslow J on this point.
No doubt the fact that the respondent is chairman and managing director of HSC does not of itself make him personally liable in respect of that company`s tortious acts. A tort may be committed through an officer or servant of a company without the chairman or managing director being in any way implicated. There are many such cases reported in the books. If, however, the chairman or managing director procures or directs the commission of the tort he may be personally liable for the tort and the damage following from it. 
 Performing Right Society v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate 
[1924] 1 KB 1
 per Atkin LJ at pp 14 and 15. Each case depends upon its own particular facts. In the instant case the uncontradicted evidence proves that early in 1961 the respondent, as chairman and managing director of HSC, agreed with the directors of TSC the terms upon which HSC would continue wrongfully to convert goods consigned to the banks just as they had done in the past. Their Lordships consider that, in all the circumstances, there is no answer to the appellants` contention that the respondent was personally liable for the conversion in respect of which judgment has been entered against HSC.
There remains the important question as to whether the banks are now entitled to recover judgment against the respondent in respect of the conversion for which he was liable or whether their right to judgment against him is barred by the unsatisfied judgment recovered against HSC. This question depends entirely upon the true construction of s 11(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) (the Act) which, like a number of other legislative enactments throughout the Commonwealth, reproduced s 6(1) of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935. It reads as follows: 
 
(1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) -
 
 
 
 
(a) judgment recovered against any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage shall not be a bar to an action against any other person who would, if sued, have been liable as a joint tortfeasor in respect of the same damage; 
 
(b) if more than one action is brought in respect of that damage by or on behalf of the person by whom it was suffered ... against tortfeasors liable in respect of the damage (whether as joint tortfeasors or otherwise) the sums recoverable under the judgments given in those actions by way of damages shall not in the aggregate exceed the amount of the damages awarded by the judgment first given; and in any of those actions, other than that in which judgment is first given, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to costs unless the court is of opinion that there was reasonable ground for bringing the action; 
 
(c) any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise, so however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought.
  
 
 
According to the common law rule, anyone who suffered damage by reason of a tort jointly committed by a number of persons was deemed to have but one cause of action which emerged in the first judgment which he might recover in respect of it. 
 King v Hoare 
 M & W 494 per Parke B at p 504. Once he recovered final judgment against any tortfeasor, his cause of action in respect of that tort disappeared. He was accordingly barred from subsequently recovering judgment against any other joint tortfeasor responsible for that tort whether in an action commenced before, at the same time as or after the action in which a final judgment had already been recovered.
This was a highly technical and unsatisfactory rule but it prevailed even though the judgment recovered remained unsatisfied and the liability of joint tortfeasors is and always has been joint and several. It mattered not that at the time he recovered judgment, the plaintiff did not know the whereabouts nor even of the existence of the other tortfeasors. The rule often worked injustice on plaintiffs and allowed defendants without a spark of merit, to escape liability. It was laid down as long ago as the reign of James I (see 
 Brown v Wootton 
Cro Jac 73) and survived in the United Kingdom until 1935. Its only possible justification was stated by Blackburn J in 
 Brinsmead v Harrison 
LR 7 CP 547 at p 553: 
 
Is it for the general interest that, having once established and made certain his right by having obtained a judgment against one of several joint wrongdoers, a plaintiff should be allowed to bring a multiplicity of actions in respect of the same wrong? I apprehend it is not; and that, having established his right against one, the recovery in that action is a bar to any further proceedings against the others.
 
 
 
Blackburn J, however, remarked that had the matter been res integra,the American cases cited to the court would have been entitled to great respect. Those cases decided that a judgment against one tortfeasor is no bar to a suit against another and that nothing short of full satisfaction could make such a judgment a bar (see for example 
 Lovejoy v Murray 
 Wal 1).
If the purpose of the rule was to prevent a multiplicity of actions, it undoubtedly did so but at what is now generally recognised as too high a price. It also had an unfortunate by-product which had nothing to do with its purpose in that it prevented a plaintiff who had brought only one action against a number of joint tortfeasors from recovering final judgment, even by consent or default, against any of them without barring his right to judgment against the others. 
 Goldrei, Foucard & Son v Sinclair 
[1918] 1 KB 180
. The Tomlin form of order (which recorded an agreement instead of entering judgment) was often used in an attempt to mitigate the hardships caused by the rule in such a case. It did not, however, by any means, wholly succeed in doing so. A plaintiff was still prevented from taking steps to levy execution against defendants who were prepared to consent to judgment or to allow judgment to be entered against them by default, until the action was finally disposed of against all the other defendants. In the meantime, assets which would otherwise have been available to satisfy the damages might have been put out of the plaintiff`s reach.
There can be little doubt that by the time that s 11(1)(a) of the Act was enacted, it was generally recognized that the common law rule was far too favourable to tortfeasors and produced manifest injustice. Evidently the rule ought to have been expunged in its entirety. The question is - did the legislature succeed in doing so? It is conceded that under para (a) judgment against one tortfeasor is no longer a bar to a subsequent action against another in respect of the same tort. The courts below have, however, decided that on the true construction of the subsection, it leaves the bar against a second judgment firmly in place where two or more joint tortfeasors are sued in the same action in respect of the same tort: in such a case, if judgment is entered against any one of the defendants, it precludes judgment being subsequently entered in that action against any of the other defendants.
Since the only justification which has ever been offered for the rule was that it prevented a multiplicity of actions, it seems incredible that the legislature abolished it insofar as it indubitably prevented multiplicity of actions but left it alive in relation to its impact upon a single action brought against two or more joint tortfeasors - an impact for which no justification has ever been suggested save that it followed logically from the nature of the rule itself.
The construction of the Act which commended itself to the courts below involved further anomalies. Suppose a case in which judgment is entered for Â£X against two joint tortfeasors and they both appeal. The appeal by one (possibly the impecunious one) is dismissed. The appeal of the other is allowed; the judgment against him is set aside and a new trial ordered. At the new trial, the evidence against him is overwhelming. If, however, the construction of the statute which commended itself to the courts below is correct, the defendant would have a complete answer, namely, that the cause of action against him and his co-defendant was one and indivisible; it merged in the judgment against his co-defendant and therefore he is immune.
If the statute abolishes the old rule only insofar as it was intended to prevent multiplicity of actions but leaves it alive insofar as it applies to separate judgments in the same action, the anomalies and indeed the absurdities referred to above are inescapable. It hardly seems possible that they can have been intended; nor does it seem likely that they were overlooked. After all 
 Goldrei, Foucard & Son v Sinclair, 
supra,was just as well known as the Tomlin Order which was commonly used in attempting to avoid some of the unjust consequences of the common law rule.
In the end, whether or not the legislature did abolish the rule in its entirety must depend upon the true construction of para (a) which has never yet been the subject of judicial decision. In other cases, for example in 
 George Wimpey & Co Ltd v BOAC 
[1955] AC 169
 the meaning of para (c) (which deals with the rights and liabilities of tortfeasors inter se) was considered and decided. There are no doubt similarities of structure and phraseology in paras (a) and (c) but as Lord Reid pointed out at p 188 the language of the subsection does not appear to be used accurately and its drafting is so defective that it would be unsafe to rely upon any inference from the similarity of expression in the paragraphs comprising it.
It is, of course, a canon of construction that a statute should not be construed as altering the common law any further than it does so expressly or by necessary implication. It is, however, also a canon of construction that a statute should not be construed in such a way as to lead to injustice or absurdity unless its language makes no other course possible. Although para (a) could easily have been couched in much simpler and more explicit language, their Lordships consider that it expresses with reasonable clarity the intention of the legislature to abolish the common law rule in its entirety.
The crucial words in para (a) are `any other person who would, if sued, have been liable`. Whether or not a person is liable for a tort cannot, apart from the context of those words, depend upon whether or not he is sued. He is liable for the tort from the moment when he commits it. But para (a) contemplates the case of a person being `liable` only `if sued`. A person is 
 held liable 
only when he is 
 sued to judgment, 
not at the moment when he is sued. Accordingly, to construe the words `if sued` as meaning `if sued to judgment` and the word `liable` as `held liable` is not to put a strained meaning upon words (as argued on behalf of the respondent) but to give them their ordinary and natural meaning in their context in para (a). The paragraph begins by postulating that a person has recovered judgment against tortfeasor A for damages suffered as the result of a tort. It then goes on to state the circumstances in which that judgment shall not bar an action against tortfeasor B who was jointly responsible for the same tort. It does this by reference to a hypothetical action. It supposes such an action being brought against both A and B and lays down that if in such a hypothetical action B would, under the common law, have been held liable if sued to judgment, then the actual judgment already recovered against A shall not be a bar to an action against B.
If judgment in the hypothetical action had first been recovered against A, there could not, at common law, have subsequently been any judgment against B. Paragraph (a) must therefore assume that in the hypothetical action there can have been only one judgment against A and B. Unless that assumption is made, para (a) is wholly nugatory. If it is made, it deprives B, in the actual action brought against him, of the immunity which he would have enjoyed at common law as a result of the judgment already recovered against A. This would follow whether in the actual action A were sued jointly with B (as in the present case) or whether the action against A had been instituted before or after the action against B.
Their Lordships accordingly conclude that para (a) abolishes the old common law rule in its entirety; it does not abolish that part of it which according to one view may have been defensible and preserve the other part which is indefensible from any point of view save that it may have followed logically from the part which has been abolished. Their Lordships consider that this construction of para (a) accords equally with the manifest intention of the legislature and with fairness and commonsense.
It has been rightly pointed out that para (b) does not contemplate a single action but only a number of actions; moreover it limits only the amount of money to be awarded in judgments which may be recovered after the judgment in the first action and gives a discretion as to costs only in actions subsequent to the first. This is certainly true. It is argued that it follows from this that since para (b) applies no limit to the amount recoverable in judgments given in one action against joint tortfeasors and makes no provision for any special discretion as to costs in such an action, para (a) cannot be intended to apply to separate judgments given in one action. Their Lordships cannot accept this argument. Paragraph (b) is clearly devised merely to discourage the multiplicity of actions which the old rule was designed to prevent. Since more than one judgment being given in a single action has nothing to do with a multiplicity of actions, there is no reason why any express provision should be made to limit the amount of damages recoverable under such judgments nor to give any special discretion in respect of costs.
The House of Lords has decided that when the court assesses the damages to be awarded against joint tortfeasors in a single action only one sum can be awarded - 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome 
[1972] AC 1027
. In that case the House`s attention was not called to the Act from which the Act now under consideration derives. That decision, however, compels a court called upon to assess damages in one action against individual tortfeasors to assess the same amount against each joint tortfeasor. This, as a rule, would be the normal course to adopt quite apart from authority. The amount of damages awarded for a tort is normally awarded as compensation for the amount of damage which that tort has caused the plaintiff. Each joint tortfeasor, irrespective of the degree of his blame vis-a-vis other joint tortfeasors, is liable to the plaintiff for the whole of the damage which the tort has caused him. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment against each of the joint tortfeasors for the whole of the damage which he has suffered but he cannot recover in the aggregate more than the sum at which that damage is assessed. The present is such a case. It is only in a very special case, for example where punitive damages may be awarded, that it could ever have been even arguable that different sums of damage could have been awarded against different joint tortfeasors in respect of the same tort.
It has also been argued that it would be unfair to allow the appeal because the court would be bound to award the same damages against the respondent as were assessed against HSC - and the respondent was not heard when that assessment was made. This argument has a hollow ring. Throughout this litigation up to the first appeal before this Board the respondent and HSC were jointly represented. When the order was made for damages to be assessed against HSC the respondent could, had he wished to do so, have applied to be separately represented at the assessment because in the event of his losing on the issue of liability he might be bound by the assessment of damages. He made no such application. This is hardly surprising. As chairman and managing director of HSC he would presumably have had every opportunity to give such instructions as he thought fit to those appearing for that company when the assessment was made.
For these reasons their Lordships will allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and of the High Court and remit the case to the High Court with a direction that judgment for $570,500 be entered for the appellants. The respondent must pay the costs of the appeal to their Lordships` Board and the costs in both courts below.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant is the administrator of the estate of Veeranan deceased. On 22 January 1968 the deceased met with an accident when he was a member of a gang engaged in loading a cargo of planks from the wharfside at the Port of Singapore into the holds of an adjacent ship. Each member of this stevedoring gang was in the regular employment of the respondent which engaged them, paid them, prescribed the jobs which they should undertake and alone had the power of dismissing them. The shipowners paid the respondent for the stevedoring services which it rendered in accordance with the provisions of ss 45 to 49 of the Straits Settlements Ports Ordinance of 1912.
The only members of the gang concerned in the accident suffered by the deceased were the deceased himself, a winchman and a signalman. It is unnecessary to give anything except a brief description of this accident. The deceased`s job was to secure a load of planks with a chain and attach each end of the chain to the cable hook of one of the ship`s winches. The winchman`s job was to hoist the load and then lower it into one of the ship`s holds. He should not, however, commence this operation until he received the signal from the signalman to do so because the winchman could see neither the deceased nor the load and had no means of knowing that it was safe to operate the winch until he received the signal. The signalman`s job was to give the signal to hoist after he had satisfied himself that it was safe to do so. In fact, the winchman lifted the load together with the deceased, whose thumb had been caught in the chain securing the load, to a height of 40 feet from which the deceased fell to the ground and suffered grave injuries.
At the trial, it was agreed that the accident had been caused by the negligence of the winchman and/ or the signalman and contributed to by the negligence of the deceased: it was also agreed that if, in law, the respondent was vicariously liable for the negligence of the signalman and winchman, the blame should be apportioned as to 75% to the respondent and 25% to the deceased. Damages were agreed at a total of $80,000; so that if the appellant had succeeded on the law he would by consent have recovered judgment for $60,000.
The relevant points of law were:
 
 
(1) Did by-law 26 of the respondent`s By-Laws, on its true construction, exempt the respondent from any liability to the appellant? 
 
(2) If the respondent was right on this first point, was by-law 26 ultra vires s 75 of the Straits Settlements Ports Ordinance of 1912 (which empowered the respondent to make By-Laws) or unreasonable and therefore of no effect?
  
 
 
These two points of law had both been decided by the Court of Appeal in the respondent`s favour in 
 Alishakkar v Port of Singapore Authority 
Singapore. (Civil Appeal No 25 of 1972, Suit No 652 of 1970) - a case which is indistinguishable from the present in so far as the effect of by-law 26 is concerned.
The only difference between 
 Alishakkar 
and the present case concerns the facts. In the former case it was held that no negligence had been proved against anyone but that even if negligence had been established against any member of the respondent`s gang, the respondent would have been protected by by-law 26, whereas in the present case, as already indicated, it was admitted that the members of the respondent`s gang had been negligent and that the injuries to the deceased were attributable 75% to that negligence and 25% to the negligence of the deceased.
The decision in 
 Alishakkar 
was treated as binding on the learned trial judge and also on the Court of Appeal. The respondent accordingly succeeded in the present case at first instance and on appeal. Leave to appeal to this Board was granted to the appellant by the Court of Appeal on 2 August 1976.
It may perhaps be useful in examining the judgment under appeal, to consider what the legal position would have been at common law, had By-Law 26 never existed. Clearly, in such circumstances, the respondent would not have had, nor has it been suggested that the respondent could have had, any defence to the claim against it. It has long been established that the onus of proof 
 
rests on the general or permanent employer - in this case the appellant board - to shift the prima facie responsibility for the negligence of servants engaged and paid by such employer so that this burden in a particular case may come to rest on the hirer who for the time being has the advantage of the service rendered.
 
 
 
 
 
 Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) 
 
[1947] AC 1
 per Viscount Simon at p 10.
Their Lordships` attention has not been drawn to any case since 
 Donovan v Laing 
 
[1893] 1 QB 629
 in which this burden has been successfully discharged. 
 Donovan`s 
case came in for a good deal of criticism in the 
 Mersey Docks 
case with which their Lordships respectfully agree. Viscount Simon said at p 11: 
 
... if that decision is upheld, it must be on the basis found in the words of Lord Esher MR, when he said: `The man was bound to work the crane according to the orders and under the entire and absolute control of` the hirers.
 
 
 
Lord Macmillan in referring to 
 Donovan`s 
case said at p 14: 
 
The current of subsequent authorities has set against this case and the opinions of the learned judges who have commented on it have been largely concerned with distinguishing and explaining it, if not explaining it away.
 
 
 
Lord Simonds at p 18 said of anyone in the position of the present respondent that they could escape liability only: 
 
... if they can show that 
 pro hac vice
the relation of master and servant has been temporarily constituted between [the ship and the members of the gang] and temporarily abrogated between [the respondent and those members]. This they [could] do only by proving, in the words of Lord Esher MR in 
 Donovan v Laing
[1893] 1 QB 629
, 632 that `entire and absolute control` over the [gang] had passed to the [ship].
 
 
 
In the 
 Mersey Docks 
case, the appellant Board had hired out to the respondent company, who were master stevedores, a mobile crane with a skilled driver. The hiring contract provided that the driver should, whilst on hire, be the servant of the stevedores. Owing to the driver`s negligence in manipulating the crane, a man checking the goods to be transferred from shed to ship by means of the crane was seriously injured. It was held unanimously by the Court of Appeal and by the House of Lords that the appellant Board and not the stevedores were liable for the injuries caused by the crane driver. Each of the noble and learned Lords made it plain in their speeches that servants cannot be transferred from the service of one master to that of another without their consent, express or implied, and that the onus of establishing that consent rests on the master by whom the servant is paid. They also relied upon 
 M`Cartan v Belfast Harbour Commissioners 
[1911] 2 IR 143 HL and 
 Ainslie v Leith Harbour and Docks Commissioners 
 SC 676 and in particular upon the speech of Lord Dunedin in the former, and the judgment of Lord Mackenzie in the latter case to support the view that partial control by the hirer is not enough but that entire and absolute control is necessary in order to transfer liability for the negligence of the servant from the shoulders of the employer who engages, pays and regularly employs and can alone dismiss him on to the shoulders of those who have hired the servant`s services from his regular employers.
Their Lordships recognize that the authorities relied on by the appellant are mostly concerned with the hiring out by a port authority of a travelling crane with a skilled driver to be used for loading or unloading a ship. The principles enunciated in those cases cannot, however, be confined to that particular fact. They are of general application.
No doubt it may be somewhat less difficult to produce acceptable evidence that the servants of a port authority whose services alone have been hired out to a ship agreed to put themselves under the entire and absolute control of the ship than that the skilled driver in the service of a port authority and in charge of a travelling crane hired out by the port authority agreed to put himself in such a position. But the task in either case is likely to be formidable, particularly when the services rendered are stevedoring services. In 
 Cameron v Nystrom 
[1893] AC 308
 Lord Herschell LC said at p 312: 
 
Reliance was placed upon expressions used in the evidence, with regard to the extent to which the mate and master had the right to direct and control the acts of the stevedores` servants. That does not seem to their Lordships in the least inconsistent with their being the servants of the stevedores, and not the servants of the shipowner. There was no express agreement with regard to the extent to which the master and mate should have control over them. That control is only to be implied from the circumstances in which they were employed. The relation of stevedore to shipowner is a well-known relation, involving no doubt the right of the master of the vessel to control the order in which the cargo should be discharged, and various other incidents of the discharge, but in no way putting the servants of the stevedore so completely under the control and at the disposition of the master as to make them the servants of the shipowner, who neither pays them, nor selects them, nor could discharge them, nor stands in any other relation to them than this, that they are the servants of a contractor employed on behalf of the ship to do a particular work.
 
 
 
See also 
 Murray v Currie 
(1870) LR 6 CP 24.
It seems to be a natural inference from the facts that the respondent was rendering stevedoring services to the ship under contract with the shipowners. Unfortunately the agreed facts were not put into writing: there is no record of them except what appears to be a tenuous note of what counsel said at the trial. This note does not, for example, disclose the size of the respondents` gang or whether it included a foreman. Having regard to the burden of proof it certainly cannot be assumed that it did not. If there was a foreman in charge of the gang, it puts the respondent out of court. If there was no foreman, it certainly does not establish the respondent`s case. There is no need to recite the note of what counsel said because, rightly, it has never been argued on behalf of the respondent that the facts referred to in it could possibly discharge the burden of proof which admittedly rests upon the respondent. This no doubt is why, in the courts below, and therefore necessarily before this Board, the respondent has relied solely upon by-law 26.
Their Lordships have dealt with the principles and the authorities relating to this branch of the law because they do, in their Lordships` view, throw considerable light on the true construction of by-law 26.
The by-law 26 which dates from 5 December 1913 reads as follows: 
 
The serangs and labourers employed in discharging and loading vessels shall be under the superintendence of the ship`s officers; the Board undertake no responsibility as stevedores.
 
 
 
Their Lordships consider that this by-law falls far short of putting the servants of the respondent under the entire and absolute control of the ship. It does not seem to their Lordships in the least inconsistent with their being the servants of the respondent, and not the servants of the shipowners. It throws no light upon the extent of the superintendence of the ship`s officers. Superintendence is a somewhat loose and ambiguous word. For example a building owner`s architect superintends on behalf of the building owner the work of the building contractor`s workmen, but this does not make them the building owner`s servants. The ship`s officers no doubt have the right to superintend the loading by directing into which holds the cargo is to be loaded and the order in which it is to be loaded but this in no way puts the servants of the respondent so completely and entirely under the control and at the disposition of the ship`s officers as to make them the servants of the shipowners, who neither pay them, nor select them, nor could discharge them. Incidentally it does not seem feasible that the ship`s officers would be watching the signalmen to see that they did not give the signal to hoist when it was unsafe to give it nor the winchmen to see that they did not begin to hoist until they had received the signal to do so.
Had it been the intention of by-law 26 to shift the prima facie responsibility of the respondent for the negligence of servants engaged and paid by them on to the shoulders of the shipowners, nothing would have been easier than to do so in plain words. This indeed was done in s 97B of the Port of Singapore Authority Act as amended in 1971 - which is strikingly different from by-law 26. That section reads as follows: 
 
Any stevedore or workman whilst engaged in performing work in or in respect of any vessel shall, notwithstanding that his wage or remuneration for performing the said work is paid by the Authority, be deemed to be the servant of the owner and master of such vessel and the Authority shall be exempt from all liability for any loss or damage caused by any act, omission or default of such stevedore or workman.
 
 
 
Their Lordships do not consider that by-law 26 is of any assistance to the respondent which is being sued in its capacity as an employer. The action is brought by the representative of one of its deceased servants in respect of the negligence of the deceased`s fellow servants for which the respondent is vicariously liable. Its liability for the negligence of its servants does not spring from any undertaking it has given. It is imposed upon the respondent by the common law. In their Lordships` view, by-law 26 does not exclude that liability, nor transfer any part of it on to the shoulders of the shipowners.
In 1913 the doctrine of common employment still prevailed: and that no doubt would have constituted a complete defence to the appellant`s claim. That doctrine, however, has long since disappeared. The respondent is vicariously liable for the negligence of its servants if such negligence causes personal injury to a fellow servant or to a member of the public. In their Lordships` view the fact that the negligence occurred in the course of a stevedoring operation does not afford the respondent any defence.
Having regard to their Lordships` views about by-law 26 it is unnecessary to deal with the argument that that by-law was ultra vires or unreasonable.
Their Lordships will therefore allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered for the appellant for $60,000 with costs here and below.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 11 February 1976 the appellant was found guilty by the High Court of murder, and sentenced to death. Murder being an offence punishable by death, he was tried by a court consisting of two judges, whose decision had to be unanimous for him to be convicted of the offence: Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) s 185(1) and (2). The trial, which extended over 12 days, was notable for a painstaking and meticulous examination by the two judges of the evidence of eye-witnesses and doctors. The appellant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The appeal was dismissed on 12 August 1976. Now, by special leave granted on 9 December 1976, he appeals against conviction to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
Three questions have been canvassed before this Board:
 
 
(1) the cause of death, 
 
(2) whether the appellant was so intoxicated as to be incapable of forming the intent necessary to constitute the offence of murder, 
 
(3) the defence of `sudden fight` which, if proved by an accused, reduces the offence to one of culpable homicide: Exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) and s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 5, 1970 Ed).
  
 
 
At the time of his death the deceased was 54 years of age and was employed as a lorry driver. The appellant was also 54 years of age and was employed as a lorry attendant by the same firm. The two men were friends. Both of them lived at No 8 Pulau Saigon Road, where they had separate rooms in a store belonging to their employer. The store was adjacent to a yard, which was used for a variety of industrial purposes including the loading, unloading, and parking of lorries.
On 25 May 1975, a Sunday, their employer`s manager, Tan Chwee Siong, who gave evidence, went to the store at about 7.40pm to ask the two men to load and deliver some timber that night. As soon as he approached them, he realized they were highly intoxicated. He, therefore, made no request of them but told them to go and sleep. He went to this office where shortly before 8pm they asked if they could do the job the following morning. He agreed, and left. He said they were, when he saw them in his office, unsteady on their feet.
There then occurred the incident in which the deceased lost his life. The trial judges, faced with conflicting evidence of two eye-witnesses, Phasaram Misa, an office boy aged 16, and Saeroen bin Rakiman, an old man (76 years old), accepted the evidence of Misa in preference to that of Saeroen whom they found to be an unreliable witness. Misa first saw the appellant and deceased sitting on a stack of poles. The two men were talking loudly and laughing. They got down from the stack and then began to argue. The argument degenerated into wrestling. As they grappled with each other, they fell down, got up, and fell down again. This happened several times. They punched each other, as they fought. Suddenly the appellant ran toward the store of No 8 Pulau Saigon Road, where a lorry was parked, and returned with the exhaust pipe of a motor vehicle. He then rushed at the deceased, who was standing up, and delivered one blow on his head with the exhaust pipe. The deceased tried to defend himself with his hands, but almost at once fell to the ground. The appellant then hit at his head three or four times with the exhaust pipe. He then threw the exhaust pipe on the ground, and walked away. The deceased was lying in a pool of blood. When the ambulance arrived at 9pm, the deceased was found to be dead.
The appellant was medically examined at the Changi Prison Hospital at about 2.30am. The doctor noted that his breath smelt of alcohol, that his gait was staggering, and that he had a sub-conjunctival haemorrhage in the right eye and that he had an abrasion of some five inches over the back of the right forearm. When his blood was analysed, it was found to contain 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. An autopsy of the deceased revealed the following fractures:
 
 
(1) comminuted fractures in the region of the left forehead, 
 
(2) comminuted fractures involving both temporal bones (ie behind each ear), 
 
(3) a fracture line across the base of the skull.
  
 
 
Dr Seah, who conducted the autopsy, also gave evidence and was subjected to a prolonged cross-examination by defence counsel, in the course of which he conceded that there was a number of possibilities as to the cause of death including that of a fall. He concluded that the fractures to the left forehead occurred after death because they were not associated with any haemorrhage, and gave as his opinion that most probably the deceased died of a fractured skull resulting from two blows with a blunt instrument behind the ears.
The appellant did not give evidence, but made an unsworn statement from the dock. In a short statement made by him under caution, and given in evidence, he said: 
 
The fight started because I told Arunmugam not to drink when he drove lorries. He got angry and punched me on the eye. He also used a wood to hit me on my left hand. I got angry and hit him back. I do not remember with what I hit him. I had no intention to kill him. I did not know he will die. That`s all.
 
 
 
The trial judges found that the deceased was standing up when the appellant delivered the first blow, that the cause of death was a fractured skull, and that the appellant inflicted the fatal blows. In their grounds of decision they dealt at length with what they said was `the main question` for their consideration, namely the appellant`s intention, and stated their conclusion in these terms: 
 
After considering all the evidence ... we were of the view that the action of the accused could not possibly be the action of a person who was so severely intoxicated that he could not form the intention to inflict the fatal blows.
 
 
 
The evidence, they said, clearly showed that he intended to cause the injuries which resulted in death.
On appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal reviewed the evidence and concluded that there were no grounds at all for disturbing the conviction of murder.
Mr Heald QC for the appellant has sought to attack the judges` finding as to cause of death on the ground that there is an inconsistency between the opinion of Dr Seah and the evidence of Misa. The doctor said the fracture of the left forehead was a postmortem injury: the boy said the first blow, which was struck while the deceased was still standing, was a blow to the left forehead. Mr Heald submitted that the boy`s evidence can only be accepted, if the doctor`s opinion be rejected. So grave an inconsistency throws substantial doubt, it is said, upon the prosecution case. The trial judges were careful to make no finding as to the precise region of the head where the first blow landed. They were, however, satisfied that the deceased was standing up when first struck on the head and asserted that `there was no doubt` that it was the accused who inflicted the fatal blows. Misa may, or may not, have accurately observed where the first blow landed. Whether he did or not, the totality of the evidence was such that the judges were well justified in reaching the conclusion that they did. Mr Heald also suggested that, since the doctor accepted under cross-examination that death could have been caused by any one of four possible causes, the trial judges must have departed from the standard of proof required in a criminal trial when they found as a fact that death was caused by a blow. The doctor`s opinion, however, remained that death was most probably caused by a blow, or blows, and upon the totality of the evidence the judges` finding was well justified.
We have expressed an opinion upon these submissions because, having heard them developed in argument, we have thought it helpful to make plain our opinion that the trial judges` findings were soundly based. But it is not the function of this Board to review findings of fact. The principles of our jurisdiction are well known. It is not for us to test or weigh evidence. If there be, as in this case there plainly was, evidence upon which the court of trial could find as it did, the Judicial Committee does not interfere.
These observations apply equally to the question of the appellant`s intent. Mr Heald`s submission that the evidence does not warrant the finding that the appellant was capable of forming and did form the intent necessary for murder is misconceived. The trial judges had no doubts at all. Their finding has been reviewed and upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Board would intervene only if it could be demonstrated that there was no evidence upon which a fair-minded tribunal could have reached the finding: and that is not this case.
The third question, however, does present some difficulty. The Penal Code is largely derived from, and very close in many of its provisions to, the Indian Penal Code. The provisions we have to consider are also to be found in the Indian Code. Culpable homicide is defined by s 299 of the Penal Code. Section 300 specifies the four cases in which culpable homicide is murder. The section, so far as relevant to the present case, provides: 
 
300 Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder -
 
 
 
 
... 
 
(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death;
  
 
 
Exception 4 provides: 
 
Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
 
 
 
The burden of proving the exception rests upon the defendant: s 105 of the Evidence Act.
The exception was not relied upon by the defence either at trial or before the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is not mentioned in the judgments of the High Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal. Can it now be raised for the first time?
Where trial has been by jury and the burden of proof is upon the prosecution to negative the defence, it is settled law that the judge must put to the jury all matters which upon the evidence could entitle the jury to return a lesser verdict than murder. And, if the judge fails to do so, the Board will intervene, even if the matter was not raised below. For otherwise there would be the risk of a failure of justice. In 
 Kwaku Mensah v R 
[1946] AC 83
, Lord Goddard, giving the reasons of the Board for allowing the appeal, said, at p 94: 
 
The principles on which this Board acts in criminal cases are well known and need no repetition, but when there has been an omission to place before the jury for their consideration a matter of such grave importance that they were never led to consider whether in this respect the prosecution had discharged the onus which lay on them of proving murder as distinct from manslaughter, their Lordships think that they can properly entertain the appeal. They would add that it must be seldom that they consider a matter which was not only not mentioned in the courts below, but was not included in the reasons given by the appellant in his case.
 
 
 
Although different considerations arise where, as here, the burden of proving the defence or exception is upon the defendant and trial is by judge (or judges) alone, Mr French for the Public Prosecutor has not contended either that s 105 of the Evidence Act, or the mere fact of trial being by judge alone, precludes the Board from considering a defence not raised below. But he does raise the point that it does not follow from a judge`s silence as to a possible defence that he has ignored it. He may have thought the matter too plain for argument - more especially, if it has not been raised by the defence. Moreover it would not, in our judgment, assist the administration of criminal justice if there were to be cast upon the High Court the duty of reciting in judgment only to reject every defence that might have been raised but was not. Nevertheless there will be cases in which justice requires the Board to consider matters not mentioned in the court below. It is to be noted that in India, where there is also no trial by jury and the burden of proving the exception of `sudden fight` is upon the defendant, the Supreme Court of India has considered and given effect to the exception, substituting a verdict of culpable homicide for one of murder, although the exception had not been relied on at trial: see 
 Budhwa v State of Madhya Pradesh 
AIR 1954 SC 652. In our judgment a defence based upon an exception which the defendant has to prove may be raised for the first time before the Board, if the Board considers that otherwise there would be a real risk of failure of justice. The test must be whether there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal could find the defence made out. If there be such evidence, the court of trial should have expressly dealt with it in its judgment and the Judicial Committee will deal with it on appeal, even though it has not been raised below.
We turn now to the question whether in the present case the evidence was such that the High Court could have reasonably concluded that the defence of sudden fight was made out. There was evidence that the act causing death was done without premeditation. In 
 Kirpal Singh v State 
AIR 1951 Punjab 137, a case in which the exception (no 4 to s 300 of the Indian Penal Code) was raised unsuccessfully, Bhandari J said (para 14 of his judgment) that `to constitute a premeditated killing it is necessary that the accused should have reflected with a view to determine whether he would kill or not`: in other words, there must be an element of design or prior planning. In the present case there was evidence that suggested strongly the absence of any element of design or planning. There was also evidence that the blow, or blows, were struck `in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel`, though there was also evidence (ie going in search of the weapon, returning with it, and striking the deceased when he appeared to be neither aggressive nor on his guard) which suggested the contrary. But formidable difficulties face the appellant when he attempts to show that the act causing death was committed `without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner`. The appellant, who had been engaged in a fight with the deceased, ran to get a weapon and returned to attack the defenceless deceased with a truly murderous weapon, the exhaust pipe, a photograph of which we have seen. The evidence of the assault shows that the deceased was taken by surprise and attacked with a very unusual and unexpected weapon, a heavy blow on the head from which could reasonably be expected to be lethal. In one of the Indian cases to which we were most helpfully referred, 
 Sarjug Prasad v State 
AIR 1959 Patna 66, K Sahai J commented that `undue advantage ... means unfair advantage`. In the face of the evidence, we do not see how the appellant could prove that he had not taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
There was, therefore, no need for the trial judges to refer to the exception in judgment. Indeed, had the trial been a jury trial, we doubt whether the judge would have considered it necessary to put the defence to the jury. In our judgment, therefore, the appellant`s argument based on the exception of `sudden fight` fails.
It follows that the appeal must be dismissed. We would, however, respectfully wish to draw the attention of those whose duty it is to advise the President on the death sentence that the offence was committed over two years ago, and that there are mitigating factors worthy, it may be thought, of consideration before a decision is taken in regard to the sentence.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The sole question arising for determination on this appeal is whether the deceased motorcyclist, whose estate is represented by the first respondents, was guilty of contributory negligence on the facts found by the trial judge and accepted by counsel for the appellant. A lorry-cum-trailer driven by the second respondent along Anson Road in the direction of Robinson Road entered its junction with Maxwell Road when the traffic lights were in its favour. The appellant was driving a motor car. The deceased and the appellant drove their respective vehicles along Maxwell Road from the direction of Shenton Way. The deceased jerked to a stop about three feet away from the off-side of the lorry, inside the junction but the appellant`s car which was travelling on the off-side of the deceased`s motorcycle and to its rear entered the junction without stopping and collided with the towbar of the lorry. This resulted in the car spinning to its right as it was dragged forward by the lorry and thereby colliding with the deceased`s motorcycle.
The motorcyclist died as a consequence of the appellant`s undoubted negligence as found by the trial judge which is not disputed before us. The sole contention of counsel for the appellant is that, notwithstanding the negligence of the appellant in driving into the junction when it was unsafe to do so and thereby colliding with the lorry-cum-trailer and the deceased motorcyclist whose death he caused by negligence, the deceased also caused or contributed to his own injury and was part author of his own misfortune.
On the principle emerging from 
 Radburn v Kemp 
[1971] 1 WLR 1502
 it is clear that the deceased motorcyclist and the appellant who was driving his car on a parallel course to that taken by the deceased into the junction were both negligent in entering that junction at a time when the lorry was already well inside that junction and right across their paths. 
 Radburn`s 
 case establishes that even if at that stage the lights in Maxwell Road had changed to green in favour of the deceased and the appellant when they entered the junction it would nevertheless have been negligent on their part to proceed into the junction in the prevailing circumstances. As Edmund Davies LJ in 
 Radburn`s 
 case described the position of persons like the deceased and the appellant: 
 
the defendant driver had no business, despite the lights being in its favour, to enter the junction at all unless he was satisfied that it was safe for him to do so, and, once he had entered it, no right to proceed further across the junction without taking the utmost care to save harmless people who rightly were already on the junction before he entered it.
 
 
 
They would both undoubtedly have been negligent had the lights been then against them as they more probably were. The deceased motorcyclist, however, jerked to a stop about three feet short of the lorry whereas the appellant who had been pursuing a parallel course to that taken by the deceased but on the deceased`s right and slightly to his rear proceeded into the junction and failed to avoid the lorry-cum-trailer with whose towbar an impact took place resulting in his spinning round to his right and being dragged along in circumstances which caused his car to collide with the deceased motorcyclist who was then in a stationary position sandwiched between the appellant`s car and the trailer at almost the same time as or immediately after he, the appellant, came into collision with the lorry-cum-trailer.
The important question which arises for determination, as urged upon us by counsel for the appellant, is whether by placing himself in that position three feet short of the off-side of the lorry-cum-trailer as it was crossing the paths taken by both the deceased and the appellant, the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. It is not in dispute that the lorry driver was not guilty of any negligence at all as found by the trial judge.
Contributory negligence when set up as a defence does not depend on any duty owed by the injured party to the party sued and all that is necessary to establish such a defence is for the appellant to prove that the deceased did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed, by his want of care, to his own injury (see 
 Nance v British Columbia Electric Railway Co 
[1951] 2 All ER 448 per Viscount Simon at 450).
After referring to the full analysis of the legal concepts involved by the English Court of Appeal in 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) 
[1949] 2 KB 291
. Viscount Simon continued: 
 
This, however, is not to say that in all cases the plaintiff who is guilty of contributory negligence owes to the defendant no duty to act carefully. Indeed, it would appear to their Lordships that in cases relating to running-down accidents like the present such a duty exists. The proposition can be put even more broadly. Generally speaking, when two parties are so moving in relation to one another as to involve risk of collision, each owes to the other a duty to move with due care, and this is true whether they are both in control of vehicles, or both proceeding on foot, or whether one is on foot and the other controlling a moving vehicle.
 
 
 
A plea that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence is wide enough to cover the contention that he was careless of his own safety, even though he may not have owed a duty to the appellant to be careful.
Viscount Simon referred to the fact that it is, perhaps, unfortunate that the phrase, `contributory negligence` uses the word `negligence` in a sense somewhat different from that which the latter word would bear when negligence is the cause of action and observed that in the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 of the United Kingdom Parliament (which is similar to our corresponding Act in Singapore), the contrast between the two meanings is recognized. That Act provides for a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, and `fault` is defined as being: 
 
... negligence, breach of statutory duty or other act or omission which gives rise to a liability in tort or would, apart from this Act, give rise to the defence of contributory negligence.
 
 
 
Such a plea, ie a plea of contributory negligence, should be treated as setting up want of care by the plaintiff for his own safety, whether in the circumstances of the accident the plaintiff owed a duty to the defendant or not.
In the circumstances of 
 Nance`s 
case the Privy Council restored the decision of the original trial judge to the effect that the street car driven by a motorman of the respondent company was solely negligent for ramming into and killing the deceased, who was then crossing the road on slippery ice at sometime between 11.00pm and midnight, the evidence being that the street car had stopped some 75 feet away to pick up passengers and then restarted without warning and knocked down and killed the deceased as he was crossing the road.
We cite 
 Nance`s 
case not because of its particular facts or the findings thereon but for the principles enunciated which arise for consideration when contributory negligence is set up as a defence which it is for the defendant to prove.
Not long afterwards in 1953 another case involving British Columbia Electric Railway Co Ltd arose, ie the case of 
 Sigurdson v British Columbia Electric Railway Co Ltd 
 
[1953] AC 291
 where one Sigurdson who wanted to drive from one side of the street to the other, after beginning to turn, stopped on a street car track in the centre of the road. The driver of the street car had an unobstructed view, but did not see Sigurdson until he was 75 feet away, so that there was a collision. The jury found the driver of the street car was negligent in not keeping a proper lookout and that Sigurdson was not negligent. This decision, after being reversed on appeal, was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
Inter alia, the trial judge directed the jury to consider whether Sigurdson was also guilty of some negligence which contributed to the accident as alleged by the company, ie `that he was the author of his own injury knowing that the street car was coming along there and driving in front of it contrary to the by-law and other regulations; in crossing the street aside altogether from the question of the regulations and taking chances of crossing there under the circumstances`. In the result the jury found that Sigurdson was not guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident. The Privy Council, per Lord Tucker, held that: 
 
the jury were entitled to come to the conclusion, taking a broad view of the case as a whole, that the negligence of the motorman was in the circumstances the sole cause of the accident irrespective of the precise moment at which he became aware of the danger.
 
 
 
In his comment on this case in the 
 Cambridge Law Journal 
for 1954 at p 45, Professor CJ Hamson, says: 
 
... not only is the `principal` in 
 Davies v Mann
good law but a recital of that celebrated donkey`s misfortune is still effective actually to fix upon one wrongdoer sole responsibility for an accident to the occurrence of which the other party`s misbehaviour was relevant.
 
 
 
It is satisfactory to note that in 
 Sigurdson`s 
case we have been spared any observations upon the question whether the plaintiff`s negligence was continuing or not. In spite of some apparent authority to the contrary - which was recently given further currency in the opinions of the House in the 
 Boy Andrew Case 
[1948] AC 140
 - it should be self-evident that, at any rate in the normal collision case, the plaintiff`s negligence, if relevant at all to the occurrence of the accident, necessarily continues up to the moment of the accident. Sigurdson necessarily continued to be at fault whilst he continued to lie wrongfully astraddle the track, just as much as the owner of the donkey continued to be in breach of his duty so long as it remained hobbled in the highway. The interest of 
 Sigurdson`s 
 case, as much as of 
 Davies v Mann, 
lies precisely in the fact that despite the continuance of the plaintiff`s negligence up to the moment of impact the defendant is held solely responsible for the collision.
We need not be overly concerned with the facts of 
 Sigurdson`s 
case because the battle there was entirely between two parties to an accident, only one of whom was found to be solely to blame because his act was held to be the effective cause of the injury caused to the other in that accident.
In the present appeal, we are dealing with facts which, not only show that a collision took place between the appellant`s car and the lorry-cum-trailer for which responsibility lay solely at the door of the appellant, but also show that, as a result of that collision, injury was caused almost immediately afterwards by the appellant to the deceased who was then stationary to his left inside that junction. The deceased may have been negligent in entering the junction when it was palpably unsafe to do so and most probably against the traffic lights but so was the appellant whose own version that he stopped in Maxwell Road until his lights turned green, that the lorry had not yet reached its own stop-line and that he then did not see the deceased, was rejected by the trial judge. On the facts accepted at the trial the appellant shot past the deceased into the lorry on a more or less parallel course and it certainly seems most unlikely that any duty of care was owed to the appellant by the deceased particularly as there is no evidence that he was aware of the presence of the appellant behind him - in fact, the appellant denied seeing him or his motorcycle there at all.
The sole question on contributory negligence which remains for consideration therefore is whether the deceased failed in his own interest to take reasonable care of himself and thereby contributed to his own injury even if he did not cause or contribute in any way to the collision between the lorry and the appellant`s car.
Cases like 
 Nance, Sigurdson 
and 
 Radburn 
are cases of direct collisions between two parties. The defendant in each case was held solely negligent and the plaintiff not guilty of any contributory negligence.
In 
 Nance`s 
case, the plaintiff was a pedestrian. In 
 Sigurdson`s 
case, the plaintiff was driving a car. The defendants in both cases were owners of street cars driven by their motormen. In 
 Radburn`s 
 case, the plaintiff was a pedal-cyclist and the defendant drove a motor car.
No third party was injured in the collisions which took place in each case.
These cases only decided the issue of contributory negligence arising for consideration on the particular set of facts established in each case.
We are not, in this appeal, concerned with a collision between two vehicles or two parties only. So far as the collision between the lorry-cum-trailer and the appellant`s car is concerned sole negligence for that collision lay with the appellant. As a result of that collision the appellant`s car spun to its right and collided with the motorcyclist who died as a consequence of the appellant`s negligence. The question is whether fault as defined under s 2 of our Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 31, 1970 Ed) lay partly with the motorcyclist so as to render the damages payable to his dependants in respect of that negligence liable to be apportioned in such a way as to reflect the deceased`s share (if any) of the responsibility for the injury to himself under that Act.
We have also considered the cases of 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) 
and 
 Jones v Livox Quarries 
[1952] 2 QB 608
.
In each of these two cases the question whether a third person who was injured as a result of a collision between two vehicles was guilty of contributory negligence was considered by the English Court of Appeal.
In the case of 
 Davies 
both the driver of a dust lorry and an overtaking omnibus driver were held negligent for a collision between their respective vehicles in the proportions of one to two. The question was whether the dustman who, contrary to instructions and regulations, was standing on the steps attached to the off-side of the lorry contributed to the injury to himself by so doing when the collision between the vehicles occurred. Bucknill LJ at p 312 said, `it seems to me that it is impossible to say that the dangerous position of the deceased man on the lorry had ceased to be a factor contributing to the damage that he suffered` and answered the question `Did the negligence of the deceased (dustman) right up to the moment of collision ... contribute to his injuries?` in the affirmative and reduced the damages to the plaintiff by one-fifth. Evershed LJ agreed after saying that the question was most difficult of solution. Denning LJ who gave the third judgment at p 326 said: 
 
... the first question is: What were the faults which caused the damage? The collision between the two vehicles was caused by the negligence of the two drivers: the omnibus driver because he attempted to overtake in a narrow lane on a bend, without warning and before receiving a signal; the dust lorry driver because he turned suddenly across the road without making proper use of his mirror and without giving sufficient warning of his intention to do so. But although those negligent acts were the cause of the collision, what was the cause of the damage to the deceased man? He was as the judge found, in a position which he must have known was a very dangerous position, in defiance of the dictates of common sense. If he had not been in that position, he would not have been injured. His position was certainly one of the causes of the damage just as in 
 The Margaret
the improper position of the anchor was one of the causes of the damage to the barge.
 
 
 
It should be observed that 
 The Margaret 
(1881) 6 AC 76 was a case of a direct collision between a barge which was being negligently navigated and a (stationary) schooner which was moored to a mooring buoy in the river Thames. The schooner`s anchor was hanging over its bow with the stock above water contrary to bye-laws for the navigation of the river Thames. The position of the anchor caused it to make a hole in the barge and its cargo was damaged. The damage was divided equally between the parties because both were to blame.
That was a case which, as Viscount Birkenhead said in 
 The SS Volute 
[1922] 1 AC 129
 belongs to the class of cases where: 
 
two acts (of negligence) come so closely together, and the second act of negligence 
 is so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act
, that the party secondly negligent, might invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision so as to make it a case of contribution.
 
 
 
Was the act of negligence of the deceased in entering the junction and stopping as he did to avoid the lorry a prior act of negligence which entitles the party secondly negligent (the appellant) to say that his act of negligence was so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by that prior negligence that he is entitled to invoke it as being part of the cause of his collision with the deceased so as to make it a case of contribution so far as injury to the deceased is concerned?
In the case of 
 Jones 
, the plaintiff, who rode upon the towbar at the back of a traxcavator, knowing that such conduct was dangerous and was forbidden by his employers, was held to be guilty of contributory negligence in so doing when he was crushed between the traxcavator and a dumper which negligently ran into him from the back as he stood on the towbar.
The danger of applying to the facts in the appeal before us pronouncements by the learned Lord Justices in that case is the danger that when considered out of the context of the particular facts of that case such pronouncements may seem to lend support to a finding that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. Singleton LJ, for example, held that Jones `put himself in a dangerous position which, in fact, exposed him to 
 the particular danger which came upon him. 
He ought not to have been there ... If he unreasonably or improperly, exposed himself 
 to this particular risk, 
I do not think that he ought to be allowed to say that it was not a cause operating to produce the damage.` Singleton LJ`s `first impression was that the fact that the plaintiff was upon the traxcavator had nothing to do with the accident. I think the real cause was the negligence of the driver of the dumper` but a little later said: 
 
Still, when one has to consider the question of contributory negligence, I do not see that it can be said that the judge was wrong in finding that the plaintiff, who deliberately put himself into a position which exposed him to this danger, was to some extent responsible for that which happened; in other words, I do not think it would be right for this court on these findings to say that the judge was wrong in law;
 
 
 
When one considers that in the 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
cases there was an injured person who had been forbidden to stand on the steps of the lorry in the former case and on the towbar at the back of the traxcavator in the latter case, one gets a somewhat different picture from that which emerges from the facts before us.
The similarity between the position of the deceased in this appeal and the positions of 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
lies in the fact that like the defendant in 
 Radburn`s 
case he had placed himself in a dangerous position inside the junction when it was unsafe to do so (and therefore negligent). He was not, however, caught in the kind of collision which took place first between two vehicles as 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
were. In the cases of 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
neither Davies nor Jones caused or contributed to the actual collisions between vehicles which took place in those cases because of their presence there. In the case of the deceased motorcyclist, similarly his presence at the scene did not cause or contribute to the collision between the lorry and the appellant`s car. The conduct of each of the three was accordingly such that it was not a cause operating to produce each of these collisions, however dangerous their positions might have been.
The question is whether the deceased, whilst stationary about three feet short of the lorry ought reasonably to have foreseen that some motorist to his right and to his rear would act as he himself had earlier done in driving into the junction when it was unsafe to do so, collide with the lorry, spin round to his right and cause him, the deceased, to suffer harm?
As Denning LJ said in the 
 Jones 
 case at p 615: 
 
A person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably to have foreseen that if he did not act as a reasonable, prudent man, he might be hurt himself; and in his reckonings he must take into account the possibility of others being careless.
 
 
 
Does this mean, if one accepts this proposition, that the question we should ask ourselves is whether the deceased motorcyclist in entering the junction negligently ought to have foreseen that he might be hurt not only by a vehicle he could see moving lawfully inside the junction like the lorry and to take into account the possibility of carelessness on the part of such a vehicle or should we ask ourselves whether he ought to have foreseen harm to himself from vehicles generally, whether he could see them or not, which might lawfully or unlawfully enter that junction from any quarter?
It would appear that the proposition is worded in sufficiently wide terms to include the possibility of vehicles charging into the traxcavator from behind it such as the dumper in question of whose presence there is no evidence that 
 Jones 
 was ever previously aware.
If so, should we go further and ask ourselves whether the deceased ought to have foreseen possible harm to himself from the appellant`s car which overtook him on his right (even though he may not have seen it or been aware of its existence earlier) because it might hit the lorry across their paths and spin round and knock him under that lorry?
This is a difficult question to answer but it requires to be answered `somewhat broadly and upon common sense principles as a jury would probably deal with it` (see per Viscount Birkenhead in 
 The SS Volute 
[1922] 1 AC 76 at p 144).
If, to quote Denning LJ`s illustration on causation, Jones had been hit in the eye by a negligent sportsman then that would be a part of the history and would not make the plaintiffs negligence in any way a cause of that injury. The learned judge was unable to say this on the facts of the case before him, holding that the negligence of 
 Jones 
 here `was so much mixed up with his injury that it cannot be dismissed as mere history. His dangerous position on the vehicle was one of the causes of his damage just as it was in 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) 
`
 . 
In 
 Stapley v Gypsum Mines 
[1953] AC 681 Lord Reid said: 
 
To determine what caused an accident from the point of view of legal liability is a most difficult task. If there is any valid logical or scientific theory of causation it is quite irrelevant in this connection. In a court of law this question must be decided at a properly instructed and reasonable jury would decide it. The question must be determined by applying common sense to the facts of each particular case. One may find that as a matter of history several people have been at fault and that if any one of them had acted properly the accident would not have happened, but that does not mean that the accident must be regarded as having been caused by the faults of all of them. One must discriminate between those faults which must be discarded as being too remote and those which must not. Sometimes it is proper to discard at all but one and to regard that one as the sole cause, but in other cases it is proper to regard two or more as having jointly caused the accident. I doubt whether any test can be applied generally.
 
 
 
In the same case Lord Asquith at p 687 said: 
 
I am persuaded that it is still part of the law of this country that two causes may both be necessary pre-conditions of a particular result - damage to X - yet the one may, if the facts justify that conclusion, be treated as the real, substantial, direct or effective cause, and the other dismissed as at best a 
 causa sine qua non
 and ignored for purposes of legal liability. This is a doctrine affirmed by your Lordships` House, and not, in my view, displaced by the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945.
 
 
 
It may be pertinent also to consider the following passage from Lord Atkins judgment in 
 Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries 
[1940] AC 164 at p 164: 
 
But the injury may be the result of two causes operating at the same time, a breach of duty by the defendant and the omission on the part of the plaintiff to use the ordinary care for the protection of himself or his property that is used by the ordinary reasonable man in those circumstances. In that case the plaintiff cannot recover because the injury is partly caused by what is imputed to him as his own default. On the other hand if the plaintiff were negligent but his negligence was not a cause operating to produce the damage there would be no defence. I find it impossible to divorce any theory of contributory negligence from the concept of causation. It is negligence which `contributes to cause` the injury, a phrase which I take from the opinion of Lord Penzance in 
 Radley v London and North Western Ry Co
. And whether you ask whose negligence was responsible for the injury, or from whose negligence did the injury result, or adopt any other phrase you please, you must in the ultimate analysis be asking who `caused` the injury; and you must not be deterred because the word `cause` has in philosophy given rise to embarrassments which in this connection should not affect the judge.
 
 
 
In our view, the act of the deceased in entering the junction and stopping as he did was not the kind of prior act of negligence which entitles the appellant who was the party secondly negligent to say that his act was `so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act` that he is entitled to invoke it as part of the cause of his colliding with the lorry so as to make it a case of contribution on the part of the deceased with whom he subsequently collided. The facts in 
 The 
 
 SS Volute 
case showed clear negligence on the part of both vessels in relation to each other. In the present appeal, there was no act of negligence on the part of the deceased which caused the appellant to be secondly negligent.
The cases of 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
relate to passengers who exposed themselves to particular risks which they could have reasonably foreseen when they took up their positions on their respective vehicles after being forbidden to do so and thereby contributed to their own injuries.
With regard to Denning LJ`s proposition earlier cited from the 
 Jones 
 case we are of the view that the question we should ask ourselves and which we do is whether the deceased ought reasonably to have foreseen that he might be hurt not only by vehicles such as the lorry in particular which he could see lawfully moving inside the junction but also by vehicles unlawfully entering the junction like the appellant? We would answer this question in the negative.
As to the further question whether he ought reasonably have foreseen harm to himself from the appellant we are satisfied that the answer is again in the negative.
There is no evidence that the deceased was negligent in relation to the appellant so as to make that negligence a prior act which contributed to cause the injury he sustained. The second act of negligence on the part of the appellant was independent of the first act and was not brought about by it. The negligence of the deceased was in relation to vehicles like the lorry which had lawfully entered the junction, in the first place, which the appellant obviously had not.
Having jerked to a stop, there was practically no risk to which the deceased exposed himself as there was no other traffic lawfully moving in that junction besides the lorry. So far as the evidence shows and, as the trial judge found, all other traffic was at a standstill except for the appellant who entered the junction unlawfully after the deceased on a parallel course but to his right and to his rear. The deceased could not have reasonably anticipated the action of the appellant in overtaking him and hitting the towbar of the lorry. Nor could he have foreseen that the appellant`s car would spin round and knock him under the trailer. Further, this was not a consequence in the chain of causation which he ought to have foreseen.
We appreciate that the position in which the deceased placed himself in that junction after entering it unlawfully may seem to be a potent factor showing want of care on his part towards lawful users of that junction. The appellant was not such a person. But it does not prove, as the appellant is obliged to do in this appeal, that the deceased did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself.
After anxious consideration of the difficult questions arising out of the facts in this appeal we have arrived at the conclusion that the real, substantial and effective cause of the death of the deceased was the appellant`s sole negligence in hitting the lorry with his car which spun to its right and killed him, a fact which the deceased could not reasonably have foreseen. In any event, the trial judge came to the conclusion that the appellant was solely to blame and that the deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence. Adopting the language of the Privy Council in 
 Sigurdson`s 
 case the trial judge was entitled to come to that conclusion, taking a broad view of the case as a whole.
We would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The Workers` Party, the appellant in this appeal, is a political party. Tay Boon Too, the first respondent, is a member of the People`s Action Party, another political party. He was the People`s Action Party candidate for the Paya Lebar constituency at the general election held on 2 September 1972. At that general election the appellant fielded 27 candidates thereby contesting 27 seats out of 65 seats in Parliament. The People`s Action Party fielded candidates for all the seats in Parliament.
At an election rally of the People`s Action Party held at Lorong Tai Seng on 25 August 1972 the first respondent, Tay Boon Too, was one of many speakers. On the same evening at its regular 11 pm news broadcast the Department of Broadcasting broadcast over the radio edited versions of speeches made at, several election rallies held by various political parties at various parts of Singapore. One of the edited versions broadcast that evening was the speech made by the first respondent at the election rally at Lorong Tai Seng. Some of the items broadcast over the radio at 11pm on 25 August 1972 were repeated in the regular news broadcast at 6.30am, 7am and 8am the next morning. The items containing the edited version of the first respondent`s speech was so repeated. That item as broadcast reads as follows: 
 
At another PAP rally in Lorong Tai Seng, the PAP`s candidate for Paya Lebar, Mr Tay Boon Too, accused the Workers` Party of having received $600,000 from a foreign country for its election campaign.
 
 
 
The edited version of the first respondent`s speech was prepared from a report in English by a reporter, Law Ah Ta, of the Department of Broadcasting who had attended the rally at Lorong Tai Seng and had heard the first respondent who was speaking in the Hokkien dialect to those present. The reporter took down notes in Chinese in point form and not verbatim and he prepared his report in English from those notes.
The 1972 general election resulted in the People`s Action Party winning all the seats in Parliament. On September 1972 the appellant commenced proceedings in the High Court against the first respondent claiming damages for slander. The statement of claim, delivered on 23 January 1973, alleged that at the election rally at Lorong Tai Seng held on 25 August 1972 the first respondent published to persons attending the rally defamatory words to the effect `that the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from sources outside Singapore for its election expenses`.
On 15 June 1973 the appellant also commenced proceedings against the Department of Broadcasting naming the Attorney General as the nominal defendant claiming `damages for libel contained in broadcasts and published by the Department of Broadcasting, Ministry of Culture on 26 August 1972`. The statement of claim dated the same day alleged that `on 26 August 1972 the defendant ... broadcast and published over its wireless transmission to the public ... of and concerning the plaintiff and in relation to its conduct in the said Parliamentary elections a statement allegedly made by one Tay Boon Too on ... 25 August 1972 that the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from sources outside Singapore for its election campaign`.
These two actions by the appellant were consolidated and were eventually tried in the High Court before Chua J on 14 October 1974. During the trial the appellant successfully applied to amend the statement of claim against the first respondent so as to allege that the first respondent at the election rally in question published to persons attending the rally `that the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from Kuala Lumpur for the current election campaign and celebrated its anniversary at the Singapore Malay National Organisation`s premises indicating that it is not an independent party and that the Singapore Malay National Organisation is a Kuala Lumpur arm in Singapore which carries out subversive activities`.
In a reserved judgment Chua J dismissed both actions with costs and the appellant appealed to this court. At the conclusion of the appeal we dismissed the appeal and intimated that we would give our reasons at a later date.
We now proceed to give our reasons. The first ground of appeal in the petition of appeal concern the first respondent only and reads as follows: 
 
The learned judge erred in law and in fact in holding that your petitioner had not proved that the first respondent had uttered and published the words complained of on the night of 25 August 1972.
 
 
 
The words complained of are pleaded in para 5 of the amended statement of claim in the action against Tay Boon Too, the first respondent, as follows: 
 
At a public rally addressed by the defendant at Lorong Tai Seng in the constituency of Paya Lebar on the night of 25 August the defendant falsely and maliciously spoke and published of and concerning the plaintiff and of it in the way of its said undertaking and in relation to its conduct therein by saying to the persons attending the rally that the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from Kuala Lumpur for the current election campaign and celebrated its anniversary at the Singapore Malay National Organisation`s premises indicating that it is not an independent party and that the Singapore Malay National Organisation is a Kuala Lumpur arm in Singapore which carries out subversive activities.
 
 
 
The first respondent, at para 4 of his re-amended defence, denied the said para 5 of the amended statement of claim and put the appellant to strict proof of the allegations contained therein.
The evidence in support of the appellant`s claim consisted of that of Ee Boon Lee, Controller of News in the Department of Broadcasting of the Ministry of Culture, who produced the text of a report in English submitted to that Department by its reporter, Law Ah Ta, who was also called to give evidence on behalf of the appellant. Ee Boon Lee was not present at the rally in question although he did admit responsibility for the edited version of the text of Law Ah Ta`s report which was subsequently broadcast.
Law Ah Ta`s evidence was to the effect that he attended the rally held by the first respondent as the PAP candidate for the constituency of Paya Lebar at which nine speakers spoke including the first respondent who spoke in the Hokkien dialect. He said that he took down notes, in Chinese, of the speech `in point form` but not `verbatim`. There were other speeches, some of them in Mandarin, made by other speakers. He said that he submitted to the news editor a report in English which contained accurately what he heard the first respondent say in Hokkien at the rally. He said that he had less than 20 minutes in which to prepare, type and hand in his report. He said that in preparing it he referred to his notebook in which he had previously taken down points in the speech made by the first respondent. The report was a translation into English from the notes he had taken down in point form in Chinese in his notebook. The notebook could not be produced in evidence as he did not have it nor did he know where it was as used notebooks were `put aside`, the usual practice being for the office attendant to collect them. He said that he could not remember the `verbatim words` or the exact words used by the first respondent. He said his mother tongue was Hokkien and that he had taken Chinese as a language for the School Certificate examination and passed it.
When taxed in cross-examination as to the words `subversive activities` appearing in his English translation from his notes in Chinese, he was unable to remember the Chinese words used. He was unable to remember any reference to illegality or secret activities leading to the overthrow of the government. All he could say was that he could have chosen another word but he chose `subversive` as the most suitable word when be translated the Chinese word he had written in his notebook. There is thus not a shred of evidence as to the actual Chinese word be had so noted.
It should be borne in mind that this witness, though admittedly a reporter in the Department of Broadcasting, gave no evidence about his competence as an interpreter or translator from Hokkien into English and vice versa apart from saying that his mother tongue was Hokkien and that he had passed in Chinese at School Certificate level.
The trial judge dealt with this evidence, inter alia, as follows: 
 
The plaintiff must prove that the words complained of have been published. The plaintiff has called only one witness, Law Ah Ta, who was present at the rally and heard the speech of Tay Boon Too. No other witness who attended the rally and heard Tay Boon Too`s speech was called by the plaintiff to prove the speaking of the words. Law Ah Ta has not proved the actual words alleged to have been published. It is clear from his evidence that what he set out in his report exh P4 was what he conceived to be the substance or effect of the words or his impression of what was said ...
 
 
 
Here the slander alleged was spoken in Hokkien but the words complained of were set out in English in the amended statement of claim. English is the official language of the court and in that context any other language would be a foreign language. If the slander alleged is in a language other than English it must be set out in the statement of claim in the foreign language precisely as spoken and followed by a literal translation. It is not enough to set out a translation without setting out the original or vice versa. (Gatley on 
 Libel & Slander 
, 7th Ed para 987). While the absence of a translation in the pleadings may not be fatal to the plaintiff`s case the absence of the original words in the foreign language in question is ...
After the plaintiff has proved the actual words published he must also prove that the translation given in the statement of claim is correct by calling an interpreter sworn as a witness (
 Gatley 
, para 1207).
I am of the view that the plaintiff in this case has not proved publication of the words complained of.
Counsel for the appellant, Mr JB Jeyaretnam, contended that the trial judge was wrong in fact and in law in finding that the publication of the words complained of as set out in the amended statement of claim had not been proved and advanced the pro-position that the absence of the Hokkien text of the speech was a mere technicality which could have been resolved by the simple expedient of rendering the English words set up in the pleadings back into Hokkien, He further contended that no translation was required as Law Ah Ta whose mother tongue was Hokkien had supplied the translation as he was a competent interpreter for the purpose of meeting the argument of counsel for the first respondent, Mr G S Hill, that not only must the original words in Hokkien be proved but so must a translation into English of those words so complained of as set out in the pleadings be proved to be correct. In the present appeal, there is no evidence of the actual words alleged to have been spoken in Hokkien and which Law Ah Ta quite candidly said he could not remember.
In our judgment, the trial judge was entitled and indeed was bound to regard the absence of proof of the original or actual words in Hokkien as fatal to the appellant`s claim against the first respondent. Law Ah Ta had no recollection whatsoever of the words used in Hokkien and was only able to give evidence of his own translation of the notes he took in Chinese in point form. The words used must be proved and not what a witness conceives to be the substance and the effect of such words. A witness is bound to give the words used, as far as he could recollect them and then the enquiry would be whether his recollection and accuracy could be trusted, and whether the words he recollected could be relied upon as giving the material words of the slander (see 
 Rainy v Bravo 
(1872) LR 4 PC 295).
One would have expected in the circumstances attending the holding of this election rally at which about 200 persons were present that the appellant should have been able to produce at least one or more of the hearers who understood what was being said in Hokkien to given evidence of what words they, to the best of their recollection, actually heard in Hokkien. Where a foreign language is used it is necessary for the appellant to prove the actual words published in that language and the English translation of those words. It was not in dispute that Hokkien is for the purposes of these proceedings, a foreign language. Law Ah Ta could not remember the exact words used in Hokkien. Indeed, at the trial, he was not even asked to give to the best of his recollection the Hokkien words used by the first respondent which the appellant alleges are defamatory.
We accordingly found no merit whatsoever in the contention by counsel for the appellant that the publication of the words complained of had been proved nor any merit in his application for a retrial `to have issues properly ventilated` - by which we understood him to mean that he wanted a second bite at the cherry in an endeavour to rectify errors and omissions, in the appellant`s case in relation to the first issue of publication which it was essential for the appellant to prove as against the first respondent. We were satisfied that the trial judge directed himself correctly on the law and arrived at the right conclusions on questions of fact arising for consideration on this issue and accordingly that the appeal against the first respondent must fail.
We now turn to that ground of appeal affecting the second respondent, the Attorney General for the Department of Broadcasting, which alleges that the trial judge erred in holding that the words complained of were not defamatory. The broadcast words alleged to be defamatory are not directly set out by the appellant in his statement of claim in the action against the Attorney General but are set out in para 5 of the defence and they read as follows: 
 
At another PAP rally at Lorong Tai Seng the PAP`s candidate for Paya Lebar accused the Workers` Party of having received $600,000 from a foreign country for its election campaign.
 
 
 
The appellant in para 5 of his statement of claim pleads as follows: 
 
The said words meant and were intended to mean that the plaintiff was acting in the interests of person who were not citizens of Singapore and that the plaintiff`s motives in contesting the said elections were questionable as to whether they were genuinely to serve the interests of the citizens of Singapore or foreigners.
 
 
 
It is difficult from this paragraph to discover whether the appellant was relying on a `true` or on a `false` innuendo. If he was relying on a `true` innuendo then by virtue of O 78 r 3(i) he must support it by pleading particulars. The appellant did not plead any particulars and his failure to plead particulars seems to be an indication that he was relying on a `false` as distinct from a `true` or legal innuendo, ie that he was relying on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words together with such inferences as might reasonably be drawn from the words themselves in the light of the ordinary man`s knowledge.
However, this ambiguity was resolved at the trial when counsel for the appellant in his opening speech said: 
 
Plaintiff has to show the words are defamatory ... To allege that the plaintiff has received $600,000 from foreign sources can only mean one thing, that the Party is at the mercy of paymasters from outside and that immediately calls into question, the honesty, integrity and sincerity of the plaintiff. I submit these words were calculated to do precisely that. It also imputes the height of irresponsibility of the plaintiff. I submit it bears the meaning set out in para [5] of the statement of claim.
 
 
 
During the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant confirmed that the appellant was throughout relying on a `false` innuendo as set out in para 5 of his statement of claim. Counsel in addressing the court on this ground of appeal, said he was not alleging or relying on an innuendo even in the action against the Attorney General and he submitted, without distinguishing between the words alleged to have been said by the first respondent at the election rally and the broadcast words, that the broadcast words were defamatory. On this basis para 5 of the statement of claim in the action against the Attorney General should have been pleaded as follows: 
 
The said words in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was acting in the interests of persons who were not citizens of Singapore and that the plaintiff`s motives in contesting the said elections were questionable as to whether they were genuinely to serve the interests of the citizens of Singapore or foreigners.
 
 
 
Incomprehensively to us, in support of his submission, counsel contended that the 
 imputation 
 is that the plaintiff are proxies, agents for foreigners, willing tools of foreigners, allowing themselves to be manipulated by foreigners and to be used against the interests of Singapore citizens.
Nevertheless, we had to consider whether the broadcast words in their natural and ordinary meaning were capable of bearing or of being understood by persons who heard them to bear the meanings for which the appellant contended in para 5 of his statement of claim, viz (1) that the plaintiff was acting in the interests of persons who were not Singapore citizens, and (2) that the plaintiff`s motives in contesting the said elections were questionable as to whether the plaintiff was genuinely to serve the interests of the citizens of Singapore or foreigners. If the words were capable of bearing or of being understood by hearers to bear those meanings without the aid of extrinsic facts, we would then have to consider whether they were defamatory of the appellant.
It is pertinent to observe that during the trial and during the appeal counsel for the appellant never attempted, by argument or through witnesses, to prove that the broadcast words were capable of bearing or of being understood to mean, without the aid of extrinsic facts, the aforesaid two meanings.
The trial judge said at p 134 of the record of appeal that it was not defamatory per se to say of a political party that it had received funds, nor `unlawful for a political party to receive money at home or abroad and no right-thinking person would have given the words complained of a defamatory sense in their natural and ordinary meaning`. The learned trial judge was then dealing with the words alleged to have been uttered by the first respondent whereas the words broadcast were confined to the receipt of the funds in question albeit from a foreign country and not Kuala Lumpur.
As Lord Selborne said in 
 Capital and Countries Bank v Henty 
(1882) 7 SC 741: 
 
The test, according to the authorities, is, whether under the circumstances in which the writing was published, reasonable men, to whom the publication was made, would be likely to understand it in a libellous sense.
 
 
 
Not one hearer, however, was called to give evidence of what he or she understood the words in question to mean or that he or she drew any inference, in the context of election fever when contestants are not exactly prone to say the most flattering things about their opponents, that the Workers` Party was acting in the interests of persons who were not Singapore citizens with the questionable motives aforesaid.
An allegation that money has been received by a political party for its election expenses from a foreign country is not, as the trial judge found, per se defamatory. It could be capable of bearing or of being understood by persons who heard them to bear the alleged meanings only if the ordinary man in the light of his knowledge was prepared to draw the inference that foreign country was inimical to Singapore and its citizens. The ordinary man would wish to know more about the facts than the bare statement broadcast which would probably only make him at the most less likely than he otherwise would be to cast his vote in favour of a candidate of the Workers` Party. It was most unlikely that the broadcast words would lead him reasonably to draw inferences to the effect that the Workers` Party was acting in the interests of persons who were not citizens with the questionable motives alleged.
In our judgment the trial judge was right in deciding that the words in question were incapable of bearing or of being understood to bear the two meanings alleged and in concluding that, in fact, in their natural and ordinary meaning, they were not defamatory of the appellant.
For all these reasons we dismissed the appeal.
