2703709,R v Hastings Fredrickson (No 2) [2015] NSWDC 115,"Judgment


	
	On the previous occasion, which was 9 February 2015, I convicted the offender and sentenced him to 15 months imprisonment in relation to each of the counts to which he pleaded guilty. I referred him for assessment for suitability for an intensive correction order, and I am informed by a report that that manner of disposition is not available given that the offender resides in the Australian Capital Territory.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose that these orders now result from the extensive reasons I gave earlier. Firstly, I confirm that I convicted the offender and sentenced him to 15 months imprisonment in respect of each offence.
	
	
	Mr Fredrickson, pursuant to s 20 (1)(b) I direct that you be released upon giving security of $2,000 without security by recognisance that you will comply with the following conditions:
	



	
	That you be of good behaviour for the period of the sentence, that is 15 months from today’s date.
	
	
	That you will during the period of the sentence be the subject of supervision of the probation officer appointed in accordance with this order and obey all reasonable directions of that probation officer, and
	
	
	That you provide access to your personal computer to that probation officer when the latter reasonably requests that to occur to ensure that there is no relapse into this kind of behaviour. As is required by s 20(4) you will be provided with a written copy of this order before leaving this complex.
	



	
	You should know as well that if you breach the conditions that I have imposed upon you, you will be brought before this court, and if the court is satisfied that there is no reasonable cause or excuse for your failure to comply, I can impose a number of the sentences which are specified in s 20A(5)(c) which range from taking no action to ordering that you be imprisoned for part of the sentence which has not been expired. You need to understand that, if you breach the conditions you are at risk of going to gaol full time.

2703712,Application by Roger Cheney pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 293,"Judgment


	
	Pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Act”) Roger David Cheney (“the applicant”) applies for an inquiry into his 1995 convictions in relation to two offences namely maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse and assaulting a police officer occasioning actual bodily harm. These were counts 1 and 3 on an indictment. Count 2 was an alternative to count 1. An appeal against the conviction was dismissed in 1998.
	
	
	The circumstances of the offences were summarised by Studdert J in R v Cheney (Criminal Court of Appeal (NSW), 28 April 1998, unrep):
	


“The offences charged allegedly took place at about 7.00 pm on the evening of 3 May 1991 in Everton Lane, Strathfield. Mrs Long lived in a unit on the third floor of a building in Everton Road, Strathfield. The rear section of that block of units faced Everton Lane and Mrs Long, who lived in a rear unit, said that she heard that evening some grunting out in the laneway. The Strathfield TAFE was beside the lane and there was some light into the laneway from the TAFE buildings. When Mrs Long looked out, she saw two figures across the lane, one of which appeared to be straddled over the top of the lower figure. She observed the figure on top drag the lower figure along some distance away from her position and she eventually lost sight of the figures. She then rang Burwood police station and according to her, police vehicles arrived quickly.

Constable Meredith was on patrol nearby in a police panel van with Constable Wicks as his offsider. In prompt response to a police radio message, Constable Meredith drove the van down Everton Lane with the headlights on high beam and the roof spotlight shining ahead. According to Constable Meredith, he saw ahead of him and to the right, a male person on top of another figure. The male person had his trousers down and Constable Meredith said he could see his buttocks. Having stopped the vehicle Constable Meredith began to alight. As he did so the male ahead stood up. According to Constable Meredith that person's penis was erect. As the constable left the van, the figure ahead began to pull up his tracksuit pants and run away. Constable Meredith said that he noticed that this person was wearing a blue and bright yellow spray jacket, a black coloured beanie and he had long fair hair protruding below his headwear.

Constable Meredith gave evidence that he chased this person over a set of wooden gates, up beside a building, over another two fences, through a gate and across on to the roadway, Everton Road, which runs parallel with Everton Lane, at the front of the block of units in which Mrs Long lived. As the blond haired person set off to cross the road there was a moving vehicle in his path and Constable Meredith said that the fugitive ran into the near side of the vehicle, stumbled, regained his balance and continued to flee. The chase continued into other premises along the side of which the fugitive ran, followed by Constable Meredith. Eventually, when the fugitive reached the back of the premises which adjoined Cowdery Lane, Constable Meredith caught up with him and tackled him. A struggle followed, during which Constable Wicks also arrived. The two police officers were attempting to but were unable to securely handcuff the fugitive. Further officers arrived and he was in due course handcuffed. There is no dispute that the person arrested in that fashion was the appellant. Thereafter, when the appellant stood up, he kneed Constable Meredith in the testicles. That incident gave rise to the third count in the indictment.

It was the evidence of Constable Meredith, that he was two or three metres away from the appellant when he commenced his flight and this police officer said that he never lost sight of the appellant between that point and the time when he later tackled him beside Cowdery Lane.”


	
	For the sexual assault offence the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of four years eight months commencing on 8 December 1993 with an additional term of two years. For the assault police offence the applicant received a sentence of one year commencing 24 March 1995. There was no appeal against sentence and, it seems, the sentences have long ago expired. However, there is some confusion in relation to the applicant’s release date arising from the multiplicity of other convictions and sentences relating to other proceedings and offences: see Application by Roger Cheney pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 291 (“Cheney No 1”) at [4] and [14].
	


CONCURRENT APPLICATION UNDER S 78 OF THE CRIMES (APPEAL AND REVIEW) ACT 2001 (NSW)


	
	I have before me two applications under s 78 instituted by the applicant. After the charges relevant to the present application, the applicant was tried in the District Court sitting in Coffs Harbour for the various charges discussed in Cheney (No 1) at [3]. In the submissions and material, that case is also referred to as the “Port Macquarie matter” while this case is referred to “Strathfield matter”. The offences in the Port Macquarie matter were summarised by Shaw J in R v Cheney [2004] NSWSC 104 at [4]:
	


“Broadly speaking, the allegations against the petitioner fall into a number of categories. First there are incidents of sexual molestation, including forcible cunnillingus upon a nine-year-old girl. There were alleged to be other offences involving touching of the vagina. Other allegations involved the theft of a handbag, which apparently contained a wallet, credit cards, a purse, a pen, earrings, cosmetics and a small amount of cash. Other incidents involved, it is alleged, kidnapping, indecent assault and penile penetration of the vagina, the mouth and digital penetration of the vagina.”


	
	For full details of the procedural history of the Port Macquarie matter see Cheney (No 1) at [5]-[13]. In summary, the applicant was convicted by a jury and was sentenced by Kirkman DCJ on 22 June 1995. The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a conviction on one count (count 4) but otherwise the appeal against conviction was dismissed. The appeal against sentence was allowed and adjustments were made to the sentences: Cheney (No 1) at [4].
	
	
	The applicant unsuccessfully applied for special leave to appeal to the High Court and has made an unsuccessful application under the predecessor provisions in Part 13A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) seeking an inquiry into his convictions: see R v Cheney [2004] NSWSC 104. The applicant also made two unsuccessful petitions to the Governor.
	
	
	The applicant continues to press allegations of corruption and misconduct by members of the NSW Police force and prosecuting authorities.
	


HISTORY OF THE LITIGATION


	
	The applicant pleaded not guilty to each of the three counts on an indictment presented against him the District Court in March 1995. The trial was conducted by Judge alone before his Honour Judge Shillington QC. On 24 March 1995 the applicant was found guilty of the first and third count. His Honour then imposed sentence.
	
	
	In April 1998, the Court of Criminal Appeal heard an appeal against conviction for the first charge of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. No challenge was made to the sentence. The appeal was dismissed: R v Cheney (Criminal Court of Appeal (NSW), 28 April 1998, unrep). Studdert J (Levine and Simpson JJ agreeing) concluded his judgment with the following remarks:
	


“I have closely considered all the evidence which was placed before the learned trial judge and I have considered his Honour's judgment in its entirety. His Honour carefully recorded the various matters to be proved by the prosecution and the evidence that established those essential elements. There is, in my opinion, no error to be found in his Honour's judgment.

Paying due regard to all the submissions made by counsel and in particular, the submission made concerning the DNA evidence, it does not seem to me that there is any reason for concern as to the result of the trial. I do not consider that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted and I regard the conviction as soundly based. Accordingly, in my opinion this appeal should be dismissed.”


	
	Although the current application was initiated on 12 July 2007, the applicant’s final submissions were not provided until 21 May 2014. In the intervening years, the applicant provided a number of letters and memoranda sent to the Court in support of the application. Further, the submissions in reply relating to Cheney (No 1) were not received until mid-December 2014. As I pointed out in Cheney (No 1) this explains the lengthy delay between the institution of the application and its disposition.
	


legal FRAMEWORK FOR APPLICATIONS UNDER S 78 OF THE CRIMES (APPEAL AND REVIEW) ACT 2001 (NSW)


	
	My analysis of the relevant legal framework is contained in Cheney (No 1) at [15]-[22].
	


THE APPLICANTS SUBMISSIONS CONSIDERED


	
	The applicant’s submissions were received by way of a series of letters and attachments over some seven years. I have considered all of these materials as well as submissions provided by the Attorney General on 14 October 2013.
	
	
	The Applicant identifies four discrete arguments in his application for an inquiry into his convictions.
	


1. ""Fresh evidence"" obtained from the Sydney West Area Health Service in 2007 pursuant to a Freedom of Information application


	
	The applicant contends that evidence not previously provided to him is capable of undermining some of the fundamental parts of the prosecution case. The ""fresh evidence"" consists of two documents each dated 1 July 1991 and both purporting to be a statement of Jennifer Burger of the Department of Health Forensic Biology Laboratory, Division of Analytical Laboratories, Glebe. The applicant says that he gained access to these documents in 2007 after he made a Freedom of Information request for “all blood tests results, DNA results, Police reports, Biologist reports, all documentation relating to Roger David Cheney held at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Glebe” (see Cheney v Sydney West Area Health Service [2007] NSWADT 75).
	
	
	The two documents appear to be different versions of the same document.
	
	
	The first document is headed ""Re: the alleged sexual assault of [name redacted in black and then written in handwriting]"". It lists 10 items received from Detective Khoudair of the Crime Scene Unit on 10 May 1991. Item 2 in that list is described as ""Blood – Cheney”. Item 10 is described as ""Blood sample - [word or words blacked out]"" and then the word ""BLATCH"" appears in hand-writing adjacent to the black redaction.
	
	
	The second document is identical except that the victim’s name is in typed form and no other words are blacked out. However, it lists only 9 items and does not include the Item 10 or any reference to “BLATCH”.
	
	
	The applicant says that at his trial he was only provided the second document and he argues that this was done in order to cover up the fact that the police may have had another suspect (i.e. somebody called “Blatch”). This in turn prevented him from raising an argument that the police arrested the wrong man and from submitting that that the existence of a second suspect put the lie to Constable Meredith’s evidence that he observed the applicant from the time of the attack to the time of his apprehension. As the description of the case by Studdert J shows, the Crown case was that the applicant was caught red handed by the police with his trousers down. Indeed, the prosecution did not call the alleged victim of the crime because she was so traumatised by the events and it was considered unnecessary given the evidence of the other witnesses.
	
	
	The applicant submits that a blood sample labelled 'BLATCH' was recorded on 7 May 1991, whereas his blood was not sampled until 9 May 1991. In making this submission I assume that the applicant relies on a document entitled “Specimen/exhibit Examination Form”. That document refers to “a blood sample in the name of David [Cheney] dated 9.5.01 – Lidcombe.” It then refers to “two blood samples in name of [REDACTED IN BLACK] Dated 7.5.91 for grouping.” On the second page of the form, the 10 items received from the police are detailed and item 10 is recorded as a “blood sample – [REDACTED IN BLACK]”. The applicant argues that this earlier enquiry into another person shows that police witnesses fabricated the evidence that he was the only suspect because he was always in Constable Meredith’s sight. Further he argues that this evidence would have given support to his case at trial that Constable Meredith did not observe him in Everton Lane and had fabricated his evidence.
	
	
	One difficulty with the argument is that it not clear exactly what “Blatch” means. The argument only works, if it works at all, if one accepts the applicant’s contention that BLATCH was a suspect. The report does not establish, as asserted by the applicant, that a person called “Blatch” was a suspect in the matter. The Specimen Examination Form makes no reference to “Blatch” at all. If “Blatch” was a suspect, there is no reason for his name to be redacted. There are a number of other redactions on the form and they all appear to be designed to protect the identity of the alleged victim. For example, there is reference to “Sexual assault kit in the name of [REDACTED IN BLACK]”, “pantihose the property of [REDACTED IN BLACK]” and “ladies … shirt in the name of [REDACTED IN BLACK]. No blood sample is recorded as being received from the alleged victim.
	
	
	The Attorney General’s submission indicates that the Crown Solicitor’s Office made a number of inquiries into which of the two reports was actually tendered at the trial. Due to the effluxion of time, the effort to locate the original exhibit has been fruitless. Records kept by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions have only one version of the report, and it contains the “item 10” and “BLATCH” references. This suggests, albeit inconclusively, that the applicant and/or his legal representatives may have received the complete version of the report at the time of trial. The Attorney General submits that there is no independent evidence to support the applicant’s assertion.
	
	
	I am inclined to accept the submissions of the Attorney General. The evidence now presented is, at best, ambiguous. Other inferences might arise other than the one for which the applicant contends. This is not to place any particular onus on the accused but to give effect to the finding of the trial Judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal as to the evidence upon which the accused was convicted. The evidence of Constable Meredith was tested and accepted at trial. His evidence received some support from the other witnesses (that is, the witnesses in the car into which the applicant ran). The applicant’s assertion that he had never seen the second report cannot be tested with any degree of reliability at this time.
	
	
	I will take this matter into account in the consideration of the matters raised under ss 78-79 but, taken alone, this matter is insufficient to warrant action under those provisions. By itself, it does not leave me with a sense of unease or disquiet as to the conviction.
	


2. The DNA and other physical evidence as to the presence of the applicant at the scene of the crime


	
	The applicant makes three arguments with regard to the DNA and other physical evidence. All of those issues were considered and dismissed on appeal.
	
	
	First, the applicant argues that because his DNA was not a match to the DNA found within semen located on the victim's underpants, another person was the perpetrator. Putting to one side the logical fallacy of this reasoning, this evidence was fully available both at trial and on appeal. On Appeal Studdert J found that:
	


“It is clear from Dr Gunn's evidence, that it was not possible to determine when the semen had been deposited on the underwear but its presence, whilst not adding to the prosecution case, cannot be considered of itself to be exculpatory of the appellant. It does no more than to afford a basis for an inference that the victim had intercourse at some time with somebody other than the appellant It was not possible, according to Dr Gunn, to determine the age of the deposited semen.""


	
	Secondly, the applicant argues that the fact that his tracksuit pants were not damaged contradicts the evidence at trial that some fabric from his pants had lodged in the tail light of the car which he struck whilst fleeing police. He says the same about his lack of injuries. His contention is that he could not have been the person Constable Meredith was chasing because his clothes were not damaged and he was not injured. This argument was also raised and rejected in the course of the appeal. Studdert J said:
	


“The trial judge considered the significance of the fact that there were no signs of injury to the accused. However, his Honour had regard to the fact that the car was not travelling quickly and that there was no suggestion that the appellant had been struck a direct blow but rather a glancing one. His Honour further had regard to the fact that the person who collided with the car, was able to run on immediately. His Honour considered that it was quite consistent with the appellant having been that person, notwithstanding the absence of injury to him and notwithstanding the absence of damage to his clothing. It seems to me that that was a conclusion which was entirely open to the trial judge.”


	
	Thirdly, the applicant contends that the evidence of similarity between a cream-coloured wool-like fibre found on his black tracksuit pants and a fibre found on the victim's cardigan and was not substantiated by proper forensic procedures. This argument was also dealt with by Studdert J in disposing of the appeal:
	


“Professor Pailthorpe, who has a doctorate in textile technology, tested the samples of fibre taken from the victim's cardigan and from the tracksuit pants the appellant was wearing. A number of tests were carried out, which indicated that the samples so taken and analysed each were of pure wool and of the same approximate diameter of fibre. Each sample had no dye in it. Neither sample had been exposed to detergent, so that the professor concluded that the samples could have been from the same origin. Professor Pailthorpe's evidence was that wool comprised only five percent of clothing fabric and undyed white wool, such as that analysed, made up only ten percent of that five percent.

Mr Byrne referred to a question which the trial judge then asked:

""Q. So it is five in 10,000 is it?

A. Yes. .5%, or five in 10,000, correct.""

Mathematically that is incorrect and Mr Byrne has argued that the judge attached undue weight to this evidence. I do not think that that conclusion is warranted. There was a later passage of evidence in the appeal book and the judge asked the professor:

""Q. Ten percent of five percent?

A. Ten percent of five percent is white apparel wool.

Q. So you multiply ten over 100 by five over 100?

A. You end up with, .5 percent world­wide would be white apparel wool.""

It seems to me, following that second piece of evidence, that there is no reason for concluding that his Honour considered that the incidence of white apparel wool was any more that five in a thousand cases.

In considering the significance of the evidence of the fibres found on the appellant's tracksuit, his Honour was alive to the possibility that that fibre might have found its way on to the appellant's tracksuit in an innocent way, perhaps through the police officer who helped the victim into the car and who might possibly then have transferred the fibre on to the clothing of the victim. However, his Honour remarked that the evidence was consistent with the appellant being the assailant and there can be no criticism of that observation.”

3. The absence of evidence by the complainant at trial


	
	The applicant argues that the conviction is unjust because the alleged victim did not give evidence at the trial. Studdert J noted that the submission on appeal was that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory for the following reasons:
	


“1. The absence of evidence by the alleged victim of the offence.”


	
	Two other matters were said to support the argument that the conviction was unsafe (the quality of the identification evidence and the lack of evidence supporting the identification).
	
	
	Studdert J noted that the victim did not give evidence and that a psychiatrist gave evidence that:
	


“… this lady was suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder, as a consequence of her experience on 3 May 1991 and it was the doctor’s opinion that the effect of her giving evidence would be catastrophic for her condition.”


	
	Of course, it is unusual for the complainant in a sexual assault trial not to give evidence. On the other hand, it is unusual that the perpetrator is caught in the act and seen to pull his trouser up before being chased and caught by a police officer. Studdert J considered essentially the same argument in 1998 and did so with the considerable benefit of the assistance of the late Paul Byrne SC. His Honour, with whom both Levine and Simpson JJ agreed said:
	


""There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the trial judge reached, not only that actual bodily harm had been maliciously inflicted upon the victim but that this had been done with intent to have sexual intercourse as defined by the Crimes Act"".


	
	These arguments, and the fact that they have been comprehensively dealt with on appeal at a time more proximate to the trial, make the following observation of Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 particularly apposite to the present application:
	


“The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result.”


	
	In Application by Ivan Milat under Section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 209 Johnson J considered the history and application of s 79(3) of the Crime (Appeal and Review) Act [11]-[22] and concluded:
	


“20    It may be seen that the balance being struck by the provisions then contained in s.474E(3), and now contained in s.79(3), involved an appropriate remedial process for applications for a post-conviction inquiry and the need to guard against “the waste of judicial resources that can flow from repeated unmeritorious applications for inquiries”.

21.   In a case to which s.79(3) applies, the Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. This course may be taken where one or more of the circumstances identified in s.79(3)(a)(i)-(iv) arises and, in addition, the Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action: s.79(3)(b).

4. Inconsistency between internal police documents and the Crown case


	
	The applicant argues that the Crown case in relation to his assault of Constable Meredith is inconsistent with an internal police report of the same incident. The reports the applicant points to were created during a police internal investigation that was initiated by the applicant after he had complained about his treatment during and after his arrest. The applicant acquired these documents through FOI requests.
	
	
	The applicant says that due to the nature of his arrest, where he was handcuffed and held by four police officers, it would have been physically impossible for him to assault Constable Meredith.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the applicant kneed Constable Meredith in the groin. This is consistent with the version of events that Constable Meredith gave in his evidence and in his reports to police internal investigations. However, an internal report made by a Mr Cushway, one of the detectives on the case, records that, during the struggle to arrest the applicant, Meredith was punched and kicked in the upper body. It makes no mention of a kick or knee to the groin.
	
	
	The applicant further points to an alleged inconsistency in Cushway’s report that after the arrest Constable Meredith went “of[f] duty on sick report”. The applicant says this is inconsistent as Constable Meredith accompanied him to his bail appearance the next day on 4 May 1991.
	
	
	The applicant relies on these inconsistencies as evidence that the assault on Meredith was fabricated. The applicant further submits that the false evidence given by Constable Meredith in relation to the first count should also impact on the Court’s assessment of the third count. In other words, all of the offences on the indictment should be quashed.
	
	
	The alleged inconsistencies arising from the reports of Detective Cushway fail to raise any real possibility that the entire assault was fabricated. The evidence of Constable Meredith was tested and accepted at trial. Detective Cushway’s report that after the arrest Constable Meredith went “of[f] duty on sick report” is not necessarily inconsistent with Constable Meredith taking the applicant to the bail court. The report does not specify when and for how long Constable Meredith was off sick.
	
	
	Finally, the applicant had a right to appeal against his conviction for the assault charge at the same time as he pursued his appeal against the conviction for the sexual assault charge. Studdert J noted “the appellant appeals only against his conviction in respect of the offence charged in the first count”. Section 79(3)(iii) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) provides that a court may refuse to deal with an application if the matter:
	


“(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made.”


	
	If the application related solely to the conviction for assault, I would be inclined to refuse to deal with it under s 79(3)(iii). However, given its close connection to the conviction for the aggravated sexual assault, I will not invoke that provision.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	This Court may refuse to consider an application for review pursuant to s 79(3) of the Act if it appears the matter:
	


“(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions,

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.”


	
	With the exception of the arguments based around the reports and forms obtained under the Freedom of Information request (considered above at [14]-[23]), all of the matters raised in this application were dealt with in the 1998 appeal. I would be inclined to refuse to consider this application pursuant to s 79(3) if it were not for that singe fresh argument (putting aside whether it is “fresh evidence” as that term is generally understood) and the applicant’s contention that those documents may give rise to an inference that there was another suspect called “BLATCH” and the capacity of that inference to undermine the testimony of Constable Meredith. However, in view of that one matter, I have reviewed all of the material provided with that particular issue at the forefront of my consideration.
	
	
	Having conducted that review and considered the submissions of both parties, I am unable to conclude that there is a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s 79(2). I am not left with the sense of disquiet or unease that the authorities refer to as justifying action under the section: see, for example, R v Garry Andrew Bayliss [2001] NSWSC 732; 124 A Crim R 362 at [3]. I also apply the observations of Beech-Jones J in SKAF, Bilal - Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 45 at [21; 24].
	
	
	In the final analysis, the conclusions that the applicant seeks to be drawn from the “BLATCH” evidence is more in the nature of speculation than it is a process of proper and logic-based circumstantial reasoning.
	
	
	I would not exercise my power to order an inquiry or to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as on an appeal.
	
	
	The application is dismissed.

Introduction


	
	In FieldturfInc v Balsam Pacific Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 809, Finkelstein J made two points which are now widely accepted as important in case management. Firstly, he warned that “no one seriously suggests that the system of pleadings is adequate” in telling the opponent (or the court) what the case is about (at [6]) and, secondly, that when parties are unable to define the issues in dispute, the earlier the court intervenes, the better (at [11]; see also Holden Ltd and Ors v TTF Dandenong Pty Ltd and Ors [2004] VSC 175 at [7]). The circumstances giving rise to these proceedings demonstrate the former problem, and require the latter solution.
	
	
	The matter complained of in these proceedings gives rise to particular difficulties by reason of the antiquity of events, the wide range of imputations available (not all of which are pleaded), and the informal language which no doubt results from these events having passed into Australian folklore over the past thirty years. The plaintiff, who turns 96 in September 2015, complains of references to his activities from approximately 1976 onwards, in events now generally referred to as “the Age Tapes” scandal, as set out in chapter 15 of “He Who Must Be Obeid”, a book about the circumstances in which Mr Obeid has come to be the subject of findings in the Independent Commission Against Corruption (“ICAC”).
	
	
	The relevant portion of this publication, almost as colourful as the events it describes, starts by referring to a 1976 police undercover investigation which included phone-tapping Australia’s most notorious organised crime figures, Bob Trimbole, George Freeman and Abe Saffron. In the words of the matter complained of, these police “could not believe what they were hearing”, in that underneath the surface of Sydney society there was a “corrupt network of lawyers, politicians, crime figures, judges and the obligatory handful of colourful racing identities”, from whom, at a price, you could buy anything. The matter complained of states that the “nervous” editors of the Sydney Morning Herald were afraid to publish this “very Sydney story”, but the Age published this “explosive” material in February 1984. That material referred extensively to the plaintiff; among the “more sensational” material was evidence that a judge of the High Court had attempted to influence court proceedings in which the plaintiff (described by the High Court judge as “my little mate”) was involved. The plaintiff was described in police intelligence reports as “a go-between for major organised crime figures” and by the matter complained of as having had “a lot of fingers in some very grubby pies”. Excerpts from the confidential findings in Volume II of the April 1986 Stewart Royal Commission (footnote 11 to paragraph 12 of the matter complained of; Volume 1, the contents of which were not confidential, appears at http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1985-87No96.pdf) are included in narrative of events of what the author calls the “national scandal” (paragraph 6 of the matter complained of) that then ensued.
	
	
	Due to the plaintiff’s advanced years, I was requested to hear the defendant’s challenge to the imputations on an urgent basis. This resulted in a degree of informality in the conducting of the hearing. However, the plaintiff cannot expect the court to give him the indulgence of a speedy trial unless these proceedings are appropriately pleaded and particularised. If the plaintiff seeks an early hearing date, his legal representatives need to formulate the claim now, rather than make further applications for amendments of the kind that came before the court today.
	
	
	The amendments to the plaintiff’s case since the statement of claim was filed are already substantial. The plaintiff, in submissions provided late last night, added a further four imputations to those already pleaded and reformulated others; further reformulations were proposed in the course of the hearing. As a result, I have made orders today on the basis that I would provide reasons for decision after having reviewed the many issues raised “on the run”, as well as the adequacy of the orders, as a result of the changing nature of the parties’ applications before me.
	
	
	The defendant has taken a number of what may be described as technical objections to the form (and, in one case, the capacity) of the imputations, on the basis that the plaintiff must identify the imputations with precision, this still being a requirement of imputations pleaded in New South Wales by reason of r 14.30 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) notwithstanding the replacement of the imputation as the cause of action with the matter complained of (Bateman v Fairfax Media (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1380 at [6] – [10]). I readily understand the defendant’s difficulty, in part because the events occurred long ago, and in part because of the difficulties it will encounter in pleading any defence of contextual justification under the poorly drafted s 26 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). There is thus more than usual force in Mr Potter’s complaint that the linguistic ambiguities of the imputations mean that his client does not know how to justify the imputations. This will be an important feature of case management of this action generally.
	
	
	The solution to disputes about the form and capacity of imputations is generally the time-honoured practice of applications to the court, requiring the plaintiff to redraft (sometimes several times) the imputations to which objections of form have been raised, interspersed with the usual applications for leave to appeal. This procedure was recently considered by Sackville AJA, in Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Hibbert [2015] NSWCA 13 at [24]-[25], in the context of the overriding case management provisions of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Refusing an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Bozic DCJ concerning the form and capacity of imputations, his Honour stated:
	


“[24] The decision of the primary Judge is properly characterised as an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure, rather than a decision which affects substantive rights. The court is reluctant to grant leave to appeal from such a decision. The reason for that reluctance was given almost 70 years ago by Jordan CJ (Nicholas CJ in Eq concurring) in In re the Will of FB Gilbert (Dec’d) (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318 at 323:

“In [cases of this kind], if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of Judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in Chambers to a Court of Appeal.”

[25] Jordan CJ’s strictures are given added force by the direction in s 56(2) of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) requiring the Court to seek to give effect to the “overriding purpose“ stated in s 56(1) when exercising any power conferred by the Act or the rules of court. That overriding purpose is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings. The significance of the overriding purpose in the conduct of litigation has recently been emphasised by a unanimous High Court: Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 46; 250 CLR 303 at [56]–[57]. The overriding purpose is as important in defamation proceedings as in other forms of civil litigation: Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at [29]–[31] (Spigelman CJ; Basten and Campbell JJA agreeing).”


	
	The reason for the significance of these comments is that, in Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 46; 250 CLR 303, a decision their Honours referred to in the extract above, the High Court also stated (at [39] – [40]):
	


“[39] Speaking of what the case management provisions in the CPR might mean for the conduct of litigation, in Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc the Court of Appeal explained that:

“It is no longer the role of the court simply to provide a level playing field and to referee whatever game the parties choose to play upon it. The court is concerned to ensure that judicial and court resources are appropriately and proportionately used in accordance with the requirements of justice.”

Earlier, in Biguzzi v Rank Leisure Plc, Lord Woolf MR had doubted that authorities decided under the old procedure could continue to be binding or even persuasive.

[40] There are some examples of the application of a new approach by English Courts to case management. In Hertsmere Primary Care Trust v Administrators of Balasubramanium’s Estate, the claimants sent a letter of offer which did not technically comply with the CPR. The defendant’s lawyers realised the error and sought to take advantage of it at a later date in resisting a Calderbank style order for costs. Lightman J rejected the defendant’s submission that there was no duty on the part of its lawyers to cooperate and enable the claimants to rectify the error. His Honour said: “[t]hat may have been the law prior to the CPR, but it is not the law today.” (Footnotes omitted)


	
	Principles of proportionality, as set out in s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and reflected in Practice Note No 6, should be a factor which should be taken into account when determining issues of form and capacity of imputations.
	
	
	However, this is, at present, a factor of very limited compass. For example, I cannot adopt the more flexible approach to imputations taken in other jurisdictions in Australia. In particular, I cannot adopt the procedure under the Defamation Act 2013 (UK), although Mr Rasmussen has provided me with a copy of Cooke & Anor v MGN Limited [2014] EWHC 2381 and commended the course taken by the judge, as outlined at [6] – [19]. In Cooke, a separate trial on defamatory meaning and serious harm, the judge invited both parties to identify the imputations at the same time, and then decided which imputations are conveyed. This is contrary to the Australian practice of leaving it to the plaintiff to plead imputations, which are then challenged in a series of separate arguments, followed by arguments about contextual imputations and whether the plaintiff can adopt these, which arguments may now, according to Hibbert, continue up to the making of such an application to the trial judge. The likelihood that these proceedings will follow such a path seems inevitable, but there is no alternative procedure available.
	
	
	The imputations initially pleaded, and as now amended, are set out below.
	


The imputations


	
	The imputations pleaded in the statement of claim, as amended in the written submissions and/or during argument, are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a go-between for major organised crime figures.
	
	
	The plaintiff has a lot of fingers in very grubby pies.
	
	
	The plaintiff used an alias, “Jim Brown”, to ring Garry Boyd at the Immigration Department to ask for favours – The plaintiff’s written submissions sought leave to amend to read: “The plaintiff misled officers of the Department of Immigration by calling Garry Boyd using an alias to ask him for favours”. The defendant challenged this revised form of pleading as well.
	
	
	The plaintiff, Brian and Garry Boyd and Abe Saffron (the major organised crime figure of his day) were involved in an SP bookmaking ring.
	
	
	The plaintiff, Brian and Garry Boyd and Abe Saffron (the major organised crime figure of his day) were involved in illegal casinos being run with police [sic] – The plaintiff in written submissions sought leave to split this into two imputations: (e)(i) “The plaintiff, Brian and Garry Boyd and Abe Saffron (the major crime figure of his day) were involved in illegal casinos”; and (e)(ii) “The plaintiff, Brian and Garry Boyd and Abe Saffron (the major crime figure of his day) paid police to protect the operation of their illegal casinos”. The defendant challenged these revised imputations as well.
	
	
	The plaintiff and illegal gambling figure John Yuen conspired to give Labor strongman John Ducker a $50,000 bribe to influence the Wran Government to give a casino licence to Yuen who ran an illegal casino in Chinatown.
	
	
	The plaintiff was involved with John Yuen in an immigration racket through which they were bringing in cheap Korean labour for construction giant Transfield – The plaintiff in written submissions sought leave to amend this imputation to read: “The plaintiff was involved with John Yuen in an immigration racket through which they were bringing in cheap Korean labour for construction giant Transfield”, but abandoned this formulation in oral argument.
	
	
	The plaintiff, John Yuen, Abe Saffron and the Boyd brothers were involved in running illegal gaming venues in Dixon Street Chinatown.
	
	
	The plaintiff, John Yuen, Abe Saffron and the Boyd brothers were involved in criminal activity with regard to SP betting activities.
	
	
	The plaintiff, Abe Saffron and the Boyds were paying for police protection – The plaintiff in written submissions sought leave to replead this imputation as: “The plaintiff, Abe Saffron and the Boyds paid police to protect their SP Betting activities.”
	
	
	The plaintiff dishonestly paid Garry Boyd monies to approve of [sic] applications for permanent resident status.
	
	
	The plaintiff together with John Yuen, Brian Boyd and Garry Boyd and Robert England may have been involved in forging documents, conspiracy and misleading officers of the Department of Immigration – The plaintiff in written submissions sought leave to split this imputation into three separate imputations: (l1) “The plaintiff, together with John Yuen, Brian Boyd and Garry Boyd and Robert England may have been involved in forging documents”; (l2) “The plaintiff, together with John Yuen, Brian Boyd and Garry Boyd and Robert England may have been involved in a conspiracy”; and (l3) “The plaintiff, together with John Yuen, Brian Boyd and Garry Boyd and Robert England may have been involved in misleading officers of the Department of Immigration”. The defendant challenged these proposed amended imputations. In the course of argument, however, counsel for the plaintiff resiled from these proposals and sought to rely upon the original imputation.
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely pretended that he could influence Neville Wran who was premier of New South Wales – In the course of argument, counsel for the plaintiff conceded this imputation could not be conveyed and sought leave to withdraw it.
	
	
	The plaintiff was a business and financial associate of the Boyd brothers who were financially involved and did business with Eddie Obeid, a corrupt politician – In the course of argument this imputation was withdrawn.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a criminal.
	
	
	Although not pleaded in the statement of claim, the plaintiff sought leave to rely upon an additional imputation: “The plaintiff was knowingly involved in a corrupt Sydney network of lawyers, politicians, crime figures, judges and racing identities in which, for a price, anything could be bought.”
	



	
	The defendant’s objections may be summarised from the correspondence as follows:
	



	
	Imputations 3(b), 3(c), 3(e), 3(j), 3(m) and 3(n) fail to distil a defamatory act or condition of the plaintiff.
	
	
	Imputation 3(k) “does not make sense”.
	
	
	Imputations 3(d), 3(g), 3(h), 3(i) and 3(p) use the word “involved”, which is ambiguous (I note, however, that the matter complained of also uses the word “involved”, and objection in argument was thus restricted to its use in imputations (g) and (p).
	
	
	The use of the phrase “may have” in imputation 3(l) is ambiguous and should not be permitted in pleadings: Christiansen v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1258 at [33]; Alex v Gridneff [2013] NSWSC 2025 at [25].
	
	
	The original imputation 3(l) is rolled up, in that it refers to forgery, conspiracy and misleading officers of the Department of Immigration; the same objection is also made to imputation 3(e).
	
	
	Imputations 3(e) and 3(h) do not differ in substance. The same objection is taken to imputations (d) and (i).
	
	
	References to the names of other persons (and to Mr Saffron as “the major organised crime figure of his day”) are surplusage and should be removed.
	
	
	The jury would have trouble understanding what an “SP bookmaking ring” (imputations 3(d) and 3(i)) was, and this should be rephrased or explained;
	
	
	Imputation 3(m) is not capable of being conveyed. The form of imputation 3(m) is also objected to, in relation to use of the words “falsely pretended” and “influence”.
	


The requirement for precision for imputations in New South Wales


	
	Mr Potter distils four principles arising from the relevant decisions:
	



	
	The plaintiff is obliged to identify for the defendant the act or condition which was understood by the ordinary reasonable reader as having been attributed to him or her. If not, a defendant has no way of knowing whether he can plead various defences to the publication.
	
	
	An imputation must be stated with such precision as to avoid the likelihood of confusion in relation to the meaning the plaintiff contends.
	
	
	To be clear and precise, it is not often that this will be met by adopting the exact language of the publication. However, such words may be used where their meaning is clear.
	
	
	Where a publication is vague and itself lacks specificity then a pleader can do no better than use the words of the publication. Hence a poster that says no more than “X is disgusting” can yield nothing more specific by imputation than the words used. The defamatory imputation must be related to the nature and content of the defamatory matter
	



	
	These principles require pleading at a very high standard; would pleadings in other proceedings survive such scrutiny? There is no parallel scrutiny of words used in, for example, cases where misleading or deceptive language is used, or where particulars of contributory negligence are pleaded.
	
	
	The first issue to determine is what is meant by the claim that an imputation is embarrassing because it fails to identify the “act or condition”, causing “confusion” and ambiguity. What words are ambiguous? The question of what words are ambiguous should not just be a matter of opinion, but a careful analysis of the meaning of the words, in the context of the matter complained of.
	
	
	A word or phrase that is “ambiguous” generally connotes, according to the Oxford Concise Dictionary, more than one meaning. The Court of Appeal considered the issue of an “ambiguous imputation” in Fairfax Media Publications v Alex [2014] NSWCA 273 per McColl JA at [19] – [24], referring to Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425. However, the imputation in Ffrench was genuinely ambiguous, in that it had two meanings. The plaintiffs were trustees for a fund for a quadriplegic, and the imputation in question was one of breach of trust. The defendants sought to call evidence, including expert evidence, that breach of trust in the legal sense had occurred, as opposed to the kind of breach of trust that might be connoted in general discussion. This decision is a good example of the need to consider the nature of the ambiguity concerned in the context of the publication.
	
	
	The word “corrupt”, used in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135, raises a meaning problem of a different nature, more akin to the “confusion” referred to by Mr Potter, in that the word has a series of “different shades” (at 138 per Gleeson CJ) of meaning, as well as being “notable for its generality and vagueness”. This word, again, is not a general example of the tendency of common words in the English language to be ambiguous, but an exception to the rule.
	
	
	Is a word with a general and vague meaning ambiguous, or is it simply meaningless unless properly defined? The word “disgusting” is a term of generality, but Gleeson CJ considered (at 137) that a publication solely stating “X is disgusting” needed no further refinement in terms of the imputation pleaded.
	
	
	Gleeson CJ’s explanation should resolve many arguments about the need for specificity. In Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 at [20] - [21] Beazley and Ward JJA explained:
	


“[20] The specificity with which an imputation must be pleaded was referred to by Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 137,where his Honour said:

“If a defendant has posted in a public place a sign that simply says ‘X is disgusting’, the degree of specificity with which it is appropriate to require X to formulate the defamatory imputation will need to be related to the nature and content of the defamatory matter.”

[21] Many of the disputes about ambiguity arise from the use of the words in the matter complained of. In 21 An imputation may plead or closely follow the exact words used in the alleged defamatory publication: see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin [2003] HCA 50; 201 ALR 77 at [63]. However, as Hunt AJA pointed out in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [126]:

“Merely pleading the words of the matter complained of as the imputation for which the plaintiff contends where those words do not adequately distil the act or condition attributed to the plaintiff, and thus identify his cause of action, is not a compliance with Pt 67 r 11(2).””


	
	This brings me to the principal nature of the objections here, namely that where the words of the matter complained of are used in the imputation, only rarely should this be permitted, firstly because they cannot capture the sting, and secondly because the defendant’s words (not the words of the imputation) are ambiguous, and the meaning is therefore not sufficiently clear to support an imputation.
	
	
	In Drummoyne, both Kirby JA (at 144 - 150) and Priestley JA (at 156) reiterated the correctness of Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682. In Hepburn, Hutley JA stated that “it is strange to hear the suggestion that this defendant does not understand an imputation which is precisely in the words it has used, so that it is embarrassed in justifying it.”
	
	
	The question of whether a word or phrase is ambiguous, or imprecise, is not resolved by looking at the form of words used in the imputation in isolation, but of considering the imputation in the context of the matter complained of. If the use of the word or phrase in the matter complained of contains the sting, assertions of ambiguity due to the loose or colourful nature of the language, or because a metaphor or slang is used, must become difficult to maintain. In the present case, the simple and direct language of the matter complained of lends itself well to the formulation of imputations using the same or very similar words.
	
	
	The interlocutory battle between the plaintiff who seeks to use words as close as possible to the matter complained of and the defendant who seeks words of a more distant import needs to be scrutinised in the context of what the publication says. Where the language of the matter complained of is colourful, in general terms and informal, as is the case here, calls for a greater level of specificity in the imputations than is contained in the matter complained of should be viewed with caution, as the very formality of the language required for the imputations may become a barrier for the tribunal of fact.
	
	
	Having noted the parties’ respective submissions on these issues, I now consider the imputations in question.
	


Imputation 3(a), 3(f) and 3(o)


	
	No objection is taken to these imputations and they will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 3(b)


	
	Mr Potter’s submission is firstly that the matter complained of is incapable of any meaning at all, in that the metaphor of a finger in the pie is incapable of precision and, secondly, that the appropriate level of precision cannot be achieved by repeating the words in the matter complained of.
	
	
	The correct approach to interpretation of sayings, metaphors and similes, has been considered in decisions at appellate level. In C v L and Ors [2005] SASC 315 at [30] – [33] and [70] the Full Court of the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal in relation, inter alia, to defamatory meaning where the imputation was that the plaintiff treated someone “like a doormat”. Besanko J noted that the metaphor was capable of shades of meaning, but that the simile conveyed a defamatory meaning of treating someone shabbily.
	
	
	It is possible to distil a meaning capable of being defamatory even where no words appear at all. In Darbyshir v Daily Examiner Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 2 May 1997), an advertisement for the plaintiff’s services as a solicitor was embellished, by the newspaper, with an illustration of a vulture. Levine J permitted the plaintiff to plead an imputation that she was a vulture.
	
	
	In neither of the above cases was the plaintiff obliged to cast about for a reformulation of the sting. The words of the matter complained of, and the use of a popular saying, namely that someone has a finger in the pie (the inference being, since fingers should not be put into pies, pejorative) are simple and direct and the meaning is capable of being understood by the ordinary reasonable reader.
	
	
	I do not accept Mr Potter’s submission that no imputation can be distilled from this expression because of its vagueness and/or generality. The use of informal language or colourful analogies in the matter complained of is designed to be understood and descriptive of the act or condition ascribed to the plaintiff. For any person to have a finger in a pie is capable of pejorative meaning, according to the Concise Oxford Dictionary. The fact that these were “very bad” pies confirms this. For the reasons explained by Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Council, supra, the fact that a wide range of conduct is connoted by the use of this expression in the matter complained of would not warrant a restriction of the imputation distilled from it to some lesser meaning.
	
	
	According to my notes, Mr Potter’s alternative submission is that any imputation conveyed is not different in substance from imputation (o), namely that the plaintiff is a criminal. I do not accept that submission, as that the conduct in this imputation need not be criminal at all. Having a finger in a pie generally does not generally connote criminality, and neither does the word “bad”.  Mr Potter says that his second submission was that, apart from being impermissibly imprecise, the matter complained of permitted further specificity (in contra to only ‘X is disgusting’) which was picked up in later imputations: Greenfield v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1940.  Conformably with my earlier comments as to the tenor of the matter complained of, I reject this submission that further specificity is required.
	
	
	This imputation will go to the jury.
	


Imputations 3(c), 3(e), 3(j) and 3(m)


	
	These imputations were withdrawn in the course of argument. The first proposed alternative 3(e) was, however, struck out as not differing in substance from imputation 3(h), as is set out below.
	


Imputation 3(d)


	
	The defendant objected to the use of the words “SP bookmaking ring”, submitting that it was no longer part of everyday language and understanding, and that a jury would not be able to understand it unless it was accompanied by explanatory words.
	
	
	Courts should be cautious in making assumptions about what an ordinary reasonable reader may or may not know, as the differing opinions in Hill v Westfield [2003] NSWSC 437 and Forrest v Askew [2007] WASC 161 show. In Hill v Westfield Simpson J was persuaded that the ordinary reasonable reader would not understand that insider trading was a criminal offence. Her Honour explained her reasons for such a finding as follows:
	


“[12] In written submissions presented on behalf of the plaintiff, and in response to the defendants’ submissions, it was asserted that the matter complained of appeared in the financial pages of the newspaper. Whether or not that is so I do not know; there is no evidence and no pleading to that effect. For the purposes of the argument I am prepared to assume that it is the case. But it advances the plaintiff’s case not at all. The capacity of a publication to convey imputations in its natural and ordinary meaning does not depend upon the identity of recipients, or a specific class of recipient, but is to be determined by the application of an objective test: see Reader’s Digest Services Pty Ltd v Lamb(1982) 150 CLR 500 at 505–506.

[13] It may well be the case that many members of the public are aware, in some sense at least, of the concept of insider trading, and even that it constitutes a criminal offence. However, I am not satisfied that the level of public understanding of the concept is such as to warrant the conclusion that, from the factual matters asserted in the article, the ordinary reasonable reader would draw the conclusion that the assertions amounted to an accusation of insider trading.”


	
	In Forrest v Askew Newnes J, in the course of determining whether an imputation of insider trading was conveyed, disagreed with the approach taken by Simpson J in Hill v Westfield:
	


“[63] I do not consider that Hill v Westfield (above) assists the defendants. In that case two articles fell for consideration. In the first there was no reference in the words complained of to ""insider trading"". Simpson J said (at [13]) that it may well be the case that many members of the public are aware, in some sense at least, of the concept of insider trading, and even that it constitutes a criminal offence, but her Honour was not satisfied that the public understanding was such as to warrant the conclusion that, from the factual matter in the article, the ordinary reasonable reader would understand that the assertions amounted to insider trading. In respect of the second article there was an express reference to insider trading but it did not identify it as a criminal offence nor explain the concept. Simpson J concluded that the concept of insider trading was not sufficiently widely known in the public arena, and the ordinary reasonable reader was not aware that it was a criminal offence, so her Honour struck out an imputation that the plaintiff had committed the criminal offence of insider trading.

[63] In the present case, in my view, it is arguable that the article makes sufficiently clear what the concept involves and the reference to charges makes it clear that it is an offence. I would, in any event, respectfully disagree with Simpson J that it is clear that the concept is not sufficiently understood in the community so that such an imputation should be struck out at an interlocutory stage.


	
	I adopt the approach taken by Newnes J. The matter complained of makes sufficiently clear what SP bookmaking involves, and the reference to illegality makes it clear that such conduct is against the law. The defendant’s submission that these words are imprecise and require explanation and/or extrinsic facts pleaded is accordingly rejected.
	
	
	However, I accept the defendant’s submission that the words “the organised crime figure of his day” are surplusage, in that the sting of association with such a crime figure may be determined by the reader looking at the matter complained of. It is not necessary for it to be repeated in the imputation, and it is confusing that it is repeated in some imputations but not others. Accordingly, these words should be deleted from all the imputations in which they appear.
	
	
	The defendant’s remaining objection to this imputation, and to others where the plaintiff’s alleged partners in crimes are named, is that these imputations should be split into two meanings: one being that he associated with these specific criminals and the other being that he performed these acts in the company of persons Mr Potter submitted should be described as “other criminals” or “other persons”.
	
	
	This submission goes beyond the requirement for precision in imputations. The matter complained of clearly states that the plaintiff carried out this activity with those persons, and not a separate imputation that he associated with them. The fact that he carried out these activities in association with these specific persons is an essential part of the sting of the imputation.
	
	
	This imputation, appropriately amended, will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 3(g)


	
	The matter complained of uses the word “involved” on several occasions, and the basis for the defendant’s objection to it as ambiguous is without merit. An objection to the word “involved” was specifically rejected by Nicholas J in Wafawarova v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2007] NSWSC 1212 at [18]; see also Ainsworth v Burden [2000] NSWSC 105, referred to with approval in King v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1244 at [15].
	
	
	The defendant submitted that the reference to the “construction giant Transfield” should be deleted as surplusage and the imputation was rolled up. The plaintiff initially responded by redrafting this imputation but, in the course of argument, returned to the original pleading. As to the reference to Transfield, part of the sting of the libel is the bringing in of cheap labour for a company that is a “giant” and this should be permitted to remain.
	
	
	This imputation will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 3(h)


	
	The matter complained of refers to illegal casinos in Chinatown in paragraphs 4 and 5, in which John Yuen was involved. This allegation is repeated in paragraph 11, where the reference is to “illegal gambling venues in Dixon Street Chinatown”.
	
	
	Although Mr Rasmussen argued that two different casinos were involved, it is clear that these gambling places are the same; paragraph 11 is the finding of Justice Don Stewart about who was running them and these are the same persons.
	
	
	Accordingly, counsel for the plaintiff was called upon to decide whether he wanted to rely upon 3(e) or 3(h). Mr Rasmussen chose 3(h), so this imputation will go to the jury.
	


Imputations 3(i) and 3(j)


	
	Mr Rasmussen sought to withdraw imputation 3(i) to replead it and, given the similar territory for imputation 3(j), I have deferred ruling upon it until I see the redraft of 3(i) and am apprised of any objections by the defendant. If there are no further objections to these imputations, I will be able to make orders accordingly when the matter is next before the court.
	


Imputation 3(k)


	
	The objection taken to this imputation in correspondence was that it “does not make sense” and “does not specify how the plaintiff’s conduct was dishonest”.
	
	
	Mr Boyd is described as an official in the Department of Immigration. Payment to him personally for the purpose of approval of a residency status application, as opposed to a payment to the department for the purpose of processing the application (whether it is successful or fails) is the dishonesty in question, and this is clear from the text of the matter complained of.
	
	
	An alternate claim that this imputation does not differ in substance from 3(g) also fails. These transactions relate to payments for permanent residency, not for bringing in “cheap Korean labour”. I am satisfied that, to the ordinary reasonable reader, it is arguably the case that the plaintiff was involved in different immigration scams: ringing up Garry Boyd under an alias to ask for favours (paragraph 3); the “immigration racket” for cheap Korean labour in which the plaintiff and John Yuen were involved (paragraph 5); payments to Garry Boyd for approval of applications for permanent residency status (paragraph 12); misleading officers from the Department of Immigration (paragraph 12).
	
	
	I am conscious that paragraph 13 refers to John Yuen being convicted over “the immigration racket”, but whether the ordinary reasonable reader assumes that this was one overarching racket or a series of rackets should be an issue for the trial. I note, in any event, that the challenge to this imputation was one of failing to differ in substance rather than capacity, and that as no UCPR r 28.2 separate trial was sought, the plaintiff may, as Sackville A-JA noted in Hibbert, raise these issues at a later date, including at the trial.
	
	
	This imputation will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 3(l)


	
	As the defendant’s submissions note, the practice of replacing “reasonably suspected of” with “may have” is one which has not been accepted as a pleading practice. The clear import of the matter complained of is that the plaintiff was reasonably suspected by Justice Don Stewart, the Royal Commissioner who headed the Royal Commission into The Age tapes, of involvement in each of these three activities, which must be separately pleaded. This will give sufficient precision to these three imputations to permit the defendant to prove their contents by tender of the report containing the words extracted from it.
	
	
	Leave to replead has accordingly been granted.
	


Imputation 3(n)


	
	Mr Rasmussen sought leave to withdraw this imputation, acknowledging that doing business with someone who did business with “Eddie Obeid a corrupt politician” was not capable of being defamatory. It is accordingly struck out.
	


Imputation 3(p)


	
	Mr Potter’s objection to the word “involved” is covered by my previous ruling. He additionally submitted that the phrase “in which, for a price, anything could be bought” should be pleaded as a separate imputation as it rolled up the additional factor of being a member of the corrupt network.
	
	
	I do not accept this submission. These additional words identify what the network was for. This imputation will go to the jury.
	


Costs


	
	Mr Rasmussen submitted that his client had been substantially successful, in that more than half of the imputations challenged had survived scrutiny.
	
	
	The substantial changes made to the imputations in written submissions were themselves the subject of further changes in the course of the argument. The defendant’s submissions included many sensible proposals which the plaintiff could have saved time by adopting. The defendant was, on balance, more successful than the plaintiff and that should be reflected in the costs order. Accordingly the costs should be the defendant’s costs in the cause.
	
	
	The parties were able to agree on a timetable to allow for a further argument on the amended pleading, as is set out in the orders made. As noted at the commencement of this judgment, these proceedings will need careful case management because of the plaintiff’s age and the long period of time since the events in question. The plaintiff has been put on notice that he must include all imputations he relies upon in the next pleading, and not assume he can continue to add imputations as he goes along (including the repleading of contextual imputations) without compelling reason.
	


Orders


	
	Imputation 3(a), 3(f) and 3(o) will go to the jury.
	
	
	Imputation 3(b) will go to the jury.
	
	
	Note imputation 3(c) is withdrawn; strike out proposed imputation 3(c) with leave to replead.
	
	
	Strike out from imputation 3(d) the words “the major organised crime figure of his day” but otherwise this imputation will go to the jury.
	
	
	Note imputation 3(e) is withdrawn and grant leave to the plaintiff to replead this imputation as proposed, but deleting the words “the major organised crime figure of his day”; this amended imputation will go to the jury.
	
	
	Noting the plaintiff withdraws the proposed repleading, imputation 3(g) will go to the jury.
	
	
	Note in relation to imputation 3(h), the proposed second form of imputation 3(e), namely that “The plaintiff, Brian and Garry Boyd and Abe Saffron were involved in illegal casinos” does not differ in substance from imputation 3(h), and imputation 3(h) is the imputation the plaintiff selects to go to the jury.
	
	
	Strike out imputation 3(i) with leave to replead so that this imputation will differ in substance from imputation 3(d).
	
	
	Note that imputation 3(j) is withdrawn and grant the plaintiff leave to replead.
	
	
	Imputation 3(k), subject to deleting the word “of”, will go to the jury.
	
	
	Imputation 3(l) is struck out with leave to replead imputations to the effect that the plaintiff was reasonably suspected by Justice Don Stewart, the Royal Commissioner who headed the Royal Commission into The Age tapes, of involvement in: (a) forging documents; (b) conspiracy; and (c) misleading officers of the Department of Immigration (each to be a separate imputation).
	
	
	Imputation 3(m) is withdrawn and struck out on the basis of capacity.
	
	
	Imputation 3(n) is withdrawn and struck out.
	
	
	Grant leave to the plaintiff to plead imputation 3(p): “The plaintiff was knowingly involved in a corrupt Sydney network of lawyers, politicians, crime figures, judges and racing identities in which, for a price, anything could be bought”; this imputation will go to the jury.
	
	
	Costs of this application to be the defendant’s costs in the cause.
	
	
	Plaintiff’s Amended Statement of Claim by Friday 27 March 2015.
	
	
	Defendant’s objections by Thursday 9 April 2015.

2703727,R v WOODS [2015] NSWDC 228,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Cameron Leonard Woods appears today for sentence in relation to what are now five offences on an indictment which was presented today, although the accused was committed for sentence from the Local Court.
	
	
	There was a deficiency in one of the Court Attendance Notices that was detected yesterday when this matter started before me. I was in the middle of a busy list of sentence matters and I stood the matter over to today to complete the matter given, amongst other things, the convenience of the Crown, counsel for the accused and appearance of the prisoner who had travelled down from the North Coast.
	
	
	The indictment presented today encapsulating what was reflected in the Court Attendance Notices the subject of committal for sentence, alleges charges of supplying a prohibited drug to wit 3,4‑methylenedioxyamphetamine, otherwise known as MDMA between 4 April 2014 and 1 May 2014 at various places, usually in Sydney. Although, to be fair, count 4 is in fact an offence of “knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug” intimately concerned with the supply of that particular drug.
	
	
	A charge brought pursuant to s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment or 2,000 penalty units or both. There is no standard non-parole period for that offence.
	
	
	The fifth count on the indictment is an offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug 3,4 methylenedioxyamphetamine on 8 April 2014. This is an offence contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment or 3,500 penalty units or both and has the standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested on the date of the commission of the fifth matter on the indictment, the most serious charge, and has been in custody since that date. The sentences will be calculated to take into account all time spent in custody. The pleas of guilty entered at the Local Court as I earlier explained were entered at the first reasonable opportunity, there is no doubt the prisoner is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian benefit of his pleas of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton and the discount he is accorded is in accordance with that guideline judgement, 25% in respect of each offence.
	
	
	There are five matters on a Form 1 which are to be taken into account in respect of the principal offence which is count 5 in the indictment, the supply not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA. Those five charges are three charges of supplying small quantities of MDMA on 22 February, 20 March and 17 April 2014, a charge of supplying 6.99 grams of cocaine on 24 April 2014 and a charge of possessing a restricted substance as a result of a police search of premises occupied by the prisoner after his arrest at Terrigal. Identified in the Form 1 are particulars and Court Attendance Notices are attached to the Form 1 that have been provided to the Court.
	
	
	Those matters will be taken into account in accordance with the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to Form 1 matters ((2002) 56 NSWLR 147 Attorney‑General’s Application No 1 of 2002) and I particularly refer in general terms to the observations of the Chief Justice for the Court between [18] - [43]. I am only sentencing for the “principal offence.”
	


“It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1.”


	
	It is acknowledged, for example, at [18] that, “The entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone” in the appropriate case.
	
	
	In this particular matter these other offences do not greatly aggravate the criminality of the principal offence which is substantial. But they provide, particularly as to the supply prohibited drug offences, a context for what is self-evident from the facts. That is, the prisoner was involved in an ongoing sale of prohibited drugs over a period of nearly three months and the conduct of the prisoner involved escalating criminality as undercover agents or else police operatives lured him into providing greater and greater amounts of prohibited drugs, particularly MDMA. Which I hasten to say, as the facts reveal, were provided to the prisoner by a person who obviously was substantially involved in drug distribution. The prisoner was, if one can use the expression, ‘the middleman’ in the relevant transactions. Although it is clear he was cultivated by, and himself cultivated the relationship with, an undercover operative.
	
	
	In relation to this matter, further, there is an offence on a s 166 certificate to complicate matters further which is a related offence of having in his possession $460 which was proceeds of crime. For some reason he was charged under the Commonwealth Criminal Code pursuant to s 400.8(1) of that Code. The sum was a modest sum. It was found with some capsules believed to be MDMA tablets. That matter will be the subject of a discrete sentence but which will be concurrent with the non-parole period the law requires me to fix in relation to the principal offence, that is, count 5 on the indictment.
	
	
	I have already provided somewhat of a global summary of the offending but it is important that just reflect upon some of the details taken from the agreed facts and the evidence that the prisoner gave today, in the context of histories the prisoner has given to the Community Corrections Service and to a psychologist.
	
	
	The police set up a strike force to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs in the Sydney area and the prisoner came within the thrall of that particular operation. It was the case the prisoner was in contact with undercover operatives who obviously, working on behalf of the Police Force, were able to pass the drugs obtained onto investigators and they can be analysed on the spot so that there is no doubt as to the quantities involved and the purity of the drugs.
	
	
	I interpose at this point to reflect upon some evidence given by the prisoner that I have just mentioned in passing. The prisoner was a man substantially without criminal convictions. He has a finding of guilt for driving whilst suspended, but he is not a person who is naturally disposed to criminal activity. There is no suggestion of him having what could be described as an ‘antisocial personality’. He had generally been in employment, largely working in the mining industry until he was 26 years of age when he suffered a back injury, the circumstances of which he explained in the careful cross‑examination of the learned Crown Prosecutor. It led to him losing his employment from which he received a modest, it would seem, compensation payment for the injury suffered to his back, this was a sum of just over $12,000, he lived off that sum in part. Not being able to work in the mining industry he took up working as a DJ, it would seem, somewhere on the Central Coast. He obviously came into contact with people involved in what is sometimes colloquially called the “party lifestyle” and in the context of the reaction to his loss of employment, perhaps to some extent the pain he was in and the like, the prisoner, who had only occasionally dabbled in prohibited drugs before, commenced to use quantities of prohibited drugs, particularly MDMA. I am satisfied on the evidence he became dependent upon them. He developed a drug debt which he in fairness to him frankly conceded was $1,700. Although the Community Corrections Service wrongly reported it as $7,000. Usually when people are making up a story they tend to increase the amount for sentencing purposes rather than decrease it as the prisoner frankly did on this occasion.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence of being approached by a number of people that he understood were connected with the Rebels ‘outlaw’, as it is sometimes called, motorcycle gang and pressure was put upon him to sell drugs on behalf of members of that group or associates of that group in order to reduce his debt. In the period of time between February and May over which time the prisoner committed the offences with which I am concerned the prisoner gave evidence, at first hand hard to believe but ultimately I accept, that in fact his debt increased, notwithstanding increasingly substantial sums of money being received by him for the purposes of the purchase of drugs from him, supplied to him by a person, or at least one person, called “Ilich.”
	
	
	I pause at the moment to say as is probably self‑evident from anyone who had the opportunity of watching the proceedings that in the fact finding I make at this particular time there is a coalescence so to speak between the facts in the Crown case and the evidence in the defence case because to understand the facts in the Crown case one needs to properly put them in their perspective.
	
	
	The first supply of the prisoner was to an undercover operative of 0.34 grams of MDMA in Sydney. The prisoner charged $30 per capsule and he received a total of $180. The purity of the tablets was very high. The prisoner himself was using the tablets so he must have known what strength they had. This is a level of purity I have not seen in tablets. I have been involved with cases of this type, not just supplies within Australia but importations of massive amount of drugs from what seemed to be endless numbers of MDMA factories in Belgium and the Netherlands, usually the tablets being imported from overseas in the middle of the first decade of the century had a purity of around 25%. I am sentencing some offenders this afternoon who were supplying MDMA or MDA in powder form with a purity of over 70%. Perhaps it is a dangerous trend.
	
	
	I do not draw a conclusion adverse to this prisoner in this context concerning these matters but the facts of the matter are we read of tragedies everyday of young people taking one tablet and dying from the ingestion of that one MDMA tablet. One, in reading those tragic stories, could reflect upon the purity of the drug being in the vicinity of perhaps 20% or even less as was more commonly found in some tablets. One is concerned with, if there are tablets on the street with a purity of around 76 - 75%, what adverse effect that might have upon a susceptible recipient. That charge on 22 February is on the Form 1.
	
	
	The next offence in time is on the Form 1. This is an offence of supplying 1.79 grams of MDMA outside the nightclub where the first supply occurred. The prisoner received $500. He drove his own motor vehicle to the scene, the registration of which was taken. The car I point out was purchased for him by his parents and has been forfeited as proceeds of crime. The purity of these tablets that he sold were 63.5%. The prisoner provided mobile phone numbers or a mobile phone number to the undercover agent.
	
	
	The next supply shows this development of the relationship and, the greater and greater quantities on the prisoner’s account, because of enticement to supply more from the undercover authority. That offence occurred on 4 April, 15 tablets for $500 which were 78.5% pure. This is a supply matter which is on the indictment.
	
	
	The next offence on 10 April is on the indictment. This is supplying 115 capsules containing approximately 6 grams of MDMA outside the same nightclub and receiving $3,000. Again, supplying the drugs from his own car. The purity was 78%.
	
	
	The next offence in time is on the Form 1. This is an offence on 17 April 2014, supplying 15 tablets containing 1.49 grams of MDMA for $500, 79% pure.
	
	
	The next offence again on the Form 1 is on 24 April, supplying 500 clear coloured capsules containing 27.5 grams of MDMA and also supplying 6.99 grams of cocaine (another offence on the Form 1) which caused the prisoner to receive $10,000 for the MDMA and $2,000 for the cocaine. I should pause for a moment to say that the supply of the MDMA is one of the counts on the indictment.
	
	
	The next count, or the next offence, committed on 1 May is on the indictment. It is count 4. This is the supply of 300 clear coloured capsules containing MDMA. The prisoner was given the capsules by a person who is described as “the co-accused” and then the prisoner supplied the tablets over a period of seven or eight days. The approximate weight of the capsules was said to be 30 grams. That supply, as I take it from the facts, although they are not entirely transparent on this regard, would appear to be monitored by telephone intercepts rather than dealing with an undercover operative.
	
	
	The principal offence, Count 5 in the indictment, was committed on 8 May 2014. The prisoner was supplied by the so called “co-accused”. The man who was the provider of drugs at relevant times to the prisoner provided the prisoner with 1,000 capsules and 260 grams of MDMA powder. The prisoner was provided with 1,000 capsules which contained 90.8 grams of MDMA and 260 grams of MDMA powder. He received $39,000 for the powder and $19,000 for the capsules. The prisoner was dealing of course with an undercover operative at this particular point. He was arrested, it would seem, on the spot as the transaction took place. The co-accused was arrested as well and the drugs that he provided to the undercover operative were clearly, based upon the police investigations, provided to him a short time before by the co-accused. The cash that he received was to go to the co-accused.
	
	
	Police investigations led them to his apartment in Terrigal and the various items were found in the house, giving rise to the related offence on the Form 1 and the identification of other drugs, including the restricted substance which is on the Form 1. The average purity of the MDMA supplied by the prisoner over the course of the investigation was 75.5% with the highest purity being 90%.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on 24 February 1987 according to the criminal history I have, therefore, he is now 28 years of age as I have earlier mentioned.
	
	
	He has a minor matter of no relevance on his record and no other convictions. The Community Corrections Service prepared a report in relation to the prisoner and reflected upon the fact that in custody he has incurred no institutional misconduct offences and he has completed various courses including a Positive Lifestyle Program for which I have been provided with a certificate. I have a reference from the Chaplain at the institution where he is held which I will refer to in a moment.
	
	
	There has been some positive feedback in relation to his work within the gaol, although there has been some deterioration in recent weeks.
	
	
	He is an only child. His parents have children from other relationships, as I understand it. He grew up in a loving household and there are no issues in relation to his background that would explain his offending.    He had been in a relationship prior to coming into custody but that was terminated in November 2014 which has had an effect upon him.
	
	
	At school he was subject to some bullying. He attempted to complete a mechanical apprenticeship but was assaulted apparently two years into training and did not complete that apprenticeship. These events, according to the Community Corrections Service, have an impact upon him still. He worked in the mining industry, as I pointed out, for an eight year period until injury. He has been a member of the Australian Army Reserve for a period of time and I have seen a Certificate of Service in that regard. I have already reflected upon the effect of his injury as it is relevant to the assessment of his offending.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Service report reflects upon his use of drugs as I have already summarised it. He has in custody attended some Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, did not find them beneficial. He is willing to engage in interventions to remain drug free.
	
	
	He said that he was able to identify the issues that caused him to engage in the offending with which I am concerned and is able to have insight into that and the effect upon other people of his conduct. Although, only through the fact that he was dealing with people that he did not know were undercover police officers or police operatives that the drugs supplied did not find their way to the community. A matter about which I will comment in a moment.
	
	
	He now sees, both in his evidence and the histories that he has given to the psychologist and the Community Corrections officer, the impact upon himself, his family and others of drug use. He is quoted by the Community Corrections Service as acknowledging that his involvement in drug use and in drug supply had “ruined his life” and that he had “hit rock bottom” and he was now picking up the pieces.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Service said that he was forthcoming and he had largely led a ‘prosocial’ lifestyle until recent years. He accepted responsibility for his actions, sought not to justify his behaviour or place blame on others and he stated that he was lucky in one way that he supplied the drugs to an undercover officer.
	
	
	In his evidence before me he said, as I noted it, that the arrest of him was, as he looks upon it now, “a good thing”. He described it as “an element of relief” on his arrest. Not immediately and I can understand that. When a person is first arrested and realises that they are going into custody for the first time, there would be a range of reactions and emotions. But as time wore on the implications of his arrest were clear to him and as I said he described that as a relief.
	
	
	I have mentioned the psychologist’s report. It is a very detailed report, although it does not undertake the depth of psychometric assessment one would hope from a psychologist. It is an increasing trend in psychologists reports to be presentence reports reflecting upon matters the subject of history without undertaking any objective testing such as is capable of being tested. Although the material within the histories that accord with the prisoner’s evidence, he has given evidence that the histories essentially as reported by the psychologist and the Community Corrections officer, are accurate. I accept those histories.
	
	
	I do not need to reflect upon the very considerable detail in the history I have summarised it, I believe, largely from the observations I have made, thus far.
	
	
	The psychological assessment of the prisoner was that he was greatly affected by the loss of his employment, he thought that his career was over because his back injury continues. The Crown led evidence of the fact that he still suffers discomfort and he would need to make some recovery before he went back into heavy industry such as mining. He was an individual who developed low self-esteem and poorly developed self-identity as he grew up through a number of experiences of bullying at school and other problems. He had some symptoms of social anxiety and generalised anxiety but these are described as “subclinical”. As an adult he had not involved himself in antisocial or aggressive behaviours. He denied any functioning concerns in custody. He had recovered from the breakup of his relationship. He was not having any difficulties at the moment with sleep or appetite, energy, concentration and was not considering self‑harm.
	
	
	There was one personality assessment undertaken by the use of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory. This self‑reporting questionnaire seeks to assess various aspects of personality and other matters. The prisoner reflected an elevation on pessimistic thoughts and has some sense of hopelessness. He has some problems with anxiety and some social fears and difficulties with drug use, including impulsivity and resistance to having limits placed on his behaviour.
	
	
	The results of the testing were “consistent with the information he provided.” The bottom line is, however, when one analyses it, while the information is all very interesting, assuming that the accused is of average intelligence and does not have any cognitive disability (which is not reported), there is nothing in the psychological report that reflects upon a mental disorder or a mental illness, or a mental abnormality, that has a causal connection with his offending behaviour.
	
	
	The formulation of the psychologist reflects upon the stability of his upbringing, some aspects of the matter concerning lack of confidence and some social anxiety. He had been engaged, it is said, in unhealthy behaviours targeting at increasing his body image such as he has self‑admitted use of steroids which had an effect upon his health, as did his use of drugs in early 2014 from the evidence he gave in this Court.
	
	
	His offending would appear, from the history he gave and the analysis I make of it from the objective facts, reflecting upon the analysis of the psychologist, to have developed from his association with undesirables who were able to introduce him to the use of drugs and effectively took advantage of him in the way that the Crown articulately identified.
	
	
	He was in some form of psychosocial functioning decline at the time of the offending, but this was very much reflected in what could be called prosaic circumstances such as the loss of employment and financial difficulties leading to indebtedness and thus being placed in a position where he could not get away from the entreaties of those more powerful than him.
	
	
	The psychologist reflected upon him not being ingrained in an antisocial lifestyle as a rule, needing assistance in relation to substance use and assistance in relation to lifting his self‑esteem and his self‑identity.
	
	
	I must say he presented very well. He obviously looks very fit and came appropriately attired to Court. He may have had some difficulty articulating matters but he struck me as presenting a very positive image at least in his presentation in Court.
	
	
	It is recommended that he have some residential rehabilitation program available to him on his release to custody, this will be a matter for the Parole Authority. He would need assistance too in relation to self‑confidence and self‑esteem, and also in finding employment in the community should he not be able to return to the mining industry in the view of the psychologist.
	
	
	There are a large number of references from a range of people, obviously very respectable people, some have known the prisoner for a relatively short time, some, such as an uncle, have known him of course all of his life. The various referees speak of the fact that they are shocked and surprised by his involvement in this type of offending. The prisoner is well regarded usually, when not affected by drugs and not involved in this sort of activity, as a good young man, responsible, helpful, being a person who generally has taken responsibility for himself. One person describes him as “not an immoral person” the offending being “extremely uncharacteristic.”
	
	
	The difficulties for his family are reflected upon. If given an opportunity, one referee says, that referee is confident given his past performance that he can make a valued contribution to the community.
	
	
	Some people of course were not fully aware of the prisoner’s background. One referee refers to him not having previously been involved with drugs which is not entirely correct. His uncle has found him throughout his life as a respectful, pleasant, well-mannered young man, with a sense of family and willing to listen to his family. That uncle, who is a retired high school mathematics teacher, said that the prisoner can make a positive contribution to the community.
	
	
	I have also viewed a number of a Certificates reflecting upon attainment of qualifications and certifications to perform particular tasks, particularly within the mining industry. The prisoner has Certificates in relation to attending upon various programs relevant to his employment. There is a Certificate of his enlistment, as I mentioned earlier, in the Australian Army Reserve in 2009. I have seen the certificate for the program he has undertaken in custody. I have taken all this material into account.
	
	
	I have already referred to some of the evidence given by the prisoner and I have sought to integrate that into the fact finding in relation to the offending. As I said earlier, he explained, particularly in cross-examination, how it was that he still was indebted at the time of his arrest. I was, as I mentioned earlier, somewhat circumspect in my understanding or appreciation of what he was saying, but I am prepared ultimately to accept that he was caught in a situation where at the behest of others, he was supplying drugs for which he was not receiving a particular financial profit beyond the use of other drugs and an attempt to quell the debt which had in fact increased over the period of time. He talked about the effect of drugs upon his physical health and spoke positively in his cross-examination of his wish to attend upon the Cessnock institution run by Corrective Services to obtain trade certificates or qualifications for future employment.
	
	
	If I could start with the learned Crown submissions because in my view they set a template for what was put by the defence. I summarise the submissions as necessarily I must. The Crown recognised the prisoner was an unlikely criminal and acknowledged that the evidence revealed that he was beholden to others who were in a more powerful position. He pointed out, as I had commented, that the prisoner had given evidence that may be difficult on the face of it to accept, although the Crown very fairly said, in an observation that was astute, that the prisoner may have struggled to properly express himself and he also made the observation that perhaps this is not unnatural in these circumstances, the prisoner has been “thinking about his situation too much”, as I noted the Crown’s words.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that he had done a lot in life and he had good prospects for the future, although he noted the Community Corrections report reflected upon a “medium risk of reoffending” a matter about which the Crown and I had a short discussion. From my understanding of how these assessments are made the Crown was not particularly au fait with that assessment. There are many features of the prisoner’s offending that would raise concerns in the testing that the Community Corrections does in this regard. I understand that entirely. A person who is drug dependent committing crimes in the context of drug dependency is very much at risk of reoffending if they go back to the use of drugs. Whether the prisoner will be able to avoid the use of drugs is something that I do not have the crystal ball to predict but I am prepared to accept that the prospects for him reoffending in my view are good if he can avoid the use of drugs and particularly noting his family’s support.
	
	
	The Crown noted, as the defence had, the escalating criminality reflected in the various charges and of course he pointed out that the minimum quantity of the relevant prohibited drug for a commercial quantity was 125 grams. The minimum quantity for a large commercial quantity was 500 grams or higher, therefore, whilst it was not the largest amount that could be covered by the charge, it was a substantial quantity of drugs within the context of the legislative provisions. He said that specific and general deterrence had their role to play, but he also acknowledged prospects of rehabilitation being encouraging and I believe he agreed with me when I pointed out that the time in custody for the prisoner would be a salutary experience, which I certainly believe and accept.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused, apart from reflecting from the objective facts and the escalation of supply, noted the pressure upon the prisoner from the supplier and the enticements of undercover officers. She reflected upon the weight to be given to the plea of guilty, the prospects of rehabilitation, the family support, the making good of his time in custody thus far, the capacity to apply himself and pointed out that this was a man seeking to support his drug dependency, not for profit, arising out of the difficulties caused by his loss of employment through no fault of his.
	
	
	If I could just deal with some of the legal issues that arise. Every sentencing exercise throws up a raft of matters that are required to be addressed.
	
	
	First of all, there is, at the forefront, the ‘purposes of sentencing’ under s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (‘the Act’). The learned Crown had pointed to two of the purposes, both general and specific deterrence, which will always be present as matters to be taken into account to varying degrees in drug supply matters.
	
	
	There is a need to promote the rehabilitation of the prisoner but also to make him accountable for his conduct and to denounce his conduct and to ensure that there is adequate punishment in all the circumstances of the matter.
	
	
	There are the terms of s 21A of the Act, not only the importation of common law principles of sentencing in s 21A(1) of the Act, but consideration of the presence or not of aggravating factors and mitigating factors under subs (2) and (3). I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, beyond the facts of the case and what they speak of, that there are specific aggravating factors arising under subs (2). I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner conducted the offence for “financial reward.”
	
	
	In that regard, the learned Crown Prosecutor very helpfully provided me with a number of Court of Criminal Appeal judgments that might provide some assistance for showing a range of penalty imposed in relation to offences covered by count 5 in the indictment, that is, offences contrary to s 25(2) of the Act. Those decisions are Barlow [2010] NSWCCA 215, Ellis [2010] NSWCCA 298, LMN v R [2012] NSWCCA 52, McBeth [2009] NSWCCA 235. Those cases I have read. Each case is different, if I accept that, but they are of assistance.
	
	
	The case of Barlow is an interesting case. The young offender who was 19 was involved substantially in the supply of ecstasy but received a term of imprisonment, after a 40% discount, of two‑and‑a half years to be served by way of periodic detention. The Crown appealed against this sentence on the basis of inadequacy of sentence, but the Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed the approach of the learned trial judge. There were important matters that were taken into account. Including the circumstances in which the young offender was detected. One of the matters raised by the offender, accepted by the trial judge and given the imprimatur of approval by the Court of Criminal Appeal was the finding that the offence, the relevant offences, were not committed for “financial gain.” The prisoner had involved himself in very substantial criminal activity to endeavour to settle or diminish or remove a drug debts. The Court found that it was open to the trial judge to have regarded as his settlement of a debt for drugs used by him as not being to be considered as for the purpose of financial gain. The learned judge who delivered the judgment of the Court, Justice McCallum observed:
	


“In my view, it is clear that his Honour regarded Mr Barlow’s aim of eliminating a debt as a purpose in a different category from the case of a person who engages in the sale of drugs for profit.”


	
	In my view, this case on the evidence available to me fits within the same rubric in the circumstances I have outlined.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors under s 21A(3) ultimately I conclude that the prisoner does not have any record of previous convictions. He was a person of good character. I am prepared to accept on balance that he is unlikely to reoffend. The prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation. The prisoner has shown remorse by providing evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the damage or the potential damage his conduct had done. He was aware of the damage it was doing to him, that is, the ingestion of prohibited drugs. The plea of guilty of the prisoner is a relevant mitigating factor for which he receives a discount as I have already identified.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of the circumstances of the offending the evidence he gives is that he was enticed into providing more and more drugs. This is a perfectly legitimate police tactic to draw out those that have the capacity to provide the drugs. It is not a case of a young Aboriginal 18 years of age being asked by an undercover police officer in a pub to provide a “point of” methylamphetamine, as I found in Wagga once, rushing out of the pub to find the drug supplier to get the “point” to bring it back to the undercover officer, and doing that over a three or four day period on three occasions, finding himself charged with a “s 25A offence”, in circumstances where it was quite clear that the young person would never have committed the offences unless the undercover officer had asked him to commit them. It was quite clear on the facts of the matter that he had no access to any drugs at all unless he went and asked somebody who was a real drug supplier.
	
	
	But, having said that, in the decision of Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103 Acting Justice Smart reflected upon the role of what was called “entrapment” and its relevance to the assessment to the diminution of culpability where an undercover officer was involved. In that particular matter his Honour referred to three decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the South Australia Full Bench at [14] - [16]. Two of those decisions turned upon the factual determination that the prisoner was in the business of selling prohibited drugs and had not been encouraged to do something that he or she would otherwise have not done.
	
	
	It is a fine line in this matter because it is quite clear on the facts available to me that the prisoner himself was not capable of immediately filling orders placed with him. On the other hand he was dealing with people that he knew wanted drugs sold that could fill the orders as they were increasingly made and was able to facilitate what was being requested from people who were more than willing to fill the orders.
	
	
	In Taouk (1993) 65 A Crim R 357, particularly at 403-404, the late Justice Badgery‑Parker came to the conclusion that if there was a reasonable possibility that a police officer had encouraged the commission of a crime that would not have otherwise been committed, but for the officer’s facilitation of the supply, that might be a matter to be regarded as diminishing the culpability of the offender. He said that the assistance, encouragement or incitement offered by the police officer was such that the prisoner would not have committed the crime as a reasonable possibility. In all the circumstances of the case involvement of the police in the commission of the crime was such as to diminish the prisoner’s culpability.
	
	
	In this particular matter, it seems to me from the escalating quantities of supply, that the accused on his evidence, and I have no other evidence other than the statement of facts, was being encouraged to supply more and more. If not encouraged he would not have supplied more and more. But I point out the facts obviously point to the fact that the prisoner was supplying to others as well. It was not as if the prisoner was enticed into supplying prohibited drugs. Just that the quantity of drugs that he supplied may have increased based upon that encouragement.
	
	
	In Chan it was concluded that had the police agent not made the request, or not made the purchase, the offence of supplying prohibited drugs would not have been committed. But Chan would have supplied someone else. It was held that the appellant was happy to deal with customers unconnected with the police.
	
	
	In this particular matter the situation is not quite as bald and straight forward. Ultimately I have concluded there will be some slight diminution of culpability in the context of his relationship with an undercover police officer, but I point out of course the prisoner was not just concerned to supply to that person.
	
	
	In any event, the Court in Chan held that if there was a suggestion of reluctance or hesitancy or persuasion in supplying drugs the accused should give evidence about the matter and any issue of encouragement making a difference should appear in the evidence. These matters are not to be resolved by speculative or informal conclusions or assumptions.
	
	
	There is another point, however, that emerges from Chan which is clear in this case. That is that when drugs are supplied to undercover agents those drugs will not be disseminated into the community. That is a matter of minor diminution of culpability simply because the offender had the intention to supply and believed the drugs would likely find their way into the community by the fact of supply, which is self‑evident.
	
	
	The principal offence has a standard non-parole period. Of course in Muldrock v R [2011] 244 CLR 120 when considering Part 4 Division 1A of the Act the Court overruled some of the significant conclusions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the [2004] decision of Way. Ultimately, the Court concluded, in the context of the earlier judgment of the High Court of Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357, that the standard non-parole period is just one part of the larger task of passing sentence. It is a guide but not a starting point and made various observations at [17] - [29] which changed the approach to the treatment of standard non-parole periods.
	
	
	What was held by the High Court in Markarian is now reflected in s 54A(2) and s 54B(2) of the Act. Those provisions amending the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 noted that the standard non-parole period was only relevant to the objective factors concerning the relative seriousness of the offence and the assessment of whether an offence was in the middle range of the seriousness. The standard non-parole period is a matter to be taken into account without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	I am of the view in relation to the matter, having regard to the prisoner’s role, the moral culpability of the prisoner, the quantity of course (which is always relevant) but not a final determinant, that the offending of the prisoner falls below the middle range of objective seriousness, if that assessment is required. It is not low of course but it is certainly below that of the middle range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	I have concluded in the context of fixing the appropriate non-parole period, as a non-parole period must be fixed, that there are ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act. There is a need for an extended period of supervision to assist the prisoner to adjust to community living, he will need professional assistance from the Parole Authority, both the Authority itself and the officers of the Community Corrections Service, in relation to matters such as employment, drug counselling, associations and perhaps psychological assistance.
	
	
	The sentences I impose must take into account the totality of the criminality. In that respect I reflect the principles that are summarised by the majority of the High Court in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45] which reflected upon the fact that in sentencing for multiple offences an appropriate sentence for each offence must be fixed, unless one uses the aggregate sentencing facility pursuant to s 68A of the Act. Then the Court must address the issue of appropriate concurrency accumulation ultimately to reflect the totality of sentence required for the offences to which the prisoner is to be sentenced. In this regard there will be a partial accumulation which of itself is a ‘special circumstance’ warranting an adjustment of the relationship of the effective non-parole period to the balance of sentence.
	
	
	The Crown very helpfully provided me with some statistics. They show a range of sentences for 95 cases for an offence under s 25(2) relating to the supply of at least a commercial quantity of ecstasy. The range of sentences show what appears to me to be, for what it is worth, a mean figure of somewhere in the order of five to six years imprisonment for offences under this provision. I have not done a statistical analysis of the range in terms of fixing upon what the statistics reveal to be either a median or mean figure but I see the range of sentences reflected in the statistics for imprisonment are between 30 months and 12 years imprisonment. These statistics do not tell me discounts for pleas of guilty and or cooperation and the like. They provide some assistance.
	
	
	I am mindful of what Chief Justice Spigelman said in the decision of Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734, particularly at p 739 about the difficulties with the use of statistics, they provide a range of penalty. There must be caution exercised in relying upon them, they give an indication in general sentencing trends and standards but they provide not sufficient detail about the circumstances, each case being different, the larger the sample the more likely the statistics are likely to be useful in respect of the matters that statistics can assist a Court to determine in relation to a particular matter. I note, of course some of the matters he observed relevant to statistics are more within the thrall of a Court of Criminal Appeal reviewing whether a particular sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate than for a court finding facts at first instance.
	
	
	There are a number of features of statistics that his Honour did not refer to in Bloomfield. Time spent in custody might not necessarily be reflected in the particular penalty that has been imposed amongst other factors, and of course every case is different.
	
	
	The same with comparative cases. There is some recent authority, RCW (No 2) reflected upon the failure of the District Court Judge to avoid concentrating on one comparative case. It was held to be an error to use a particular case that was unrelated as a starting point in comparative sentencing exercises that may be appropriate. But I have taken into account comparative cases which provide some assistance.
	
	
	Obviously a term of full‑time custody is appropriate, I do not think there was any discussion about that aspect of the matter and this is a case that does not require the consideration of the analysis that appears in decisions such as Gip, Carrion, Clarke, Gu and Fayd’Herbe. This is not a borderline case. Naturally the principal offence is one which ordinarily would attract a term of imprisonment as the statistics themselves reveal and no particular submission was put to me to suggest otherwise.
	
	
	I believe I have addressed all the relevant matters that were either referred to, not referred to or hinted at and otherwise not developed in the course of the conduct of the case, bearing in mind, of course, I am giving my judgment more or less immediately after the completion of the submissions with no transcript of the proceedings.
	
	
	Could you stand up, thank very much, sir.
	
	
	Mr Woods, in relation to count 1 on the indictment you are convicted.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment to date from 8 May 2014, expiring on 7 May 2015.
	


In relation to count 2 you are convicted.


	
	You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months to date from 8 May 2014, that will expire on 7 November 2015.
	
	
	In relation to count 3 you are convicted.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 8 May 2014, expiring on 7 May 2016.
	
	
	Likewise, in relation to count 4, you are convicted and you are sentenced to two years imprisonment to date from 8 May 2014, expiring on 7 May 2016.
	
	
	In relation to count 5, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of two years that will date from 8 May 2015 and on my calculation will expire on 7 May 2017. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two and a half years imprisonment. The balance of sentence will on my calculation will expire on 7 November 2019.
	
	
	That is, on my calculation, a total sentence of five and a half years imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of three years, that total as I have described it effectively commencing on 8 May 2014.
	
	
	In respect of the matter on the s 166 certificate, that is the proceeds of crime offence, you are convicted. In relation to that offence you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months that will date from 8 May 2015 and will expire on 7 November 2015.
	
	
	You can take a seat, thank you very much.

		09 October 2015",2015-03-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703728,R v Evans [2015] NSWSC 254,"Judgment


	
	On 31 May 2012 the offender was arrested and charged with the murder of Colleen Deborah Ayers on 9 May 2012. She was also charged with breaking and entering the dwelling house of Judith and Bryon Green and committing a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, in circumstances of aggravation being in company with Michael John Duffy and Scott Derbridge. Duffy was charged with the same offences.
	
	
	The present offender was committed for trial to this Court on 6 September 2013 from Campbelltown Local Court. She was arraigned on 4 October 2013 and the matter was listed for a joint trial of the present offender and Duffy on 19 May 2014. On 15 May 2014 she indicated in court that she would plead guilty to the murder, that fact having been notified the day before to the Crown.
	
	
	On 19 May 2014 she was again arraigned on the charge of murder and she pleaded guilty. In the circumstances, the trial against Duffy did not proceed. That trial will now commence on 20 April 2015.
	
	
	The matter was before me for proceedings on sentence on 31 October 2014. On that day the Crown presented a further indictment, that on 9 May 2012 in the dwelling house of Judith and Bryon Green the offender did steal certain property being an X box console, games, mobile phones, jewellery, a 12 gauge shot gun and a double barrel shotgun the property of Judith and Bryon Green. She pleaded guilty to that offence. The offence of breaking and entering the dwelling house was not proceeded with.
	
	
	In addition, the present offender was charged with furnishing false information to a licensee, in relation to pawning some of the stolen items, contrary to the Pawnbrokers and Secondhand Dealers Act 1996 (NSW). She asked for that offence to be dealt with on a Form 1 attached to the offence of steal in a dwelling-house.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of 20 years. The maximum penalty for steal in a dwelling house is 7 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the Form 1 offence is 50 penalty units, each penalty unit being $110.
	


Facts


	
	The facts relating to the offending were largely agreed. There were, however, three areas of dispute. I will note areas of dispute where they occur.
	
	
	On the evening of Tuesday 8 May 2012, the offender was at CC's pub located on Queen Street, Campbelltown. While there she met the deceased, Colleen Deborah Ayers, and they started talking.
	
	
	At some point in the evening, the co-accused Duffy, and the offender’s sister, Monique Simmons, joined the offender and Ms Ayers.
	
	
	The group of four boarded a train at Campbelltown train station and travelled to Picton. They checked into the George IV Inn which is located on Remembrance Drive, Picton. At the hotel the offender, Duffy and Ms Ayers engaged in sexual activity with each other. Monique filmed the incident on a mobile phone.
	
	
	On the morning of Wednesday 9 May 2012, the group left the hotel and travelled by train from Picton to Campbelltown. The offender bought an amount of methylamphetamine and the group sat in Mawson Park, Campbelltown, consuming methylamphetamine and alcohol.
	
	
	A friend of Monique’s, Scott Derbridge, had been to the Centrelink Office in Campbelltown that morning and bumped into Monique. Derbridge went with her to Mawson Park where the offender, Duffy and Ms Ayers were.
	
	
	At some stage the group was joined by Mark Curran, known by the group as ""Kiwi"". As the evening progressed, Curran became highly intoxicated and was asleep for the majority of the events set out in these facts.
	
	
	The facts put forward by the Crown say that while at the park Derbridge heard some of the group speak about killing the deceased. He heard the offender, Duffy and Monique saying they wanted to kill her. Derbridge thought they were joking or ""talking shit."" The deceased had gone to get money from an ATM when this conversation occurred.
	
	
	The offender denies that a conversation about killing the deceased took place at the park. However, her version is that an intention was formed by the group at the park to rob the deceased. The offender and Duffy had a particular interest in stealing two firearms that the deceased had told them belonged to her parents.
	
	
	This was the first area of dispute. It is necessary to make findings in relation to it because if the Crown's case on it is accepted, it would tend to show a measure of planning about the killing.
	
	
	The evidence given by Derbridge was that the offender and Monique said, while they were in the park, that they wanted to kill Colleen. No reason was given by them for wanting to do that. Derbridge also said that Duffy was not around at the time that was said. This is to be contrasted with his second ERISP where he alleged that Duffy was present and said similar words.
	
	
	Derbridge said that the first time he heard about guns was after Ms Ayers had been killed. He also volunteered that the offender and Monique also said again, while they were on the train, that they wanted to kill Colleen. When asked if this was when Colleen was present, he at first said it was when Colleen was getting changed but then said it was when the offender and Monique were getting changed. Presumably, they moved away from Colleen with Mr Derbridge at that point although he did not say so.
	
	
	Monique was asked by the Crown if she heard anyone make threats against Ms Ayers before they got on the train. She said she did not remember. She was not asked about threats on the train.
	
	
	I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender made any threat to kill Ms Ayers in the park or on the train. Derbridge's evidence was unsatisfactory and, I thought, unreliable about this matter. His exclusion of Duffy from this stated intention and his reference to the threat on the train all seemed to be recent invention. Although I have some doubts about Monique's honesty (she seemed to have clear recollection of all the surrounding matters but could not remember a significant matter like a threat to kill the person who was later killed), I cannot infer from her absence of recollection that such a threat was made. Moreover, an intention to rob Ms Ayers of guns to sell on the black market for drug money seems a much more likely matter.
	
	
	From the ATM, Ms Ayers withdrew a few hundred dollars. The offender used this money to buy methylamphetamine.
	
	
	At some stage, Ms Ayers told the group about her parents' rural property. She told the group that her parents were away and that they should go back to her parents' place for drinks.
	
	
	Later that day the group of six travelled by train to Picton. At 7.10pm all were captured on CCTV entering a Camden Wollondilly Maxi Taxi. They were travelling to 220 Rockbarton Road, Lakesland, which is the deceased's parents' home.
	
	
	En-route to 220 Rockbarton Road, Lakesland, the taxi stopped at the Welcome Inn located in Thirlemere. The offender and Duffy bought alcohol from the bottle shop. The taxi then continued to 220 Rockbarton Road Lakesland. The group of six are captured on CCTV footage exiting the taxi at this time.
	
	
	220 Rockbarton Road, Lakesland, is a property situated on approximately 25 acres of land. On the property is the main residential house, a two bedroom detached guesthouse and a shed located at the rear of the main residence. The lawful occupiers of this property are Judith and Bryon Green, the parents of Ms Ayers. Both Mr. and Mrs. Green are licensed to hold firearms. Before travelling interstate on 4 May 2012, they believe they locked and secured the property. Ms Ayers did not have permission to enter the premises.
	
	
	The group went into the property accessing the main residence, detached guest house and detached shed. They then started a fire in the yard of the premises where they spent much of the night consuming drugs and alcohol. In the following hours the group remained at the property spending most of the time between the guest house and around the fire.
	
	
	At one point during the night Duffy and Ms Ayers went into the main bedroom of the guest house. They could be heard having sex. Derbridge and Monique went into the second bedroom to lie down because Monique was feeling unwell. The offender remained in the lounge room crushing Seroquel tablets. Derbridge and Monique lay down on the bed. The Crown facts then assert that while they were in this room the offender walked into the room and said to them: ""We're gunna kill her, we're gunna kill her."" This appears to be based on assertion by Derbridge. This is the second area of contention.
	
	
	Both the offender and Monique deny that the offender said at this point that she was going to kill Ms Ayers. The offender and Derbridge both agree that Monique said that she was going ""to smash"" Ms Ayers and that Monique asked the offender if she would back her up if Ms Ayers ""got it over"" Monique. Derbridge, having been reminded that that was what he agreed with the police on 16 June 2014 when it was put to him by them, said that it was at that point that the offender said she wanted to kill Ms Ayers.
	
	
	Monique first denied that she ever said anything about wanting to bash Ms Ayers but then gave this evidence:
	


Q. I put it to you that you did say that and that was directed to Rachel, and Rachel's response was, ""Yes I'll back you up."" You deny that happened do you?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Is it possible it may have happened but you can't now recall?

A. It may have, but because we were that heavily intoxicated on drugs and alcohol, I do not remember.


	
	Again, I have doubts about Monique's honesty, and I certainly consider that her evidence is unreliable. I have doubts about the reliability of Derbridge's evidence. Whether because he has intellectual difficulties or the other psychiatric problems identified by Judge Maiden SC when he sentenced Derbridge or because he has damage from his long-term drug and alcohol consumption, I would generally need supporting evidence before accepting what he said. All of these matters mean that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that even at this late stage of that night's events the offender had expressed an intention to kill Ms Ayers before she went into the bedroom where Ms Ayers was with Duffy.
	
	
	Monique followed her sister out of the room. Derbridge went into the lounge room of the guest house and continued to drink beer. Derbridge saw the offender and Monique walk out of the guest house. About five minutes later, Derbridge saw the offender and Monique run into the room in which Duffy and Ms Ayers were having sex.
	
	
	Derbridge remained in the lounge room. He could hear Ms Ayers in the bedroom saying: ""Stop it"". A short time later Monique came into the lounge room, crying. She told Derbridge that the offender and Duffy had killed Ms Ayers. She explained to him that both the offender and Duffy had tried to strangle her but when that didn't work Duffy had to break her neck. The autopsy did not support the assertion that Ms Ayers’ neck had been broken.
	
	
	The Crown Facts assert that the offender admits that she strangled the deceased with a belt and that she was assisted by Duffy during the commission of the murder. The offender disputed that she did so. This is the third area of dispute. However, the offender’s evidence in chief was this:
	


Q. ...Do you agree that at some stage you did have a belt or you did put a belt around her neck?

A. Yes, sir, I did put the belt around her neck.

Q. At the time Miss Ayers stopped resisting who had the belt then?

A. Michael.

Q. And can you tell me how he came to end up with the belt?

A. After my sister hit her in the head, when I put the belt around the neck she fought and she liked bucked and I fell back on my backside and that's when Michael grabbed the belt and started strangulating her and then I got back up and held her head down from the back, holded (as said) her head down, and Monique held her legs and bottom part of her body down while Michael was strangulating her.


	
	In cross-examination she said:
	


Q. You have admitted your part in strangling the deceased, haven't you?

A. Yes, Ma'am.

Q. Was it the case that while you were trying to do that the belt broke?

A. The belt didn't break, Ma'am, I - when I first put the belt around Miss Ayers' neck she fought and I let go. I fell back. The belt wasn't broken or snapped, and then Michael picked up the belt from there.

Q. So it was the case that you were both engaged in the act of strangling her at various times in that bedroom, is that right?

A. My hands were around that belt that one time, Ma'am.

Q. My question was at various times in the bedroom you were both engaged in the act of strangling her, is that correct?

A. Yes, Ma'am.


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt from this evidence that the offender took part in the act of strangling Ms Ayers and that she was endeavouring to do just that. I reject her evidence and the submission made on her behalf that she intended only to hurt Ms Ayers. That may have been the position before the offender went into the bedroom, but when she put the belt around her neck and pulled on it she intended to kill Ms Ayers.
	
	
	Derbridge opened the door to the main bedroom and saw Ms Ayers’ body hanging over the bed, with Duffy beside it. The offender, who was standing in the corner of the room, yelled at Derbridge to get out.
	
	
	The offender dragged the body of the deceased into the bathroom followed by Duffy. In the bathroom, the offender washed the deceased's body in the shower. Duffy then took a bed sheet and lay it out on the floor in the hallway where he and the offender wrapped the body in the sheet.
	
	
	Duffy grabbed Derbridge and told him to go for a walk with him, picking up shovels on the way. Duffy told Derbridge that they were going to dig a hole. Derbridge initially refused to assist Duffy who then started hitting him. The two of them walked down to a part of the property that was near a dam. They began to dig a hole.
	
	
	After they finished digging the hole they walked back up to the guest house. Duffy and the offender carried Ms Ayers’ body to the hole that had been dug by Duffy and Derbridge. They then buried the body.
	
	
	After the body was buried the group returned to the house. Items were thrown onto the fire and burnt, including blankets from the bedroom in the guest house. From the main house, the group collected an X Box console, games, mobile phones and jewellery. From a locked cupboard in the garage, Duffy removed a 12 gauge shotgun and a double barrel shotgun, using bolt cutters to break the lock. The group then left the property. On their way from the property the offender made up a story and told the group that, if the ""cops"" asked, they were to tell them that they left the property during the night and other people showed up.
	
	
	At about 7.40am on Thursday 10 May 2012, CCTV footage depicts the offender, Duffy, Derbridge, Curran and Monique entering a Maxi-Taxi and departing 220 Rockbarton Road, Lakesland. At this time the group can be seen carrying bags of property. In this footage the offender is seen to be jovial and joking with the driver. When asked by the driver how her night was, the offender replied ""Yeah it was great... very exhilarating.""
	
	
	They travelled to the Picton area, to the house of a friend of Duffy's. They eventually parted company.
	
	
	On 10 May 2012, Judith and Bryon Green were alerted by a neighbour to damage caused to the property and an apparent break and enter. This matter was subsequently reported to Camden Police and investigations commenced. Discovered stolen from the residence was a significant quantity of property including jewellery, electrical items, computers, two firearms, passports and banking documents.
	
	
	On 14 May 2012, the offender attended the Ace Ben Pawn Shop located on Dumaresq Street, Campbelltown, where two items of jewellery stolen from 220 Rockbarton Road, Lakesland, were pledged. The offender received $40. Pledge Number 4208/2012 was signed by the offender.
	
	
	The offender and Duffy attempted to sell both the firearms stolen from the property. They sold the 12 gauge shotgun for around $6,000 to a person the offender later described to police as a drug runner who wanted the weapon for his boss. The offender and Duffy halved the money. They were unable to sell the other firearm.
	
	
	On 25 May 2012, Judith and Bryon Green returned to their home and identified the particulars of the items stolen and damaged. Judith Green observed entire rooms throughout the property to have been ransacked and significantly damaged including the lighting of a fire on the property.
	
	
	A statement obtained from Judith Green confirmed that at no time did any member of the group, including the deceased, have permission to enter her property and remove any items from within.
	
	
	On realising that no one had heard from his daughter in some time and that she was not contactable, Bryon Green reported his daughter to police as a missing person. The deceased was last independently sighted exiting the Maxi-Taxi at the property on 9 May 2012.
	
	
	On 31 May 2012, the offender met up with a friend, Wayne Latta. She told him certain things about the evening of the murder. Latta and the offender made contact with police and arrangements were made for the offender to attend Narellan Police Station.
	
	
	At about 2pm on 31 May 2012, the offender attended Narellan Police Station where she was arrested.
	
	
	The offender participated in an electronically record of interview with police. She admitted to going to the property with the others and gave her account of what happened on the 9 May 2012. Following this interview, the offender accompanied police to the property where she showed police the location of where the deceased was buried. Subsequent examination of this area revealed the deceased's body in a shallow gravesite.
	
	
	On 1 June 2012, police arrested Duffy. He participated in an electronically recorded interview giving police his account of what occurred.
	
	
	Derbridge was also arrested on 1 June 2012. He participated in an electronically recorded interview giving his account of the night of 9 May 2012. During this interview, Derbridge did not reveal anything about the murder and told the false story concocted by the offender that another group of people had turned up at the property. Derbridge was interviewed a second time on 12 July 2013 where he revealed a full account of what happened on the 9 May 2012.
	
	
	A post mortem and formal identification of the body took place on 2 June 2012. Due to the advanced state of decomposition a cause of death could not be determined. Decomposition also made it difficult to evaluate the skin and soft tissue for any ante-mortem injuries. However, on the right side of the deceased's neck was a pink abrasion highly suggestive of a peri-mortem ligature mark. Also found was a fracture of the left posterior horn of the hyoid bone (the bone near the base of the tongue). There was no evidence of a neck fracture, pelvic fracture or any open wounds or lacerations to the deceased's head. The toxicology analysis was compromised due to the decomposition and age of the body. However, levels of alcohol and methylamphetamine were found in the deceased's blood.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The offender was born on 5 July 1989. At the time of the killing she was aged 22 years.
	
	
	Her parents separated when she was one or two years of age. She has an older half-brother, a younger brother and a younger half-sister. The half-sister was the person Monique Simmons who was involved in the present events.
	
	
	The offender was raised by her mother and her stepfather who sexually abused her between the ages of six and ten years. The sexual abuse at the hands of her mother and her stepfather included being sodomised. She required repair of her injuries from this abuse at hospital when she was seven years of age. She was also physically abused and emotionally abused. Her younger brother was beaten and she was exposed to domestic violence.
	
	
	She was placed into the care of DOCS as a ward of the State. She lived in foster care and was also raised by her grandmother in Melbourne. She told Dr Richard Furst, a psychiatrist, that she estimated living in 30 to 40 foster placements between the ages of 10 and 13 years having been regarded as a 'placement problem'.
	
	
	She attended multiple schools in the Wagga Wagga area, eventually dropping out because of behavioural problems and drug addiction.
	
	
	At the age of 16 years she left Wagga Wagga and lived in Sydney where she supported herself as a sex worker. She lived in cheap brothels and hotels until she met the father of her daughter who is now aged about seven years.
	
	
	She drank alcohol occasionally from the age of 11-12 years. She used heroin from the age of 13 years in what Dr Furst described as a maladaptive pattern of attempting to block-out her negative memories. She used cannabis from the age of 14 years.
	
	
	She reported withdrawal symptoms from not using heroin and she had a dependence on it between the ages of 14 and 17 years.
	
	
	At the time she met the father of her child she did not use drugs apart from some intermittent cannabis abuse. She stopped working as a sex worker. She tried to study hairdressing and attended TAFE but she found her studies ""boring.""
	
	
	When she broke up with the father of her child in about September 2011 she commenced using drugs again, and that continued until the events in question. She estimated using ice in amounts of 3.5g two and three times per week, including injecting it. She was also dependent on benzodiazepines, using about 50 Serepax or 50 Xanax tablets every couple of days. She was drinking one to two bottles of rum a day. She also started working again as a sex worker.
	
	
	She said that her relationship with the father of her child was okay but she continually had relationships with other people, including women that led to multiple arguments and separations. She said she had had in excess of a hundred relationships and countless sexual encounters.
	
	
	She gave a history of intrusive suicidal thoughts as well as violent thoughts and fantasies occurring on a daily to weekly basis. Dr Furst said that there was evidence of apparent paraphilia in the form of sadomasochism.
	
	
	Dr Furst diagnosed her with the following mental disorders:
	



	
	(a)   Borderline Personality Disorder
	
	
	(b)   Substance Use Disorder
	
	
	(c)   Paraphilia, sado-masochism
	



	
	The offender attempted to hang herself in August 2012. At the time she said she wanted to die. Subsequently she has felt differently because she is not on the same medication and is no longer withdrawing from illicit substances.
	
	
	Dr Andrew Ellis, who saw her in February 2013, also diagnosed her as having Borderline Personality Disorder as well as paraphilia, sexual sadism, masochism and autoerotic asphyxia. He thought she also appeared to have a Substance Abuse Disorder.
	
	
	Dr Ellis also noted that she had previously given information that had turned out to be false. One example of that was saying that she had psychiatric admission to Liverpool Hospital. She had also been prescribed Methadone prior to entering custody but the prescription was given under an alias.
	
	
	Dr Ellis noted various self-harming activities in addition to the attempt at hanging, including burning herself. She had made threats to kill staff in custody and had diverted a number of her legitimately obtained drugs. She had also encouraged intellectually disabled inmates to self-harm and had incited other inmates to strangle her and steal property from the kitchen. Dr Ellis did not make any comment about her likely re-offending once released from custody.
	
	
	She has a criminal record commencing in December 2000 when she was only 11 years of age. Her criminal record is reasonably lengthy. Although there are two convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the majority of the offences are property and motor vehicle offences. She received a number of control orders whilst she was dealt with by the Children's Court but many of these were suspended. She has, however, been sent to prison a few times as an adult.
	
	
	In fact, after she was arrested on 31 May 2012 she commenced a one month sentence of imprisonment on 3 July 2012 for unrelated offences of common assault and damage property, and thereafter a three month period of imprisonment from 14 July 2012 for unrelated offences of larceny and damage property.
	
	
	The present offences for which she is to be sentenced were committed whilst she was on bail for those offences for which she entered custody on 3 July 2012 and subsequently.
	
	
	Subsequent to her plea of guilty the offender participated in a further ERISP on 20 May 2014 where she detailed her involvement and, in particular, the involvement of her co-accused Duffy.
	
	
	On 31 October 2014 she gave a written undertaking to give evidence at any proceedings against Duffy for offences arising out of the murder of Ms Ayers and the entry onto the property of Judith and Bryon Green in accordance with the ERISP of 20 May 2014.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The killing of Ms Ayers was gruesome and apparently pointless. Prior to the events concerned she was not known to the offender, Duffy or anyone else in the group. She had engaged in sex with them the day before and presumably thought they could be trusted because she invited them to her parents’ home. Then, when at the house, at one minute she was simply engaging (again) in sexual congress with Duffy, the next she was at the mercy of two and probably three persons who, it must have been apparent to her, were intending to harm and kill her. Death did not come instantly. There was evidence that she had called out to the perpetrators to “Stop it” and there was clear evidence that she had physically resisted in such a way as caused the present offender to lose her grip on the belt with which the offender was trying to strangle her. Having been successful in that regard, Ms Ayers was then overpowered by Duffy who completed what the offender had been endeavouring to do.
	
	
	Although it was faintly suggested that the only intention that could be inferred was an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the intention was to kill the deceased. There can be no other explanation for putting a belt around someone’s neck and pulling it so tight that when the victim bucked, the perpetrator (ie, the offender) was thrown off, and then the co-accused took over doing the same thing.
	
	
	The offence had a number of aggravating features. First, it involved the use of a weapon being the belt. The Crown submitted and the defence accepted that the belt could be regarded as a weapon. Given the use to which the belt was put I consider that it should be regarded as a weapon in the circumstances of this crime.
	
	
	Secondly, the offence was committed in company.
	
	
	Thirdly, and contrary to the submission of the defence, I consider that the fact that it happened at the home of the deceased’s parents is an aggravating factor. Section 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) makes it an aggravating factor that the offence was committed at the home of the victim “or any other person”. Even if the property could not be regarded as Ms Ayers’ home it belonged to her parents. The offender and the other persons were present at the home only at the invitation of Ms Ayers even though, seemingly, she did not have permission to be there. The situation does not seem to me to be so different from other cases where victims are entitled to feel safe in their own home, notwithstanding (as here) that Ms Ayers was not living there at the time.
	
	
	The parties did not address on the issue of whether it was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(ea) that the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years being Monique. It was certainly the evidence of both the offender and Derbridge that Monique was in the room at the time of the killing. Both of those persons asserted that it was at Monique’s initiative that they entered the room to “smash” the deceased. The offender claims that Monique helped to hold the deceased down whilst she and Duffy strangled the deceased. The offender also asserted that Monique struck the deceased with a bottle. The injuries to the deceased did not bear out a blow to the head with a bottle. Monique denied being in the room. She said that she stood at the door but the lights were off, she could not see anything, and the offender told her not to put the lights on.
	
	
	I do not accept Monique’s evidence in this regard. However, I do not consider in all of the circumstances that her presence in the room, although a child under 18 years of age, should be an aggravating feature. She was 16 years old at the time and she had a significant responsibility for initiating the attack on Ms Ayers which led to her death.
	
	
	Finally, the treatment of the deceased’s body after her death including the burying of it in the grave at the property is an aggravating factor: R v Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170 at [69]; R v Dong [2010] NSWSC 1242 at [46].
	
	
	Although it has not been shown that this offender planned to kill the deceased, the circumstances of the killing that I have detailed mean that the offence of murder must be seen to be high in the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In relation to the stealing offence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at least from the time the group was in the park together, the offender and Duffy had planned to steal the guns from the house. That offence was also committed in company. That it happened at the home of the victim’s parents should not be seen as an aggravating factor because that is an element of the offence.
	
	
	In my opinion the stealing offence falls within the mid-range of objective seriousness, particularly because two firearms were stolen.
	
	
	Two other matters aggravate the offences.
	
	
	First, the offender was on bail for the two sets of offences to which I have already made reference.
	
	
	Secondly, the offender has a reasonably long criminal record. The offender submitted that her criminal record should not be regarded as an aggravating factor. She pointed to the fact that the serious personal violence offences (the assaults occasioning actual bodily harm) were committed whilst she was under the age of 18. However, the convictions for common assault in 2010 and 2013 cannot be regarded as minor, particularly because for the offence in 2013 she was sentenced to a period of imprisonment.
	
	
	She has a number of convictions for larceny including four in 2012. Other property offences include break and enter, as well as steal in a dwelling house, steal from the person, take and drive motor vehicles, and destroy or damage property.
	
	
	In my opinion, the commission of the present offences and the circumstances in which they were committed involving the prolonged purchasing and use of illicit drugs demonstrates, with her record, a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. That is accentuated by the fact that she was on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of these offences.
	
	
	In my opinion her criminal record is an aggravating feature for both offences.
	


Plea and Assistance


	
	The offender’s plea came very late. Its lateness had very little utilitarian value because it resulted in the need to vacate the trial of the co-offender Duffy. That trial will, as I have said, proceed in any event. I accept, however, that the assistance provided by the offender, albeit latterly, and the assistance that will be provided, may shorten Duffy’s trial. I consider that the discount for the plea alone should be limited to 5%.
	
	
	On 31 May 2012 the offender participated in an ERISP at Narellan Police Station. Although she initially provided misleading information and minimised her role in the matter she eventually told the police that Ms Ayers was dead. She then provided a more accurate version of events and agreed to attend the scene to assist in locating the body. She also identified Duffy and Derbridge from photographs. The offender does not suggest that these persons were not already suspects.
	
	
	After she pleaded guilty to murder she participated in a further ERISP on 20 May 2014 where she detailed the events of the night in question, particularly the actions of Duffy. As I have said earlier, on 31 October 2014 she signed an Undertaking to Give Evidence in the trial of Duffy.
	
	
	Derbridge pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to murder and to break, enter and steal. He received a combined 40% discount for his plea and assistance. That involved a 20% discount for plea and past assistance with 20% being allocated for future assistance.
	
	
	I certainly do not accept that, without the offender’s evidence, there would be a difficulty in the Crown proving that Duffy had murdered Ms Ayers. However, I accept that her evidence, if accepted, will be significant in circumstances where Derbridge was not, on anyone’s account, in the bedroom at the time, and Monique denies having been in the bedroom although the evidence of both Derbridge and the offender certainly suggests otherwise. Certainly, because of her denial, Monique will not be giving evidence of what happened in the bedroom.
	
	
	I have read the Remarks on Sentence by the judge who sentenced Derbridge. He considered that Derbridge’s evidence would fill what the judge regarded as a gap in the Crown case. This was before the plea by the present offender. Further, Derbridge pleaded guilty to the offences with which he was charged at a relatively earlier time than the present offender. These are significant differences from the present offender’s situation.
	
	
	However, the most significant difference arises because of the length of the sentences given to Derbridge and the length of the sentence which the present offender will receive but for the plea and assistance. Basten JA recently drew attention to this matter in SL v R [2015] NSWCCA 30 at [13] where he said:
	


There is another sense in which disproportion may not be properly reflected in the actual ""proportion"" by which a sentence is reduced. The reduction could be measured by reference to years, rather than a percentage. In terms of length of imprisonment, a percentage reduction will give a greater benefit, the more serious the offender's criminality. On the other hand, the person who plays the lesser role in the offending and may face a relatively shorter sentence than the co-offenders against whom the assistance is provided, may nevertheless be at equal or greater risk as a result of providing assistance to the authorities than an offender who committed more serious offences. Thus a 25% reduction of a four year sentence is one year; the same proportionate reduction of a 12 year sentence is three years. The mechanical exercise (applying a percentage reduction), may, in some cases, fail fully to serve the purpose of the reduction for assistance to authorities. (The percentage reduction is appropriate in the case of a guilty plea.)


	
	There was no evidence that the assistance provided and to be provided is likely to cause her to serve her sentence under protection in a more onerous environment.
	
	
	I do not consider that it is appropriate in the present case to provide a percentage reduction for the assistance. Even a relatively modest percentage discount produces a reduction in the overall sentence from the starting point I consider appropriate which results in a sentence unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. Rather, I consider that the discount for assistance should be measured by reference to years.
	


Remorse


	
	The offender gave evidence that she decided to plead guilty because she wanted to take responsibility for Ms Ayers’ death and she felt it was the right thing to do. She said that she was sorry but she knew that “sorry doesn’t cut it” and “you can’t say sorry for just taking a life”. Taken at face value, she now shows some remorse.
	
	
	It is necessary, however, to have regard to the assessment of her by Dr Ellis and Dr Furst, two very experienced forensic psychiatrists. Dr Ellis said in his report of 21 March 2013 that the offender describes an unstable sense of self identity, deceit in her interactions with others and a difficulty experiencing the point of view of others.
	
	
	Dr Furst‘s report of 17 October 2014 reached similar conclusions, albeit he thought that there had been improvement in some areas. His report contained a number of significant conclusions relevant to the genuineness of her remorse and her risk of re-offending. He said:
	


In my opinion, her apparent deviant and intrusive sexual thoughts relating to violence against others, and her pattern of sexual arousal when feeling pain or inflicting pain on others are consistent [with] a paraphilia in the form of sadomasochism, which is a paraphilia (disorder of deviant sexual arousal and a pattern of abnormal sexual behaviour). There was also evidence of arousal from auto-erotic asphyxiation. There is an apparent obsessional component to her thinking.

…

Ms Evans has a history of conduct disorder, multiple offences as a juvenile, childhood victimisation, a severe personality disorder, sexual deviance in the form of sado-masochism, and an obviously serious offence involving the murder of Colleen Ayers in the company of others on 09/05/12. Although she made some expressions of remorse, she appears to lack insight into the severity and risks posed by her sexual deviance and any relationship this may have had with her offending. She also has a history of chronic self-harm, emotional dysregulation, and substance abuse. Those factors place her at high risk of future offending. She also poses a high risk to herself and fellow inmates, especially if sharing a cell and engaging in sado-masochistic sexual practice.

I note Ms Evans has taken some positive steps to engage in therapy with clinical psychologists, PDBU and the mental health services of Justice Health. The treatment measures outlined above may go some way to reducing the risks she poses to herself and others over the longer term. (emphasis added)


	
	My assessment is that the offender has shown some remorse by her plea and by what she has said. This remorse, however, was a long time coming. Her statement in the taxi afterwards that the night was exhilarating showed quite the opposite of remorse at the time. She lied in her first ERISP saying first that Ms Ayers was fine when they left the house, and thereafter lied by putting the whole blame on Duffy for Ms Ayers’ death and minimised her own involvement. There was no remorse expressed in that interview.
	
	
	On a charitable view, it might be thought that she was somewhat remorseful when she spoke with Dr Furst in August and September 2014 although most of her account of the offence to Dr Furst reads as if she was simply coming to realise quite what she had done. Dr Furst seems also to have had reservations about the extent of her remorse, as appears from the highlighted passage above at [105]. Neither Dr Furst nor Dr Ellis relates her suicide attempt and other acts of self-harm to regret or remorse for killing Ms Ayers. Nor did the offender so connect those matters in what she said to them.
	
	
	The personality issues to which the psychiatrists refer mean that I must have some reservations about the extent to which the offender’s statements of remorse are heartfelt. I do not think that they satisfy s 21A(3)(i) of the Act.
	
	
	Ms Ayers’ father provided a Victim Impact statement. It is clear that Ms Ayers was a troubled woman with drug and mental health issues that may have led her into the events which resulted in her death. No parent should have to endure the pain from the death of a child in such terrible circumstances as these. The Court expresses its sympathy to Mr Green, his wife and Ms Ayers’ siblings. The offender had pleaded guilty before the changes to the legislation commenced for the taking into account of Victim Impact statements and the position is governed by R v Privitera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.
	


Psychiatric issues and rehabilitation


	
	Mr Young of Senior Counsel for the offender submitted that Dr Furst’s report showed a clear linkage between the offender’s actions and her mental disorders. He submitted that such a finding would bring into play s 21A(3)(j), that is, that it is mitigating factor if the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of her actions.
	
	
	Mr Young referred to statements made by the offender at various times about feeling nothing or her brain not going at the time or she was “weird” at the time. He pointed to what Dr Furst said (at p.12):
	


In my opinion, it is likely Ms Evans was experiencing violent and sexual fantasies at the time of the killing, in keeping with her underlying sadomasochistic disorder and severe personality disorder, possibly including deviant fantasies of killing the victim for sexual gratification.

…

In my opinion, her childhood trauma, dysfunctional personality style, paraphilia, substance abuse problems and the obsessional nature of her thinking probably mitigates to a degree against the seriousness of her actions.


	
	In Zaharos v R [2008] NSWCCA 336 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) said:
	


[14]   … Where mental illness has played a part in the offending, the need for general deterrence may be diminished: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. However, where an offender understands what he is doing and the gravity of his actions, general deterrence may be of continuing significance: Wright at 51; R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [252]-[254]. The issue is further discussed in R v Matthews [2004] NSWCCA 112; (2004) 145 A Crim R 445 and R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36].


	
	In circumstances where the offender had been ingesting large quantities of drugs and alcohol over an extended period of time prior to the killing, where there was planning to the extent of robbery involved, where there was organisation about covering up what was done, where no evidence was given suggesting the offender obtained any sexual gratification for what she did and where there was no prior offending involving sado-masochistic behaviour, sexual or otherwise, I cannot accept Dr Furst’s connection between the offender’s psychiatric disorders and the killing in a way that mitigates the seriousness of what she did. Indeed, Dr Furst himself acknowledges that efforts made to avoid detection indicate that she was aware of her actions and their wrongfulness.
	
	
	The offender’s conversation with her sister before going into the bedroom suggests very clearly that she knew exactly what she was doing. At that time it was to back her sister up when her sister assaulted the deceased. Whilst the matter escalated once they were in the bedroom, nothing suggests either any sexual gratification nor any unawareness of the consequences of her actions.
	
	
	If it were the case that her psychiatric problems somehow minimised what she did and made general deterrence of less significance, other considerations might assume greater significance such as protection of the public: Engert v R (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68.
	
	
	Whilst I accept that what is recorded in Dr Furst’s report about her behaviour in custody and her willingness to undertake appropriate courses and treatment demonstrates some improvement from what Dr Ellis had reported some 18 months earlier, Dr Furst had a very guarded view about her prospects of reoffending as the passage at [105] above makes clear. I note the documents tendered on her behalf showing the courses in which she has enrolled and the units completed. In the light of her history more time will be needed before a positive view could be formed with respect to the likelihood of her reoffending.
	
	
	Mr Young submitted that a lengthier than usual time will be necessary for close supervision and rehabilitation in the community, and in that regard special circumstances should be found. In my opinion, the overall length of the sentence to be imposed means that the statutory ratio does not need to be varied for that or any other reason.
	


Sentence


	
	In relation to the steal in a dwelling house, the offence is aggravated because it was planned. It is a matter of concern that two of the items stolen were firearms both of which the offender endeavoured to sell and one of which she and Duffy did sell to a person the offender described as a drug runner who wanted it for his boss. The offender’s actions had the result that a firearm was provided to a person involved in crime and drug supply. I accept on the basis of R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 that I am not sentencing the offender for the sale of the firearm, but the ultimate disposition of the firearm, which was not a matter incidental to the offence (it was always intended to sell the firearms for money) is a matter I can and should take into account.
	
	
	I consider that it is also an aggravating factor that the stealing took place from a property to which the offender had been invited by Ms Ayers and with which Ms Ayers had a connection, it being her parents’ house. She had no knowledge that the purpose of the offender in coming to the house was to steal the firearms. The theft of the other items appears to have been spontaneous.
	
	
	The offence on the Form 1 arose as an ordinary consequence of the offence of steal in a dwelling house and does not result in any increased penalty for the principal offence.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty to this offence shortly after it was substituted for the earlier more serious offence. She is entitled to a modest discount for that. Its utilitarian benefit was small in the circumstances of the late plea for the murder and the negotiations in relation to this offence. The assistance provided by the offender is principally concerned with the murder. I do not consider there should be any additional discount for assistance for the stealing charge.
	
	
	For the offence of a steal in dwelling house, and taking into account the offence on the Form 1 the offender should be sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years. I decline to set a non-parole period because of the sentence that will be imposed for the offence of murder.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of murder I consider that the starting point should be a period of 30 years. With a discount of 5% for the late plea, the sentence, but for the assistance provided and to be provided, would be 28 years and 6 months. I consider that the offender should be given a discount of 3 years and 6 months for assistance with 18 months of that period being allocated to future assistance. The result is a head sentence of 25 years with a non-parole period of 18 years and 9 months.
	
	
	A direct comparison with Derbridge regarding the discount for assistance is not possible because the Sentencing judge did not identify the discount for the plea separately. However, the effect of the combined discount for plea and assistance given to Derbridge was that he received a reduction of about 19 months from a notional starting point of about 4 years in circumstances where there was not at least a belated plea as here.
	
	
	As far as totality is concerned I do not consider that the sentence for steal in a dwelling house should be entirely concurrent with the sentence for murder. They were separate offences, albeit committed in close proximity. The murder was not committed for the purpose of stealing. The stealing was planned from the outset. It is appropriate that the sentence for the stealing offence should be served first because of the length of the sentence for the murder. There should be an accumulation of 12 months for the start of the sentence for the murder.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 31 May 2012, being the date of her arrest. However, she served a sentence of 1 month from 3 July 2012 to 2 August 2012 for unrelated offences of common assault and damage property. She then served a 3 month sentence from 14 July 2012 to 13 October 2012 for unrelated offences of larceny and damage property. It may be noted that she was accorded some leniency in respect of the latter sentence in that it commenced only 11 days into the prior sentence. In my opinion the present sentences should commence at the conclusion of the second of the earlier sentences but taking into account the 3 days in custody pertaining to her arrest for the present offences. The result is that the sentence for steal in a dwelling house will commence on 10 October 2012.
	
	
	Rachael Margaret Evans, for the offence of steal in a dwelling house and taking into account the offence on the Form 1, I sentence you to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment commencing 10 October 2012 and expiring 9 October 2015. For the offence of murdering Colleen Deborah Ayers, I sentence you to a non-parole period of 18 years and 9 months commencing 10 October 2013 and expiring 9 July 2032 with an additional term of 6 years and 3 months expiring 9 October 2038. The overall sentence is an effective non-parole period of 19 years and 9 months commencing 10 October 2012 and expiring 9 July 2032 with an additional term of 6 years and 3 months expiring 9 October 2038.

		25 May 2015",2015-03-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703730,MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 12 September 2013 following his plea of guilty on two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years. The child in question was the applicant’s own daughter aged 8, and the circumstance of aggravation is that the child was under the authority of the applicant. The offences were committed in contravention of s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 15 years.
	
	
	In sentencing for these offences the judge took into account, at the request of the applicant, an additional offence listed on a Form 1 document, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Sentencing Act). That was the offence of indecent assault of a person under the age of 16 years. The victim was again the applicant’s own daughter. This offence was committed in contravention of s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 8 years. The Form 1 offence occurred immediately after the first offence and prior to the second offence, all of which occurred on the same day, 11 June 2012.
	
	
	The individual sentences imposed on the applicant were as follows:
	



	
	With respect to Count 1 a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months, with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months. The non-parole period was ordered to commence on 11 June 2012.
	
	
	With respect to Count 2 (and taking into account the Form 1 offence) a non-parole period of 7 years and 2 months, with a balance of term of 2 years and 7 months. The non-parole period was ordered to commence on 11 December 2012.
	



	
	The overall sentence, which included a small period of accumulation, was a term of imprisonment for 10 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 8 months.
	


Ground of appeal


	
	If leave is granted, the sole ground of appeal is:
	


The judge erred in imposing sentences that failed to reflect a finding of special circumstances.

Circumstances of the offences


	
	The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts. The following is taken from her Honour’s summary.
	
	
	The applicant is the father of the victim. He and his wife have three children. At the time of sentencing, the daughter who is the victim of these offences was aged nine years, and the two sons were aged seven and one year old. The applicant described himself as having an active role in their upbringing.
	
	
	On 11 June 2012 the child was bathing in their home. The applicant came into the bathroom as she got out of the bath and was starting to get dressed. The applicant pulled his pants down to just above his knees and helped the child put on her singlet and tee shirt. The applicant then rubbed the child’s head and forced her head down to the applicant’s penis and inserted his penis into the child’s mouth. The child pulled back and the applicant rubbed the child’s head again and inserted his penis into her mouth. The applicant’s penis was in the child’s mouth for a few seconds altogether. (This conduct constituted the offence on Count 1.)
	
	
	The applicant then put his hands on the victim’s hips and turned the child around. He inserted his penis between the child’s buttocks and rubbed it up and down. (This conduct constituted the Form 1 offence.)
	
	
	The applicant then sat down on the toilet and pulled the child towards him on the toilet and forced the child’s head towards his penis and again inserted his penis into the child’s mouth for about two seconds. (This conduct constituted the offence on Count 2.)
	
	
	The child pulled away and as she did the applicant’s wife walked into the bathroom. She observed the child naked from the waist down and the applicant pulling his pants up. She asked what was going on and the applicant stated “You should have knocked first”. The applicant claimed that nothing had happened and that he was going to have a shower.
	
	
	Later that evening the applicant’s wife asked him “Did you do it” and he said “Yeah”. The applicant left the family home that evening. He was arrested on the following day. He participated in an electronically recorded police interview during which he made full admissions. During the course of the interview the applicant detailed his actions after the child pulled away saying he physically positioned the child so that he could position his penis in between her buttocks (leading to the Form 1 offence). He admitted that some days prior to this offence he had performed a similar act on the child but he denied any other acts.
	
	
	The applicant made the same admissions to the psychologist, Ms Pratley, who interviewed him for a report tendered to the Court on his behalf. However, he told the psychologist that the prior similar acts had occurred “a few weeks” before these offences.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to all of these offences in the Local Court and he was committed for sentence in the District Court.
	


The applicant’s subjective case


	
	Subjective matters taken into account by the sentencing judge included the age of the applicant, 36 years at the time of sentence; his background, including that he had a “fairly normal upbringing”; that he did not have a record of prior criminal convictions; and that whilst his cognitive ability was assessed by the psychologist to be low to average, and he was thought to be suffering from marked distress, his offending was not predicated upon any psychological distress.
	
	
	The applicant had been unemployed for two years at the time of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence. Nonetheless her Honour took into account his guilty pleas as evidence of remorse, as well as his candidness with the psychologist and the police. Her Honour noted that the offending was not isolated having regard to the applicant’s admission of the prior conduct and this reduced the leniency considerations.
	
	
	The judge referred to the observation of the psychologist that the applicant’s anticipated social isolation upon his eventual release from custody was a potential risk factor in reoffending, which may need to be guarded against. Her Honour accepted that there were no reported issues which would otherwise impinge on the applicant’s ability to access and benefit from in-custody treatment programs and this factor pointed towards a reduced risk of reoffending.
	
	
	The judge noted that the applicant had expressed to the psychologist feeling ashamed of his actions and took this to be an acceptance of responsibility. Nonetheless, the applicant also expressed to the psychologist his belief that he did not need treatment. The psychologist observed that the applicant’s present attitude and his denial of any sexualised thinking about the child was unlikely to be true.
	
	
	The judge recorded that the psychologist’s assessment was that the applicant presented a “low to moderate risk of reoffending”. (The actual assessment of the psychologist was that of a “low risk” of reoffending: AB at 161.) Given the qualifications to the risk assessment expressed in the psychologist’s report and the range of unresolved issues (including the matters referred to in [18] and [19] above, and [21] below), an assessment of a low risk of sexual recidivism might be considered unduly generous to the applicant. In any event, no complaint was made by the applicant in this Court concerning the sentencing judge’s finding.)
	
	
	The judge accepted that the applicant may have good prospects of rehabilitation if he participated in treatment while in custody and noted the applicant’s expressed willingness to do so. Against this, her Honour observed that there were risk factors including the applicant’s isolation from his family as a consequence of the offences that should be guarded against upon his release. The judge considered that the applicant’s previous good behaviour suggested that there may be hope with respect to his prospects of rehabilitation.
	


The judge’s reasons


	
	The judge found that Counts 1 and 2, which both involved forced fellatio, were offences “at a level of moderate objective seriousness lower than middle range, for the very serious offence charged” (ROS 7.7). In expressing herself in this way, her Honour emphasised that this was not to minimise the seriousness of the applicant’s behaviour but simply to acknowledge that the category of offences charged covered a wide range of offending conduct against very young children. Her Honour had earlier observed that the applicant’s conduct was a very serious example of sexual intercourse and degrading to the child (ROS 3.3). The judge also noted that the offences appeared to have been opportunistic but not an isolated one (ROS 3.8).
	
	
	Her Honour found that the offences were aggravated by the breach of trust and the fact that the victim was under the applicant’s authority. Her Honour stated that:
	


There can be no greater breach of trust than the breach of a father to a child and this will be taken into account as part of the serious breach identified by the fact that she was under his authority and his daughter and the fact that the offence occurred in the home. (ROS 5.4)


	
	While the events were momentary for each individual offence, her Honour observed that the course of the applicant’s conduct must have continued for some minutes (ROS 5.9).
	
	
	Her Honour found that the Form 1 offence was a very serious example of indecent assault of a child considering the age of the victim and the nature of the assault near the victim’s genital region (ROS 3.10-4.2). Her Honour accepted that the sentence in respect of Count 2 must reflect the serious nature of the Form 1 offence (ROS 8.1).
	
	
	The judge took into account the victim impact statement from the child which spoke of her emotional hurt and confusion. Her Honour observed that it was well-known that the anguish suffered by victims of such crimes and the potential consequences for such victims often were not fully recognised for years (ROS 6.3).
	
	
	The judge allowed a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s early guilty pleas.
	
	
	The judge determined that the offences should be sentenced separately, but took into account the short time period between the offences and that the offending was in effect a single course of conduct (ROS 7.9). Her Honour also determined, as conceded by the applicant’s counsel, that some accumulation was appropriate (ROS 7.9).
	
	
	The judge referred to the need for specific and general deterrence and denunciation of the offending conduct as being important sentencing considerations (ROS 10.8). Against this her Honour noted that the long-term protection of the community, and the rehabilitation of the applicant, must also be considered and that promoting his rehabilitation was a sentencing consideration (ROS 10.9-11.1). Her Honour also acknowledged that the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole periods were to be used as a guide in sentencing (ROS 11.3).
	


Finding of special circumstances


	
	The judge found special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act to provide for the applicant’s supervision upon his release in order to promote his rehabilitation and, to a “minor” extent, to reflect the accumulation of the sentences for Counts 1 and 2. The Crown accepted before the sentencing judge that such a finding could be made on the latter basis.
	
	
	Her Honour’s finding was in the following terms:
	


The psychologist observes that his attitude at present and his denial of any sexualised thinking about the child is unlikely to be true. She observes “His thinking in this regard is reflective of the cognitive distortions that are common in untreated offenders”. It is a positive observation that the offender is willing to participate in in-custody treatment. His engagement will and should in due course inform the parole authorities when they are considering any future application for parole after he has completed his minimum term. This is a matter that will be reflected in the finding of special circumstances and the recommendation that he be released on parole in slightly less than the statutory period but only after consideration of his commitment to engage in counselling as recommended in the psychologist’s report and his engagement with in-custody counselling. These matters are difficult to predict at this stage. [Emphasis added.] (ROS 9.2-9.6)

Later in her remarks, her Honour said:

When considering the appropriate ratio of non parole to parole period the personal circumstances of the offender are relevant. I have already noted the circumstances above. For the length of sentence I intend to impose and the fact that this is his first time in custody is not in itself a special circumstance. The offender may have good prospects of rehabilitation if he engages in treatment while in custody. The observable risk factors mentioned in the psychologist’s report will require supervision on his release. He is currently assessed as having a low to moderate risk of re-offending. He will require substantial assistance and supervision on his release. Any willingness to engage in out of custody or post custody counselling will also be a factor that may assist in an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and his risk of re-offending. I therefore propose to find special circumstances to some extent. The parole authorities will be in a better position to assess his prospects of rehabilitation when the minimum term expires. If his risk level has been ameliorated by his treatment in custody he should be released after completing about sixty-five percent of his total sentence and serve the balance of his sentence under supervision in the community. [Emphasis added.] (ROS 9.9-10.6)


	
	It is common ground that the periods and the ratios of the non-parole periods to the total sentences imposed by her Honour are reflected in the following table:

Submissions


	
	The applicant contends that the sentencing judge found special circumstances based on the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation if he engaged in treatment while in custody; to provide for his supervision upon his release; and, as a minor consideration, to reflect the accumulation of the sentences for Counts 1 and 2.
	
	
	The applicant submits that neither the overall sentence, nor the individual sentences, reflects any meaningful departure from the “statutory proportion”, being a reference to the 3:1 (or 75%) proportion that s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act proscribes for the non-parole period relative to the term of individual sentences, in the absence of finding of “special circumstances”.
	
	
	The applicant submits that the sentencing judge intended to adjust the 3:1 ratio of non-parole period to parole period reflected in the overall term to “about sixty-five percent”, but failed to do so.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that her Honour’s remarks on this issue are unclear. Two possible interpretations were suggested by the Crown. One interpretation is that the total non-parole period imposed (74.8% of the total sentence) may reflect her Honour’s intention to find special circumstances “to some extent”, and that the applicant should be released after serving “slightly less than the statutory period”. That her Honour may have only intended to make a limited finding of special circumstances is said to be apparent from her Honour’s statement that the parole authorities would be in a better position to assess the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation when he was eligible for release. On this view it was submitted that there was no error in the total non-parole period imposed and that the Court should dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	The other interpretation is that if her Honour intended that the applicant should be released after serving about 65% of his total sentence, then the total non-parole period imposed did not appear to give effect to that intention. The Crown accepted that on this interpretation, her Honour must have either made a mathematical error, or some other error that resulted in her not manifesting her intention.
	


Consideration


	
	The principles applicable to the setting of the non-parole period of a sentence under s 44 of the Sentencing Act are well settled. A non-exhaustive statement of principles may be found in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [26]-[31] (R A Hulme J; Giles JA and Adams J agreeing). Three matters are of particular relevance in the present case.
	
	
	First, the non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in custody having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender’s subjective circumstances: Power v R [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 627-629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [34].
	
	
	Secondly, simply because there are circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances, does not compel the Court to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22]. The decision to find special circumstances is first, one of fact, to identify the circumstances and secondly, one of judgment, to determine that those circumstances justify a lowering of the non-parole period below the statutory ratio: R v Simpson at [73]. The degree or extent of any adjustment of the “statutory ratio” is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56; 194 A Crim R 20 at [33].
	
	
	Thirdly, in setting an effective a non-parole period for more than one offence the focus should not be solely upon the percentage proportions that the non-parole and parole periods bear to the total term: “the actual periods involved are equally, and probably more, important” (Caristo v R at 42 (R A Hulme J)).
	
	
	Generally speaking where this Court has intervened, it has usually been the case that the sentencing judge has not given effect to a finding of special circumstances through inadvertence or miscalculation. Examples can be found in the cases collected by McClellan CJ at CL in Fina’i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134 at [31]-[40].
	
	
	The starting point with appeals asserting such error is to ascertain “what can be gleaned of the judge’s intention from the sentencing remarks”: Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 at [24] (Howie AJ).
	
	
	Here the judge found special circumstances, but her Honour’s statement in the judgment referring to release of the applicant after completing “about sixty-five percent of his total sentence” if his risk level has been ameliorated by his treatment in custody, is inconsistent with the total non-parole period imposed, being 74.8% of the total sentence. It is also inconsistent with the individual non-parole periods on Counts 1 (75%) and Count 2 (73.5%) as a proportion of the total term of the individual sentences.
	
	
	The earlier statement by her Honour that the applicant should be released after serving “slightly less than the statutory period” cannot be interpreted as advertence to the end result. This statement does not indicate that the judge realised that the extent by which the non-parole period represented a departure from the statutory norm was as short as it was. Other than this statement, there is nothing to indicate that the judge was aware of, or intended, this result.
	
	
	I am persuaded that the sentencing discretion miscarried and that the ground of appeal is made out. There should be a grant of leave to appeal.
	


Is some other sentence warranted in law?


	
	Once error is established it becomes this Court’s duty to resentence unless in the exercise of its discretion it concludes that no sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted and should have been passed: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 at [42].
	
	
	The Crown contended that if the Court concludes there was error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, then no lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Crown drew attention to the nature and totality of the applicant’s offences and the requirement in s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act that the non-parole period be the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence: Power v The Queen at 627-629.
	
	
	Aside from reliance upon the matters advanced in support of the ground of appeal, counsel for the applicant relied upon an affidavit from the applicant as to his circumstances post-sentence. Evidence of post-sentence conduct is admissible for the purpose of determining whether a sentence should be substituted under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [124] (Johnson J; McClellan CJ at CL and Adam J agreeing).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the affidavit evidence demonstrated that the applicant:
	



	
	had engaged with a psychologist since entering custody to speak about his offences and identify programs relevant to his rehabilitation; and
	
	
	had applied for and been referred to the preparatory program for sexual offenders, which will prepare him to participate in sexual offender treatment programs whilst in gaol.
	



	
	I have had regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances which have been mentioned above.
	
	
	The applicant’s affidavit demonstrates that he has been a responsible inmate with no disciplinary findings made against him: affidavit at [4]. He has taken steps in terms of rehabilitation by engaging with a psychologist and seeking to enrol in appropriate treatment programs: affidavit at [9]. Both of these steps are consistent with the recommendations that were made by the psychologist, Ms Pratley, in her report.
	
	
	The applicant’s expression of regret and shame to the psychologist, and more recently in his affidavit of 19 January 2015, may be taken an indication of an acceptance of responsibility for his conduct.
	
	
	It is necessary to balance all these matters against the offending.
	
	
	On his own admissions, this incident was not isolated. The applicant had engaged in similar activity with the same victim either “a few days” or “a few weeks” prior to these offences.
	
	
	Notwithstanding his low cognitive ability, the applicant appreciated what he was doing was wrong. He was not suffering from any psychological condition at the time of the offending. The offending was obviously very serious. The sentencing judge was correct to observe that the offences involved the most serious breach of trust – they were committed by a father against his daughter, whilst she was under his authority in the family home, and where she was entitled to feel safe.
	
	
	The traumatic effect of this crime on the victim cannot be understated. So much is apparent from the emotional hurt, confusion, mistrust and anger recorded in the victim impact statement. As this Court has previously observed, child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]; Gavel v R [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110].
	
	
	The maximum sentence and standard non-parole periods are important legislative guideposts for the Court to take into account: see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. The legislature has set the heaviest maximum penalty of life imprisonment for s 66A(2) offences, accompanied by a standard non-parole period of 15 years. It follows that it is important that sentences for s 66A(2) offences reflect this grave element implicit in the offence itself: Gavel v R at [111].
	
	
	Although there was only a short time between the two s 66A(2) offences, the nature of the offending on Count 2 is such that when the intervening Form 1 offence is taken into account, greater weight needs to be given to personal deterrence: Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42] (Spigelman CJ; Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreeing).
	


Whether a finding of special circumstances should be made on resentence


	
	There remains the question as to whether special circumstances need or ought be found by this Court. In other words, in determining whether this Court should resentence the applicant it is required to determine whether such a finding should be made and if so the extent of any variation to the statutory ratio under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	For those purposes, it is necessary for the Court to take into account both the evidence before the sentencing judge and the applicant’s affidavit evidence in the present proceedings.
	
	
	As to the evidence before the sentencing judge, the evidence as to the risk assessment undertaken by Ms Pratley and the results of the same, set out in her report of 30 July 2013, are of particular importance. As already mentioned, her assessment, subject to the cautionary matters referred to in [52] of the report, was that the applicant has a low risk of sexual recidivism: at [60]. Furthermore, she was of the opinion that his highest risk factors can be moderated through treatment though that is dependent upon his response to and engagement in such a process. The affidavit evidence of the applicant discloses that he has seen a psychologist since he entered custody and that this has assisted him in identifying programs that address his offending behaviour, as well as to improve his daily life: affidavit at [9].
	
	
	The applicant’s affidavit discloses that he has undertaken a number of courses whilst in custody and he has applied for, and since been referred to, the Preparatory Program for Sexual Offenders. That program, it is stated, would prepare him to participate in sexual offender treatment programs whilst in gaol. He is waiting on acceptance into that program. He has stated his intention to apply for the CUBIT program once he has completed the Preparatory Program.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that the applicant would require substantial assistance and supervision on his release. This finding was not challenged by the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown also accepted on appeal that it would not be inappropriate for this Court to consider and give some weight to the prospects of rehabilitation in determining whether a finding of special circumstances should be made on resentencing (Tcpt, 10 at lines 29-36).
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances should be made (justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term) to provide for the applicant’s need for a longer period of supervision upon his release.
	
	
	That need or desirability arises in the present case from two matters. First, the prospect of particular difficulties for the applicant in adjustment after a long period in custody, having regard to the anticipated social isolation from his family upon his release. Secondly, and related to the first matter, the greater prospect of rehabilitation if the applicant is supervised whilst on parole than for a longer period of incarceration.
	
	
	It is well established that accumulation may require adjustment of a single sentence to re-establish the statutory proportion for the actual total sentence: R v Simpson at [36]. However, an accumulation of sentences does not automatically give rise to a finding that special circumstances exist: R v Cook [1999] NSWCCA 234 at [38]. Here the relatively small period of accumulation which is appropriate, as discussed below, does not require adjustment of the sentence on Count 2 to re-establish the statutory proportion for the actual total sentence.
	
	
	In determining the parole period for the individual sentences on Counts 1 and 2, it is important to bear in mind that there will be a practical limit of 3 years upon parole supervision which the applicant may receive: cl 218 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2014 (NSW); AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203; 225 A Crim R 481 at [90]; Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [37]; Jinnette v R [2012] NSWCCA 217 at [107].
	
	
	In the present case the evidence of the psychologist amply demonstrates that the applicant should be subject to supervision, with associated counselling and treatment, for the entirety of the period upon which he is to be on parole. It follows that “[a]s this period is confined by an upper limit of 3 years, then that is an important factor which indicates that no longer period ought to be set”: Jinnette v R at [108].
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. After allowing for the 25% discount for the applicant’s pleas of guilty (as applied by the sentencing judge), I consider that the following sentences are appropriate:
	



	
	Count 1 – the first s 66A(2) offence – imprisonment for a period of 9 years with a non-parole of 6 years and 3 months;
	
	
	Count 2 – the second s 66A(2) offence (taking into account the Form 1 offence) – imprisonment for a period of 9 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months.
	



	
	It was not in contest that some accumulation is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. I would adopt the approach of the sentencing judge of a 6 month accumulation on the sentence on Count 2 on the earlier sentence on Count 1.
	
	
	The effective total sentence that I would propose is a term of imprisonment for 10 years and 3 months commencing on 11 June 2012, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months expiring on 10 September 2019.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in the District Court on 12 September 2013 is quashed.
	
	
	On Count 1 (the first s 66A(2) offence), the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months, commencing on 11 June 2012 and expiring on 10 September 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months expiring on 10 June 2021.
	
	
	On Count 2 (the second s 66A(2) offence), the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months, commencing on 11 December 2012 and expiring on 10 September 2019, with a balance of term of 3 years and expiring on 10 September 2022.
	


   The first date the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is on 11 September 2019.


	
	After the reasons of the Court were published, the Court’s attention was drawn to an error with respect to order 4 referred to in [74] above. The date “10 March 2021”, originally stated as the date of expiry of the balance of term on Count 1, has been replaced by the date “10 June 2021” as now appears in [74](4).
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Gleeson JA and with his Honour's reasons.

2703731,R v Hoang; R v Xiao; R v Nguyen [2015] NSWDC 197,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing three members of a criminal syndicate responsible for the importation of prohibited drugs into Australia. The drugs were pseudoephedrine and some ephedrine. Although the drugs were imported into Australia, each of three offenders has been charged with New South Wales State offences to do with the supply of the drugs. Two of the offenders were couriers who travelled overseas to bring the drugs back to Australia. The third offender remained in Australia with an organisational role in the syndicate.
	
	
	So far as the drug pseudoephedrine is concerned, it is helpful at this stage to quote from some remarks on sentence by my colleague Judge Berman SC. His Honour was sentencing a Mr Zheng in 2013 (R v Zheng [2013] NSWDC 151). His Honour said the following at [1] -
	


“Manufacturers of methylamphetamine face a number of difficulties in present day New South Wales. One of those concerns the supply of raw materials or, as they are sometimes known, precursors. Not too long ago one source of the precursor pseudoephedrine was cold and flu tablets sold in pharmacies, but changes in ingredients and changes in the regulation of the supply of such medication has meant that that source has dried up. That has placed more of a focus on the importation of such precursors. Pseudoephedrine, in particular, is a relatively common precursor which is now often sourced from overseas so that illegal drug manufacturers can use it to make methylamphetamine.”


	
	In my remarks on sentence in these cases, I will first list the charges to which each of the offenders has pleaded guilty. Then I will make some remarks about the facts surrounding the offences and, by reference to the exhibits, the personal circumstances of each of the offenders. It is important for me in due course to make findings about what happened. One of the aspects of sentencing is for a judge to determine how serious an example the particular offence is for that crime. In other words, where on the scale of seriousness for that crime does this particular offence lie? In addition, it is also important for a judge to refer to the personal circumstances of offenders because Parliament has made clear that the purposes of sentencing are not only to ensure that an offender is adequately punished and to prevent crime by deterring the offender and others as well as protecting the community, but also to promote the rehabilitation of an offender. Parliament also emphasises that offenders must be made accountable for their actions and their conduct must be denounced. Hence in sentencing, judges and magistrates refer to both the circumstances of the crime and the circumstances of the individual offender.
	
	
	Robin Xiao has pleaded guilty to one offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely pseudoephedrine. The amount is just over 4 kilograms. That is an offence against s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Parliament regards that crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment to the offence and, in addition, has fixed a standard non‑parole period of ten years. In accordance with sentencing legislation, Mr Xiao has asked me to take into account, when I am sentencing him for that offence, another offence; that is the supply of the prohibited drug ephedrine in the amount of some 260 grams. I will take that into account in sentencing him and I sign a certificate to that effect. Mr Xiao, I convict you of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	Ann Hoang has pleaded guilty to the supply of 2.3 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. Again, that is an offence against s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries the same maximum penalty and standard non‑parole period. Ms Hoang, too, has asked me to take into account, when sentencing her, another offence; namely the supply of 690 grams of ephedrine. I will take that offence into account when I am sentencing her and I sign a certificate to that effect. Ms Hoang, I convict you of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug.
	
	
	I should add, and I omitted to add in respect of Mr Xiao, that the amount of the prohibited drug is the commercial quantity of prohibited drugs both for Ms Hoang and for Mr Xiao.
	
	
	Ms Thi Kim Ngan Nguyen has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug. In her case the amount is just over 4 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. That, too, is an offence against the same legislation and carries the same maximum penalty and standard non‑parole period. The amount of the drug in that case is also a commercial quantity. Ms Nguyen also has asked me to take into account, when I am sentencing her, an additional offence of conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug, namely ephedrine, in the amount of just over 260 grams. I will take that into account and I sign a certificate to that effect. Ms Nguyen, I convict you of the offence of conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug.
	
	
	I will now say something about the circumstances of these offences. First I will refer to Mr Xiao and Ms Nguyen because their two cases are more directly related.
	
	
	Mr Xiao, it is agreed between the prosecution and the defence in a document which is part of exhibit B, “was one of two couriers used to transport drugs from overseas for the purpose of supplying these drugs” to another co-offender, a Ms Ho. Mr Xiao was detected arriving at Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport. However the police knew in advance about the operations of the syndicate and had been monitoring telephone calls. They knew that Robin Xiao had been recruited for the purpose of bringing drugs into Australia and hence his departure from Australia and arrival were under scrutiny. In fact, he left Australia on 3 August 2013 and flew to China. On 16 August 2013 he flew from China to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. He spent three days there and then flew to Sydney, arriving at a quarter past eight in the morning on 20 August 2013.
	
	
	Mr Xiao was stopped by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and searched. They found four containers of “Herbal Life shake powder” and two containers of “Herbal Life protein powder” and six large bags containing a number of “Thanh Long Coconut Candy”. The containers were inspected and found to contain “a brown paste-like substance”. They were sent to the United Nations Office of Drugs where a drug precursor test kit was administered and a positive result was returned for ephedrine. Later they were formally analysed at the National Measurement Institute and the packages contained 435.48 grams of pseudoephedrine and 263.31 grams of ephedrine.
	
	
	Mr Xiao was given some paperwork and allowed to leave the airport and to go home. Mr Xiao told Customs officials that he had been contacted by a woman in Vietnam on a phone number provided to him in Sydney. The woman attended his hotel room and handed him a box containing bags of lollies and tubs of herbal powder. He repacked that into his own suitcase. Mr Xiao said that he was told by the woman that the herbal powder was for her friend in Sydney and the lollies were for her children. Mr Xiao was arrested a month and a half later on 31 October 2013.
	
	
	Before Mr Xiao left for Vietnam, Ms Nguyen (whom I am also sentencing today) was asked to meet Mr Xiao “to assess his suitability as a courier” as the facts agreed between the prosecution and the defence record. Ms Nguyen met Mr Xiao and reported back to a woman named Huynh to advise on the arrangements for the supply. Conversations on the telephones being used by Ms Nguyen and by Ms Huynh had been monitored. There was another person involved in Sydney named Ms Ho. Discussions which were monitored commenced as early as 25 July 2013. Mr Xiao was identified as “the man with the walking stick” and his age - he was in his sixties - was referred to.
	
	
	Ms Nguyen became involved again - and much more - on the arrival of Mr Xiao from Vietnam on 20 August. It became obvious to Ms Nguyen, Ms Ho and Ms Huynh that there must be a problem. Mr Xiao was meant to arrive on the flight at 8.15, but he was not seen for some hours. In the telephone conversations being monitored by the police, there are regular exchanges amongst Ms Nguyen, Ms Ho and Ms Huynh. Ms Nguyen was relaying information between Ms Ho and Ms Huynh. She was also giving directions to Ms Ho.
	
	
	It is relevant to observe that Ms Nguyen admitted in the phone calls to being very nervous. It is also relevant to observe that at one stage - towards the end, when they had abandoned hope of seeing Mr Xiao - Ms Ho said to Ms Nguyen, “What sort of treat do I get from you two ladies when I come back because I’ve been shaking like hell all morning?” The agreed facts note that obviously Ms Ho “is requesting additional payment for her additional work”. Ms Nguyen replied, “I am the same, my heart keeps pounding all morning, too. You go up there, find out and report back to me.” Ms Nguyen too was arrested on 31 October 2013.
	
	
	Ms Hoang was involved in a separate importation. Police knew from monitoring the phones that I have referred to that Ms Hoang had been in Vietnam since 2 July 2013. Police monitored her movements and she returned to Sydney at about quarter past 8 in the morning on Sunday 4 August 2013 from Ho Chi Minh City. Ms Hoang “was accompanied by six other companions, her two daughters and two friends with their children.”
	
	
	Again, Customs officers searched Ms Hoang and recorded what they found. They found two containers of “Mayfair” whitening lotion and two containers of “Dello” slimming body cream and one “Avocado plant hair care” and one “Rotary” amino hair mask. Customs officials inspected the contents and found “a brown paste-like substance”. They were tested with a precursor test kit, returning a positive result for ephedrine. Samples were sent to the National Measurement Institute and the results returned were 2,326.38 grams of pseudoephedrine - a commercial quantity - and 692.4 grams of ephedrine - an indictable quantity.
	
	
	Ms Hoang was interviewed and agreed that the bags were hers and that she had packed them. She said that she “had only clothes and cream that her friend gave her.” Her explanation was as follows -
	


“I went to have my hair done in a shop. I met a friend and that friend said that she got a friend in Australia who has hairdressing salon and if I bring these things back to her friend then I can go to her salon and I will have the reduced price when I want to do the facial massage or doing my hair.”

Ms Hoang said that the woman gave her articles to bring back to Australia. She filled in paperwork and was allowed to leave the airport.


	
	Again, the intercepted telephone calls indicated to the police that there were arrangements for Ms Hoang to fly to Vietnam to get prohibited drugs and to bring them back to be supplied to Ms Huynh. Again, there was great concern when Ms Hoang did not emerge at the expected time from the airport. This time the telephone monitored was that of Ms Huynh.
	
	
	Again, on 31 October 2013 Ms Hoang was arrested and charged. She repeated the account she gave of bringing back the beauty products and getting a reduced price.
	
	
	I should say something now about how serious an example of this particular offence these crimes were that I am sentencing each of the offenders for. It is clear and agreed that both Mr Xiao and Ms Hoang were couriers. In sentencing drug offenders, often reference is made to whether there is a hierarchy and where the particular offender fits into the hierarchy. By reference to such a hierarchy, couriers are usually placed at the bottom. However the High Court has cautioned sentencing judges about adhering strictly to an artificial concept such as a hierarchy. It is of course relevant but more important is what activity and conduct the offender being sentenced actually engaged in. Although Ms Hoang and Mr Xiao were couriers, their criminal activity must be seen in the context of what they actually did.
	
	
	Ms Hoang and Mr Xiao have pleaded guilty and been convicted of the offence of supply a prohibited drug. The basis of the supply is not that the drugs were actually passed on to somebody in Australia (that did not happen because they were intercepted) but that they were in possession of so much of the drug that the law provides that it must have been for the purposes of supply - if a person possesses drugs for the purposes of supply they are guilty of the crime of supply.
	
	
	Returning to the activity of each of Mr Xiao and Ms Hoang, this is not a case where the offender on one occasion is caught by the police carrying more than the amount which the law regards as for the purposes of supply. But - and this is why the events preceding it are important, to appreciate the context - both of these offenders went overseas and back. They collected the drugs overseas and brought them back into Australia. I repeat I am not sentencing them for importation. These are State offences not Commonwealth offences. But their actual activity and conduct has to be appreciated. They were engaged in a good deal of relatively sophisticated activity over some time.
	
	
	I also need to bear in mind that the commercial quantity for a drug of this kind is 1.25 kilograms. Hence the amount that Ms Hoang had in possession for supply was almost double and the amount that Mr Xiao had in his possession for supply was more than three times that amount. Indeed, an amount of pseudoephedrine moves from a commercial quantity to a large commercial quantity at 5 kilograms. So the amount that Mr Xiao was dealing with, to use that term generally, was approaching the large commercial quantity.
	
	
	The law acknowledges that although low in the hierarchy (so to speak), couriers are necessary to any drug syndicate. Each of them in this case had been paid some money but neither of them was involved in the business enterprise or derived any profit. Ms Hoang for example was to receive $2000.
	
	
	It is also relevant to make this observation (this is relevant to all three offenders): the drugs themselves were not distributed into the community. That is relevant to take into account because there will be some cases where a judge is sentencing an offender where the offender may have been engaged in distributing prohibited drugs within the community for some period of time. In this case, fortunately for the community, the drugs were intercepted by the efficient operations of the authorities.
	
	
	Mr R Steward of counsel for Ms Hoang developed an argument for his client by reference to what the courts understand as the principles set out by Hunt J (as his Honour then was) in R v Clark, NSWCCA, 15 March 1990 (unreported). His Honour said in that case as follows -
	


“The position is worse when there has been a profitable exploitation, but trafficking alone in any substantial degree should normally lead to a custodial sentence”.

Mr Steward argued that his client Ms Hoang was involved in an individual act of supply and may not attract the principles in Clark. He argued that his client was not engaged in a sophisticated commercial arrangement and that there was a limited degree of planning. I reject those arguments. His client was engaged for a financial reward. It was not a share of the profits but nevertheless she expected some benefit for the efforts which she put into her crime. This was not a spontaneous short lived episode of criminal activity. It involved overseas flights. She had plenty of time to think about what she was doing and it involved receiving and packaging - or at least packing - the drugs before bringing them back into Australia. It involved almost double the commercial quantity. There was involved a good deal of planning and execution of those plans. Of course Ms Hoang had to be involved at a basic level but nevertheless she was involved. I regard it as artificial to suggest that the principles in Clark are not engaged. Of course this is trafficking to a substantial degree. Although Ms Hoang is not charged with importing but possession, the observations about the trouble that she went to to bring the drugs into Australia are important in dealing with the argument presented about her limited involvement.


	
	Mr D N Shridhar, counsel for Ms Nguyen, developed arguments about his client’s role in the syndicate. He acknowledged, which had to be the case, that the role of his client “was to determine the suitability of Xiao as a courier”. That was based clearly upon the agreed facts. In addition, his client was “to keep informed Huynh as to the progress or otherwise as to Xiao returning to Australia.” He correctly pointed out that there was no evidence to suggest that she was involved in arranging for payment for his air fare or visas, nor was there evidence to suggest she determined the nature of the drugs or that she intended to distribute them beyond Huynh. She did not select Mr Xiao but approved him.
	
	
	Referring to the concept of a hierarchy, Mr Shridhar argued that it may be as simple as Ms Huynh recruiting his client, Ms Nguyen, “due to her gambling debts” and asking her “to take certain actions on Huynh’s behalf, thus distancing Huynh”. These observations have some merit but, on the other hand, the evidence in exhibit D - a transcript of the intercepted telephone calls including his client’s conversations - reveal clearly in my opinion that his client was above Ms Ho in any hierarchy and closer to Ms Huynh but also below her. Ms Huynh is clearly the senior person in the syndicate that we know of. She admitted in one of the telephone calls that she is “the big sister of you all”. Ms Huynh gives directions and approvals to both Ms Nguyen and Ms Ho. Others go to see her. Ms Nguyen, the offender, reports back to Ms Huynh regarding progress at the airport. Ms Nguyen gives directions to Ms Ho as well as analysing the circumstances and providing advice. Her role is clearly an advisory role to Ms Huynh. As I noted, Ms Ho expects reward from “you two ladies”.
	
	
	It seems to me that Ms Nguyen’s contribution, although limited, did involve her judgment, intelligence and advice being brought to bear in the criminal activity. It is true that we do not know the full extent of any syndicate. But I am confident in finding the relationship amongst the four that we do know of is this: Ms Huynh is at the top; Ms Nguyen is below her; Ms Ho is below Ms Nguyen; then there are Ms Hoang and Mr Xiao. I repeat, the main factor however is not some hierarchy - which is developed analytically by looking at the facts - but the evidence about what the offender actually did to amount to the crime. I agree that Ms Nguyen had no independent decision-making and derived no profit but, I repeat, she contributed to the enterprise her judgment, intelligence and advice.
	
	
	I should now say something about each offender’s personal circumstances. Mr Xiao is now 67. He has a criminal record. It is not very serious. It involves traffic offences but it also involves four offences of obtaining benefits by deception in 1999. They were obviously not very serious because he received fines and a good behaviour bond. Nevertheless, that deprives him of the extent of leniency that might be afforded to someone with a completely clean criminal record. I must emphasise that the law is clear that a criminal record does not aggravate the seriousness of the crime. In this case it is simply the extent of leniency that may be available to the offender.
	
	
	There is an affidavit from Mr Xiao’s wife, Ms Zhou. They met and started living together in 1998. When they met Mr Xiao was in a poor financial situation. He was receiving Centrelink benefits. Over the last few years he was receiving an aged pension. Ms Zhou was receiving a carer’s pension in order to look after Mr Xiao. As she said, they “never had much money and have always struggled financially”. She thought that Mr Xiao “felt ashamed that he could not provide better for me financially” and had always been upset about their living conditions. She said they have “moved about 17 times since we got together, and 12 times in the past five years”. The couple were finally granted public housing “about six weeks after Robin went to prison but were not able to take it because he was in custody”.
	
	
	Ms Zhou reports that Mr Xiao tells her that he is remorseful and she thinks that he is sorry about being imprisoned is also ashamed. I take into account to some extent that evidence of remorse expressed in the affidavit of Mr Xiao’s wife. Remorse is a relevant factor in sentencing. However the remorse was not expressed in the witness-box under oath or affirmation and therefore carries less weight than if it had been. Ms Zhou is prepared to “care for him and stand by him and encourage him to persevere”. She is not prepared to allow him to travel in the future, unless it is with her. As she said, there will “not be a second time”.
	
	
	There is also a report about Mr Xiao from a clinical psychologist, Michelle Player. That report provides a good deal of personal information and background about Mr Xiao. He is well‑educated, with a tertiary education. He came from a stable, supportive and nurturing family but when he was nine years old he went to Singapore with his grandparents. He came to Australia in 1972 when he was 24. As Ms Player observes, he has “a sound education history” with tertiary qualifications in science, chemical engineering and migration. Mr Xiao held steady employment for a period of time but injured his back in 1992 and received a disability support pension for that. He has two adult sons. He reported suffering from hypertension and cataracts and reported as being in poor physical health. Mr Xiao said that he had been coping poorly with gaol since his remand in custody on the day of his arrest on 31 October 2013. He had lost almost 15 kilograms and had difficulty sleeping.
	
	
	Ms Player thought that his account showed what she described as “”substantial depressive symptoms”. She said that since coming into custody “Mr Xiao’s psychological functioning has been poor and he is struggling with depressive and anxiety-type symptoms including persistent low mood, excessive worry, feelings of hopelessness about the future and sleep disturbance”. Ms Player thought that he would benefit from receiving professional support, and possibly medication, whilst in custody. She concluded by saying that enabling Mr Xiao “to maximise his time in the community, by granting him as long a period of community supervision as possible, will maximise the likelihood that he does not come before the criminal justice in the future”.
	
	
	Amongst the documents provided to me by Mr C Smith SC, who appeared for Mr Xiao at the sentence hearing last year, were statistics from the Judicial Commission regarding sentencing patterns for this offence. However the database is very low, being only four. Appropriately, they included the database for the offence involving a large commercial quantity which is relevant to consistency in sentencing.
	
	
	Mr Smith also provided me with two sentencing remarks by his Honour Judge Berman SC in the matters of Yin [2013] NSWDC 234 and Zheng [2013] NSWDC 151. Both of them concerned large commercial quantities of pseudoephedrine, in each case over 27 kilograms. They were also pleas of guilty. His Honour sentenced one offender to seven years and the other offender to eight years imprisonment.
	
	
	Turning to Ms Hoang’s personal circumstances, she turned 45 late last year. She has no criminal record and the law provides that I may take that into account in extending some leniency to her and I will do so in due course. There is a presentence report prepared by Community Corrections about Ms Hoang. It notes at the date of the report (15 September 2014) that she “is a mother of two young daughters, aged 14 and 12”. She was a single mother. The author of the report was concerned that at that stage “the offender has refused to inform her children of her current situation, which is of concern”. That has since changed. The author of the report noted that Ms Hoang was visiting her mother in Vietnam who had recently had a stroke and that she was offered $2,000 to bring a package back to Australia. Ms Hoang had medical bills mounting up for her mother’s treatment. She maintained that she was falsely informed what the packages contained. The author of the report concluded that “Ms Hoang presented as emotional and having no insight into the serious nature of her current charges”. Ms Hoang is unemployed and “has been for the past two years”. She was receiving Centrelink benefits.
	
	
	Mr Steward tendered on behalf of his client, Ms Hoang, a report from the forensic psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst. He noted her report that her teenage years were “chaotic”. Her father died when she was young and her mother still lives in Vietnam. He reported that Ms Hoang “fled to Malaysia by boat, later migrating to Australia as a refugee in 1991, being 21 years of age at the time”. She has worked as a seamstress and a hairdresser. She stated that she was offered $2,000 to import the drugs. Dr Furst said that Ms Hoang “expressed a lot of remorse and regrets in relation to her offences, being even more worried about the welfare of her children should she be incarcerated”. He noted that she “has now informed her children of her charges and upcoming sentencing hearing”. She repeated to Dr Furst how sorry she was.
	
	
	Dr Furst diagnosed Ms Hoang with a generalised anxiety disorder and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He thought that the onset of her anxiety was probably from early childhood losses. Dr Furst notes a history of chronic anxiety and that Ms Hoang presented for psychiatric assessment and treatment to a psychiatrist “only days before leaving for Vietnam in July 2013”. I will refer to that psychiatrist’s report shortly but it comes as no surprise to me that she would be anxious at that time given what she was undertaking. Dr Furst recommends that she be placed under the care of a psychiatrist and a health nurse if sent to custody. He also expressed the view that a “custodial sentence is likely to weigh more heavily on Ms Hoang than the average inmate by virtue of her high levels of anxiety, depression, and her fears for the safety and welfare of her two daughters”. He thought “Ms Hoang has good prospects of being successfully rehabilitated and making ongoing substantial contributions to the care of her two daughters and the community generally. Her risk of her reoffending is low.” Those are factors which I take into account in accordance with the law.
	
	
	The psychiatrist whom Ms Hoang saw was Dr S K Law. He noted that he saw her on 25 June 2013, not long, I add, before she left for Vietnam and complained that “in the past couple of years she has suffered from impaired concentration”. He thought that she suffered an anxiety disorder. Again, I observe that there may well be generalised anxiety suffered by Ms Hoang but I must place less weight on that anxiety being increased at the time that she was about to commit these offences. Dr Law thought that Ms Hoang, as a person suffering from severe anxiety disorder, “probably has a somewhat weaker will power and determination to resist offers that appear too good”. I put limited weight on that because he first saw her not long before the offence. He did add significantly that if “she is given a custodial sentence for her offences, she will almost certainly suffer from an aggravation of her anxiety level, and a custodial sentence will almost certainly have some negative impact on her two early teenage daughters.”
	
	
	There is a report from a person in Vietnam who, I think, is a brother of Ms Hoang confirming their mother’s poor health and the expenses involved in her treatment. There is also a medical report concerning Ms Hoang’s mother confirming that she suffers from diabetes and hypertension, as well as noting “acute hepatitis/stroke”.
	
	
	There is a reference from a friend of Ms Hoang’s, Thi Tau Nguyen. She also has two teenage children and is a single mother living at home. Ms Nguyen reported that Ms Hoang had told her how sorry she was and that she had “made a very bad mistake” and cries whenever she talks about it. Ms Nguyen has said significantly that if Ms Hoang goes to gaol she, Ms Nguyen, is “willing to take care of her children. I know it would be extremely hard for me to look after four teenage children, given my health conditions, but I will try my best.” Ms Nguyen has even spoken to the Department of Family and Community Services who, she says, “support my intention to care for the children”.
	
	
	Finally, I turn to the offender Ms Nguyen’s personal circumstances. Ms Nguyen is 36. She too has no prior convictions at all and I take that into account in her case. In a letter to the court (which became exhibit 10) she confirms that she “came to Australia with [her] family on 1 June 1990 as a 12 year old refugee.” Her parents separated in 1992. She explained her personal circumstances and her marriage to her husband, Peter Tannous.
	
	
	Ms Nguyen is pregnant. I should put that remark in context. Mr Shridhar tendered a report from Dr Harry Ngo, an obstetrician and gynecologist (which became exhibit 11). Dr Ngo reported that on the date of his report, 2 March 2015, Ms Nguyen was “currently about 13 weeks IVF pregnant.” Dr Ngo has been looking after Ms Nguyen’s pregnancy since she was 8 weeks pregnant. He reported that her expected confinement date is 4 September 2015. He reported that her pregnancy has been “progressing quite well so far.” Dr Ngo goes on to say this -
	


“However, Mrs Nguyen has had high risk obstetric history. She has had seven miscarriages and two unsuccessful IVF pregnancies since January 2011. Therefore, Ms Nguyen has been under a lot of anxiety and stress. In order to maintain healthy pregnancy this time, she was advised to avoid any stressful situation. She will be going to have the most important morphology ultrasound at 19 weeks on 16 April 2015. Based on her poor obstetric history, she will need to be closely monitored at least fortnightly, and the baby will be delivered by Caesarean section at 38 to 39 weeks gestation because of her history.”

It is also relevant to observe, which became apparent from exhibit 12 and the submissions of Mr Shridhar, that an earlier IVF pregnancy had to be terminated at 15 weeks on 15 June 2013 which, I note, is about a month before this offence. Exhibit 9 confirms that Ms Nguyen underwent an embryo transfer resulting in her current pregnancy on 17 December 2014, two days before she came before me for the commencement of her sentence proceedings on 19 December 2014. A terminated pregnancy in June 2013 resulted in an autopsy report which, as I said, is exhibit 12.


	
	I make these observations of otherwise very personal information for two reasons. One is what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said in a case drawn to my attention by Mr Shridhar. The case is HJ v R [2014] NSWCCA 21 and at [66] Garling J (with whom the Chief Judge at Common Law, Hoeben J, and Hulme AJ agreed) said the following -
	


“The relevance of an offender who stands for sentence being the mother of a young baby is undoubted. It is always a question of weight as to the impact which this factor has on the sentencing process.”

Now of course Ms Nguyen is not the mother of a young baby but she is pregnant and I would respectfully adopt what his Honour said - that that circumstance must be “a question of weight as to the impact which this factor has on the sentencing process.” The second reason is that the weight Mr Shridhar has asked me to put on his client’s pregnancy is significant. He points to the numerous miscarriages his client has had and to the previous unsuccessful IVF procedures, as well as to what appears to be the current successful procedure and the report of his client’s gynaecologist and obstetrician. Mr Shridhar realistically acknowledges that his client is most likely to receive a full-time custodial sentence. His submissions were focused on my delaying the commencement of that sentence until after she has given birth.


	
	That submission was anticipated by Mr Mehta, for the Director of Public Prosecutions. He tendered (as exhibit E) a report from the manager of the Mothers’ and Children’s Program of Corrective Services. In particular Mr Mehta refers to p 6 of that letter, where the author sets out how Corrective Services deals with pregnant offenders. They receive ante-natal care from a Justice Health midwife educator and attend pregnancy clinics. In addition, there is a high risk pregnancy clinic at Dillwynia Correctional Centre staffed by medical and social workers from Nepean Hospital. Offenders who deliver their babies at either the Nepean or Westmead Hospitals - which are linked to Corrective Services facilities - “are subject to standard NSW health and hospital guidelines and regulations regarding the management of post-natal women and neo-nates.” Mr Mehta also referred me to the fact that New South Wales Corrective Services has provision for “pre-school aged children” being given “the opportunity to reside with their mother or primary carer at Jacaranda Cottages” which is at Emu Plains Correctional Centre or at the Parramatta Transitional Centre. The child must be 6 years or under and the offender must be a particular classification.
	
	
	Mr Shridhar pointed out on behalf of his client, in addition to arguing that her sentence may be postponed, that his instructions were that if she went into custody, she did not propose to use the facility of keeping her child in custody, but the child would be looked after by her husband and his family.
	
	
	I should add that there was a report (exhibit 8) from a psychiatrist, Dr Ben Teoh. He recorded a reported “history of addiction to gambling” on Ms Nguyen’s part. She apparently told him that she “was in debt for more than $300,000” and “was banned from the casino in 2013.” She thought she could help herself. She reported to the psychiatrist the terminated pregnancy in June 2013 and said how depressing and stressful it had been, which I accept. The psychiatrist reported that Ms Nguyen had “experienced intense grief followed by significant depression after the termination” and did not care about anything anymore and felt like giving up.
	
	
	Again in respect of Ms Nguyen, as with Ms Hoang and Mr Xiao, she has not given evidence in the witness box so I do not have a verified account of her circumstances. I say that, not to doubt her reaction to the termination of the pregnancy which I might add was followed by a funeral she arranged, but because of the importance of any diagnosed causal relationship between that and her offending behaviour.
	
	
	Ms Nguyen has an elderly mother who is not in good health, living with or near her. She said she had been approached by someone in the casino who asked her if she was interested in being a courier. Dr Teoh thought that Ms Nguyen’s presentation was “consistent with a diagnosis of major depression and pathological gambling”. She expressed remorse for her behaviour. That does not carry as much weight as it would have if she had given evidence in the witness box.
	
	
	Ms Nguyen has seen her doctor regularly for treatment and has been compliant and, he thought, had developed a good insight into her condition . He thought her prognosis good “provided she continues to attend treatment.” He recommended counselling fortnightly to deal with her depression and gambling addiction.
	
	
	I turn now to consider the appropriate sentences for each offender. Although I may not have recorded in these remarks all of the submissions made in writing or in Court on behalf of each offender, I have read and heard them and taken them into account.
	
	
	I start with Mr Xiao. I bear in mind, as I said, that as a courier he is at the bottom of what might be described as a hierarchy. But I have listed the actual activity he was engaged in, in order to be in a position to commit this offence of possessing for supply this large amount of drugs. I would regard an appropriate sentence for Mr Xiao as one of 6 years imprisonment. However Mr Xiao has pleaded guilty to the offence at what the prosecution agrees was the earliest available opportunity. That not only indicates remorse but in New South Wales the Court of Criminal Appeal says that it must attract a discount for the very good reason that it facilitates the course of justice. It means that the busy courts are relieved from what may be a long and expensive trial whilst other accused persons are waiting for their turn. For someone who pleads guilty at the earliest available opportunity the discount is 25%. I would therefore reduce the sentence I indicated to one of four and a half years imprisonment. I should add that the only appropriate form of sentence given the seriousness of the offence is one of full-time custody. Normally, for a sentence of four and a half years imprisonment the sentencing legislation envisages a non-parole period - during which an offender cannot be released - of 75%, which would be three years and four months in Mr Xiao’s case. However the legislation permits a sentencing judge to take into account any special circumstances for reducing that non-parole period. In this case Mr Smith SC pointed out on behalf of his client that special circumstances include that it is his client’s first time in custody. He will do custody harder because of his age and because of his state of health. A period of extended parole will also assist him in integrating back into the community. I accept those submissions. I propose to reduce the non‑parole period to a percentage of the head sentence which is just over 55%. The non-parole period for Mr Xiao will be two years and six months. In due course I will sentence Mr Xiao.
	
	
	I turn to Ms Hoang. Again, Ms Hoang was a courier. But, as with Mr Xiao, she did a lot before she was in a position to commit this crime. I have to take into account that she had a smaller amount of the drug, just over 2 kilograms as compared with Mr Xiao’s over 4 kilograms. Ms Hoang also receives the benefit of having no criminal record whatsoever. I should say here that Mr Steward presented an argument, which he acknowledged was a brave submission, to the effect that her overall sentence may be something like two years which might then be suspended. It was a brave submission. It is not appropriate at all for his client to receive such a low sentence. I regard an appropriate penalty for Ms Hoang as being one of five and a half years imprisonment. Again, Ms Hoang has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I would discount her sentence by 25% for the same reasons I have mentioned, which brings it to just over four years which I will round off to four years imprisonment. For a prison sentence of four years the sentence legislation envisages a non-parole period of three years imprisonment. Again, Mr Steward argues that there are special circumstances for reducing that non-parole period in his client’s case. I agree. The special circumstances include her mental health, as diagnosed by Dr Furst, and the fact that she has two teenage children. I would regard an appropriate reduction as being just a little over 58%, so that I would regard an appropriate non-parole period for Ms Hoang to be one of two years and four months.
	
	
	First I will indicate the appropriate sentence for Ms Nguyen before turning to the submission made regarding her pregnancy by her counsel. Ms Nguyen was involved for almost a month in the criminal activity which resulting in the conviction of conspiracy and, as I have found, contributed her intelligence, her judgment and her advice. The weight of the drug in her case was also just over four kilograms, more than three times the commercial quantity and a kilogram short of the large commercial quantity. In her case, so far as her place in the notional hierarchy is concerned, I have indicated where that is - it is higher than Mr Xiao and Ms Hoang. I would regard an appropriate sentence for Ms Nguyen as being one of eight years imprisonment. Again, Ms Nguyen pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. She too is entitled to a discount of 25%. That means in her case that the sentence I will eventually impose is one of six years imprisonment. For a sentence of six years imprisonment the sentencing legislation envisages a non-parole period of 75%. That would be a non-parole period of four and a half years imprisonment without release. There are special circumstances, as set out in his submissions by Mr Shridhar, for reducing that non-parole period. It is also Ms Nguyen’s first time in custody. She needs treatment in the community for her psychiatric conditions including her gambling addiction. She, too, will serve custody harder because of her mental health issues. In addition, she will have, hopefully, a young baby in the community outside and I take that into account. I regard an appropriate percentage as being just under 55%, so that the non-parole period for Ms Nguyen will be three years and four months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	I turn now to the submission made by Mr Shridhar regarding deferring the commencement of the sentence. I propose to accept that submission. I have given particular weight to the report of her treating gynaecologist and obstetrician, including a history of seven miscarriages and two unsuccessful IVF pregnancies. That doctor’s advice was also that she should “avoid any stressful situation” and that there is a very important ultrasound next month. He was of the view that “she will need to be closely monitored at least fortnightly”.
	
	
	I do not make this decision lightly, nor does it involve any criticism whatsoever of the commendable services provided by Corrective Services for pregnant women and for mothers of young children. I repeat, the information set out in exhibit E reflects what seems to me to be a very enlightened attitude for women who are either pregnant or mothers. However, the punishment which I have imposed on Ms Nguyen is by fixing a prison sentence on her. It is not part of her punishment that her pregnancy should be put under threat or that she should be at greater risk of losing the child because of the obvious stress that will be involved in being in prison and having the child. I think in the circumstances, her case is best managed in the community by her own doctor and for those reasons I propose to accept Mr Shridhar’s submission and I will list Ms Nguyen’s case again, either this afternoon or next week, for further directions as to how the process is to be managed whereby his client will commence her sentence after she has given birth.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now I am going to formally sentence each of the offenders. I’ll just check, Mr Mehta and Mr Funnell, Mr Xiao’s sentence commenced 31 October 2013, am I right?

MEHTA: That’s so, your Honour.

FUNNELL: That’s the day he went into custody, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Funnell and Mr Mehta, please note the figures and the dates that I am reading out, because I will ask you both to check them.


	
	Mr Xiao, I fix a non-parole period for your sentence of two and a half years, two years and six months. That commenced when you were arrested and went into custody on 31 October 2013. Your non-parole period expires on 30 April 2016. On that date you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not is a matter for the Parole Authority. The balance of your sentence is two years, commencing on 1 May 2016 and concluding on 30 April 2018. So your overall sentence is four and a half years commencing 31 October 2013 and expiring 30 April 2018, and your non‑parole period expires on 30 April 2016. Do you understand that? Have a seat.
	


HIS HONOUR: Ms Hoang, and again Mr Mehta and Mr Nguyen if you would keep a note of these figures and make sure that they are right, that they add up.


	
	Ms Hoang I fix a non-parole period of two years and four months. It will commence today 20 March 2015 and your non-parole period will expire on 19 July 2017. On that date you will be eligible for parole. The Parole Authority will determine whether you get parole or not. The balance of your term is one year and eight months commencing 20 July 2017 and expiring 19 March 2019. So I repeat, your overall sentence is four years. The time you must spend in prison is two years and four months until 19 July 2017. After that, if you are on parole, the balance is one year and eight months and your sentence finishes on 19 March 2019. Do you understand?
	


INTERPRETER: Yes thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now Ms Nguyen I probably will not formally sentence you now because I am going to postpone the sentence and I do not know when it will commence for the reasons that I have given. But it is important that you know that you have a sentence of six years imprisonment and the non-parole period is three years and four months. Do you understand? Now Mr Nguyen, Mr Funnell, Mr Mehta, the figures in Xiao and Hoang are there any corrections?

NGUYEN: That’s correct.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Mehta do you agree?

MEHTA: All correct.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Funnell?

FUNNELL: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Mehta, Mr Nguyen, Mr Funnell I don’t think I need to make any other orders in respect of your clients Mr Funnell and Mr Nguyen and I’ll just check with Mr Mehta as well. I have sentenced them.

MEHTA: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t set the parole conditions because they are both over three years.

NGUYEN: I just wonder if your Honour would state on the record that your Honour has taken into account the offence on the Form 1.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. I did. Thank you very much. I did in each case when I signed it during my remarks on sentence.


	
	But for abundance of clarity I make it clear that in each case I have taken into account the offence of possessing or rather supplying ephedrine which each offender has pleaded guilty to as well.
	
	
	In respect of Ms Nguyen I find her guilty of the offence, and under s 11(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) I make an order adjourning the proceedings to Friday 1 May 2015 at 2pm for the purpose of assessing the progress of her pregnancy. Bail is to continue on the same conditions as presently fixed, with the addition that Ms Nguyen is to notify the Court registry and the officer in charge of the case if she is no longer pregnant.

		09 September 2015",2015-03-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703733,R v Anthony James Dickson (No 18) [2015] NSWSC 268,"Judgment on sentence


	
	The crimes for which this offender stands convicted illustrate the significant potential for tax fraud that arises from the high levels of secrecy surrounding the ownership and control of companies incorporated in certain overseas jurisdictions.
	
	
	On 21 August 2014 the offender, Anthony James Dickson, was arraigned on an indictment that contained six counts. On 22 December 2014 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts 1 and 6 on the indictment. Counts 2 to 5 were alternative counts to count 1 and need not be referred to further.
	
	
	Count 1 of the indictment charged Mr Dickson with an offence under s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the “Code”) in the following terms:
	


“Between about 15 November 2005 and 2 December 2011 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere [the offender] did conspire with [his coaccused] to dishonestly cause a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss to a third person, namely the Commonwealth, knowing or believing there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring.”


	
	Count 6 of the indictment charged Mr Dickson with an offence under s 11.5(1) of the Code, namely conspiring to commit an offence under s 400.3(1) of the Code, in the following terms:
	


“Between about 15 November 2005 and 25 June 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere [the offender] did conspire with [his co-accused] to deal with property of a value of $1 million or more believing it to be the proceeds of crime


	
	The maximum penalty for an offence under s 135.4(5) is imprisonment for ten years. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 11.5(1) is that provided for an offence under s 400.3(1), namely imprisonment for twenty five years or 1500 penalty units or both. The maximum penalty for each offence provides a “yardstick” for sentencing courts. It enables a comparison to be undertaken between the case before the Court and the worst possible case (Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [31] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ).
	
	
	The offender's co-conspirator was arraigned with him at the commencement of the trial. However some weeks prior to the jury's verdict he was discharged for the reasons stated in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 1595.
	
	
	Upon the return of the jury's verdict convictions were recorded and the offender's bail was revoked. He has remained in custody since that time. Submissions in respect of sentence were heard over three days in February 2015.
	


Background


	
	Neumedix Health Australasia Pty Ltd (“NHA”) was incorporated on 9 March 2006. Its two directors were the offender and his co-conspirator.
	
	
	The essence of the Crown case on count 1, as accepted by the jury, was that the offender and his co-conspirator agreed to cause NHA to make false depreciation claims in its tax returns of many hundreds of millions of dollars. The depreciation claims were in respect of the alleged cost of acquisition by NHA of certain medical technologies, even though it was agreed that no such cost was to be incurred. The offender and his co-conspirator agreed to this so as to enable NHA to avoid incurring tax liabilities on income it was deemed to have received as the owner of units in a number of trusts. These trusts generated very large taxable profits from their participation in certain financing transactions that were arranged between the offender, the ANZ Banking Group Ltd (“ANZ”) and some of its clients.
	
	
	The essence of the Crown case on count 6, as accepted by the jury, was that the offender and his co-conspirator agreed to deal with the “proceeds of crime” being the amounts standing in various bank accounts that represented the cash distributions from the trusts to NHA. The jury accepted the Crown’s contention that these funds were the “proceeds of crime” because they were derived from the conspiracy the subject of count 1. This was so because, to the knowledge of the offender and his co-conspirator, the funds would not be required to meet NHA’s tax liabilities as they would be eliminated by false depreciation deductions and the funds would not be required to make payments on the agreements the subject of the claims for depreciation as no genuine obligation to make those payments would be incurred (see R v Dickson (No 16) [2014] NSWSC 1862 at [19]). The offender and his co-conspirator agreed to cause the funds to be distributed offshore to various accounts controlled by entities associated with the offender and then repatriated to Australia, largely for their own enrichment.
	
	
	To place the offender’s criminality in context and address the relevant sentencing criteria it is necessary to describe the circumstances of the offences in more detail. The following facts were either not in issue, necessarily found by the jury, or matters of which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt and which are consistent with the jury’s verdict (see R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 (“Olbrich”) at [27] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ). All amounts stated are in Australian dollars unless otherwise indicated.
	


Count 1


	
	To address the level of criminality involved in count 1 it is necessary to describe the financial transactions that generated assessable income for NHA, NHA’s dealings with the inventors of medical technologies, the events surrounding the lodgement of NHA’s tax returns and the audit by the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”), and aspects of the offender’s case. It is also necessary to make certain additional findings concerning whether the agreements provided to the ATO to support the false depreciation claims were all shams or only some of them were and address various submissions made as to the loss involved in or occasioned by count 1. I will deal with these topics in turn.
	


The financing transactions


	
	The offender is a highly experienced tax and finance professional. During the course of 2005 and 2006 he pursued negotiations with the ANZ to pursue a financing transaction that had the following essential features. One of the ANZ's clients sold an asset to a partnership consisting of the trustee of a unit trust, namely ANZ Investment Holdings Ltd, and the client. The ANZ provided debt financing to fund the purchase. The asset was leased back for use in the client's business. The trust generated assessable income from the lease payments although most of that income was used to pay debt, interest and fees. NHA acquired 100% of the units in the unit trust. Under the relevant taxation legislation all of the net income of the trust was to be treated as taxable income of NHA although it did not receive a distribution of those amounts as they were used to pay down the ANZ's debt. Instead NHA received a cash distribution from the trust of 9% of the taxable income of the trust.
	
	
	The result of each such transaction was that ANZ's clients received an injection of cash from selling their asset. The client paid rent to use the asset, however those payments were tax deductible. The rental cost was lower than it otherwise would have been because NHA was effectively contributing part of its tax losses to make the transaction more commercially attractive. ANZ received interest on its loan to the trustee which was paid by the lease payments and fees for facilitating the transaction.
	
	
	As noted, it was agreed that, in return for it acquiring the obligation to declare the entirety of the taxable profit of the trust in its tax return, NHA received cash payments representing 9% of each trust’s taxable profit. In order for its participation in these transactions to make any commercial sense for NHA it had to have available to it very large amounts of tax losses to offset the taxable income it was required to declare. The offender repeatedly assured the ANZ that those deductions had been, or would be, generated by NHA assuming obligations to pay very large amounts to acquire certain medical technologies. ANZ was assured that NHA was in effect selling tax losses arising from large depreciation expenses on medical technology to acquire funding. As I will explain, the true position was that no such obligations were intended to be incurred and none were incurred. Instead the offender and his co-conspirator agreed to use the bulk of the cash distributions for their own purposes.
	
	
	In total four such transactions were arranged involving three of the ANZ's clients, Bluescope Steel, Gunns and Incitec. The relevant trust deeds were executed on 30 August 2006, 17 December 2006, 1 August 2008 and 21 September 2009. The first cash distribution to NHA was made on 26 October 2006 when $14.3 million was sent to NHA. Overall a total of $68,405,000.00 was distributed to NHA by the four trusts between that date and 24 December 2009. As the ratio of cash distributed to deemed tax income was 9:100 it follows that it was envisaged that in excess of $750 million in assessable income would be notionally distributed to NHA and declared in its tax returns over time. As I will explain, just over $378 million was so “distributed” in the financial years 2007 to 2010, and declared in NHA’s tax returns.
	


The medical technologies


	
	Throughout the period of the two conspiracies NHA presented itself as a business involved in the acquisition and exploitation of medical technology. It employed staff and had office premises. The evidence revealed that the offender, his co-conspirator and other staff employed by NHA had a number of dealings with various inventors of medical technology. It was not the Crown case that the entirety of NHA's business was a façade or that the medical technologies were not genuine. Instead the Crown case concerned the means by which NHA was alleged to have acquired three particular medical technologies as they were the subject of the depreciation claims in NHA's tax returns for the financial years 2007 to 2010.
	
	
	The first medical technology was a cancer vaccine known as “Genvax”. It was developed by Dr Stephen Ralph. Throughout 2006 the offender and his co-conspirator met with Dr Ralph and discussed the terms upon which the technology might be acquired and exploited. At the trial a variety of executed and unexecuted agreements which purported to transfer the rights to this technology to various entities were tendered. With the exception of those that were signed by Dr Ralph, the Crown case was that it could not and did not have to demonstrate when they were executed as the offender was engaged in the process of manufacturing agreements from time to time to suit his and his co-conspirator’s purposes. I will return to address this, but it suffices to state that the Crown succeeded in establishing that proposition beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	On or about 9 January 2007, Dr Ralph and his company, Genvax Pty Ltd, executed an agreement assigning the intellectual property rights in Genvax to Athena Health Patents Incorporated (“Athena”) for 50% of the gross revenues on commercialisation [1] . This is not the relevant assignment the subject of the false depreciation claims that were later made in NHA's tax returns. On or about 15 January 2007 a loan agreement was executed in which Athena agreed to lend to Genvax Pty Ltd up to $1.8million on a non-recourse basis for the development of Genvax [2] . A project deed concerning the development and exploitation of Genvax was executed on or about the same day [3] .
	
	
	Athena was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It was originally named Neumedix Biotechnology International Limited but it changed its name to Athena in January 2007. At the trial there was a dispute over the origins of this company and who controlled it. The offender said it was formed by his brother, John Dickson, in 2005 and that John Dickson owned the shares [4] . In contrast, John Dickson stated that he never negotiated for, worked for or was involved in the day-to-day management of Athena [5] .
	
	
	There was a sustained attack on John Dickson's credit and his evidence generally. On this issue and the other matters noted in this judgment I have no doubt the jury accepted his evidence. I am otherwise satisfied that it should be accepted. It accords with the balance of the evidence at the trial. For example on 12 January 2007 the offender sent an email to the firm in Cayman Islands that acted as the registry for Athena directing that its name be changed and that two corporate entities be added as directors [6] . Later in 2007 the offender and his co-conspirator prepared and amended drafts of correspondence on Athena’s letterhead [7] . I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at all relevant times the offender controlled Athena.
	
	
	The assignment from Dr Ralph and Genvax Pty Ltd to Athena was executed on behalf of Athena by a solicitor purporting to act under a power of attorney executed by one of Athena's corporate directors, Flying Dragon Group International Ltd (“Flying Dragon”) [8] . John Dickson was a director of Flying Dragon but he denied that he executed the power of attorney. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not and that his signature was forged and placed on the document.
	
	
	The second item of medical technology was a device placed on the upper part of the spine during surgery known as the “CG Surgical Clip” (“CGS”). It was developed in New Zealand. On or around 2 March 2007 a representative of CG Surgical Limited executed an assignment of the intellectual property in CGS to Athena in exchange for 50% of the proceeds of commercialisation [9] . On or about the same date he signed a loan agreement on behalf of CG Surgical with Athena under which the latter agreed to advance up to NZD$825,000.00 for the development of the technology [10] . Shortly after these documents were executed a commercial dispute broke out so that in the end result only a small portion of the funds were advanced and there was almost no further development of the CGS.
	
	
	The third item of technology was a diagnostic test for colorectal cancer known as “Cologene”. It was developed by Dr Jenkins from the United Kingdom. Dr  Jenkins gave evidence via videolink. In his evidence Dr Jenkins was shown various assignment agreements bearing his name and the name of his company, Armedillo Health Ltd (“Armedillo”) which he produced but which were unsigned. He said that he recalled he signed various documents on or about 2 November 2007 at his lawyer's offices [11] . I am satisfied that he signed them some time in November 2007. Four of these documents are of particular relevance.
	
	
	One of the agreements produced by Dr Jenkins was an assignment of the rights in Cologene from Armedillo to Athena in exchange for 40% of the proceeds of commercialisation [12] . Another was a loan agreement between Athena and Armedillo under which an amount of up to 1.3 million pounds sterling was agreed to be lent for the development and exploitation of Cologene [13] .
	
	
	The other two agreements were assignments by Athena. They were not the subject of much attention in the trial but, as I am required to make some additional findings, it is appropriate to note them at this point. Under one of these agreements Athena purported to assign the rights for Cologene to NHA for the territory of Europe (other than the United Kingdom), USA, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa for a consideration of 200 million pounds sterling [14] . Under the other agreement Athena purported to assign the rights to Cologene for the rest of the world to Neumedix Health New Zealand Ltd for 200 million pounds sterling [15] . The significance of these agreements is that they are fundamentally inconsistent with the assignment agreement for Cologene provided to the ATO which was said to justify the depreciation claims for the purported acquisition of Cologene by NHA.
	


The tax returns and the tax audit


	
	NHA's tax return for the 2007 financial year was lodged on 26 February 2009 [16] . It was signed by the offender. The return disclosed $47,837,698.00 in income from the unit trusts. However this was offset by various expenses the largest of which was a claim for $76,071,054.00 in depreciation expenses. The overwhelming bulk of that claim consisted of depreciations expenses in respect of the cost of the alleged acquisition by NHA of the intellectual property in Genvax and CGS from Athena.
	
	
	NHA's tax return for the 2008 financial year was lodged on 17 September 2009 [17] . It was also signed by the offender. The return disclosed $77,229,906.00 in income from the unit trusts but claimed $98,470,850.00 in depreciation expenses. The overwhelming bulk of the latter claim consisted of claims for depreciations expenses in respect of the cost of the alleged acquisition by NHA of the intellectual property in Genvax, CGS and Cologene from Athena.
	
	
	The lodgement of these returns led to the automatic generation of tax assessments which accepted the claims that were made. As NHA recorded a tax loss it did not incur any tax debt. However the returns attracted the attention of officers of the ATO. The ATO commenced an audit.
	
	
	In February 2010 the ATO wrote to NHA making a very broad request for the production of documents [18] . On 15 February 2010 the offender wrote to the ATO seeking an extension of the time for compliance [19] . Shortly afterwards there was a telephone conversation between the offender and an ATO officer, Mr Chris Harvey. The offender claimed he told Mr Harvey that he did not have executed versions of some transaction documents as they were overseas. He claimed Mr Harvey agreed to the offender's suggestion that the latest version of the transaction documents be printed off his computer and provided to the ATO. Mr Harvey denied this. The significance of this aspect of this conversation, if it occurred, is it provides an explanation for why the offender did not provide the ATO with executed copies of the assignment agreements and how it was that he was able to supply them in his case at the trial although there were material differences.
	
	
	I have no doubt the jury accepted Mr Harvey's evidence. To the extent necessary I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Harvey's denial should be accepted. Amongst other matters it is supported by his file note of the conversation [20] . The offender’s version of the conversation is not supported by a subsequent email sent by him on 15 March 2010.  [21] 
	
	
	Between March and May 2010 the offender caused to be provided to the ATO fourteen folders of documents said to be responsive to the ATO's request and supportive of the amounts stated in NHA's 2007 and 2008 tax returns including the large depreciation claims. Included in this material were three unsigned agreements each of which purported to record an assignment of the intellectual property in one of the three medical technologies from Athena to NHA (the “Genvax Assigment Agreement”, the “CGS Assignment Agreement” and the “Cologene Assignment Agreement”). Each of them had a handwritten annotation on the front indicating that it represented the executed copy. I will return to address the terms of these agreements later in this judgment but the combination of the provision of these agreements with their annotations, the contents of the tax returns and various unsigned minutes of NHA that were provided to the ATO recording the entry into of the agreements, amounted to an unambiguous assertion to the ATO that NHA had acquired the three technologies on the terms set out in those agreements.
	
	
	The ATO's letter of 10 February 2010 requested NHA provide, amongst other documents, any valuations of the relevant medical technologies that supported the amounts claimed for depreciation in NHA's tax returns. Included in the material supplied to the ATO were three documents purporting to be valuations of the medical technologies by the Karkalla Biotechnology Group (“KBG”) [22] . Those valuations stated that the value of Genvax was USD$627 million as at December 2005, the value of CGS was between USD$103 million and USD$119 million as at February 2006 and the value of Cologene was USD$2.541 billion as at November 2007. Each of the reports had a signature and underneath that the name “Peggy Wong, President Karkalla”. Elsewhere in each document she was described as “Peggy Wong PHD President Karkalla”.
	
	
	The Crown contended, and the offender strenuously denied, that these valuation reports were concocted by, or at the direction of, the offender and that the Dr Peggy Wong referred to either did not exist, or if she did, she had no connection to the reports. There was a vast amount of documentary material to support the Crown's contention. This included computer records pointing to the documents and their logo being created well after the dates referred to in the reports; documents indicating that the offender controlled various companies named “Karkalla”; the hosting of a contact email address for Peggy Wong by NHA in Australia, although it was alleged that she was based overseas; and numerous other documents allegedly signed off by Peggy Wong that inconsistently attributed to her a multitude of titles and job descriptions. In support of his case the offender gave evidence of his dealings with Peggy Wong and called two witnesses including the offender’s other brother, Paul Dickson, who said they had met her. The jury clearly accepted the Crown's contention. To the extent necessary I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the reports were concocted by, or at the direction of, the offender. The use by the offender of false identities was one aspect of his modus operandi in carrying out the two conspiracies that he was convicted of.
	
	
	On or about 17 May 2010 the offender caused NHA's tax return for the 2009 financial year to be lodged electronically [23] . The return declared $123,841,532 in assessable income from the unit trusts and claimed $106,689,541 in depreciation expenses. On 1 September 2011 NHA's tax return for the 2010 financial year was lodged [24] . It was signed by the offender. The return declared $129,474,513 in assessable income from the unit trusts and claimed $109,021,139 in depreciation expenses. The overwhelming bulk of the depreciation claimed in each return was referable to the alleged cost of the acquisition of the three medical technologies under the assignment agreements that I have referred to. Further, when those depreciation claims were combined with carried forward losses from prior years which were in turn attributable to depreciation claims in those years, it meant that the tax assessments that were automatically generated did not create a tax debt in favour of the Commonwealth.
	
	
	On 15 February 2012 the offender caused NHA to lodge amended returns for each of the financial years 2007 to 2010. The income declared in the returns was $18,550,000, $77,229,906, $30,868,000 and $129,474,513 respectively. The first and third of these figures were erroneous. The correct amounts were in the order of those disclosed in the 2007 and 2009 initial returns respectively. The amount of deprecation claimed in each amended return was $76,888,893, $118,570,332, $104,042,825 and $102,825,040 respectively. The total of these amounts is just in excess of $402 million. An exhibit tendered in the offender's case attributes approximately $386 million of the total amount claimed for depreciation as referable to the assignment agreements [25] . While there are reasons to doubt the calculations in that exhibit, the difference between that and the total of $402 million is immaterial for the purposes of sentencing. As I have stated, an amount in excess of $378 million was declared as income earned by NHA from the unit trusts.
	
	
	In or around March or April 2012 search warrants and notices under s 263 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (“ITAA 1936”), were executed on the offender's premises as well as a number of other places (see R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 1595 at [16]ff). He was arrested in April 2012. Since that time the ATO has issued amended taxation assessments for NHA, and proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) have been commenced against the offender.
	


The offender’s case at trial


	
	In light of a number of submissions made on behalf of the offender at the sentencing hearing it is necessary to briefly address the offender's evidence at the trial.
	
	
	In his evidence, the offender told the jury that throughout these events he was an employee of Rand Stone Private Equity Partnership (“Randstone”). He said that Randstone was a consultant to an entity known as the “HFAC Harmony Biotechnology Private Equity Partnership” (“HFAC”), with HFAC standing for “Health for all Children”. The offender said that HFAC was a Cayman Islands based private equity partnership that was originally formed between two wealthy entrepreneurs a number of years ago, and that it invests in medical technology (and similar initiatives) designed to improve the health of all children worldwide.
	
	
	The offender said that his arrangement with HFAC was that he would act as its “steward” for various medical technologies and that Athena acquired intellectual property rights for the three technologies as the undisclosed agent for HFAC. The offender said that the recipient of funds from NHA, Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Ltd (“Dampier Finance”), was HFAC's nominated receiving agent for the payment of the amounts owing by NHA under the three assignment agreements with Athena referred to previously and that the movement of funds from NHA overseas which I will describe were simply NHA meeting its obligations under those agreements. Further, the offender said that the subsequent routing of those funds through Hong Kong and back to Australia occurred as a result of HFAC directing him to transfer those funds, and “invest” them in Australia by allegedly lending various amounts to his co-conspirator and otherwise paying him his remuneration under his arrangements with Randstone.
	
	
	There were a number of documents tendered in the offender’s case which were said to evidence these arrangements. These included executed versions of the Genvax assignment agreement and the Cologene assignment agreement provided to the ATO which referred to HFAC as a party. None of the assignment agreements provided to the ATO refer to HFAC.
	
	
	The Crown submitted to the jury that this evidence was false and the documents said to support it were fabricated after the offender's arrest. I will not repeat all the points made by the Crown but they included the fact that none of the documents provided to the ATO or seized during the execution of the search warrants provided any support for this evidence, save for one deed that bore the date March 2006 but which appears to have been prepared well after. Critically none of the assignment agreements between the inventors and Athena that were retained by the inventors or the assignment agreements between Athena and NHA provided to the ATO referred to HFAC. In any event the jury were instructed, inter alia, that, if there was a reasonable possibility that the version presented by the accused was true, then the Crown case failed. It follows from the jury's verdict that it rejected even the reasonable possibility that the accused's version was true and otherwise accepted that the supposedly corroborative documents were fabrications.
	


Further findings concerning the assignment agreements


	
	I have already referred to the agreements purporting to record an assignment of the intellectual property in the three technologies between Athena and NHA that were provided to the ATO which were the basis for the depreciation claims in NHA’s tax returns and the versions of those assignments that the offender tendered in his own case.
	
	
	It was accepted that the Crown case on both counts 1 and 6 was circumstantial and the jury were instructed accordingly. In relation to count 1 this included a direction in accordance with Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573. In particular the jury were instructed that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the agreement the subject of count 1 unless they were first satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that NHA “did not incur any obligation to pay for the intellectual property assignment under at least one of the agreements … which was the basis [for] the depreciation claimed in NHA's tax returns” [26] . To that end the jury were also given directions of law in relation to the principles concerning sham agreements.
	
	
	From their verdict it can be accepted that the jury accepted that at least one of the three agreements was a sham. However the Crown urged the Court to find that all three were shams. Counsel for the offender resisted this and submitted that the Court should find that only the CGS Assignment agreement was a sham.
	
	
	The relevant principles to be applied can be stated briefly. A sham is a document such as a contract which has the form or appearance of a legally effective document but is really one which the relevant parties intend should not have its apparent, or indeed any legal, consequences (Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55; 218 CLR 471 at [46]). It is “intended to be mistaken for something else, …, a spurious imitation, a counterfeit, a disguise or a false front”, something that is not “genuine or true” (Sharrment Pty Ltd & Ors v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1988) 18 FCR 449 at 454). To determine whether such a document is a sham there must be a consideration of the subjective intentions of the relevant parties (Raftland Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] HCA 21; 238 CLR 516 at [146]).
	
	
	Just because one person or the same group of persons may be behind two corporate entities that enter into a contract does not mean that the contract is not genuine; that is, it is a document the parties do not intend to have its apparent legal effect. Moreover, just because a document described as a contract is unsigned or is only signed by one party does not by itself indicate that it is a sham. An unsigned contract can record the terms of an agreement that has been reached between parties. Further just because a contract is complex or forms part of a complex arrangement does not mean that it is not genuine. Simply because a contract appears to be circular or uncommercial or lacks economic sense does not necessarily mean it is not a genuine or true contract (Raftland at [149]). Even if an agreement was entered into for the sole purpose of obtaining favourable tax treatment it does not necessarily follow that it was not genuinely intended by the parties to have legal effect. Also, the fact that parties to a contract later depart from its terms does not necessarily mean that they never intended the contract to be legally binding (Raftland at [149]) although it can assist in forming such a conclusion. Parties can genuinely intend to enter into a contract but sometimes events transpire to mean that they cannot fulfil them.
	
	
	I have already made a finding that Athena was under the effective control of the offender. It follows that in determining whether the assignment agreements were shams the relevant subjective intentions to consider are those of the offender and his co-conspirator, as they were on both sides of the transaction. For the reasons that follow I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they did not intend to have NHA legally bound by the obligations in any of the three agreements and, in particular, did not intend to make NHA obliged to make the patents rights consideration payments referred to in those agreements.
	
	
	Before addressing each of the agreements individually it is necessary to describe part of the Crown case that cuts across all three of them. An especially powerful part of the Crown case was various handwritten and typed documents that passed between the offender and his co-conspirator sometime in late 2006 [27]  and then in July and September 2007 respectively [28] . The main subject of those communications was the distribution of certain interest earned by NHA on amounts received from the trusts.
	
	
	The Crown contended that a close reading of those documents revealed that the underlying assumption of the correspondence was that the offender and his co-conspirator had agreed to divide up the bulk of the funds received from the trusts between themselves with a portion to be paid to a third person and to NHA to pay its various expenses but not the amounts allegedly required under the assignment agreements with Athena. The significance of this material is that, as I will explain, in 2007 and 2008 a number of instalments were allegedly due under those assignment agreements. The only source of funds that NHA had to pay for them was the cash distributions from the trusts yet these communications suggest that neither the offender nor his co-conspirator contemplated using them for that purpose. These communications strongly support an inference that that was so because they knew that those instalments were not payable.
	
	
	Otherwise, the Crown contended that the fundamental assumption of these documents was that NHA would not only have no tax liabilities, it would also not have any liability to pay the amounts said to be owing under the assignment agreements which gave rise to the depreciation claims that avoided those liabilities. This material was powerful evidence in support of the Crown case on count 1 because while NHA might legitimately achieve one of those aims it could not legitimately achieve both.
	
	
	The first of the assignment agreements to be considered concerns the alleged acquisition of Genvax by NHA from Athena. There were two relevant versions in evidence being the Genvax Assigment agreement dated 15 January 2007 provided to the ATO [29]  and the version that included HFAC as a party that was tendered in the offender's case. For the reasons already stated this latter document can be ignored. The former purported to record the worldwide sale of the rights to Genvax from Athena to NHA for approximately $190 million payable over five years as well as for payment of the “fair market value” for the period thereafter. The first three payments required were $27.15million on 13 April 2007, $2.46 million on 30 June 2008 and $12.77 million on 1 July 2008. The agreement was structured so that NHA could elect to avoid the assignment at the end of each instalment period and in doing so only assume the obligation to pay the instalments referable to that period.
	
	
	I note six matters about the Genvax Assignment agreement. First there is the point I have just referred to, namely the communications between the offender and his co-conspirator in 2006 and 2007 concerning the division of the funds distributed from the trusts point to there being no intention to pay the amounts allegedly owing under the Genvax Assignment agreement. Otherwise the amounts payable under this agreement (and the other agreements) were very large yet NHA had not even the remotest prospect of obtaining access to that level of funding in the short term while the Genvax technology was still at an early stage of development.
	
	
	Second, clause 14.5.2 of the Genvax Assignment agreement contained a clause disclaiming any common ownership of Athena and NHA and asserting that the agreement was negotiated on an arm’s length basis. This clause was clearly false, and false to the knowledge of the offender, in that he was both sides of the transaction.
	
	
	Third, between 6 and 8 February 2007 the offender's personal assistant sent a number of facsimiles to Barclays Bank enclosing a number of agreements including a signed agreement in which Athena purported to sell to NHA the worldwide rights for Genvax for $18 million and another agreement in which Athena purported to lend $18 million to Dampier Finance. The documents were sent to Barclays because it was querying the true source of the funds that Dampier Finance had received from NHA and was reluctant to act on instructions it had received to send the funds to Hong Kong. The offender effectively represented that the funds were the proceeds of a loan from Athena to Dampier Finance and that Athena was entitled to the funds because it had sold Genvax to NHA for $18 million. Those assertions were fundamentally inconsistent with the terms of the Genvax Assignment agreement provided to the ATO.
	
	
	Fourth, in late 2007 the offender retained Walsh & Walsh accountants to prepare accounts for NHA. A memorandum and an assignment agreement for Genvax that emanated from the offender's email address was sent to the accountants for the purpose of their preparing the accounts. [30]  This material advised Walsh & Walsh that the entity that assigned the intellectual property to NHA was not Athena but another company, Karkalla International Holdings (""KIH""), and that it did so on different terms to those set out in the Genvax assignment agreement even though the latter bore a date eleven months prior.
	
	
	The offender denied that he sent the emails. He claimed they were sent by another person in his office. His denials were unbelievable and no doubt had a devastating effect on his creditability in the eyes of the jury. The emails were clearly drafted by him. He later prepared and signed accounts for NHA that reflected the effect of those agreements.
	
	
	Fifth, the Genvax Assignment agreement was created much later than the date stated on the agreement, namely 15 January 2007, but it was backdated. If the agreement had been created on or about the date it bore it would have been sent to Walsh & Walsh. Instead, just prior to lodging NHA's tax return for the financial year 2007, the offender caused NHA's accounts to be completely rewritten to remove the effect of the agreements previously sent to Walsh & Walsh, and substituted the effect of the Genvax Assignment agreement and the CGS Assignment agreement. This appears to represent the most likely time at which those agreements, or some draft thereof, was first created.
	
	
	Sixth, the other findings noted above point to the absence of any intention on the part of the offender to make NHA legally obliged to pay Athena the amounts stated in the Genvax assignment agreement. In particular his submission of concocted valuations to the ATO reflects a dishonest and fraudulent intent on his part.
	
	
	The CGS Assignment agreement provided to the ATO was also unsigned [31] . It bore the date 5 March 2007. It purported to record an assignment of the worldwide rights to the intellectual property in CGS for a total consideration of $60 million payable over four years, together with an agreement to pay the ""fair market value"" thereafter. A payment of $2.25 million was due on 15 April 2007, and a payment of $4.235 million was due on 1 July 2008. This agreement also purported to enable NHA to avoid the assignment at the end of the instalment periods. The first, second and fifth to sixth points made in relation to the Genvax Assignment agreement also apply to this agreement. In relation to the fourth point, the memorandum sent to Walsh & Walsh in November 2007 advised them that the intellectual property in CGS had been assigned on completely different terms to those set out in the CGS Assignment agreement [32] . The combination of the material sent to Walsh & Walsh suggested that it had been assigned by KIH to NHA and not by Athena,
	
	
	Otherwise I note two further points in relation to the CGS Assignment agreement.  First, as noted, shortly after March 2007 when the representatives of CG Surgical signed the assignment to NHA a dispute broke out, and the development of the technology ceased. Despite this, NHA apparently continued to incur obligations to pay the instalment amounts under the CGS Assignment agreement.
	
	
	Second, a signed agreement similar to the CGS Assignment agreement was sent to Walsh & Walsh at the time NHA's accounts were re-written in early 2009 [33] . This version did not include clause 14.5.2 discussed above. Its inclusion in the version sent to the ATO is consistent with the offender seeking to deceive the ATO into accepting that the CGS Assignment agreement was negotiated at arm’s length.
	
	
	The Cologene Assignment agreement presented to the ATO was unsigned but bore the date 30 November 2007 [34] . It purported to record an assignment of the worldwide rights to the intellectual property in Cologene for a total consideration of USD$160 million payable over a period of three years together with an agreement to pay the “fair market value” thereafter. The first three payments required were $5.75 million on 1 July 2008, $15 million on 15 December 2008 and $5 million on 15 February 2009. The first, second and fifth to sixth points made in relation to the Genvax Assignment agreement apply to this agreement.
	
	
	With the fourth point (at [56]), the agreements sent to Walsh and Walsh in early 2008 included a Deed of Option dated 6 March 2007 which purported to enable NHA to acquire the intellectual property for Cologene from KIH at its election. This was inconsistent with the Cologene Assignment agreement under which NHA purported to acquire the intellectual property in Cologene from Athena in November 2007.
	
	
	Further, included in the documents tendered on behalf of the offender was a signed version of the Cologene Assignment agreement which referred to HFAC as a party. As noted it follows from the jury's verdict that this version is a concoction. Further, it should be noted that the Cologene Assignment agreement presented to the ATO was completely inconsistent with the two assignment agreements concerning the sale of rights to Cologene previously noted (at [26]).
	


Count 1: Loss or risk of loss and loss resulting from the offence


	
	Detailed submissions were made by the Crown and on behalf of the offender concerning the extent of the loss or risk of loss involved in count 1. At the outset it must be noted that there are two distinct inquiries that must be undertaken.
	
	
	The first concerns the extent of the loss or risk of loss intended by the offender to be caused in giving effect to the agreement the subject of count 1. The second concerns the extent of the loss, if any, that was in fact caused by the offender's conduct the subject of count 1.
	
	
	With the first matter the offender was convicted of a conspiracy to dishonestly cause a loss or a risk of loss. In convicting the offender of that offence it necessarily follows that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender and his co-conspirator intended to dishonestly cause a loss or a risk of loss to the Commonwealth pursuant to the agreement they formed, and that each knew or believed that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring (Code; s 135.4(9)(b), s135.4(5)(b)).
	
	
	It follows that one aspect of any assessment of the criminality involved with count 1 is to determine the extent of the loss or risk of loss that the offender and his co-conspirator intended to cause in giving effect to their agreement and the extent of the loss that each knew or believed would occur or was a substantial risk of occurring. Such an inquiry involves a consideration of the scope of their agreement and an adoption of the hypothesis that their agreement was successfully implemented.
	
	
	With the second matter, subsection 16(2)(e) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the “Crimes Act”) specifies that one of the factors to be considered in determining the appropriate sentence is any “loss or damage resulting from the offence”. A consideration of this fact involves an inquiry into the loss or damage that was in fact occasioned by the commission of count 1. As is evident from what I have stated, the completion of the agreement the subject of count 1 was ultimately frustrated by its detection by the ATO and the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”). Their actions ameliorated the occasioning of loss to the Commonwealth in that tax returns for the financial years after 2010 claiming false deductions were not lodged, amended tax assessments have been raised and some of the proceeds of the money laundering have been seized. An assessment of the loss that has in fact resulted from the commission of count 1 must take into account those facts. However those matters are irrelevant to the first inquiry because self evidently the offender and his co-conspirator’s agreement was designed to achieve an acceptance of NHA’s false depreciation claims and not a detection of their fraudulent scheme.
	
	
	Against that background I will deal with each inquiry in turn.
	
	
	The jury were instructed that, for the purposes of count 1, the concept of “loss” meant “a loss in property, whether temporary or permanent and includes not getting what one might get” (Code; s 130.1). They were also instructed that there is a loss to the Commonwealth “if it does not get property that it would otherwise get namely a tax debt owed by NHA”. This instruction reflected the effect of the relevant tax legislation and what the evidence revealed as to the manner in which NHA’s tax returns led to tax assessments. As stated, the lodgement of NHA’s initial return for the financial years 2007 and 2008 automatically generated tax assessments based on the figures in the returns. For the subsequent returns, the returns themselves constituted the assessment. In each case if an assessment recorded an amount of tax was owing then a tax debt arose in favour of the Commonwealth ((see s 5-5 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; s 255-5 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953). A tax debt is a form of property being a chose in action. If no such debt arose because of a false depreciation claim then the Commonwealth did not obtain property it might otherwise “get”.
	
	
	The agreement entered between the offender and his co-conspirator was to claim false depreciation deductions. It follows from the jury’s verdict and the above findings that false claims were contemplated in respect of the three technologies. Thus the offender and his co-conspirator intended NHA to claim false depreciation expenses in respect of those technologies, intended they would be accepted and that, as a consequence, no tax debt would arise in favour of the Commonwealth because the false depreciation expenses would be more than sufficient to offset any tax debt that might otherwise arise from NHA’s deemed receipt of income from the trusts.
	
	
	Pursuant to the agreement the subject of count 1, between $386 million and $402 million in false deductions was claimed (see [36]). It was accepted that the total amount payable for the instalments for the first three to five years under the three agreements was approximately $450 million. As noted the alleged agreements made provision for further payments representing what is said to be “fair market value”. However that is too vague a basis for concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender and his co-conspirator intended to claim deductions based on these agreements beyond the instalments for the first three to five years. Thus while between $386 million and $402 million was claimed I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the remainder of the instalments under the assignment agreements was intended to be claimed other than the amounts said to be payable for fair market value.
	
	
	Given that the object of the conspiracy was to eliminate NHA's tax liabilities from its receipt of income from the trusts, it may be that the true scope of the intended loss or risk of loss was the elimination of any liability on the entirety of the anticipated distributions from the trusts; ie $750 million. However, in the absence of the Crown pointing to material that suggested that deductions based on either the alleged obligation to pay fair market value or other sham agreements were contemplated, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the scope of the agreement between the offender and his co-conspirator extended that far.
	
	
	Given that the anticipated total income from the four trusts was $750 million I am satisfied that, over time, it was intended that NHA would be able to apply the entirety of the approximate $450 million in false deductions to offset declared income. As the corporate tax rate was and is 30% it follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the extent of the loss or risk of loss that was intended to be caused to the Commonwealth was 30% of approximately $450 million or approximately $135 million. Clearly the fraud sought to be perpetrated was a very large one.
	
	
	What was the actual loss to the Commonwealth that resulted from the offence?
	
	
	As stated the object of the agreement the subject of count 1 was to raise false depreciation expenses claims. The implementation of the conspiracy lead to the lodgement of returns and amended returns for the financial years 2007 to 2010 which claimed between $386 million and $402 million in false deductions. As stated, the lodgement of the returns lead to the generation of assessments which did not yield any tax debt owing in favour of the Commonwealth.
	
	
	As also noted, a series of amended assessments for NHA for the financial years 2007 to 2010 have been issued. A number of adjustments have been made, however only two are relevant. The first is to add back the understatements of income noted above in [36]. The second is to disallow the amounts claimed for depreciation under the three assignment agreements. In a schedule provided to the Court on 6 February 2015 Mr Harvey explained that these adjustments resulted in the raising of a tax debt in favour of the Commonwealth of $104,152,053 for the financial years 2007 to 2010 (as well as a reduction in carried forward losses available for future years of $58,789,443.30). NHA has lodged objections to the amended assessments. In evidence at the sentencing hearing Mr Harvey stated that a draft decision has been prepared denying the objections and upholding the amended assessments. In that event NHA may seek review in either the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court.
	
	
	Leaving aside the possibility that NHA’s applications for review might yield a reduction in the size of the amended assessments, a matter I will return to, it follows that the relevant loss or damage occasioned to the Commonwealth from count 1 is a temporary delay in obtaining a tax debt of $104,152,053. The object of the conspiracy was to claim false tax deductions. False deductions were claimed and as a result no tax debt was raised in favour of the Commonwealth. The false deductions have now been reversed and the Commonwealth now has a tax debt in its favour that it was entitled to at an earlier time. Whether that delay was or will ultimately prove to be productive of an actual loss in revenue was not explored in the evidence.
	
	
	For the sake of completeness it is appropriate to deal with a number of the submissions that were made on this topic. At one point the Crown attempted to quantify the loss occasioned to the Commonwealth by taking into account adjustments beyond the amounts claimed for depreciation expenses under the three assignment agreements and the understatements of income. Ultimately this was corrected in the manner I have outlined.
	
	
	Counsel for the offender contended that in determining the actual loss resulting from the commission of count 1 the Court should bring to account the amounts that are recovered or likely to be recovered by reason of amended assessments issued to the clients of the ANZ that participated in the financing transactions. As the Crown did not elicit those details then it was said to follow that it has failed to discharge its onus of proving that any loss resulted from the offence. I reject that contention.
	
	
	Mr Harvey explained that a series of amended assessments had been issued to ANZ's clients in which reliance had been placed on the anti-avoidance provisions found in Part IVA of the ITAA1936. In respect of one of those clients, Gunns, Mr Harvey stated that an assessment of approximately $12.2 million has been raised, that Gunns has been liquidated and that it is not anticipated that any dividend will be paid. Although details of the other assessments raised were not made available to the Court, Mr Harvey did explain that the invocation of Part IVA was unrelated to the falsity of the deductions claimed by NHA. Instead they concerned the alleged artificiality of the financing transactions even assuming that NHA contributed genuine losses. In these circumstances the receipt of any revenue from the application of Part IVA does not in my view result from the offence and does not offset the assessment of the loss resulting from the offence.
	
	
	Counsel for the offender put a refinement to the above submission. He submitted that, in having applied Part IVA, the Commissioner was obliged to make compensatory adjustments to NHA's assessments to apply the same counter-factual to its circumstances as was applied to ANZ’s clients (see s 177F(3) of the ITAA 1936 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Jackson (1990) 27 FCR 1 at 16 to 18 per Hill J). Counsel submitted that would ensure that a consistent application of the counter-factual scenario was applied to the circumstances of all the taxpayers involved in the same transaction. For example, if Part IVA was applied by raising a counter-factual that treated part of the lease payments as being capital expenditure then, if that was applied to the relevant trust, it would reduce its profitability and ultimately reduce NHA's assessable income from the trust. It was submitted that any proper assessment of the actual loss to the Commonwealth resulting from the offences should be offset by the effect of the application of these compensatory adjustments, or at least reflect an assessment of the likelihood that they will be made either by the Commissioner or on appeal to the Federal Court (or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal). As no information concerning these matters was elicited by the Crown it was submitted that it had not discharged its onus of proof in relation to loss.
	
	
	To this point in time NHA’s argument that there should be compensatory amendments to its returns has not been accepted by the Commissioner. Mr Harvey’s evidence that the draft decision represents the decision that will be made is sufficient to conclude that it is very unlikely that the Commissioner will make any such adjustments. Otherwise the nature of the counter-factuals applied to the ANZ’s clients is not known. It is not clear that, even if they were applied to NHA, they might lead to a reduction in its assessable income. In the end result all this submission amounts to is that there is no more than a possibility that NHA may ultimately succeed in obtaining an amended assessment that reduces its taxable income on account of the so called compensatory adjustments. Without further material it represents no more than a theoretical contingency. It does not affect the assessment I have made that the loss resulting from the commission of count 1 was a temporary loss to the Commonwealth of a tax debt of in excess of $100m.
	
	
	It was also submitted on behalf of the offender that there was a “reduced quantum of potential loss” resulting from count 1 because NHA had available to it in and after financial years 2009 and 2010 further deductions from assignment agreements for the acquisition of other medical technologies that were not the subject of attack by the Crown. I reject this contention. These other agreements were not the subject of attack by the Crown because they were not the subject of any claim for deductions in any tax return. I am not obliged to give them any level of weight in the sentencing process when neither their commerciality or genuineness has been explored or needed to be explored in the trial. NHA did not make any claims for deductions based on these agreements and they were not brought to account in its financial statements.
	
	
	Otherwise I note that a number of other submissions were made by the offender and on behalf of the offender on this topic. They suffered from the principal defect that they were either predicated on an acceptance of the offender's case or sought to reargue it even though it was emphatically rejected by the jury.
	


Count 6


	
	The Crown case on count 6 as accepted by the jury is best explained by reference to two charts which were Crown exhibits S and T. These exhibits identified the receipt between 26 October 2006 and 28 November 2008 of five tranches of funds by NHA from the unit trusts totalling $63,715,000. The exhibits depict the transfer of these funds by NHA to accounts in the United Kingdom and then to accounts in Hong Kong. From that point the bulk of the funds were distributed back to Australia or New Zealand. Some of those funds were used to pay amounts owing to the inventors by Athena, and paying expenses of NHA. However, the bulk of it was utilised for the personal enrichment of the offender, his co-conspirator and another person who had some involvement in the scheme. Six further matters should be noted.
	
	
	First, although the amount distributed from the trusts to NHA was in excess of $68 million the Crown only sought to prove that the conspiracy the subject of count 6 resulted in a dealing in proceeds of crime of $63 million. The discrepancy arises because the sixth tranche of $4,675,000 which was distributed to NHA on or about 24 December 2009 was not addressed by Exhibits S and T or the voluminous other exhibits that demonstrated what was depicted in those charts.
	
	
	Second, the instructions to the jury identified the Crown case as alleging that the amounts standing in the various bank accounts constituted the proceeds of crime being the proceeds of the conspiracy that is count 1. [35]  The basis for that contention has already been explained (see [10]). As part of those instructions the jury were told that if they acquitted the offender on count 1 then they had to acquit him on count 6. The jury were also instructed that, if they did not unanimously find the agreement the subject of count 1 was formed prior to 12 January 2007, then they had to acquit the offender of count 6. The significance of that date was that it was the date of the first movement of funds overseas by NHA being the first of the relevant dealings the subject of the conspiracy charged by count 6. If the agreement the subject of count 1 had not been formed prior to that time then the proceeds of the accounts that were distributed overseas on 12 January 2007 could not have been the proceeds of crime and there could not have been any conspiracy to deal with those monies as proceeds of crime.
	
	
	This aspect of the instructions was favourable to the offender because it was possible for the jury to conclude that he and his co-conspirator entered into the agreement the subject of count 1 some time after 12 January 2007 and from that point conspired to deal with (a lesser amount as) the proceeds of crime. However it was not put to the jury that way principally in order to avoid an already complicated case being further complicated. The end result is that the jury's verdict means that they necessarily accepted that the agreement the subject of count 1 was formed prior to 12 January 2007, that all the funds moved overseas from NHA's account thereafter were the proceeds of crime and that those movements gave effect to the agreement the subject of count 6. Thus it necessarily follows from the jury's verdict that the amount that was dealt with in giving effect to that agreement the subject of count 6 was $63,715,000.
	
	
	Third, during the course of the Crown case the offender admitted that he caused all of the transfers of funds depicted in exhibits S and T to occur. This admission needs to be explained. The accounts in the United Kingdom belonged to Dampier Finance. Dampier Finance was incorporated in Samoa in July 2006 at the instigation of the offender. At the time of its incorporation the offender received assurances that the details of its ownership and control were not available to foreign regulators. The offender was the sole director of Dampier Finance for a number of years. It had an unusual ownership structure in that the owner of the company was the person that had possession from time to time of certain bearer debentures. The offender claimed that his brother, John, held these debentures. John denied that and stated that the control of the company was exercised by the offender. On that topic I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that John Dickson’s evidence should be accepted.
	
	
	The bank accounts in Hong Kong were held by two companies incorporated in Hong Kong in respect of which all the relevant legal indicia of control and ownership rested with John Dickson. However his evidence was that he would act on the direction of the offender. As I have said at least so far as the movement of the relevant funds was concerned that was not in dispute. Further it was not in dispute that instructions were given by the offender using a code and also by his using the pseudonym “Ronnie Wang”. In his evidence the offender stated that these were all security measures designed to avoid persons such as criminal gangs becoming aware of the transfers. This was a specious assertion. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was undertaken in an attempt to avoid scrutiny by tax regulators.
	
	
	Fourth, a significant matter in the course of the events was the falling out between John Dickson and the offender that occurred in early 2010 which was after the first two tax returns for NHA had been filed and around the same time as the ATO's audit was commencing. Subsequently John Dickson provided a number of documents to the Australian Consulate in Hong Kong. It was the receipt of those documents that enabled the ATO to follow the money trail after funds left Australia. Either through that source or through the execution of search warrants or both, the email communications between the offender and John Dickson became available.  In the scheme of what was otherwise a sophisticated tax fraud some of those emails are amateurish in that they suggest blatant dishonesty. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender never envisaged they would become available to Australian regulators.
	
	
	Fifth, one aspect of the sentencing process is to identify the extent to which the offender profited from the offences. The Crown provided a breakdown of the amounts distributed back to the offender or entities associated with him via the scheme already described. It yielded a figure of $19,616,996.37. I accept that figure. It included amounts invested in land purchases and for the purchase of a shopping centre. As noted the jury rejected the offender's claim that these amounts represented amounts invested on behalf of the entity he referred to as HFAC or the receipt by him of his remuneration from Randstone.
	
	
	Sixth, a significant amount of funds was distributed to his co-conspirator. Most of those distributions were documented as loans but in substance they were distributions. The offender participated in the preparation of false documentation which disguised the nature of those distributions.
	


Sentencing factors


	
	The legislative regime that applies to the sentencing of the offender is found in Part IB of the Crimes Act.  Within that part, subsection 16A(1) mandates that the sentence imposed must be “of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”. Section 16A has been held to accommodate a number of common law principles of sentencing including general deterrence, proportionality and totality (see Bui v The Queen [2012] HCA 1 at [18]). Subsection 16A(2) specifies a non-exhaustive list of matters that must be taken into account in determining the appropriate offence. I will deal with those factors said to be relevant to the offender’s circumstances.
	


Count 1: Nature and circumstances of the offence


	
	Subsection 16A(2)(a) requires that consideration be given to the “nature and circumstances of the offence”. I have already described the facts involved in count 1. There are a number of features of the offence and the offender’s conduct that warrant the conclusion that this case falls into the worst category of offences under s 135.4(5).
	
	
	First there is the loss or risk of loss that was intended to be caused to the Commonwealth. I have already found that the extent of the loss or risk of loss that was intended to be caused to the Commonwealth was approximately $135 million. During the course of sentencing submissions the Court was referred to a number of sentences imposed in respect of taxation fraud. None of the decisions to which the Court was referred involved an attempt to defraud the revenue authorities of an amount of that order.
	
	
	Second, there is the level of sophistication and planning involved. This was a well thought out conspiracy. The offender applied his considerable expertise and business acumen in dealing with a large financial institution, inventors of medical technology and professional advisers, as well as documenting the arrangements necessary to implement a very large fraud on the revenue. The formation and implementation of the conspiracy took place over many years. As noted, the jury were satisfied that it was formed prior to 12 January 2007. The offender caused the lodgement of NHA’s amended returns in February 2012 and the conspiracy was still ongoing when the offender was arrested in April 2012. The offender did not simply implement a fraudulent scheme designed to avoid tax on legitimately earned income. Instead he formulated and implemented a plan to obtain an income stream which would only be of value to him if NHA fraudulently claimed deductions.
	
	
	Third, the implementation of the conspiracy involved the use of numerous indicias of deceit, including false identities and concocted documents. For a sustained period the offender deliberately set out to lay a false documentary trail in a number of places to avoid detection and to assist NHA in withstanding scrutiny of its depreciation claims.
	
	
	Fourth, the offender’s role in the conspiracy was extensive (see Savvas v The Queen [1995] HCA 29; 183 CLR 1). The Crown charged the offender with what was described as a closed conspiracy, that is a conspiracy between the offender and his co-conspirator only. The jury were instructed that before they could convict the offender they had to be satisfied of the participation of his co-conspirator in the conspiracy with him. However, even allowing for the fact there were only two conspirators, the offender was the predominant player in the events the subject of count 1. As between him and his co-conspirator it was the offender who possessed a detailed knowledge of the tax system. It was the offender who possessed the professional skills necessary to implement, and did implement, those aspects of the conspiracy that were the vehicle for fraud, namely the incorporation and control of overseas entities, the use of false identities, the drafting of sham commercial agreements, the procuring of bogus valuations and the preparation of tax returns. The co-conspirator was not subordinate to the offender in any hierarchical sense. Nevertheless it was the offender who was the moving force behind the conspiracy that was the subject of count 1.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the fact that the offender’s motivation for the commission of count 1 was greed. I accept that was his motivation, however in determining the relative seriousness of the offence constituted by count 1 and the offender’s conduct, this does not add much. Generally most, if not all frauds upon the revenue, are motivated by a desire for financial gain albeit direct or indirect (see R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222 at [86]) (“Zerafa”)) and this was no different. I note that written submissions placed before this Court on behalf of the offender dispute that he was motivated by greed, but instead by a desire to pursue the medical technologies. This is completely inconsistent with the jury’s verdicts. The jury necessarily accepted the Crown case that the offender and his co-conspirator agreed to perpetrate a tax fraud for their own benefit by agreeing to pretend that NHA was investing in three medical technologies at a level far above the true amounts and diverting funds designed for that purpose to themselves.
	


Count 6: Nature and circumstances of the offence


	
	In R v Ly [2014] NSWCCA 78 at [86] the Court of Criminal Appeal listed a number of matters relevant to sentencing for money laundering offences under the Code, some of which bear upon the nature and seriousness of the offence. They are generally applicable to conspiracies to launder money.
	
	
	A significant factor identified in Ly is the amount that was the subject of the conspiracy (Ly at [86]; R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [34]). In this case it was $63,715,000. On any view that is an extremely large sum. As was the case with count 1, none of the cases brought to the Court’s attention involved a dealing with an amount of that size.
	
	
	A further factor is the number of transactions and the period over which they occurred (Ly at [86] and [87]). Exhibits S and T depict over 110 transactions orchestrated by the offender. He directed the movement of funds overseas and then back to this country. He did so via the use of accounts in overseas jurisdictions owned by companies that he secretly controlled, the use of false identities and codes and, in some cases, disguising the nature of the distributions as loans or investments. As noted, of the amount that was dealt with, he received $19.6 million. Otherwise the second and fourth matters noted above in relation to count 1 apply equally to his conduct in relation to count 6.
	
	
	Against this the money laundering offences are “not only concerned with the source of the money or property dealt with, but also [their] ultimate use”. They extend to “money obtained illegally or to be used for illegal purposes or dealt with in a manner that is illegal” (Ly at [86]). In this case there is no suggestion that the offender and his co-conspirator contemplated using the funds for any illegal purposes.
	
	
	The circumstances of count 6 and the offender’s conduct warrant a conclusion that this case represents a very serious example of an offence under s 11.5(1) in so far as it incorporates s 400.3(1).
	


Course of conduct


	
	Subsection 16A(2)(c) requires the Court to consider whether the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character. The Crown submitted that this factor was relevant in this case. I do not agree. In implementing the conspiracies the subject of counts 1 and 6 a number of separate acts of dishonesty were undertaken which may answer the description of “criminal acts”, although they were not identified with any precision. However the formation and adherence to the conspiracies the subject of counts 1 and 6 did not form “part” of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts. Instead those acts were the implementation of those conspiracies. There is a danger of sentencing the offender for offences for which he was not convicted if he is punished for any separate acts of dishonesty that he committed in implementing the conspiracy the subject of counts 1 and 6.
	


Loss or damage


	
	As noted, subsection 16A(2)(c) requires the Court to consider “any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence”. I have already addressed this in relation to count 1, and the Crown did not contend that this factor was engaged in respect of count 6.
	


Co-operation with law enforcement agencies


	
	Subsection 16A(2)(h) requires the Court to consider the “degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies” in investigating the offences. On behalf of the offender it was submitted that he co-operated with the ATO by providing material, and he offered to meet with Mr Harvey during the audit yet Mr Harvey declined. This submission overlooks the fact that the jury’s verdict reflects an acceptance that the offender submitted false and misleading material to the ATO to support the false depreciation claims in NHA’s tax returns. I do not accept that the offender assisted the authorities with their investigations.
	


Personal deterrence, antecedents and prospects of rehabilitation


	
	Subsection 16A(2)(j) requires the Court to consider the “deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have” on the offender. Subsection 16A(2)(m) requires the Court to consider the “character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition” of the offender, and subsection 16A(2)(n) requires the Court to consider the offender’s prospect of rehabilitation. These factors can be conveniently considered together.
	
	
	The offender is now fifty years of age. He has no previous convictions. He has achieved academic qualifications at a high level and amassed considerable professional experience especially in the areas of tax and finance. He graduated from the University of New South Wales with degrees in accountancy and law. After graduating he completed Price Waterhouse’s professional year programme. He was admitted as a member of the Institute of Accountants and later became a fellow. During the 1990s he worked in succession for St George Bank, Westpac and the National Australia Bank. In 2000 he commenced as a principal at the firm of accountants, Ernst & Young. He ceased in 2004. Around that time he became a Director of Admiralty Resources NL which was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
	
	
	There is no doubt that prior to the commission of count 1 and count 6 the offender was of good character. The jury were instructed accordingly. It is a factor to be considered as part of the “instinctive synthesis” of the sentencing process (Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [74] to [76]) (“Wong”). However, with so called “white collar” criminal activity such as corporate malfeasance, sustained tax fraud and money laundering, prior good character is treated as being of less significance than might otherwise be the case (R v Williams (2005) 152 A Crim R 548 at [60]; R v Huang; R v Siu at [36]). The offender’s qualifications, experiences and good standing provided him with the opportunity to commit the offences for which he was convicted.
	
	
	An assessment of an offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and the necessity for personal deterrence is often difficult in the case of an offender who has resolutely denied any wrongdoing. The Crown submitted that the “degree of subterfuge” involved in these offences gives reason to pause before forming a positive conclusion about his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	During the course of sentencing submissions the offender’s Counsel provided to the Court a forty-five page document written by the offender entitled “Mr Dickson’s submissions on sentence”. Large parts of those submissions sought to reargue the case put by the offender to the jury which they rejected. In that part of the submissions that addressed personal deterrence the offender repeated his bitter complaints about the actions of the ATO and the prosecuting authorities in laying charges. In that part of the submissions that addressed his prospects of rehabilitation, the offender stated “Mr Dickson has learned that he should avoid doing business in Australia”. These contentions do not assist the offender in obtaining a favourable assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and the absence of a need for personal deterrence.
	
	
	Nevertheless I will proceed on the basis that the prospects of the offender committing an offence of a remotely similar nature in the future are very low. It is inevitable that a substantial custodial sentence will be imposed. The offender realises that his professional career and reputation are destroyed, although he wrongly blames the actions of others rather than himself. The likelihood that upon his release the offender will be in a significant position of trust seems low. However, even if he is, he is highly intelligent and I expect the scars of this prosecution and imprisonment will operate upon his decision-making processes.
	


Hardship to the offender’s family


	
	Subsection 16A(2)(p) requires the Court to consider the probable effect that any sentence or order will have on the offender’s family or dependents. During the trial the Court heard that the offender has two older children from his first marriage. The offender’s second wife is from Slovakia although they lived together in Australia. They were married in Bratislava in 2004. Their daughter was born in May 2010. In his evidence at the trial the offender stated that, after he was charged, his wife returned to Slovakia with their daughter.
	
	
	During sentencing submissions Counsel for the offender stated that, shortly after the verdict, the offender was served with divorce papers issued by a Slovakian Court. It was also stated that the offender was now engaged to an overseas resident whose application for a spouse visa is in jeopardy because of his convictions. It was also stated that the applicant’s elderly mother was suffering financial hardship because she had sold her house to fund the offender’s legal fees and she will otherwise not have the assistance of the offender. The Crown accepted those matters and I will act on them.
	
	
	Based on this brief description, I accept that the offender’s incarceration will cause hardship to his children and his fiancé. Although the children of his first marriage are now adults, the absence of their father and the knowledge that he is imprisoned can be expected to be painful indeed. More importantly it seems very likely that his youngest daughter will never see her father during her formative years and may never see him thereafter. I also accept that the offender’s elderly mother will not have his assistance, although I note that she has two other adult sons and an adult daughter.
	
	
	If subsection 16A(2)(p) was to be applied according to its terms, these adverse effects would be considered as part of the instinctive synthesis. However, as the Crown pointed out, I am bound by authority to construe the section as though it was preceded by the words “in an exceptional case” (R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286 at [31] per Howie J; Zerafa at [119ff]). The adverse effects that have been identified do not meet that threshold.
	


Comparable cases


	
	Subject to so much of Part IB of the Crimes Act, which picks up aspects of different state and territorial laws, one of its objects is to achieve consistency in sentencing for federal offences. Such consistency is to be achieved by the application of the statutory regime and in the application of legal principles. However it is not demonstrated by and nor does it require numerical consistency (Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [47] to [49]) (“Hili”). In pursuit of consistency I am obliged to have regard to sentences that have been imposed in other cases but such comparisons have their limit (Hili at [53]). Such sentences can “stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence” (Hili at [54] citing Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [304]). Critically it is important to identify the “unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal” (Wong at [47]; Hili at [55]).
	
	
	The Court was provided with a number of sentencing judgments of higher courts in respect of revenue fraud and money laundering offences. In accordance with the principles stated in Hili I have reviewed each of those decisions. That review bears out the statement in Wong as to the underlying significance of the unifying principles many of which have already been addressed.
	
	
	Thus, in relation to revenue fraud, the relevant factors that emerge are the extent of the intended loss, the actual loss, the level of sophistication of the fraudulent scheme, its duration and the role of the offender. The decisions also reveal the significance of the maximum sentence in that a comparable statutory predecessor to s 135.4(5), namely former s 29D of the Crimes Act had a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment (Liles v R (Cth) [2014] NSWCCA 289; R v Dunn (No 9) [2014] WASC 61 (“Dunn”); R v Cox [2013] QCA 10; R v Agius [2012] NSWSC 978; O’Meara v R [2009] NSWCCA 90; Ridley v R [2008] NSWCCA 324; Robertson v R [2007] NSWCCA 270; El-Chaar v R [2007] NSWCCA 16; R v Ronen [2006] NSWCCA 123). In relation to money laundering the factors include the amount that was dealt with, the number of transactions, the intended use of the funds, the methods applied and the role of the offender (Chen v R [2010] NSWCCA 224; Chen v R [2009] NSWCCA 66, “Chen”; Ansari; Ly).
	
	
	I will mention the circumstances of two of the cases to which I was referred in which the offending has some similarities to this case. In R v Dunn [No 9] [2014] WASC 61 (“Dunn No 9”) an offender was sentenced after trial to a term of imprisonment of seven years with a non-parole period of four years for an offence under s 135.4(3) of the Code. The maximum penalty was ten years imprisonment. The offender was the principal in devising and implementing a scheme to offset tax payable by claiming false tax deductions. Similarly to this case E.M. Heenan J found that the purpose and object of the conspiracy was to inflict a loss of $7.2 million but that was not achieved by reason of the detection of the conspiracy (Dunn No 9 at [47]). This offender compares unfavourably to the offender in Dunn No 9. The intention of his conspiracy was to inflict a far higher amount of loss and his scheme was far more sophisticated.
	
	
	In Chen the appellant was convicted of a conspiracy under s 11.5(1) and 400.3(2) of the Code for which the maximum penalty was 12 years imprisonment. The offender pleaded guilty to conspiring to deal with $20 million of funds obtained from a $150 million fraud on a superannuation fund. The conspiracy was frustrated and no funds were lost through its implementation (Chen at [7]). After allowing a 25% discount for his plea of guilty he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three years. The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected the contention that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It found that the offence was “well above … the middle range of seriousness” for such an offence. Again the offender's position compares unfavourably to the offender in Chen. The maximum penalty in this case is higher, he did not plead guilty, the amount agreed to be laundered was much larger, it involved far more transactions and was a more sophisticated scheme.
	
	
	Although I have referred to these cases in some detail I have not attributed to them any particular weight beyond that which Hili directs.
	


Totality and Cumulation


	
	One issue that arises in relation to this matter is whether the sentences for each offence should be concurrent and, if so, to what extent. A number of decisions have expressed concern over the sentencing of offenders for both a predicate and money laundering offence especially where the criminality involved in the money laundering offence is encompassed by the predicate offence (Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; 198 A Crim R 135 at [27] to [31] (“Thorn”); Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; 77 NSWLR 463 at [15] to [16]; Schembri v R [2010] NSWCCA 149 at [11] to [16]; and Redfern v R [2012] NSWCCA 178; 228 A Crim R 56 at [17]).
	
	
	In R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 1068 I rejected an application for a stay of count 6 that was made on the analogous basis that it was an abuse of process because there was no criminality separately charged by that count. While I accepted that there was some overlap between the two offences, I found that the elements of count 6 were separate and distinct from count 1 and that “significant further criminality” was alleged in relation to count 6 (at [26] to [29]). Having had the benefit of hearing the evidence at the trial I adhere to those findings.
	
	
	The overlap between the two counts was to be found in the fact that, with count 6, the funds the subject of the agreement to deal were derived from count 1. However the separate elements and the further criminality were the numerous dealings with those funds depicted in Exhibits S and T, and the disguise involved in the round robin transfer of funds received by NHA out of Australia and their repatriation. The tax fraud perpetrated on the Commonwealth could have been attempted without any of those dealings having occurred.
	
	
	The submissions of the offender referred to the observation of Howie J in Thorn at [27] to the effect that the relevant criminality was in the obtaining of funds by a fraudster and “not in their use”. However in Thorn the relevant dealing was the receipt of the proceeds of fraud by a company that had made false GST returns and their subsequent withdrawal by the offender from an automatic telling machine and transfer to his personal account (Thorn at [6]). There is no relevant analogy between the dealings in Thorn and the circumstances of count 6.
	
	
	The analysis to this point suggests that a significant degree of cumulation in the two sentences is warranted. However this stage of the sentencing process not only involves “questions of cumulation or concurrency” but “as well … totality” (Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45]). Thus care needs to be taken in imposing a penalty for each offence and structuring the overall sentence to ensure that the combined effect of all the sentences reflects the total criminality of the offender's conduct (see Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] per Howie J). In this case I consider that is best achieved by making the sentences for the two offences mostly concurrent lest they otherwise have a crushing effect on the offender.
	


Sentences


	
	In Milne v R [2012] NSWCCA 24 (“Milne”) at [297] the Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised the need for sentences in cases of serious revenue fraud to reflect “denunciation, general and personal deterrence”. Those tempted to engage in large scale tax fraud constitute a class of offenders who are inherently likely to be swayed from offending by the prospect of prosecution and incarceration for a substantial period of time.
	
	
	Otherwise the authorities binding on this Court require the imposition of substantial custodial sentences for large scale tax fraud of the kind attempted to be perpetrated in this case (Hili at [63]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Hamman (unreported, 1 December 1998); R v O'Connor [2002] NSWCCA 156; Milne id). Thus, in Milne at [297] the Court of Criminal Appeal stated:
	


“There is a high community expectation that serious tax fraud will be properly punished and offenders, no matter their business acumen and high status in the commercial world, will be dealt with sternly and appropriately.”


	
	These observations apply with all their force to the offender. Having regard to its size, scale, timespan and tactics his offending falls into the worst category of cases under s 135.4(5).
	
	
	I have already referred to the principles governing the imposition of sentences for money laundering. The maximum penalty of 25 years for an offence under s 11.5(1) and s 400.3(1) represents an emphatic statement by the legislature of the seriousness with which such offences must be treated. As stated, count 6 represents a very serious example of this offence.
	
	
	One can have sympathy for the position of the offender. He finds himself broke, professionally ruined and incarcerated. He was a person who had much to lose and he has now lost it. The consequences for him and his family are severe. However his situation is not a product of circumstances but of a conscious decision on his part to pursue a dishonest and fraudulent tax scheme on a large scale. He engaged in the conduct the subject of the offences while holding an unshakeable belief in his intellectual superiority to all those around him and the ATO. It was his undoing.
	
	
	As the offender was taken into custody on 22 December 2014 it follows that his first custodial sentence should commence from that date.
	
	
	Having regard to the scale of criminality involved in each offence I am satisfied that no sentence other than a full time custodial sentence for each offence is appropriate in this case (Crimes Act, s 17A(1) and (2)).
	
	
	Anthony James Dickson, for committing count 1 on the indictment, being an offence contrary to s 135.4(5) of the Code, you are sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and six months commencing 22 December 2014 and expiring on 22 June 2022.
	
	
	Anthony James Dickson, for committing count 6 on the indictment, being an offence contrary to s 11.5(1) of the Code, you are sentenced to imprisonment for nine years commencing 22 December 2016 and expiring on 21 December 2025.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act I fix a single non-parole period of seven years expiring 21 December 2021.
	
	
	Mr Dickson I am required by s 16F of the Crimes Act to explain to you the sentences I have imposed. I have ordered that you be imprisoned for an aggregate period of 11 years commencing 22 December 2014 and expiring 21 December 2025.  I have fixed a non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment, which will expire on 21 December 2021. That means that you will be imprisoned for not less than 7 years. If you are granted parole at the end of that time, or before the expiration of the aggregate sentence, you will serve the balance of the sentence in the community. If you are granted parole, the order will be subject to conditions determined by the relevant parole authority, and may be amended or revoked. If you fail, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the conditions of your parole, your parole may be revoked and you may be taken back into custody.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: On 18 March 2014 the applicant pleaded guilty to four counts on two indictments and was sentenced by his Honour Charteris DCJ in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 24 April 2014 to an aggregate sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 4 months as follows:
	



	
	On a count of being armed with an offensive weapon he did assault with intent to rob, to an indicative sentence (taking into account two offences on a Form 1) of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 8 months. This is an offence contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	On a count of steal a motor vehicle, to an indicative sentence of imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months with a non-parole period of 14 months. This is an offence contrary to ss 117 and 154(1) (a) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.
	
	
	On a count of discharging a firearm in a public place, to an indicative sentence (taking into account an offence on a Form 1) of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. This is an offence contrary to s 93G (1) (b) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	On a count of possess prohibited pistol, to an indicative sentence of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months. This is an offence contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	



	
	The applicant was on parole at the time of the offences and his parole was revoked upon his arrest on 1 September 2011. The sentence imposed by his Honour was to commence on 1 September 2012.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court upon two grounds as follows:
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge did not make sufficient allowance for the applicant’s assistance to authorities.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence and the indicative sentences were manifestly excessive.
	


Background


	
	On 4 August 2011 the applicant was contacted by an associate about committing a bank robbery at Mascot. The next day he met the associate and two co-offenders at Arncliffe. He was told that a Nissan Skyline had been stolen. The men travelled in two cars to Mascot. The applicant and one co-offender travelled in a car which the applicant had rented. The other men travelled in the stolen car. All the men then travelled in the stolen Nissan Skyline to the vicinity of the National Australia Bank at Mascot. The applicant and two of his co-offenders entered the bank, wearing gloves and hooded jumpers covering their faces. One co-offender was armed with a broomstick and the applicant was armed with a knife.
	
	
	The bank staff activated security screens. The robbers attempted unsuccessfully to force the roof panels and a door to get around the security screens. The men abandoned the robbery and ran to the Nissan Skyline. However, the vehicle stalled and could not be restarted.
	
	
	At that time Ms Ikramova was driving out of the bank car park in her BMW sedan with her male partner. The applicant ran to the driver’s door and told her to get out of the car. The applicant then commandeered the car and drove it to the location of the hired vehicle. He abandoned the BMW but kept the keys.
	
	
	On Friday 26 August 2011 the applicant hired a black Audi sedan. Three days later he drove it with an associate to Bankstown, intending to meet another associate. He armed himself with a Smith and Wesson .38 calibre pistol as a precaution. While he was waiting in the car he saw a silver Toyota RAV 4 occupied by five men drive past. Then he saw a black Toyota Aurion also containing five men drive past. The applicant saw the men pull hoods over their faces.
	
	
	The applicant drove to the house of another associate at Greenacre. The associate told him that there were a number of men looking for him to kill him. The applicant drove from the premises and passed the RAV 4 and the Toyota Aurion. The applicant heard gunshots. He pointed his pistol out the driver’s window and fired five rounds into the air. The RAV 4 and the Toyota followed the applicant, and witnesses observed the occupants of those vehicles firing at the applicant’s car.
	
	
	The applicant managed to lose the vehicles which were pursuing him. He stopped at a hotel in Tempe. The Audi suffered significant damage including bullet holes in the front and rear windows, boot and front passenger head rest.
	
	
	Police identified the applicant as the driver of the Audi. During a search of the vehicle a silver .38 revolver was located with five unspent and one spent round in it.
	
	
	The applicant was interviewed and made admissions. He said that he had trouble with “these guys” in the past and they beat him up for money and blamed him for a shooting at their parents’ place. He told the police that there was a 9mm Beretta pistol in a bag in the back of the vehicle. Police subsequently located the Beretta. They also located an empty magazine and a number of spent .38 rounds in the vehicle.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant was 35 years old at the time of the offences. He had an extensive criminal record. In 2006 he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for possessing an unauthorised pistol. In 2008 he was sentenced for three armed robberies and received an overall sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. He was on parole at the time of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant is married but separated from his wife. He has two children.
	
	
	There was evidence before his Honour of the applicant’s assistance to authorities, consisting of two documents tendered in the sentencing proceedings and apparently placed in a sealed envelope that became exhibit F. The applicant’s legal representatives do not have a copy of these documents (as is the usual practice) but apparently understand that the assistance was “extensive”. Exhibit F was not produced for examination in this Court. Nor was the applicant’s signed witness statement that was tendered below indicating the evidence that he would be prepared to give in court if necessary. That statement was exhibit E on the sentence proceedings. Also tendered in evidence below was an e-mail from an analyst from the Crime Commission who observed that at least two people attended the sentence proceedings who were close associates of several of his enemies.
	
	
	In addition, a letter dated 23 August 2013 was tendered from Martin Sinclair, an assistant Superintendent in the Department of Corrective Services. He noted that the applicant was at the time of writing his letter in protection and that because of the “number and nature of previous and current placement (alerts) recorded on the Department’s data base [he] would suggest that the inmate would remain on some form of Protection Order for the full time of his imprisonment in NSW”.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	His Honour allowed a combined discount on sentence of 30 percent for the pleas of guilty and the applicant’s assistance to authorities. His Honour indicated that the discount for the pleas of guilty standing alone “should be more than 10 percent.”
	
	
	His Honour said this at page 11 of his remarks on sentence:
	


“I have already commented upon exhibit F. I have allowed the offender a discount for his early plea of guilty and his co-operation with authorities as reflected in exhibit F.”


	
	Although nothing appears to turn upon it, his Honour did not refer elsewhere in his remarks to exhibit F. Presumably his Honour was directing his comment to what had been discussed during the sentencing proceedings. Be that as it may, exhibit F was not provided to this Court and its precise contents remain unknown.
	


Evidence


	
	In this Court there was reference to exhibit F in the Crown’s submissions. The applicant appears in this Court to have accepted that what appears in pars [36] and [37] of the Crown’s submissions is both a fair reference to what exhibit F contained and to the contents of the Crime Commission’s letter that was also provided to his Honour. Those paragraphs are as follows:
	


“[36] Secondly, it is by no means clear that the applicant’s assistance was ‘of a very high order’. Exhibit F contained an affidavit of assistance from police and a letter from the NSW Crime Commission. The affidavit of assistance discloses the applicant provided information which led to police arresting an offender for offences relating to the supply of explosives. The applicant did not make a statement or agree to give evidence against the offender. Police did not suggest the applicant’s safety was in jeopardy as a result of providing the information. However the Crime Commission stated the applicant placed himself at ‘considerable risk assessed as moderate to high.’ Nevertheless the Crown accepts the applicant’s information resulted in 46 Powergel explosives being seized by police.

[37] The Crime Commission also provided a letter of assistance for the applicant. The Commission stated that the applicant provided information concerning three murder investigations which was assessed as ‘medium intelligence’ and found to be consistent with other information in their possession. No arrests have been made. The applicant also provided information in relation to seven shootings and a firebombing. The information for these matters was assessed as being of ‘medium intelligence’ value. The applicant also provided information in relation to the drug activities of more than ten persons. No arrests or seizures of drugs were made.”


	
	It would also appear to be the case that the Crime Commission found the applicant’s information to be accurate and of low to medium intelligence value. The Commission accepted that the applicant’s provision of information placed his family at some risk which was assessed as being low to medium. The Commission also referred to the matters mentioned in the affidavit of assistance provided by the police.
	
	
	His Honour also received the benefit of a statement from the applicant indicating the evidence that he would be prepared to give against his co-offenders. That statement became exhibit E but as noted earlier it was not reproduced for consideration in this Court.
	
	
	Exhibit D in the sentence proceedings was a letter from Superintendent Sinclair dated 23 August 2013. That letter is in the following relevant terms:
	


“In response to your correspondence of 20 August 2013 I am able to provide the following response.

Inmate [T] is currently housed in a ‘protected’ custodial setting due to his prior agreement to provide the Crown with assistance in evidential matters previously and/or currently before the Courts. Whilst it is understood that the Crown did not proceed to exercise [T’s] assistance the writer has no doubt that his initial undertaking will continue to place the inmate at considerable risk of retribution in some serious form should he later be placed in a general prison population setting.

Should inmate [T] be subject to any future moves within the NSW Corrections Service a review of his ‘at-risk’ status (in every case) would be conducted and given the number and nature of previous and current Placement (threat) Alerts recorded on the Department’s data base the writer would suggest that the inmate would remain on some form of Protection Order for the full term of his imprisonment in NSW.

Please note that all prisoners in NSW Correctional facilities may request protection should they feel concerned for their personal safety. This can allow for the inmate’s integration with other ‘protected’ inmates (SMAP), limited integration (PRLA) or, if considered warranted the total isolation of the prisoner from all other inmates (PRNA).

The imposition of any of those levels of protected status may at any time be actioned by the Department should it be felt necessary to do so and in all cases (either requested or imposed) the Order is subject to ongoing review by senior management.”

Ground 1


	
	The applicant contended that the assistance that he provided was on any view of a very high order. It was said to involve not only the giving of information to police but also a preparedness to give evidence. It was said to be associated with the likelihood that the applicant would be subjected to the possibility at least of harsher custodial conditions as a consequence. The applicant submitted that having regard to authority and the circumstances of this case the combined discount of 30 percent for his plea and his assistance was too low.
	
	
	It is clear that the provision of assistance to authorities does not lead a person who does so automatically or in all cases to suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence. That has been recognised in cases such as R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299; 58 NSWLR 581, R v Mostyn (2004) [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304 and R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; 172 A Crim R 151. In SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249, Howie J said at [3] that combined discount should not normally exceed 50 percent:
	


“[3] …I should indicate that having reconsidered the matter I do not recant from my view that in general a combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance should be given and that such a discount should not normally exceed 50 per cent.”


	
	Later, in Z v R [2014] NSWCCA 323 this Court, by majority, allowed a combined discount of 50 percent. In assessing that discount McCallum J at [21] recorded the things that influenced the trial judge as follows:
	


“[21] The applicant's assistance to authorities was evidenced by exhibits C, D and E. For obvious reasons, the sentencing judge did not expose the contents of those documents except to record that police regarded the assistance to be ‘of the highest quality and usefulness’. The judge considered that the Crown had correctly conceded that to be the case. His Honour recorded the real prospect of considerable danger to the applicant's life and those of his loved ones which ‘will never disappear’. He noted that, in all probability, the applicant would have to be relocated overseas and that members of his family had already been relocated. His Honour also noted that, as a result of his assistance, the applicant will spend his time in custody in isolation and that, as a result of the relocation of his family, he receives few visits and is extremely lonely.”


	
	The Crown sought in this appeal to distinguish that case as factually very different and submitted that the overall discount of 30 percent was appropriate.
	
	
	Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides as follows:
	


“23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities

(1)    A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2)   In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(b)    the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c)    the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d)    the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e)    the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f)    any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g)    whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h)    any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i)    whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence.

(3)    A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4)   …”


	
	McCallum J usefully referred to the applicable authorities in Z v R at [22] – [34]. The principles in summary are these:
	



	
	The discount for assistance must be considered having regard to s 23 of the Act.
	
	
	The combined discount should not normally exceed 50 percent.
	
	
	There is no algorithmic approach to the application of a discount.
	
	
	The sentence should not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
	



	
	The applicant must demonstrate that his Honour acted upon a wrong principle or otherwise offended one or other of the combination of imperatives famously collected by the High Court in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. The applicant did not, however, seek to demonstrate that his Honour did so in specific or detailed terms. One of the obvious and understandable reasons for that may well lie in the fact that none is readily apparent. Indeed, his Honour appears far from misapprehending the facts or taking irrelevant matters into account to have considered the issue in some detail, accurately and at length.
	
	
	I accept in this case that there is a prospect the applicant will experience difficulties in gaol as a known informer beyond those of the normal prison population. I accept that the assistance provided by the applicant and the dangers and risks to which the provision of that assistance will have exposed him were potentially considerable. The fact that Superintendent Sinclair provided his letter dated 23 August 2013 to his Honour supports those conclusions. His Honour had the benefit of exhibit D in that regard and presumably took it into account.
	
	
	However, I can discern no error in his Honour’s approach to the choice of a proper discount to reflect either these concerns or the corresponding benefit to the administration of justice afforded by the assistance. It follows that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 2


	
	The applicant conceded that disposition of the first ground of appeal would also dispose of the appeal. The applicant only sought to support this ground by reference to Judicial Commission statistics. It is unnecessary to restate why such statistics are of limited utility in appeals of this type.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.
	


An observation


	
	It should be noted that this Court was provided with an affidavit by a solicitor from the Director’s office that put in issue the fact that the applicant had provided the assistance that his Honour would appear to some extent to have taken into account in his sentences. The affidavit was sworn on 26 February 2015 and in summary deposes to the fact that the applicant’s failure or refusal to give evidence by way of assistance to the prosecution at a series of Local Court prosecutions in 2012 led to the withdrawal and dismissal of the charges against the defendants. Clearly enough, these things took place well before the applicant was sentenced but they were never brought to the attention of his Honour. There was no explanation of why that was so. The applicant through his senior counsel in this Court denied that the matters deposed to were true, but neither he nor the deponent was tested and the matter remained unresolved. It seems to me that the content and timing of the provision of the affidavit are both curious. However, for the purposes of this appeal I have entirely disregarded the affidavit.
	
	
	Also in addition to the material before the sentencing judge, this Court was provided with two letters. The first is a letter from Commander Nick Bingham from the Polaris Task Force and Detective Senior Constable Trent Wood dated 18 February 2015 and the second is a letter from Assistant Commissioner Singleton from the Crime Commission dated 26 February 2015. It will be apparent from the date of these letters and from the fact that they are addressed to this Court that they were not available to his Honour, even if some of the matters to which they refer were. For reasons that will be apparent, I also propose to disregard the matters referred to in those letters.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Harrison J.

		20 March 2015",2015-03-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703746,EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA:  The reasons given by Schmidt J, and the supplementary remarks of Simpson J, reflect the substance of my reasons for joining in the orders made by the Court on 13 March 2015.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I joined in the orders made on 13 March 2015 substantially for the reasons given by Schmidt J. I wish only to add briefly to those reasons.
	
	
	Although the applicant was legally represented in the District Court, he initially was unrepresented in this Court. (At the instigation of this Court, a grant of legal aid was made and counsel who had previously advised him appeared at very short notice and was of considerable assistance to the Court.)
	
	
	The only ground of appeal notified (whether by the appellant or on his behalf is not clear) was expressed as “sentence manifestly excessive”.
	
	
	The ground so expressed is an assertion of error of one - the last - of the categories of error identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. It is, as Schmidt J has pointed out, an assertion that the sentence is “unreasonable or plainly unjust”.
	
	
	That a sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust is not the only basis on which a sentence may be found to represent an erroneous exercise of the sentencing discretion. The judgment in House envisages error of a number of kinds:
	



	
	that the judge acted upon a wrong principle;
	
	
	that the judge allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him or her;
	
	
	that the judge mistook the facts;
	
	
	that the judge failed to take into account some material consideration;
	
	
	finally, that the judge imposed a sentence that was unreasonable or plainly unjust (for reasons that may not be able to discerned).
	



	
	In my opinion, it has not been shown that a sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 6 months in respect of a course of drug dealing was unreasonable or plainly unjust. The error demonstrated was not of the last kind mentioned in House.
	
	
	The error, as pointed out by Schmidt J, fell into the fourth House category. It was failure to take into account a material consideration. The material consideration was the availability of sentencing options alternative to full-time custody.
	
	
	In this respect, his Honour was not adequately assisted by the applicant’s legal representative. It seems to have been assumed by all concerned that, because the offence was of drug dealing “to a substantial degree”, non-custodial options were not available.
	
	
	I was a party to the decision of this Court in R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104, in which Howie J reviewed a number of decisions to the effect that:
	


“27 … unless there are truly exceptional circumstances present, a full-time custodial sentence ought to be imposed wherever the offender has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs …”

Decisions to that effect are legion; one of those is R v Clark (NSWCCA, 15 March 1990, unreported). Nothing in any of those decisions obviates the need for sentencing judges to consider the circumstances of each case individually, including the availability (in a practical sense) of alternatives to full-time custody. The starting point of this exercise is s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), which forbids a court sentencing an offender to impose a term of imprisonment unless satisfied, after consideration of all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. See the discussion in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [46]-[57] (specifically concerning sentencing of federal offences, but equally applicable to sentencing under the Sentencing Procedure Act).


	
	In R v Cacciola (1988) 104 A Crim R 178, accepting that the proposition that drug dealing “to a substantial degree” calls for the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, is a “policy” or even “a continuing rule”, Priestley JA said:
	


“… the fact remains that what has been said in Clarke [sic] is something that this Court continues to consider is the proper approach to sentencing, always bearing in mind the need to consider every convicted person’s case on its own merits and in its own circumstances.” (italics added)

A little later, his Honour said:

“Speaking of policy I reiterate what I mentioned before that the sentencing rule which emerges from Clarke [sic] and later cases is a continuing rule, a rule in the sense that it must be taken into account and given serious consideration by sentencing judges on every occasion when there is a case of this kind, although the sentencing judge must, in the end, always exercise his or her own discretion, but the sentencing policy or rule is not to be neglected and put out of sight, nor should there be excessively liberal interpretation of the phrase ‘exceptional circumstances’.” (italics added)


	
	I further observe that, at the time these statements of “policy” or “rule” were made, the option of an intensive correction order did not exist. That was introduced into the Sentencing Procedure Act with operation from 1 October 2010: Crimes (Sentencing Legislation) Amendment (Intensive Correction Orders) Act 2010 (NSW).
	
	
	It is not only sentencing judges who must give consideration, not only to the “policy” or “rule”, but also the legal representatives of persons charged with criminal offences. Generally speaking, offenders are bound by the conduct of their proceedings by their counsel: see, for example, Lambert v R [2015] NSWCCA 22. Failure to consider, and bring to the attention of the sentencing judge, an optional alternative to full-time imprisonment may be the cause of injustice.
	
	
	The transcript of the sentencing proceeding shows that no reference was made to any alternative to a sentence of imprisonment, including an order that a sentence be served in the community by way of an intensive correction order: see Sentencing Procedure Act, s 7.
	
	
	The Notice of Application for leave to appeal filed for the applicant did not plead error of the kind that has been found to have been established. Having regard to his unrepresented status, I would accept a notional amendment to the Notice.
	
	
	For these reasons I joined in the orders made.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: On 8 April 2014, Blanch CJDC sentenced EF to a total term of imprisonment of 2 years with a non-parole period of 6 months, for one count of supplying methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and one count of dealing with the proceeds of crime ($1,074.10) under s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), to which he had entered pleas of guilty. He served his sentence until 4 June, when he was granted appeal bail.
	
	
	EF sought leave to appeal his sentence, on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. He was unrepresented until the hearing of the appeal. In its written submissions the Crown had objected to some of his submissions as being, in truth, evidence as to matters irrelevant to the appeal. At the hearing documents which raised similar matters were tendered without objection and the Crown led evidence as to EF’s post sentencing assistance. All that material was accepted as being relevant on his resentencing.
	
	
	Having heard the parties, leave to appeal was granted, the appeal upheld and EF was resentenced, with reasons for the conclusions reached to be given.
	


The facts


	
	The facts were agreed at trial. EF was arrested on 11 July 2013, when stopped by police for a random breath test. On search, cash and a plastic bag containing orange coloured crystals were found, as well as seven small resealable plastic deal bags which also contained traces of crystals. On examination the bags were found to contain methylamphetamine totalling 8.7 grams at 15% purity.
	
	
	EF gave short evidence on sentencing. He was aged 36 at the time of the arrest and 37 on sentence. He had been the manager of a cotton farm, where he lived. He began using methylamphetamine to keep awake while working 18 hour days. The property burnt down and he and his partner lost all of their possessions and he ended up out of work, when the owners engaged contract workers for whom they did not have to provide accommodation. He later received an insurance payout.
	
	
	EF was selling ice for $100 a gram and methylamphetamine for $300 a gram. He gave evidence that he had bought a 28.3 gram block of methylamphetamine for $3,500 and that he had mainly been selling drugs to support his habit and so that he and his partner could eat. He also described the help his partner had required during her pregnancy, while she had been unwell. He had recently obtained employment with an Aboriginal Corporation.
	


The sentencing remarks


	
	Blanch CJDC noted that:
	


“Prison sentences are almost inevitable when people deal in drugs for profit and that is frankly acknowledged by Mr Curtis realistically in this case. But the material produced on behalf of the offender is compelling and, in my view, justifies imposing a prison sentence at the low end of the scale.”


	
	This conclusion rested on findings that EF’s offending behaviour had significantly related to his own drug use and that he had a prior criminal record. He had a juvenile record of offending which had been dealt with by way of bonds, an adult record for minor matters and driving matters, as well as a suspended sentence for assault in 2002. There were no drug offences before 2013. This was to be his first custodial sentence.
	
	
	His Honour accepted EF’s’ account that he had worked long hours, had begun taking amphetamines, became addicted and then progressed to dealing in drugs. There had also been a marriage breakdown. He had pursued Family Court proceedings to obtain access to his children. He was then in a new relationship and had had another child the day before the sentencing hearing. His partner was present in Court to support him. He was then still in employment, having been granted bail.
	
	
	His Honour noted a psychiatric report which revealed EF had been diagnosed with ADHD, for which he was receiving treatment. There was also in evidence a letter from EF’s partner’s treating doctor, explaining her two highly complicated pregnancies, while under his care.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that EF had “really quite good prospects for rehabilitation”. He was working and had settled down with a supportive partner. He found special circumstances, given that this would be EF’s first time in gaol; his significant drug habit; and his need for assistance on release.
	
	
	His Honour then sentenced EF to concurrent terms totalling two years, with non-parole periods of 6 months for each offence, commencing from 7 April 2014, the following day, given that he had spent only one day in custody after his arrest.
	


The parties’ cases


	
	EF’s case was that he had been advised by his solicitor to seek to have his sentence dealt with by way of an intensive correction order and had been told that this had not been accepted by the Court, but there was no record of such an application having been made or considered. Nor was there any reference to his co-operation with police on arrest, his admissions and the effect of the entry of his plea.
	
	
	The case on appeal was that his Honour erred in not considering an intensive correction order, s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requiring that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	EF’s case was that his sentencing hearing had been delayed while a DAL certificate was obtained. He had in that time worked hard at his rehabilitation. After years of infertility, he and his partner were expecting their first child. That had given him the drive to seek employment with the local Aboriginal Corporation.
	
	
	EF said that he had complied with all conditions of his bail, including curfew, for over 12 months, as well as the daily reporting required while on appeal bail. He also attended church and counselling to help him with his drug problems.
	
	
	EF said that while waiting for hearing of his appeal bail application, his prematurely born son had become ill and had required intubation and transfer to the Randwick Children’s Hospital. He had since had another hospital admission for respiratory distress and was very likely to experience similar episodes in the next 12 months.
	
	
	EF’s partner, who had a very complicated medical history had just discovered that she was pregnant. This was unplanned and given her history of repeated hospitalisation when pregnant, meant that there would be no one to care for their son, if she became ill. They leased their home from the local Aboriginal Corporation, which EF feared may not be available to them, if he has to serve his custodial sentence, because his partner is not Aboriginal. She had been given notice to vacate before he was released on appeal bail.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was that there was here no error in the conclusion reached on sentence that a full-time custodial sentence was required in EF’s case. The sentence imposed fell at the low end of the scale.
	
	
	EF’s admissions showed, however, that his drug offence had not been a one-off incident of supply, but that he had been dealing to a “substantial degree”. The two year term imposed reflected the view which his Honour reached as to EF’s circumstances, but they were not established to have been exceptional. Given the benefit which EF received from the finding of special circumstances, it could not be concluded that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that no reference was made in the sentencing remarks for any discount for EF’s plea. There was no issue that, on the facts, a discount of 25% was warranted, but it was submitted to have been unlikely that Blanch CJDC had overlooked that consideration, even though it had not been mentioned in the ex tempore judgment delivered while his Honour was on country circuit (see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [48]).
	
	
	Events that post-date sentencing were submitted not to be relevant on appeal and could not be relied on to disturb the sentence (see R v Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177). Nor did the evidence establish exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	As to the ICO, the Crown submitted that such a sentence was not open. Why that was so was not explained. In oral submissions it was accepted that it was available as a matter of discretion under the statutory scheme, but submitted not to be a suitable sentence, given the nature and seriousness of EF’s drug offence and the leniency he had already been afforded
	


The appeal must be allowed


	
	In order to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive, it must be shown to have been “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325).
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, in other than exceptional circumstances, in the case of drug supply offences, a custodial sentence will ordinarily be imposed on an offender (see the discussion in R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104).
	
	
	Error in this sentencing exercise was demonstrated by the failure to consider an ICO, which was, in this case, plainly unjust and contrary to the requirements imposed by s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	As the Crown accepted, only certain sexual offences are excluded from the ICO system under s 66(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Drug offences are not. Section 5(1) requires that a sentence of imprisonment only be imposed, if it is also concluded that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate
	
	
	Section 7(1) provides that a court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 2 years, may make an intensive correction order. The conclusions which his Honour reached triggered that discretion, which only arises to be exercised, once a sentence of imprisonment of not more than 2 years has been imposed.
	
	
	The Crown’s case that his Honour’s sentence had already extended an appropriate degree of leniency to EF, given the nature of his offending, could not, in all of the circumstances, be accepted.
	
	
	The sentence which his Honour imposed fell at the lowest end of the available range. The maximum penalty for the drug offence was 15 years imprisonment or 2,000 penalty units and for the proceeds of crime offence, 15 years imprisonment. A total term of 2 years was imposed for each offence, with a non-parole period of 6 months. They were made totally concurrent.
	
	
	That sentence reflected not only the nature and seriousness of EF’s offending, but also his particular subjective circumstances; the remorse and contrition he had plainly demonstrated by his plea and other actions; the evidence of the steps he had pursued towards rehabilitation; and the conclusions which his Honour had reached in relation to considerations of deterrence and totality. Those considerations were also reflected in his Honour's finding as to the existence of special circumstances. The result was that this was to be EF’s first custodial sentence.
	
	
	Those same matters were also all relevant to a consideration of whether an ICO should be imposed. That was an important consideration in EF’s case, but one to which no attention was paid at all.
	
	
	As discussed in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225; (2012) 82 NSWLR 60 at [56], eligibility of an offender for an ICO depends upon an assessment that the person is a ""suitable person"" (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (s 67(1)(b)) and the formation of an opinion by the sentencing judge that it is ""appropriate in all the circumstances"" that an ICO be used (s 67(1(c)). An assessment report is required, with s 70(2) requiring the report to address, amongst other things, matters prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2010.
	
	
	Regulation 14 provides:
	


“14    Assessment reports

(1)    An offender’s assessment report must take into account, and specifically address, the following matters:

(a)    any criminal record of the offender, and the likelihood that the offender will re-offend,

(b)    any risks associated with managing the offender in the community (taking into account the offender’s response to supervision in the community on previous occasions),

(c)    the likelihood that the offender will commit a domestic violence offence,

(d)    whether the offender will have suitable residential accommodation for the duration of an intensive correction order,

(e) whether any circumstances of the offender’s residence, employment, study or other activities would inhibit effective implementation of an intensive correction order,

(f)    whether the persons with whom it is likely the offender would reside, or continue or resume a relationship, understand the requirements of an intensive correction order and are prepared to live in conformity with them, so far as may be necessary,

(g)    whether the making of an intensive correction order would place at risk of harm any person who would be living with or in the vicinity of the offender,

(h)    any dependency of the offender on alcohol or drugs, or other substance abuse, that would affect the offender’s ability to comply with the offender’s obligations under an intensive correction order,

(i)    any physical or mental health conditions of the offender that would affect the offender’s ability to comply with the offender’s obligations under an intensive correction order,

(j)    the existence and extent of any self-harm risk, including the likely impact of an intensive correction order on that risk, and the availability in the community of the support and treatment services necessary to manage the risk.

(2)    If a child under the age of 18 years would be living with an offender serving a sentence of imprisonment by way of intensive correction, the assessment report must take into account, and specifically address, the effect on the child of that fact.

(3)    If it appears to the officer preparing the assessment report that the offender is homeless:

(a)    all reasonable efforts must be made by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, in consultation with the offender, to find suitable accommodation for the offender, and

(b)    the report is not to be finalised until those efforts have been made.

(4)    An offender’s assessment report must also include an assessment of:

(a)    factors associated with his or her offending that would be able to be addressed by targeted interventions under an intensive correction order, and

(b)    the availability of resources to address those factors by targeted interventions under an intensive correction order, and

(c)    any issues relevant to the administration of an intensive correction order in respect of the offender that may be relevant to the court’s determination of an appropriate date to be fixed for the commencement of the sentence.”


	
	It is the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2014 which now deals with mandatory and other conditions for ICO’s. Relevantly, it provides:
	


“186   Mandatory conditions for intensive correction orders

The following are the mandatory conditions of an intensive correction order to be imposed by a court under section 81 of the Act:

(a)   a condition that requires the offender to be of good behaviour and not commit any offence,

(b)    a condition that requires the offender to report, on the date fixed as the date of commencement of the sentence or on a later date advised by the Commissioner, to a local office of Corrective Services NSW or other location advised by the Commissioner,

(c)    a condition that requires the offender to reside only at premises approved by a supervisor,

(d)    a condition that prohibits the offender leaving or remaining out of New South Wales without the permission of the Commissioner,

(e)    a condition that prohibits the offender leaving or remaining out of Australia without the permission of the Parole Authority,

(f)    a condition that requires the offender to receive visits by a supervisor at the offender’s home at any time for any purpose connected with the administration of the order,

(g)   a condition that requires the offender to authorise his or her medical practitioner, therapist or counsellor to provide to a supervisor information about the offender that is relevant to the administration of the order,

(h)    a condition that requires the offender to submit to searches of places or things under his or her immediate control, as directed by a supervisor,

(i)    a condition that prohibits the offender using prohibited drugs, obtaining drugs unlawfully or abusing drugs lawfully obtained,

(j)    a condition that requires the offender to submit to breath testing, drug testing or other medically approved test procedures for detecting alcohol or drug use, as directed by a supervisor,

(k)    a condition that prohibits the offender possessing or having in his or her control any firearm or other offensive weapon,

(l)    a condition that requires the offender to submit to surveillance or monitoring (including electronic surveillance or monitoring) that a supervisor may direct, and comply with all instructions given by a supervisor in relation to the operation of surveillance or monitoring systems,

(m)    a condition that prohibits the offender tampering with, damaging or disabling surveillance or monitoring equipment,

(n)    a condition that requires the offender to comply with any direction given by a supervisor that requires the offender to remain at a specified place during specified hours or that otherwise restricts the movements of the offender during specified hours,

(o)    a condition that requires the offender to undertake a minimum of 32 hours of community service work a month, as directed by a supervisor from time to time,

(p)    a condition that requires the offender to engage in activities to address the factors associated with his or her offending as identified in the offender’s assessment report or that become apparent during the term of the order, as directed by a supervisor from time to time,

(q)    a condition that requires the offender to comply with all reasonable directions of a supervisor,

(r)    a condition that requires the offender to submit to a medical examination by a specified medical practitioner, as directed by a supervisor, in relation to the offender’s capacity to undertake community service work or to otherwise comply with the offender’s obligations under the intensive correction order.

187   Additional conditions that may be imposed by sentencing court

The following are the additional conditions that may be imposed on an intensive correction order by the sentencing court under section 81 of the Act:

(a)    a condition that requires the offender to accept any direction of a supervisor in relation to maintaining or obtaining employment,

(b)    a condition that requires the offender to authorise contact between any employer of the offender and a supervisor,

(c)    a condition that requires the offender to comply with any direction of a supervisor as to the kinds of occupation or employment in which the offender may or may not engage,

(d)    a condition that requires the offender to comply with any direction of a supervisor that the offender not associate with specified persons or persons of a specified description,

(e)    a condition that prohibits the offender consuming alcohol,

(f)    a condition that requires the offender to comply with any direction of a supervisor that the offender must not go to specified places or districts or places or districts of a specified kind.”


	
	These conditions reflect that ICOs are directed at various purposes of sentencing, including deterrence and rehabilitation, as to which it was observed in Pogson at [122] - [125]:
	


“122   Although it is common for judges, when considering the subjective characteristics of an offender, to evaluate the prospects of the person reoffending and to express an opinion as to whether the person is unlikely to reoffend, it could never be said that a person who has once offended would never reoffend. Furthermore, a person who has offended will always be in need of the opportunity to establish themselves as a law abiding and productive member of the community. Rehabilitation is a concept which is broader than merely avoiding reoffending.

123   A finding that an offender is not likely to reoffend may often be made not only because of expressions of remorse, but because the fact that the offender has been caught, convicted and punished (which may include extra-curial punishment) will operate to deter the offender from future wrongdoing. Deterrence will operate in respect of an offender even though the offender may not have restructured his or her thinking so that they thereafter consciously determine to re-establish themselves as a positive member of society.

124   By contrast to deterrence, rehabilitation has as its purpose the remodelling of a person's thinking and behaviour so that they will, notwithstanding their past offending, re-establish themselves in the community with a conscious determination to renounce their wrongdoing and establish or re-establish themselves as an honourable law abiding citizen: Vartzokas v Zanker at 279 (King CJ).

125   In this sense, every offender is in need of rehabilitation. Some may need greater assistance than others. It has been commonplace to speak of ""paying your debt"" to society. That phrase, in colloquial parlance, captures the essence of rehabilitation, enabling the offender to re-establish him or herself as an honourable member of the community.”


	
	Those conditions include conditions with which EF had been complying while on bail, both before and after being sentenced. The evidence led on sentencing unquestionably raised for consideration whether an ICO should be utilised in EF’s case. That explains the advice he said he had been given by his solicitor, prior to sentencing. He had also been advised that he was likely to be assessed as suitable for such an order. Similar advice was obtained before the hearing of the appeal. It was not put in issue by the Crown,
	
	
	The failure to seek such an order, appears to have been the result of oversight. The transcript of the sentencing hearing reveals that it was very short. That efficiency was at the expense of justice.
	
	
	EF was called to give short evidence and was shortly cross-examined. The submissions advanced on his behalf were also brief. Reference was made to his record; his work to support his partner during her difficult pregnancy; his remorse and acceptance of responsibility for his offending; his good prospects of rehabilitation; and his candid admissions as to his offending. It was then submitted:
	


“Your Honour, it’s a matter that I would respectfully suggest that your Honour would have to consider a custodial sentence. First time in custody, I ask your Honour to take that into consideration. If your Honour is mindful of imposing a fulltime custodial sentence, I’m certainly not suggesting your Honour shouldn’t, that your Honour would then find special circumstances on the basis that he’s a man who has some medical problems in terms of ADHD; first time in custody; good prospects of rehabilitation.”


	
	The Crown’s submissions were even briefer. In their entirety they were:
	


“Your Honour knows the facts, obviously. He’s got 8.7 grams of drug in his possession, the Crown says in possession with the purposes of supply, maybe some for his own use. He’s pleaded guilty to having money in his possession from the sale of drugs. He’s told the court that he was selling drugs for $300 a gram. He paid, I think it was, $3,500 for an ounce, therefore was a $5,000 profit between the purchase price and the sale price. He does say that he used some of those profits to support his own habit.

At the end of the day, this is a person who is supplying drugs for financial gain.”


	
	As recently discussed by Simpson J in Lambert v R [2015] NSWCCA 22 at [39], ordinarily an offender is bound by the conduct of his case at first instance, but that is not an absolute rule.
	
	
	Here it seems that his Honour was not adequately assisted in a busy circuit sitting. Neither he, nor either of the parties’ legal representatives, made any reference to the question of whether there should be a utilitarian discount for EF’s early pleas, as there obviously should have been. Nor were submissions directed to whether an ICO should be considered, even though the circumstances were such that it was a sentencing option which properly arose for consideration.
	
	
	His Honour’s reasons were shortly given and delivered ex tempore. Given his Honour’s experience and the conclusion which he reached that the concurrent sentences which he imposed would be at the lowest end of the scale, it should be accepted that the discount, while not mentioned, was not overlooked.
	
	
	The same conclusion is not available in respect of the question of an ICO. In this case, in my view, considerations of justice require that this important oversight be addressed on appeal. This was not a case where it was apparent that an applicant would not be found suitable, if assessed for an ICO. To the contrary, EF’s offending, his circumstances and his ongoing record of compliance with conditions of bail, all matters relevant to an assessment of his suitability for an ICO, suggested that there were real prospects that he would be found suitable, if assessed.
	
	
	In the result the proper course was for the appeal to be upheld and EF resentenced
	


Resentence


	
	Further evidence received on resentencing revealed relevant matters which had occurred post sentencing, which had to be taken into account. That included that EF had served some 2 months of his sentence, before being granted conditional bail; his compliance with those conditions; the ongoing efforts he had pursued at rehabilitation after sentencing; and that he had obtained permanent employment, in an environment where random drug testing is conducted.
	
	
	The Crown also led evidence as to EF’s very considerable assistance to law enforcement authorities, which gave rise to the exercise of the discretion to impose a lesser penalty under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 per Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ at 252).
	
	
	The starting point for the penalty imposed was a total sentence of 2 years and 6 months. That sentence was reduced by a combined 50% for the plea and the assistance provided. That reflected the considerable assistance revealed on the evidence, which was of such a kind that it was appropriate to grant a discount at the top of the available range, reserved for exceptional cases (see SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19).
	
	
	That sentence was suspended, on EF entering into a bond to be of good behaviour, on conditions proposed by the Crown. That was the appropriate course in circumstances where, in April 2014, imposition of an ICO would have been appropriate. Such a sentence was no longer appropriate in the circumstances which prevailed in March 2015. The sentence imposed on appeal is due to expire in several months.
	
	
	The result was a term of imprisonment of 1 year and 3 months, which, we were satisfied in the circumstances, reflected a sentence which was not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences.

2703748,RB v DPP [2015] NSWSC 248,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff was prosecuted in the Local Court on a charge of indecent assault upon a young girl. The prosecution was conducted by the first defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions. The charge was dismissed and the plaintiff sought the costs of the proceedings. The magistrate declined to award costs, and in this court the plaintiff seeks judicial review of that decision.
	
	
	Apart from the complainant, it will be necessary to refer to a number of juveniles, including the plaintiff’s own daughters. It is to prevent disclosure of their identities that the plaintiff is not referred to by name in this judgment.
	
	
	The offence was alleged to have occurred between late December 2008 and early January 2009. The plaintiff and his family were on a camping holiday and the complainant, a friend of one of the plaintiff’s daughters, had been invited to join them. It is not necessary to examine the evidence in any detail. It is alleged that on the night in question the plaintiff rubbed the complainant’s vagina through her clothing. She told him to stop. A number of matters arising from the evidence contributed to the magistrate’s decision to dismiss the charge.
	
	
	The plaintiff gave evidence denying the offence. His evidence was supported by the evidence of his family: his wife, his son (an adult) and his two daughters. Put shortly, the effect of their evidence was that they were unaware of anything untoward having occurred and they were in positions sufficiently proximate to the complainant to have been alerted if it had. Further, the complainant made no complaint about the alleged incident until around September 2010, when she made the allegation to her sister and to a female friend, ID. That complaint was made after the plaintiff had contacted the school which his daughter, A and the complainant attended concerning allegations that the complainant and other girls had been bullying his daughter. That matter had been raised by the plaintiff in the course of a recorded interview with police conducted on 29 March 2011, and his Honour recognised it as a circumstance capable of suggesting that the complainant was “getting back at the accused and/or his family.”
	
	
	To understand the issues raised, it is necessary to sketch the history of the proceedings. On 29 March 2011, the day on which the plaintiff was interviewed, he was charged with aggravated indecent assault. At that stage police had a statement (a recorded interview) from the complainant. They were aware by then of the identity of witnesses to the incident itself: the plaintiff’s wife, his son and his two daughters, and to the complaint: the complainant’s sister and ID. No statement had been taken from any of them, and that remained the case when the police brief was served on 19 May 2011.
	
	
	At the hearing of the costs application there was a dispute about whether police had attempted to obtain statements from the plaintiff’s wife and his two daughters prior to service of the brief, but the magistrate found it unnecessary to resolve the matter. In the event, statements were not taken from the plaintiff’s wife or his son at any stage. Nor did the police investigate the plaintiff’s suggestion in the interview that the complainant may have had a motive to make a false complaint.
	
	
	Police interviewed ID on 5 July 2011. On 20 July the plaintiff’s daughters, A & H, were interviewed at school, without the knowledge of either of their parents. A’s interview also raised the complainant’s possible motive to make a false complaint. The police initially refused to release copies of the transcripts of those interviews, and the plaintiff was required to issue a subpoena to obtain them. The matter was set down for hearing on 5 September 2011, but it was adjourned by consent because those transcripts had not been supplied. It was relisted for 30 November. It was not until 9 November that police interviewed the complainant’s sister, and a copy of the transcript of that interview was served on the plaintiff on 18 November.
	
	
	The proceedings were heard over three days, 30 November 2011 and 22 and 23 March 2012. The complainant, her sister, ID, and both the plaintiff’s daughters were called in the prosecution case. The plaintiff’s wife and son were called in his case. The costs application was heard on 20 July 2012, and the magistrate gave his decision on that day.
	
	
	Section 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for the award of professional costs to an accused in summary proceedings where a prosecution is withdrawn or dismissed. However, the discretion to award costs against a prosecutor acting in a public capacity is limited by s 214(1) of the Act, which provides:
	


“214 Limit on award of professional costs to accused person against prosecutor acting in public capacity 

(1)   Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following:

(a)   that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,

(b)   that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,

(c)   that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,

(d)   that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.”


	
	That subsection is applicable to the present case. In his application for costs in the Local Court the plaintiff relied upon pars (a), (c) and (d). His counsel, Mr Healey, who also appeared in this court, relied upon the failure of the police to take statements from the complainant’s sister, from ID, and from the plaintiff’s daughters before charging the plaintiff or before the police brief was served, and from the plaintiff’s wife and son at all. He also relied on the delay in the supply of transcripts of the interviews with the plaintiff’s daughters, and the lack of any investigation of the complainant’s possible motive to make a false complaint.
	
	
	In the light of these matters, he argued, the investigation had been conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner: par (a), there had been a failure to investigate properly, or at all, relevant matters of which the police were aware suggesting that the plaintiff might not be guilty: par (c), and there were exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings such that it was just and reasonable to award costs: par (d).
	
	
	The magistrate declined to award costs, having found that none of these statutory bases had been made out. As to par (a), his Honour said that he was not satisfied that the investigation, “as it was ultimately done”, was done unreasonably or improperly. As to par (c), he said that he was not satisfied that “ultimately the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate or properly investigate any relevant matter.” Finally, he found no exceptional circumstances within the meaning of par (d).
	
	
	His Honour referred to the “drawn out nature” of the investigation, but concluded that it had been conducted “properly and reasonably” when the matter finally came to hearing. He found that at the hearing “almost all of the relevant witnesses, both favourable and unfavourable to the accused, were called in the prosecution case and made available for cross-examination.”
	
	
	His Honour noted that the adjournment of the hearing on 5 September 2011 was the result of “witnesses and material” having been withheld from the defence. He indicated that if the application before him had been for the costs thrown away in relation to that day, his “conclusions would have been quite different.” However, he added that “somewhat belatedly” that material was provided (by the DPP), and was ultimately “available and was called in the prosecution case when the matter was called on for hearing.” He said that if the plaintiff’s daughters had not been called at the hearing, he might have concluded that costs should be awarded as that would have raised “a real issue in relation to the prosecution being conducted in an improper manner.” However, he noted, neither of these things happened.
	
	
	His Honour then said:
	


“At the end of the day none of these scenarios are the ones that unfolded. When the matter eventually came on for hearing before me not only was the material disclosed to the defence but the witnesses [the plaintiff’s daughters] were in fact called by the Crown. As I have noted, the accused’s son … and his wife … were not called in the prosecution case but in my view nothing turns on this.”

His Honour expressed the view that the tenor of the evidence of the wife and son was consistent with that of the plaintiff’s daughters. He described their evidence as “effectively a reiteration” of the evidence of the daughters, finding that it did not “separately call for investigation.”


	
	His Honour concluded:
	


“Whilst this is a matter where the investigation was conducted in a piecemeal manner and certainly could have been conducted better, at the end of the day there (sic) prosecution were left with allegations made by a young woman against the accused. It seems to me that they are properly jury questions and would have to have been determined in this place or, indeed, another place, but they were classically questions that ought to be left to a jury on a fact finding basis.

The fact that doubt was cast upon the reliability of the complainant in these proceedings by other investigations which took place after charging in my view does not lead to a conclusion that costs ought be granted. At the end of the day the prosecution called effectively all of the relevant witnesses and evidence and in doing so the conduct of the case ran in such a way as to be a fairly conducted prosecution.”

The proceedings in this court


	
	These proceedings for judicial review were instituted almost 12 months after his Honour’s decision. UCPR r 59.10, prescribing a period of 3 months in which to institute proceedings of this kind, was not in force at the relevant time. However, counsel for the Director, Mr Bourke, raised the issue of delay as a matter bearing upon the discretion to grant prerogative relief, assisting me by reference to authority on that question. He fairly acknowledged that the Director could not point to any particular prejudice resulting from the delay.
	
	
	The plaintiff provided some explanation for it in an affidavit deposing that he conducts a business as a lone trader, the income from the business is relatively modest, he is married with 3 children, and they live in a home subject to a substantial mortgage. He found it necessary to give careful consideration to whether he would undertake these proceedings, given the costs burden he may suffer in the event of their being unsuccessful.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I find this explanation reasonable and I do not consider that the delay is a matter militating against the grant of relief if a basis for it is made out.
	
	
	By an amended summons the plaintiff seeks orders pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970, being an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the magistrate’s costs decision and an order in the nature of mandamus directing the Local Court to exercise its power under the relevant legislation according to law. Also sought are declarations to the effect that the prerequisites of s 214(1)(a), (c) and (d) of the Criminal Procedure Act have been established.
	
	
	Mr Bourke referred me to the helpful analysis of the nature of the relief sought by Beech-Jones J in O’Brien v Hutchinson [2012] NSWSC 429, a case also involving s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act, at [4] ff. After referring to the principles relating to jurisdictional error and error on the face of the record enunciated in Craig v State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58, 184 CLR 163 and Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1, 239 CLR 531, his Honour continued at [7]-[14]:
	


“[7] The power conferred by s 213(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act cannot be exercised in a case where there is a prosecutor acting in a public capacity unless the Court is ‘satisfied’ of any one or more of s 214(1)(a) to (d). The formation of the opinion in s 214(1) is a ‘limit’ on the function or power conferred by s 213(1) as discussed in the above passage from Craig. It follows that, in a case where a costs order was refused, jurisdictional error will be established if the plaintiff can establish that the Local Court misapprehended the limits placed on it by s 214 (see for example De Varda v Constable Stengord (NSW Police) [2011] NSWSC 868 at [32] to [33], per Davies J). Having stated this, six matters should be kept in mind.

[8] First, the formulation of jurisdictional error that I have extracted from Craig involves establishing that the inferior court ‘misapprehended’ the limits on its power. Just because the matters listed in s 214(1) have a jurisdictional quality does not mean that the role of this Court is to determine whether any of them were met and, if so, conclude that there was jurisdictional error on the part of the Local Court in failing to act. The plaintiff must identify a ‘misapprehension’ by the Local Court as to the limits on its power, not a mere disagreement with the Local Court's conclusion as to those limits. Unless the intention is clearly expressed, legislation will not be construed so as to make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts as distinct from the court's opinion or determination that the facts exist (Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7; (1938) 59 CLR 369 at 391, per Dixon J]). The deployment by the legislature of the word ‘satisfied’ in s 214(1) puts beyond doubt that there is no such contrary intention.

[9] Second, a number of aspects of s 214(1)(a) to (d) involve the exercise of a normative judgment on the part of the Local Court. For example, the Local Court must make an assessment as to whether something was ‘unreasonable’, ‘improper’ or that there were ‘exceptional circumstances’. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo (1995) 57 FCR 194 the Full Court of the Federal Court noted that conclusions on matters of ‘opinion or policy or taste’ may be ‘very much a matter of opinion and thus not readily susceptible to review for error of law’ (at 199G). Similarly, conclusions by the Local Court as to whether or not failure to take some particular step in the investigation process was ‘unreasonable’ or not can be very much a matter of opinion. In such a case, the task of demonstrating a misapprehension in the Craig sense is that much more difficult.

[10] Third, an erroneous construction of provisions such as ss 214(1)(a) to (d) will sometimes be apparent on the face of the lower court's reasons. If so the existence of both an error of law and a jurisidictional error will be established. In some cases a misconstruction may only be apparent from an examination of the structure of the lower court's reasons. In other cases a party may point to a disparity between the facts as found and the lower court's conclusion as demonstrative of error. However, it must be remembered that a number of phrases in s 214(1) are not technical legal phrases but words which have a ‘common understanding’. To demonstrate legal error in this latter type of case it would have to be demonstrated that, on the facts as found, no other conclusion was reasonably open other than that the criteria was established (Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7; Williams v Bill Williams Pty Ltd [1971] 1 NSWLR 547 at 557; Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12; (2001) 202 CLR 439 at [24] to [28], per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ).

[11] Fourth, a relevant misapprehension is not demonstrated by pointing to a list of matters the court could have, or even should have, taken into account but did not or by pointing to matters the court did take into account, but should not have. In Craig at 180, the High Court held:

‘... a failure by an inferior court to take into account some matter which it was, as a matter of law, required to take into account in determining a question within jurisdiction or reliance by such a court upon some irrelevant matter upon which it was, as a matter of law, not entitled to rely in determining such a question will not ordinarily involve jurisdictional error.’

[12] It is only if one took the further step of inferring that, because the inferior court took into account some irrelevant matter or failed to take into account some relevant matter, it thereby misconstrued a limit on its power would any contention based on a failure to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant considerations suggest the existence of jurisdictional error.

[13] Fifth, the failure to take into account a relevant matter or the taking into account of an irrelevant matter by an inferior court might constitute an error of law on the face of the record even if it does not constitute a jurisdictional error. However, the relevant transgression would have to be apparent on the face of the ‘record’. It could not be demonstrated by pointing to a wider set of materials. Moreover, the relevant ‘matter’ would have to be a factor or consideration that as a ‘matter of law’ the lower court was required to consider, or exclude, as the case maybe. Such matters are ascertained from the legislation governing the case in question (see in the context of an administrative decision: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [73] to [74], per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). They are not identified by preparing a list of ‘facts’ that it is said should have been considered but were not, or were considered but should not have been.

[14] Sixth, the material placed before me included the transcript of an ex tempore judgment of the second defendant. It is well recognised that, given the prodigious workload carried by the Local Court, the transcript of such reasons are not to be construed strictly. Instead their substance is to be examined to see whether the correct test was applied (Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 478 - 479A, per Kirby P).”


	
	In the present case judicial review is sought on the grounds that the magistrate’s decision was made “upon a mistaken apprehension of the limits of the jurisdiction of the Local Court to award costs in criminal matters”, and a misconception on the part of the magistrate of the nature of his function and the extent of his powers in the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	Mr Healey’s central argument was that his Honour’s reasons disclose that his focus was upon the fairness of the hearing rather than the reasonableness of the police investigation. It is the latter, not the former, which is the subject of s 214(1)(a) and (c) (although the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, of course, is the subject of (d)).
	
	
	Mr Healey cited the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Cliftleigh Haulage Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [2007] NSWCCA 13. That case arose from a successful appeal by the appellant company to the Land and Environment Court against a conviction in proceedings brought against it in the Local Court by the respondent Council. The judge of the Land and Environment Court hearing the appeal had refused an application by the appellant for its costs. Before the Court of Criminal Appeal was a stated case, pursuant to s 5BA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the judge’s determination. The relevant legislation was s 70 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (now Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001), which is relevantly similar to s 214. In particular, s 70(1)(a) and (c) are in identical terms to pars (a) and (c) of s 214(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that a potential witness had not been called in the prosecution case. Evidence was given by officers of the respondent of a conversation with that person, which provided some indication of what he might have been able to say, but a statement was not taken from him. The judge had determined that the failure to call that witness did not provide a ground for the award of costs because he could not determine what the outcome would have been if the witness had been called, and was “not able to be satisfied that his evidence would have suggested the appellant might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not be brought … .” It will be seen that that finding used the language of s 70(1)(c).
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal held that his Honour had not fallen into error insofar as his decision was based upon par (c). However, the court did find error in his Honour’s failure properly to consider par (a).
	
	
	Hodgson JA (with whom Howie and Price JJ agreed) noted at [18] that the submissions based on the failure to call the witness were misconceived. That failure, his Honour said, “relates to the manner in which the proceedings were conducted, not to the investigation.” Explaining the focus of pars (a) and (c) of the subsection, his Honour said at [20]-[21]:
	


“[20] As regards s 70(1)(c), it could be said that a person seeking costs must identify a matter that the prosecution was or ought to have been aware of and that suggested that the appellant might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not have been brought. If the ‘matter’ in question here is that there was a possible eye-witness, then it was not shown that this matter suggested that the appellant might not be guilty. If the ‘matter’ in question is the evidence that that witness could give, although it could be said that the Council should have been aware of it, it was not shown that this evidence suggested that the appellant might not be guilty. Accordingly, in relation to s 70(1)(c), I do not think error by the primary judge was shown.

[21] However, in relation to s 70(1)(a), I do not think it is necessary for the person seeking costs in every case to show that an investigation conducted in a reasonable manner would have suggested that the appellant might not be guilty or that the proceedings ought not to be brought. If a prosecutor knows there are five eye-witnesses to an event, and interviews and calls only one of them, and the prosecution then fails, I think s 70(1)(a) may apply even if the person seeking costs does not prove what the other four witnesses would have said. Similarly, closer to this case, if the prosecutor knows there is an eye-witness to what happened, but does not interview this witness, and instead relies wholly on a circumstantial case, in my opinion s 70(1)(a) may be satisfied even if the person seeking costs does not prove what the eye-witness would have said.”


	
	The issue arose again, although with a somewhat different emphasis, in De Varda v Constable Stengord (NSW Police) [2011] NSWSC 868, a decision of Davies J. (This decision was referred to by Beech-Jones J in O’Brien v Hutchinson, cited above, at [7].) Like the present case, that was an application by the plaintiff for judicial review of the decision of a magistrate to refuse an order for costs in his favour after a charge against him of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was dismissed in the Local Court. Section 214 was the applicable legislation. The plaintiff was alleged to have assaulted his step-daughter during an incident in which the only witnesses were family members. His case was that the complainant had inflicted upon herself the injury which was the subject of the charge.
	
	
	One of the witnesses was the plaintiff’s 13 year old son, from whom the police did not obtain a statement at any stage and who was not called in the prosecution case. Prior to the Local Court hearing the plaintiff obtained a statement from him, supportive of his case, and forwarded it to the police. At the hearing evidence of a forensic pathologist was led in the plaintiff’s case, which was also strongly supportive of his account and which influenced the magistrate’s decision to dismiss the charge.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application for costs on the basis of the failure of the police to take a statement from his son was founded upon s 214(1)(a) and (c). In declining to order costs on this basis, the magistrate focused upon the impact the son’s evidence might have had upon the conduct of the proceedings. His Honour expressed the view that the son should have been interviewed but, on the question whether it was unreasonable not to have done so, questioned “what benefit would have been achieved by that.” He questioned whether a Prasad style submission might have been made at the end of the prosecution case, and whether any time might have been saved. He also noted the age of the son and the fact that the incident occurred in a domestic context.
	
	
	Davies J referred to the relevant principles governing judicial review of the decision of an inferior court set out in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales (supra), including the High Court’s reference at [72] to a basis for review arising from “misconstruction of the relevant statute thereby misconceiving the nature of the function which the inferior court is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case.” His Honour said at [23] that if the magistrate in the case at hand “asked himself the wrong question when considering the question of unreasonableness in s 214, this would be a misconstruction of the relevant statute … .”
	
	
	His Honour found at [26] that the magistrate “seemed to regard the touchstone of reasonableness as to whether it would have changed the way the trial ran.” This focus upon the conduct of the hearing, he concluded, demonstrated the error identified in Cliftleigh Haulage. His Honour said at [32] that the “question to have asked was not whether interviewing and calling [the son] would have made a difference to the way the trial would run, but whether the failure to do so meant that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner.”
	
	
	At [30] his Honour set out the passage from the judgment of Hodgson JA in Cliftleigh Haulage at [20]-[21] which I have quoted above. His Honour added at [31]:
	


“In relation to s 214(1)(a), therefore, that paragraph can be satisfied without proof of what an uncalled witness would have said. It is enough that, if the prosecution interviews and calls fewer than the available eye-witnesses, s 214(1)(a) may apply. A fortiori, if the witness who was not interviewed and called would have thrown a different perspective on the matter, the paragraph may apply.”


	
	His Honour added (also at [32]) that, given that the statement of the son provided strong support for the plaintiff’s case, the magistrate should have considered whether the investigation was unreasonable within the terms of par (c). He continued, “That may have been by asking himself what difference it would have made, not to the way the trial was run, but to whether the plaintiff might not have been guilty or that the proceedings should not have been brought.” His Honour also found that, in any event, the magistrate had taken into account irrelevant considerations on this issue, that is, the age of the son and the fact that he was a member of the family in whose domestic milieu the incident occurred. These were not relevant considerations, given the substance of the son’s evidence, and accordingly there was error on the face of the record giving rise to relief by way of certiorari.
	
	
	In the present case, Mr Healey submitted, the magistrate had misconstrued s 214 by limiting his discretion to award costs “to situations where the defence was prejudiced by the unreasonable or improper actions” of the Director or the police. He relied in particular upon the passages from his Honour’s judgment to which I have referred at [14]-[16] above, in which his Honour found that ultimately, prior to the hearing, the relevant material had been supplied to the plaintiff and, with the exception of the plaintiff’s son and his wife, the relevant witnesses were called in the prosecution case, so that it was “a fairly conducted prosecution.”
	
	
	Mr Healey pointed out that s 214(1)(a) and (c) do not require any unfairness or prejudice to the defence to be demonstrated. He argued that the obvious shortcomings in the investigation, which his Honour acknowledged, necessarily led to the conclusion that it had been conducted unreasonably.
	
	
	Mr Healey also referred specifically to his Honour’s observation that nothing turned upon the fact that the plaintiff’s son and wife were not called in the prosecution case. This, he submitted, was an error on the face of the record, as the failure by the Director to call all available material witnesses was sufficient to show that the investigation and prosecution were conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner. At the very least, given that there was a dispute as to whether police attempted to interview the plaintiff’s wife, the failure to interview or call his son was said to be sufficient to characterise the investigation in that way.
	
	
	Those last arguments appear to elide the investigation with the conduct of the curial proceedings, but the thrust of Mr Healey’s argument is clear enough. It should also not be forgotten that the application for costs was made partly on the basis of s 214(1)(d), impugning the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor. That paragraph would embrace the complaint about the failure to call the plaintiff’s son and wife in the prosecution case, although the word “conduct” is probably broad enough to include the steps taken by a prosecutor in preparing the case for hearing. That said, the focus of the argument here was the reasonableness of the investigation.
	
	
	In response to these arguments, Mr Bourke submitted that the magistrate had not fallen into the error for which Mr Healey contended. A fair reading of the reasons as a whole, he said, show that his Honour did assess the reasonableness of the investigation. Mr Bourke noted that his Honour addressed each of the relevant paragraphs of s 214(1) and, while being critical of the dilatory progress of the investigation, concluded that it had been conducted properly and reasonably by the time the case came to hearing.
	
	
	Mr Bourke argued that it was wrong to focus upon the progress of the investigation (or the lack of it) at the time the plaintiff was charged or when the police brief was served, saying that a finding that there had been some unreasonable or improper conduct at any stage of the process of investigation and prosecution was not a proper basis for an award of costs. He submitted that his Honour was entitled to look, as he did, at the whole of the investigation and the proceedings. It was in this context, he argued, that the magistrate’s findings that the investigation had been conducted reasonably by the time of the hearing, that relevant material had been disclosed to the defence, that the prosecution had called effectively all of the relevant witnesses and that, accordingly, the prosecution had been fairly conducted, should be understood.
	
	
	The focus of par (c) of s 214(1) is, of course, narrower than that of par (a). Relevantly for present purposes, it is directed to whether there was an unreasonable failure to investigate any relevant matter which suggested that the plaintiff might not be guilty. In the course of the hearing before me, the question was raised whether it would have been appropriate for his Honour to have considered whether, if the investigation had been undertaken more promptly, the prosecution might have been terminated without coming to hearing. It appears that that issue was argued before his Honour. I was assisted on this matter by further written submissions from both counsel.
	
	
	Mr Bourke accepted that there may be cases in which a magistrate, adopting that approach, might find that par (c) was satisfied. Such a case might be one in which the accused raised an alibi, and there was credible evidence in support of it which a reasonable investigation should have uncovered and which might have shown that the prosecution did not have a reasonable prospect of success. Mr Bourke argued that his Honour did address that issue in the present case, finding that it was not a case of that kind.
	
	
	So much is apparent, Mr Bourke said, from the passage of his Honour’s reasons quoted at [16] above, in which he characterised the allegations made by the complainant as “properly jury questions”, adding that the fact that doubt was cast upon the complainant’s reliability by other investigations did not lead to the conclusion that costs should be granted. Mr Bourke also relied upon the following observation with which his Honour concluded his reasons:
	


“Whilst, as I say, matters could have been perhaps – and ought to have been, I might say – investigated earlier, perhaps before charging, at the end of the day it does not seem to me that that militates towards my exercising my discretion in favour of the accused on any of the bases set out under 1(a), (b), (c) or (d).” (Mr Bourke’s emphasis.)


	
	Mr Bourke argued that it is clear from these passages of his Honour’s reasons that, for the purpose of par (c), he had considered the course of the investigation from its outset and concluded that, notwithstanding the material favourable to the plaintiff which emerged as the investigation proceeded, there was a prosecution case fit to go to trial. Implicit in that finding was the rejection of any argument that the prosecution might have been terminated at some earlier stage.
	
	
	The thrust of Mr Healey’s further submissions was that, for the purpose of par (c), the question is not whether “at the end of the day” there was a prosecution case fit to proceed to trial. The issue was whether there was an unreasonable failure to investigate a matter of which the prosecutor was aware which suggested that the plaintiff might not be guilty.
	
	
	Mr Healey drew an analogy with the reasonable suspicion of the commission of an offence necessary to justify an arrest by a police officer pursuant to s 99 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. He also referred to the examination of the notion of reasonable suspicion (in a different context) by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Rondo [2001] NSWCCA 540, 126 A Crim R 562. In that case Smart AJ, with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreed, said at [53] (576-7) that a reasonable suspicion “involves less than a reasonable belief but more than a possibility”, that it is not arbitrary and that some factual basis for it must be shown. The materials upon which it is based “must have some probative value.” His Honour also said that it is necessary to determine whether the information said to give rise to the suspicion “afforded reasonable grounds” for it, and that in answering that question “regard must be had to the source of the information and its content, seen in the light of the whole of the surrounding circumstances.”
	
	
	Using that analogy, Mr Healey argued that the issue in the present case was whether:
	


(a)   the prosecutor knew or should have known of a matter which suggested that there may be no proper basis for suspecting on reasonable grounds that the plaintiff committed the offence charged (for example, by reducing the probative value of the information available or affecting the reliability of its source);

(b)   if so, whether a reasonable prosecutor would have investigated that matter; and

(c)   if so, whether the matter was investigated (or investigated properly).


	
	Mr Healey’s position was that it was not necessary for his Honour to have formed a view as to whether this prosecution should have been brought to an end at an earlier stage, although that view was open and, of itself, was sufficient to enliven the court’s jurisdiction to award costs. His primary submission was that the prosecution was initiated upon the uncorroborated allegation of the complainant, following her very late complaint, which was made in circumstances suggesting that she may have had a motive to make a false allegation against the plaintiff. Although the police were made aware of that possible motive at the outset by the plaintiff himself and later by his daughter, no enquiries were made about it of the complainant herself or of the school. Such enquiries should have been made, Mr Healey said, because the suggested motive was a matter going to the reliability of the complainant and the probative value of the information supplied by her. In the terms of par (c), Mr Healey submitted, it was a relevant matter suggesting that the plaintiff might not be guilty, and it was unreasonable not to have investigated it.
	
	
	On the issue of the reasonableness of the investigation, both counsel referred to a passage from my judgment in JD v DPP & Ors [2000] NSWSC 1092. That case concerned an earlier incarnation of s 214 (s 41A of the Justices Act 1902), and I found that a magistrate fell into error in holding that a conclusion that an investigation was conducted in an unreasonable manner required a finding that it fell “grossly below optimum standards.” At [31] I said:
	


“Obviously, an investigation which fails to meet optimum standards is not necessary unreasonable. Equally, however, it might fairly be classed as unreasonable even though it does not fall grossly below those standards. … The test is purely objective. To find that the conduct of the investigation of a particular case was unreasonable does not necessarily impugn the general competence, far less the integrity, of those responsible for it.”


	
	Mr Bourke pointed out, correctly, that the onus was on the plaintiff to establish any of the bases for an award of costs under pars (a), (c) or (d) of s 214(1) and, even if a basis were established, the decision whether to award costs remained a discretionary exercise. He also referred to the judgment of Levine J in Dong v Hughes [2005] NSWSC 84, another case involving the Justices Act provision, in which his Honour expressed the view at [38] that the legislative intent behind the provision “was to severely restrict the discretion to award costs against the prosecution.”
	
	
	I have not found this matter easy to resolve. His Honour’s reasons for refusing costs were given ex tempore, and I am mindful of authority, referred to by Beech-Jones J in O’Brien v Hutchinson at [14], quoted above, that this court should take a practical, common sense approach to ex tempore reasons of the magistrate in a busy Local Court, with an eye to their substance. Nevertheless, I think that there is force in Mr Healey’s primary submission that the focus of his Honour’s reasons was the fairness of the hearing, rather than the process of the investigation.
	
	
	True it is that his Honour referred expressly to pars (a) and (c) of s 214(1), saying that he did not find either of those paragraphs established. However, he gave no reason for that conclusion other than his finding that by the time of the hearing the investigation which had been undertaken was not unreasonable. I accept Mr Bourke’s argument that the fact that an investigation was dilatory (including delay in supplying relevant material to the defence) does not necessarily mean that it was unreasonable and that, generally speaking, it is the state of the investigation at the time the matter comes for hearing which is relevant. However, his Honour’s reasons do not address aspects of the case which were not investigated at all.
	
	
	As I have said, no statement was ever taken from the plaintiff’s wife or his son. They were called in the defence case, and it is apparent that their evidence supported the plaintiff’s case, as did that of his daughters. Having observed that their evidence was “effectively a reiteration” of the evidence of the daughters, his Honour found that it did not call for separate investigation. This is to evaluate the investigation with the wisdom of hindsight after the hearing. The fact remains that they were witnesses whom one would have expected the police to interview. If they had been, further material would have emerged capable of suggesting that the plaintiff might not be guilty. This was a deficiency capable of raising an issue under both pars (a) and (c) of the subsection. (Whilst, as I have said, there may have been a question about the willingness of the wife to be interviewed, this is certainly true of the failure to interview the son.)
	
	
	The same is true of the failure of the police to investigate the possible motive of the complainant to make a false allegation against the plaintiff, a matter which was an important part of Mr Healey’s case on costs. About this his Honour said nothing in his reasons. As I have said, it is apparent from his Honour’s reasons for dismissing the charge that he accepted that the plaintiff had made a complaint about the complainant’s behaviour towards his daughter, and that he saw in that a possible motive on her part to fabricate her account. However, here also, that is no answer to a lack of investigation of the matter.
	
	
	It could be said that the need to pursue enquiries of the plaintiff’s wife and son, and of his complaint about the complainant’s treatment of his daughter, was heightened, not lessened, by the fact that both his daughters had made statements supporting his case. As to par (c) generally, I find it unnecessary to decide whether consideration of the issue raised by it would be assisted by reference to the notion of reasonable suspicion in other legislative contexts to which Mr Healey referred.
	
	
	These deficiencies in the investigation needed to be addressed. I am mindful of the fact that the failure to refer to a relevant matter does not necessarily establish jurisdictional error or even error on the face of the record: O’Brien v Hutchinson at [11]-[13]. However, as I have said, insofar as his Honour did address the fact that statements were not taken from the plaintiff’s wife and son, he did so only in the light of the importance their evidence assumed in the defence case at the hearing. The fact that he did not address at all the lack of investigation of the complainant’s possible motive to give a false account is consistent with the same approach. My reading of his Honour’s reasons as a whole conveys to me that the fairness of the hearing of the case was at the forefront of his reasons in declining to order costs, and that appropriate consideration was not given to the investigation. I am satisfied that his Honour did fall into the error identified in Cliftleigh Haulage and De Varda v Constable Stengord (supra).
	
	
	Accordingly, the decision to refuse costs should be quashed and the matter remitted to the Local Court for reconsideration. Of course, what I have written in no way dictates what the outcome should then be. It is a matter for that court to determine whether any basis under s 214(1) for the award of costs has been made out and, if so, if costs should be awarded in its discretion. I would not make the declaration to which the plaintiff seeks to the effect that the prerequisites of any of pars (a), (c) or (d) of that subsection have been established.
	
	
	I shall consult the parties about the formal orders to be made and, if necessary, hear argument on the costs of these proceedings.

2703759,R v R Abokhalil [2015] NSWDC 48,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	HIS HONOUR: The prosecution seeks to tender in its case against the accused Raja Abokhalil the recording of the interview conducted with him between 6.09am and 6.52am on 24 September 2013 shortly after the accused's arrest. The accused seeks the exclusion of that recorded interview and the related transcript primarily on the basis that the prosecution has not demonstrated that the truth of the admissions recorded within the document was unlikely to have been adversely affected given the circumstances in which relevant admissions were made (s 85(2) Evidence Act 1995). It is further submitted on behalf of the accused that the Court would exercise its discretion pursuant to s 90 Evidence Act 1995, or, alternatively, the discretion available pursuant to s 138 Evidence Act 1995, to exclude the contents of the interview.
	


Issues


	
	The primary issue identified relevant to consideration of both s 85 and s 90 of the Act is that the accused had a history of mental instability and a long-standing intellectual disability which relevant police who dealt with him after his arrest and during the interview either knew about, or reasonably ought to have known about, or ought to have made inquiry about, in the circumstances of the matter.
	
	
	The presentation of the accused, it was submitted, during the interview and certain admissions he made during the recorded interview gave suggestion of him being affected by prohibited drugs, particularly methylamphetamine. Particularly in circumstances where part of the Crown case against the accused was the presence of an ice pipe nearby to the vehicle in which the accused was sitting at the time he was first seen and spoken to by police, shortly after 3.30am on 24 September. These circumstances were either known to police, or ought to have been known to relevant police officers it was submitted.
	
	
	It is also submitted that a certain disclosure by the accused during the early part of the interview rendered the possibility that the accused was a ‘vulnerable person’ within the terms of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002(LEPRA) and the related Regulation of 2005.
	


The Voir Dire


	
	A voir dire examination was conducted in which was tendered the recording of the interview, as well as the transcript of it as an aide memoire, with oral evidence from the arresting police officer, Senior Constable Zammit, and Detective Otley, who was the officer in charge of the investigation and who, with Detective Maher, conducted the questioning of the accused. As well I have had oral evidence from Mr Watson-Munro, a clinical psychologist, who assessed the accused, as I understand the matter on Monday 9 March through a telephone interview; as well as relevant statements of the two police officers and two reports prepared in 2013 by a clinical psychologist Dr Zoran Protulipac and another report prepared on 11 February 2014 by Dr Ivan Lakicevic, a psychiatrist.
	
	
	As I earlier indicated, the accused had been arrested approximately two and a half hours before the commencement of the interview. It is clear from the evidence on the voir dire that the accused was known to Senior Constable Zammit. He was also known to Detective Otley. It would seem, without any great particularity provided to me, that the accused had a number of prior dealings with police. The evidence establishes that there were a large number of COPS entries relating to him, particularly at least on two occasions when action was required by police in accordance with s 22 Mental Health Act 2007.
	
	
	That particular provision requires a police officer who finds a person within police custody, or in contact with police, who is mentally ill or mentally disturbed, to take that person to a declared mental health facility if the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that certain events may occur that may cause a danger to that person or the community, or it would otherwise be beneficial to the person's welfare to be dealt with in accordance with the Mental Health Act rather than in accordance with the law.
	
	
	The evidence of the two police officers on the voir dire was that, firstly, in the case of Senior Constable Zammit, although he knew that the accused was a drug user and was aware that an ice pipe had been found near the vehicle where the accused was seated when arrested, he was unaware that the accused had used ""ice"" that night, that he had not checked any relevant COPS entries in relation to the accused, and that he was largely ignorant of any mental health issues from which the accused may have suffered in the past.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Otley had known the accused since 2007. He gave evidence that he was aware of the requirements of s 22 Mental Health Act 2007. He was also aware that if the accused had been dealt with pursuant to that Act by officers at the St George Local Area Command, with which officers he was familiar, they would have been required to enter such matters in the COPS system (the Police data base for activities relating to investigations). The COPS system could have been checked at any time prior to the interview that he conducted with the accused. Although he himself did not check the COPS system before the completion of the interview because, in the circumstances as he understood them, he did not believe there was a reason to do so. He said that he did not know the mental status of the accused or any history that the accused had of dealings with the Mental Health Liaison officer attached to the Kogarah offices of the St George Local Area Command. He had never dealt with any mental health issues in relation to the accused. I accept this evidence. Nor had he ever had occasion to review COPS entries in the past, that is, prior to 24 September 2013, reflecting upon the mental health issues of the accused, if any.
	
	
	The evidence established that in April 2012 and again in July 2013 the accused had been dealt with by officers of the St George Local Area Command, one of whom was the Mental Health Liaison officer, either pursuant to s 22 requirements or in relation to matters requiring hospital and medical examination of the accused as to his mental status at the request of the Community Corrections Service. Part of the material presented to the Court was a collection of hospital notes from the St George Hospital relating to the treatment of the accused for a variety of complaints, including committal to a mental health facility at the hospital on 8 April 2012, in December 2012, and again in July 2013 when the accused was ""handled"" by Sergeant Quinn, the mental health liaison officer to whom I previously referred.
	
	
	In April 2012 the accused was detained for a period of time exhibiting aggression, paranoia, mood swings including crying, with a history of having previously absconded from the mental health facility at the hospital. In July 2013 the Community Corrections officer, whose emails are part of the hospital record, reflected his concern about the accused's lack of insight into his mental health, his risk to himself and others, his paranoia and his hostility. When he was treated in December 2012 the hospital records reveal that he was suffering what was understood to be a drug induced psychosis arising from polysubstance abuse and ""amphetamine intoxication.""
	
	
	The evidence in the reports of the psychologist and the psychiatrist not called to give evidence is primarily concerned with the issue of whether the accused suffered from, in 2013, an intellectual disability. If so, the degree to which he may have been disabled. Dr Protulipac's report concluded that the accused had an intellectual disability for a long period of time, was “low” in intelligence, and was unable to maintain any program designed for him because these programs were beyond his level of comprehension.
	
	
	The sources of information upon which he reached his conclusion were consultations with the accused for the purposes of preparing the report, six sessions of psychological therapy, and access to a number of documents including a report from Community Corrections and historical documents relating to his criminal history, his custody record, as well as what was said to be an ""agreed facts"" for a matter for sentence with which I am not concerned. I have not been provided with that material but I understand in general terms what that material may be.
	
	
	The only psychometric testing undertaken by the psychologist, however, were the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories. He said that what would distinguish the accused's mild intellectual disability from a more severe form was his reasonable ability to appreciate the outcome of planned actions.
	
	
	The psychiatrist, Dr Lakicevic, with access to more presentence reports than the psychologist, criminal histories, as well as Dr Protulipac's psychological report, having conducted a clinical examination, came to the conclusion that the accused had a ""substance use disorder"", a “dysthymic disorder” and was of “subnormal intelligence"". He had no access to any results of psychometric testing for intellectual and cognitive ability and considered the diagnosis of intellectual disability, as he expressed it, as being based upon a history of poor academic achievement and poor comprehension and his performance on what he described as ""cognitive testing,"" which I take must have been either the Beck Inventories conducted by the psychologist or the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) which he undertook.
	
	
	The Mini-Mental State Examination is well known to be a shorthand method of getting what could be called a preliminary impression or assessment of a person's cognitive and memory capacities. It is certainly not an exhaustive cognitive test. From that latter examination, in the psychiatrist's view, the accused showed cognitive impairment in relation to memory and attention and also showed deficits in ""frontal lobe testing"". He was assessed on what the psychiatrist described, without explaining, as a ""Global Assessment of Functioning"" as having a score of 60 to 70, signifying ""mild to moderate impairment and symptomology."" He said the accused had basic literary skills and had a history of work in the past but that his overall social performance was indicative of ""moderate to mild intellectual impairment.""
	
	
	I am mindful of the fact that the psychiatrist also recorded a history of symptoms and behaviours suggestive of depressive illness, which led, I assume, to the assessment of the presence of a 'dysthymic' disorder.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro, as I earlier indicated, prepared a report but also gave evidence. The report was primarily based upon a telephone conversation with the accused of relatively short duration. It included, in an overall 30 minute period, about 10 minutes of abbreviated verbal testing which might be described as cognitive assessment or a comprehension assessment which was all that was permitted having regard to the conditions of the interview.
	
	
	His conclusion was that the accused suffered from an intellectual disability. He based that opinion upon the presentation in the interview, which was by telephone, although he did say in oral evidence it was confirmed by his meeting of the accused outside this Court last Friday; the accused's response to testing and the correlation of the findings he made on his own examination with that of previous reports. He noted the difficulties of the accused throughout his life in education attainment and employment. He noted poor comprehension in the testing and he also noted that the low level of cognition that he believed the accused was to be assessed in the context of the history of drug use. He referred to what he described as ""the poor answers provided in the police record of interview."" In that regard, as I understood his evidence, he had access to four pages of the transcript of the interview, not the entire interview. It is an assessment with which I could not agree in a global or detailed fashion having seen the interview and having regard to the full transcript of that interview.
	
	
	I note in this regard that he obtained from the history given by the accused a claim of ""no memory of part of the police interview"" that was provided to him to consider. This aspect of the history in my view is not reliable.
	
	
	The accused also claimed to Mr Watson-Munro that he had ingested between 0.5 to a gram of ""ice"" prior to the interview occurring, although it would appear Mr Watson-Munro did not actually record at what time this quantity of ice had been ingested. The history of ""ice"" consumption given by the accused in the interview at Q 322 is in my view at odds with the history that he gave to Mr Watson-Munro. He said in the course of the interview, that he and his brother had used ""2.2 each"" without further particulars.
	
	
	It was posited by Mr Watson-Munro that his history of drug usage, including reference by him to the hospital records that he saw before he gave evidence that I have read in detail, had to be considered in the context of the findings of a paper by Dr Mary Holley published in the North Dakota Law Review of 2006. This article, which I believe I have seen before, reflects upon brain damage caused by the use of amphetamines through three major mechanisms that are set out in Part II of the paper. The effect upon amphetamines upon pre-existing mental illness and the restriction upon cognitive ability, attention span and emotional stability by methylamphetamine addiction over a period within 12 months after an ""addict"" ceases methylamphetamine use.
	
	
	The paper reflects on physiological examination of brain damage through scans and the like caused by the use of methylamphetamines. It essentially urges sentencing officers in the United States, probation authorities, corrective services and those administering and supervising death penalty cases to reflect upon the long term damage caused by amphetamine use and its relevance to criminal behaviour. In her paper she pointed out that the extent of damage is very much a matter of degree depending upon usage, the period of time of usage, the intensity of usage and the like. I read that paper with interest. It provides some information that was not known to the Court but largely its relevant findings seem to me to be either uncontroversial well known. It is not of real significance in resolving this matter.
	
	
	It must be said that in this particular case I have no detailed history of amphetamine use in the immediate period of time prior to the interview being undertaken or long term. But I do note, of course, the significant entries in the St George Hospital notes reflecting upon the effects of amphetamine use, particularly in April and December 2012.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro accepted in his oral evidence that his testing was limited. It did not reflect the full psychometric testing, which is self-evident, and his opinions were in part based upon glimpses of history provided by the accused in conjunction with the opinions held in other reports. He accepted and noted that he did not have any school records or contemporaneous records to support matters of history provided by the accused. The time for a telephone assessment was limited. There were no comprehensive actuarial tests available to him, particularly tests undertaken when the accused was at school, although he was aware of the hospital records to which I have earlier referred.
	
	
	So far as the relevant legislative provisions relevant to the consideration of this matter, I was taken, from the perspective of the accused, to a number of matters. Putting aside the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act to which I briefly made reference, I was taken to LEPRA, particularly the definitions section, s 3, s 109 setting out the ‘Objects’ of Pt 9 of the Act and particular provisions within Pt 9, a very important Part as it relates to police investigation, detention and questioning of suspects, specifically ss 122, 123 and 129.
	
	
	With regard to the Regulation the Court was taken by the defence to Pt 3, Div 1 and Div 3. Particularly within Div 3, Regulations 23 to 34. The Crown very helpfully took the Court also to Schedule 2 of the Regulation, particularly Pt 1 para 3 to which I will refer in a moment.
	


Submissions


	
	I was assisted by detailed written submissions by counsel for the accused and oral submissions by him and from the learned Crown Prosecutor. In summarising the written submissions of the accused, bearing in mind of course the evidence on the voir dire included other material that had previously been tendered, including most notably exhibit 4, the Custody Management Record prepared by a custody manager who had first assessed the accused on his arrival at the Kogarah Police Station, it was submitted that up until an early part of the electronic interview the position of the accused was not ""exceptional,"" having regard to the relevant requirements that LEPRA places upon relevant custody managers.
	
	
	For the purposes of this voir dire examination it was submitted, and I did not hear the Crown to demur, that by reference to the definition of ""custody manager"" in the Act it could be said that not only was the custody manager Sergeant Bennie who completed the Custody Management Record, but also Senior Constable Otley and/or Maher, because at relevant times each of these officers had the care and management and care of the accused within their thrall.
	
	
	The written submissions make reference to the requirements of s 122, but in the context of the obligations of Sergeant Bennie, and particularly the entries made relevant to this accused in the Custody Management Record, no special obligation fell upon Sergeant Bennie, given his recorded observations of the accused of that time.
	
	
	The critical matter, however, it was submitted in the written submissions, and this is very much a summary in an attempt to extract the essence of those submissions, arose in the context of questions 31 to 34 of the questions recorded in the transcript. Question 31 reads relevantly:
	


“...And what do you do for work?

A. Looking for a job, MTC and that.

Q32. Okay, is that traffic management?

A. The mental health sends me there.

Q33. Okay.

A. Upstairs just to look for a job up there.

Q34. Which mental health clinic do you go to?

A. ...And it's under Mental Health Act, 22, number 22.”


	
	I should also cite, for the purposes of this judgment ,question 35, the officer’s next question :
	


“Q. Okay. It's been alleged that at about 2.55 on Tuesday 24 September 2013..etc.”…

when the general allegation of a robbery having been committed is put.


	
	It is submitted on behalf of the accused that at that point the interview should have been terminated for the reasons set out in paragraph 12 of the written submissions filed on behalf of the accused. Such inquiries as are suggested could have been made would have permitted the protective requirements of provisions of LEPRA and the related Regulation to be considered and, if need be, invoked. This could have led to the termination of the interview completely or a suspension to arrange the presence of a support person that is permitted under the Regulation in respect of a vulnerable suspect. This may have ultimately caused the interview to take a different course, which at that stage, at question 34, had primarily dealt with personal matters and formal matters but not the substance of the allegations against the accused.
	
	
	In the submissions filed on behalf of the accused complaint is made that the evidence suggests, based upon the account given by the accused to the police at Q 55, that he, the accused, did not have reasonable rest before being interviewed. Further, there is complaint that the accused, in the circumstances in which he presented himself, had not been given medical attention as may be required by s 129 LEPRA, flowing amongst other things, it was said, from Constable Zammit's observations of the accused, the indicia of drug use by the presence of the drug pipe and, if need be, the knowledge of either Mr Zammit or Mr Otley of the accused's background in the context of the hospital records relating to the accused's prior contact with police.
	
	
	Further, it is submitted that the Court could not be satisfied that the rights of the accused were understood by him or objectively explained to him properly in the circumstances, particularly noting the Objects of Pt 9 include, as set out in s 109(c), providing for ""the rights of the person detained.""
	
	
	In that regard it is submitted, having regard to the psychological and medical evidence, in the context of the submission that relevant police were aware of his drug use in the past and his use of prohibited drugs some time shortly before his arrest, the accused would not have had the capacity to understand or comprehend the rights he had not to be interviewed, would not have understood any caution administered and had no capability of exercising his rights as afforded by Pt 9 of the legislation.
	
	
	These matters, it was submitted, were pertinent to the test of admissibility arising in s 85(2) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Admissions are an exception to the ‘hearsay evidence rule’ in the Evidence Act. In a criminal proceeding an admission made by an accused person to an investigating officer in the course of the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence, amongst other matters, is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made was such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. This means that if issues arise in relation to consideration of s 85(2), the prosecution must establish that the circumstances in which the admission were made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.
	
	
	Further, it is submitted that all these matters need to be assessed in the context of the wider New South Wales Police Code of Conduct and Ethics and the Code of Practice for CRIME, that I need not dilate upon.
	
	
	The court was also taken to extracts of the decision of the High Court in EM v The Queen [2007] HCA 46 particularly at [109] in the observations of Gummow J and Hayne J and the observations of Giles J in an uncited case at [54] and [58].
	
	
	The oral submissions of counsel for the accused concentrated on the proposition that the accused's history of drug use, admissions of recent drug use, references to ""22"" and ""mental health"" in the interview, the interviewing officers knowledge of him in the context of the psychiatric and psychological assessments and medical histories, the contact with other police and the like ,should have at least caused the interview to be suspended at Q 34 and that what followed either had a taint of unreliability such as to warrant exclusion pursuant to s 85(2) of the Act or constitute an unfairness to warrant exercise of a discretion available pursuant to s. 90 of the Act.
	
	
	The Crown very helpfully submitted that the issue of the intellectual disability was a matter of degree and even if the accused was relevantly on the evidence ""a vulnerable person"" within the meaning of the Act and the Regulation, this could only lead to an arrangement for a support person to be organised and would not affect the integrity of the interview given by the accused.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out as I had discussed earlier with counsel for the accused that Reg 24 of the Act, which refers to vulnerable persons, including ""a person who has quite impaired intellectual function"" which is the particular aspect of the matter raised by the accused, does not include a person ""whom the custody manager reasonably believes is not a person falling within any of those categories"".
	
	
	It is submitted that Sergeant Benny, the initial custody manager and then Detective Otley as ""a custody manager” for the time being could not be said to have a reasonable basis for concluding that the accused was a vulnerable person all matters taken into account having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	It is submitted by the Crown that on - if I could call it using my words - the empirical evidence, that is in the contents of the interview itself and on the unsatisfactory character of the medical and psychological evidence, there was no reasonable basis objectively and certainly none arising from the understanding of, for example Senior Constable Otley, in circumstances of the interview that there was no reasonable basis to conclude that he was vulnerable person or that the circumstances of the interview such that his condition was likely to affect the truthfulness of the admissions made by the accused.
	
	
	The Crown said that the ‘Guidelines’ of the Schedule of the Regulation demonstrated that the conduct of the police was reasonable. There was nothing in the evidence to show that the accused satisfied any of characteristics of a person who would warrant further inquiry or which would flag concern, particularly having regard to Sch 2 setting out ""Guidelines for custody managers and other police officers"".
	
	
	Those particular ‘Guidelines’ provide that, in considering whether a detained person has total or partial loss of his or her mental function or a disorder or malfunction that results in a person learning differently from a person without the disorder or malfunction, the custody manager for the detained person should have regard to whether the person appears to have difficulty understanding questions and instructions; to respond inappropriately or inconsistently to questions or have a short attention span, or receives a disability support pension or resides at a group home or institution or is employed at a sheltered workshop or undertakes education, or has been educated at a special school or special education classes at a mainstream school, or has an inability to understand a caution given to the person under s 122 of the Act.
	
	
	The Crown says that is when one has regard to those Guidelines even if one were to accept them as being inclusive not exclusive as clearly they must be, the accused could not be said to satisfy any of those matters. There was no evidence that the accused was on a disability support pension and the contents of the interview speak for themselves. The accused was not subject to any special educational or other arrangements.
	


Consideration


	
	The submissions made in the written submissions, although not particularly pressed in the oral submissions, about the conduct of the initial custody manager who prepared the custody record and what he may or may not have done pursuant to Pt 9 particularly by regard to s 122 and the endeavours to ensure that the accused understood the caution, in my view, failed in limine, having regard particularly to the Custody Management Record itself. In any event, the custody manager who prepared that record was never requested to attend to give evidence and to explain any potential shortfalls or gaps said to arise in the circumstances of the case but which are not contained within the record. The record in its terms shows no basis for concern particularly having regard to the Guidelines to which I have earlier referred. Nor is there any basis to conclude, notwithstanding that the accused stated he had been awake for eighteen hours until 6am ,that the accused required a rest period in accordance with the relevant Pt 9 obligations.
	
	
	I might compare this accused's presentation to that of Mr Youssef in his interview. The accused was alert and alive and perhaps a little hyperactive it might be said and I hasten to say in some part from methylamphetamine use. But that of itself, is not significant.
	
	
	The presentation of the accused during the course of the interview and the Custody Management Record demonstrate that the accused was alert. In the interview he was aware of his surroundings and he was able to answer questions put to him in a reasonably direct fashion. I also note, as I must, in the course of the interview the responses given by the accused in regard to the formal questions obliged under Pt 9, at the beginning of the interview and the final questions asked of him, both by him and the interviewing police and then the ""independent officer“.
	
	
	Although the accused did not have any difficulty, in my view, understanding questions and instructions on the evidence of the interview, it might be said there may have been some inconsistency to questions, some slight inappropriateness of expression from him on occasions, although that was not to a major extent. It may be said also that aspects of his responses might reflect some short attention span.  But those matters in my view were not decisive and if they stood alone would not provide a basis for exclusion.
	
	
	Ultimately, the evidence demonstrates that there was nothing exceptional about the conduct of Senior Constable Zammit or of Senior Constable Otley up until the commencement of the interview and in the general conduct of the interview save for a one material matter. There was nothing exceptional about the conduct of the original custody management officer.
	
	
	In relation to Senior Constable Zammit's evidence, there was no admission or statement made by the accused to explain his connection with the ""ice pipe"" and there was no evidence available to Mr Zammit as to who used it and when.
	
	
	In any event, the accused later told the interviewers as earlier explained, particularly at Q. 322 that he had used methyl-amphetamine, as I understand it, late that previous evening.
	
	
	I accept however on the totality of the evidence that it has been established on balance that the accused has an intellectual disability that has existed most likely during his life and certainly is not initially attributable to the methylamphetamine use, although it may possibly have been aggravated to some degree by the use of that drug. But I have no particular evidence beyond the matters set out in Dr Holley's paper.
	
	
	However, the psychological evidence and the psychiatric evidence, such as it is, is not specific enough nor empirically precise enough to establish the extent of that disability. It may be, ""slight"" or ""mild"" or ""borderline"", but the totality of the evidence establishes that the accused was at the time “intellectually impaired”. Accepted and well known methods of assessing the level of intellectual functioning and rating a particular person within a particular age group in a range of cognitive and other intellectual functions was not undertaken. Ultimately it might be said that the opinions of each of the experts are impressionistic, limited to a large extent of the history dependent upon the truthfulness and reliability of the accused. A dangerous course for example with a person who has a proven intellectual disability I hasten to say. I note his clinical presentation in the 2013 reports and more recently to Mr Watson-Munro who conducted what was an inadequate and incomplete psychometric examination. I am not criticising any of these reporters but this is just the bold fact of the matter and it denies the Court information within the expertise of the psychologists to point to what could be called ""an objective evidence"" that can assist the Court to make a more precise conclusion.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Watson-Munro, I noted in his assessment of the accused, he described him at the commencement of the report as being ""quite intellectually dull"". However this comment could only have been based, at that point of writing, upon the telephone conversation he had with him. There are dangers to be had with having telephone interviews with people just as there are dangers to be had with having one on one interview with people, as the case of Bill Bayeh demonstrated through the evidence of the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service. Ultimately, having regard to the evidence of Mr Watson-Munro of his contact with the accused last Friday, I am satisfied that it was the accused to whom he spoke.
	
	
	He may have given the same ""quite intellectually dull"" appearance to police officers with whom he dealt with, particularly Detective Otley, but Detective Otley could not be said or could be expected to have the clinical skills required to reach any firm conclusions on this matter through brief face to face meetings or in any past experience of him. In general terms, I accept the evidence of Detective Otley about his extent of the contact with the accused. Neither were the police qualified to assess his level or method of communication, which, as I would understand it from my limited understanding of the accused's background could well be affected by cultural issues and limited educational opportunity. To my mind, in the context of my understanding of the character of psychological examinations for a number of years as a judge and then before that as a lawyer, Mr Watson-Munro's testing on only limited verbal subsets is made less reliable by what I perceive to be educational attainment and cultural matters. Of course, the education of the accused, the history of which I do not doubt may well be greatly influenced by his intellectual disability.
	
	
	As I said earlier, the interview itself shows that the accused was able to understand the questions asked of him by police and he appeared to give coherent account of himself, admittedly in a pleading, sometimes emotional manner, begging to be believed in the context of him clearly understanding that he was being interviewed about a serious matter. He clearly understood that he is arrested in compromising circumstances.
	
	
	I understand on the evidence with no detail provided that he would have been concerned further because of his apparently regular recent contact with police in relation to other unrelated matters. There is no evidence that Constable Zammit or Detective Otley reviewed COPS records before the interview was conducted or that they had any specific knowledge of mental health issues before the interview commenced. No evidence exists of them having any connection with the matters the subject of s 22 Mental Health Act, actions by police officers.
	
	
	Nothing arises from Exhibit 4 to suggest that the custody manager would, on the basis of the responses that he recorded, be enlivened to consider the impact of Regs 23 to 34, within the terms of the Guidelines under Sch 2, or for other reasons. It would seem that there was nothing about the accused that would have prompted concern. There was nothing about the accused's status with government benefits that would have prompted concern given that he told one of the psychologists in 2013 that he was in receipt of Centrelink ""New Start"" allowance, which is not a disability pension.
	
	
	However, as to the interview itself the reference to s 22 Mental Health Act by the accused was a matter that required consideration from the officer. He in fact gave evidence about this aspect of the matter.
	
	
	In the cross-examination of him by Mr McCrudden, this is what occurred at p 63 of the evidence of 12 March 2015:
	


“Q. Having regard to the fact that Raja had indicated to you that he was operating pursuant to s 22, is there any reason you didn't stop the interview to investigate that aspect?

A. When someone mentions to me that they are mentally ill I like to ask them further questions and see what their responses are to see if they are coherent. I have dealt with mental health for seven years, both on and off work, and I don't believe that Raja at the time was under any form of mental illness?

Q. You said you would like to ask a few more questions to determine the lay of the land, as it were?

A. I continued with the interview and assessed him as the interview continued.

Q. In carrying out that assessment you weighed up the for and against in relation to whether or not he appeared to you to have any sort of mental illness?

A. Yes, he was obviously visually upset in the interview but that's what Raja is like when he's in custody.""


	
	That may be all well and good, but there lies the nub of the matter in the context of what I have earlier pointed out. After being told about the relevance of ""mental health 22"" the police officer pressed on questioning the accused about the very subject matter of the investigation. I appreciate that in the difficult tasks that he performs as a policeman no doubt he has dealt with many people that he subsequently discovered, or has viewed at the time, to be suffering from some form of mental illness or mental disability. But he provided no evidence to me of having any particular clinical skill or even qualification to assess the impact of a mental illness or a disability, intellectually or otherwise, upon a person's capacity to do justice to themselves or to understand precisely what is going on.
	
	
	Most importantly in this matter, on his own account, he said he was ignorant of the actual medical and/or mental health condition of the accused but, importantly, he knew the implications of the action under s 22 Mental Health Act. He determined, as he said in his evidence, that he was satisfying himself on those matters by further questioning the accused about the subject matter of the investigation, as I would understand it, in order to conclude whether the accused was fit to be interviewed and required any protection or consideration in accordance with Pt 9 of LEPRA and the Regulation concerning people that were relevantly ""vulnerable"".
	
	
	I do not mean to be at all critical of Mr Otley doing a difficult job, trying to deal with the three accused suspects, they having been recently arrested in relation to a recently conducted crime, but with respect, on his account, he put the ‘cart before the horse’ so to speak. The approach he took precluded doing precisely what the legislation and the Regulation are specifically enacted to require. What he did involved taking a course that can only be taken when all relevant protections under the Act or Regulation have either been provided or considered and discounted. Mr McCrudden drew my attention to the Objects of Pt 9 of the Act in s 109. He took me to a consideration of the general ethical considerations that obviously permeate police work. These matters arise that from this legislation are not there by chance. This legislation was introduced ultimately to provide both protection to police and suspects and was legislation ultimately created in the wake of the Wood Royal Commission into the Police and brought an end of course to the heinous practices of verballing and to some extent other matters of which a great deal of evidence was given before the Royal Commission for which there was then no legislative protection.
	
	
	On Mr Otley's own account, having been alerted that the accused had some connection with s 22 Mental Health Act, a section that is concerned with the responsibility of police officers, he could not know at that point that the accused did not have a mental illness that was chronic or did not have a mental disorder that required medical treatment or had some other conditions that otherwise would mandate the need for a support person or, most importantly, to assist the accused to ensure that he understood his rights. Nor was he in a position to understand whether the special measures, such as provided for in s 122 of the Act, would be implemented. The legislative purpose and intent of this provision was not observed simply by continuing to ask questions and assuming that incriminating answers or admissions were in fact reliable or were given in full understanding of the right to remain silent. Given that the inquiry on COPS, if it had been made at that point, would have revealed specific matters that were flagged on the computer system, as I understand it, relevant to “s 22” action and given a later admission of the ingestion of amphetamines by the accused prior to the interview, although the accused does not give the appearance of intoxication or psychosis, the failure to stop at Q 34 and consider the situation to determine whether the implications of Regs 23, 24, 25 and 26, were satisfied was a substantial failing on his part. If he had done so he would have been required to take appropriate action to ensure fairness in the interview situation. As it was he permitted himself to ask further questions of the suspect who objectively was ""a vulnerable person"", because he was ""intellectually impaired"" to some extent at that time and may have had other mental disorders at the time now undetectable.
	
	
	In considering the matter I have examined the contents of the interview of the accused and his manner and demeanour in answering the questions. In the context of what I understand to be other evidence in the Crown case, I have satisfied myself that the prosecution has discharged the obligation upon it that arises under s 85(2). The accused's responses may be partially exculpatory of the particular allegations that arise given, as I would understand it, some objective features of the Crown case.
	
	
	However, whilst the reliability of the subsequent answers by the accused after Q 34 are not impugned or are unlikely to be impugned by his apparent condition at the time, I regard the failure to do what the spirit of Pt 9 and the particulars of the Regulations required, that is to provide protection to a ‘vulnerable person’, rendered the subsequent questioning of the accused to be unfair and to warrant exercise of the discretion to exclude the contents of the interview. Reliability of the answers may have been affected in any event by intellectual disability, ingestion of drugs or underlying mental disorder previously treated. But it would seem to be not to do so on balance. However, reliability is not critical to the exercise of this function. This was discussed in the common law context in Forster v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 550 (at 554-7).  
	
	
	The consideration of s 90, in the context of understanding past common law principles relevant to the “fairness discretion” has been had by a number of courts, particularly the High Court in EM v The Queen [2007] HCA 46. I bear in mind the observations of the Gummow and Hayne JJ at [109] of that case and also the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [30]. There are also observations about the width of meaning of s 90 by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in EM, particularly in para [56]. This is not a case where the police were taking advantage of the accused's stupidity about which Gleeson CJ and Hayne J spoke at [77] in EM: It is not a case of ""deliberate deception"". It is a case in my view of being put on notice of a relevant matter then failing to examine and consider the protection that LEPRA and its Regulations permitted and, if need be, required. I might point out also, being put on notice of relevant matters, quite inadvertently by the accused, that required further inquiry (see EM at [112]).
	
	
	It may be said that the admissions that the accused made, could be seen as exculpatory, particularly in relation to count 2, the alternative count. There may not be any ready admission of knowledge of material facts essential to the proof of guilt. This is very much in the thrall of the trier of fact. But this is not a matter that ultimately warrants, in my view in the consideration of the exercise of a discretion, the admission of the interview given its potential to prove matters relevant to the counts in the indictment if admitted. The account given by the accused, if admitted, could be rejected by the tribunal of fact material having regard to the other evidence which is available to establish his guilt on the Crown case.
	
	
	It must be said that proof of guilt in relation specifically to count 2 is not dependent necessarily solely and substantially upon the contents of the interview. This is certainly a matter for the triers of fact. The facts of the matter are, however, that objection was taken to it and in the context of the evidence available to me on the voir dire I have concluded, in exercise of that discretion, I should exclude it.
	
	
	In my view there is thus no need to consider the terms of s 138 Evidence Act 1995.

		21 April 2015",2015-03-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703767,AF v R [2015] NSWCCA 35,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: AF (“the applicant”) seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against what is said to be an interlocutory judgment or order made by her Honour Judge Payne in the District Court at Parramatta on 17 December 2014.
	


Background


	
	The applicant was arrested on 7 August 2012 and charged in relation to the alleged sexual assault of a woman at Glendenning on 12 May 2012. The Crown proposes that he be tried on five accounts of aggravated sexual assault in company contrary to s 61JA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The matter was listed for trial on 28 October 2013 but that date was vacated on the basis that the Crown sought that the complainant be psychiatrically assessed in relation to possible cognitive impairment.
	
	
	The complainant was interviewed and assessed by Dr Susan Pulman, a clinical neuropsychologist and forensic psychologist, on 28 October 2013 and by Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, on 16 June 2014. Both assessed the complainant as being cognitively impaired.
	
	
	The complainant had made written statements to the police dated 18 May 2012 and 26 July 2012. However, at the behest of the Crown, she was reinterviewed on 24 October 2013 by police and gave a further account of what she said had occurred to her.
	
	
	On 14 October 2014 the Crown filed a Notice of Motion seeking declarations that the complainant was a “vulnerable person” within the meaning of s 306M of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and that the facts of the case could be better ascertained if her evidence was given as provided by s 306S(1)(a), namely by means of the playing of a recording of her previous representations made to police in the recorded interview of 24 October 2013.
	
	
	The matter came before her Honour Judge Payne on 17 December 2014. After hearing evidence and submissions her Honour granted the Crown’s applications and provided reasons.
	
	
	It is in respect of her Honour’s rulings that the present application for leave to appeal is made.
	


The statutory scheme for the giving of evidence by a cognitively impaired person


	
	The provisions within Ch 6 Pt 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act, headed “Giving of evidence by vulnerable persons” and comprising ss 306M-306ZP, are relevant to the present application. “Vulnerable person” is defined to mean “a child or a cognitively impaired person”: s 306M(1).
	
	
	The complainant has a “cognitive impairment” on the basis that she has a “severe mental illness” which is included in the definition of a “cognitive impairment” in s 306M(2). She is therefore a “cognitively impaired person” within the meaning of that term in s 306M(1). No question was raised in the present application about her Honour being satisfied as to this matter.
	
	
	Section 306P(2) provides that “to the extent that this Part applies to cognitively impaired persons, this Part applies (unless a contrary intention is shown) in relation to evidence given by a cognitively impaired person in the manner provided by this Part only if the court is satisfied that the facts of the case may be better ascertained if the person’s evidence is given in such a manner”.
	
	
	Division 3 (ss 306R-306Z) is headed, “Giving evidence of out of court representations”. It applies to “evidence of a previous representation of a vulnerable person made in the course of an interview during which the person is questioned by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence”: s 306R(1).
	
	
	Section 306S provides that a vulnerable person may give evidence, wholly or partly, (a) of a previous representation in the form of a recording of the making of the representation during the course of an interview (per s 306R(1)); (b) orally in the courtroom; or (c) by way of closed-circuit television (per Div 4).
	
	
	Section 306U establishes an entitlement for a vulnerable person to give evidence in chief of a previous representation by way of a recording made by an investigating official of the interview in which the representation was made. Notwithstanding that entitlement, a vulnerable person must not give evidence by such means if the court orders that they not be used: s 306Y(1). “The court may only make such an order if it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice for the vulnerable person’s evidence to be given by a recording”: s 306Y(2).
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant relied upon the following amended grounds of appeal:
	


1.   (Abandoned prior to the hearing.)

2.   Her Honour erred by failing to take into account all relevant factors in considering the test set out in s 306P(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, when determining if the facts of the case could be better ascertained by the complainant’s evidence being given by way of a recording.

2A.   Her Honour erred in failing to give adequate reasons for her findings pursuant to s 306P.

3.   Her Honour erred in finding that the interview the complainant participated in on 24 October 2013, was an interview taken by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence (see s 306R(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act).

4.   Her Honour erred in construing s 306R of the Criminal Procedure Act in a manner that placed an onus on the accused.

5.   Her Honour erred in not making a finding under s 306Y of the Criminal Procedure Act that it is not in the interests of justice for the complainant’s evidence to be given by way of a recording.

5A.   Her Honour erred in failing to give adequate reasons for not making an order under s 306Y.


	
	At the hearing, counsel for the applicant accepted that grounds 2A and 5A added nothing; success depended upon him making good any of grounds 2, 3, 4 or 5.
	
	
	There is, however, a fundamental difficulty concerning the question of whether the matter properly comes within the ambit of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act at all. I will turn to that issue directly but will first state the conclusions I have arrived at after a consideration of the submissions in support of the grounds. In short, I am unpersuaded that any of the asserted errors are made out.
	
	
	As to ground 2, it was well open to Payne DCJ to be satisfied of the “facts of the case may be better ascertained” requirement in s 306P(2). The expert evidence, which was not challenged, strongly supported such a conclusion. The presence of any inconsistencies or inadequacies in the complainant’s account in the recorded interview, or any contamination that might be thought to be discernible, did not mandate a conclusion to the contrary. As a practical reality, it might be thought highly likely that such issues would be explored regardless of the manner in which the complainant gave evidence.
	
	
	Grounds 3 and 4 are based upon a contention that the recording of the interview on 24 October 2013 was for the purpose of the prosecution and had nothing to do with the investigation of the alleged offences. The applicant’s submission was that an interview had to be “for the purpose of” or “in connection with” an investigation; “there has to be some investigative purpose underlying it” (23.2.15 at T8.30; 11.5).
	
	
	There is no clear distinction between something done in connection with, or for the purposes of, an investigation rather than a prosecution. Much activity might be characterised as being for the purposes of both. In my view, the term must be interpreted broadly having regard to the overall context in which it is used as well as the beneficial purposes sought to be achieved by Ch 6 Pt 6 Div 6 (Six benefits were identified when these provisions were first introduced in the Evidence (Children) Act 1997 (NSW)). Given the view I have come to on the jurisdictional issue I will refrain from saying more on the subject.
	
	
	As to ground 5, the learned judge referred to various reasons advanced on behalf of the applicant for it not being in the interests of justice that the complainant’s evidence be given in part by way of a recorded interview. She succinctly concluded that none of them persuaded her that it would not be in the interests of justice. The types of matters relied upon by the applicant (inconsistencies in the complainant’s account in the recorded interview; matters requiring clarification because of imprecise language used; a question as to whether the complainant suffered from hallucinations at the time of the interview) are largely matters that would arise regardless of the manner in which the evidence was given. They did not mandate a finding by the trial judge that it was “not in the interests of justice”.
	


Jurisdiction under s 5F(3)


	
	The Crown contended in written submissions that the appeal was incompetent in that it did not concern “an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings”. It relied in part upon the decision of this Court in EK v R [2009] NSWCCA 4; 75 NSWLR 302 which was concerned with a decision about the admissibility of a complainant’s evidence at a “re-trial” (in fact, it was a special hearing under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW)).
	
	
	The particular focus in EK v R was upon s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides for the tender by the Crown in a new trial, of a record of the evidence given by a complainant in an earlier trial where the earlier trial resulted in the jury not reaching a verdict or resulted in discontinuation for any other reason. Johnson J, with whom Grove and Blanch JJ agreed, stated:
	


“[14] Section 306I lies within Chapter 6 (ss.274-306ZP) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, entitled “Evidentiary Matters”. Part 5 of Chapter 6 (ss.290-306L) is entitled “Evidence in Sexual Offence Proceedings”. Section 306I lies within Division 4 (ss.306H-306L) which is entitled “Special Provisions Relating to Subsequent Trials of Sexual Offence Proceedings”. The heading to s.306I is “Admission of evidence of complainant in new trial proceedings”.

[15] I am satisfied that the present decision constituted a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. The decision under challenge involved determination of the threshold question as to whether the procedure under s.306I was available where evidence is tendered at a special hearing. It was the first step to be considered concerning the admissibility of evidence tendered by the Crown. The decision under challenge involves a step along the way of a path concerning the admissibility of evidence. Whether that evidence is admitted, ultimately, will depend upon outstanding statutory matters under s.306I(3) and (5) concerning admissibility. The principle in R v Steffan, which has been applied repeatedly by this Court, has application to this case.”


	
	The Crown seemed to place some weight on the fact that the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act under consideration in EK v R and the relevant provisions in this appeal, were in the same Chapter concerned with “evidentiary matters”. This was said to support the proposition, as was held to be the case in EK v R, that the rulings in the present case were also decisions concerned with the admissibility of evidence. I am unable to accept the Crown’s submissions in this respect.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the decision in R v RAG [2006] NSWCCA 343. That case concerned an appeal by the Crown against a trial judge’s decision that a complainant was not competent to give unsworn evidence according to the criteria required by s 13(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) concerning alleged sexual assaults upon her by the respondent.
	
	
	The judgment of Latham J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreed, included discussion about whether the appeal was brought under s 5F(2) or s 5F(3A). The former provides for a right of appeal by the Crown against an interlocutory judgment or order of the same type as s 5F(3) which provides for an appeal by “any other party to proceedings” against such a judgment or order. Section 5F(3A) provides for an appeal by the Crown against “any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence” (provided it has the effect of eliminating or substantially weakening the prosecution case). The determination of Latham J was that the appeal was properly brought under s 5F(2) on the basis that it was against an interlocutory judgment, not a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. Her Honour stated:
	


“[15] The trial judge's decision in the instant case was a judicial act that determined an identifiable or separate part of the proceedings, namely the competency of the complainant: see Steffan at 636A; Bozatsis & Spanakakis at 303. The finding that the complainant was not competent to give unsworn evidence was final, in the sense that it was not subject to review in the course of those proceedings, unlike rulings on the admissibility of evidence: Bozatsis & Spanakakis at 303. The decision may have had the consequence that the complainant’s evidence was not admitted, but the substance of the decision was of an altogether different character. It was a judgment and it was also interlocutory, in the sense that it did not finally determine the proceedings between the Director and the respondent: Pavia at 368.”


	
	I expressed a tentative view at the hearing that the issue in the present case was of a similar type to that in R v RAG. On reflection, however, I have come to the view that the applicant’s reliance upon R v RAG was misplaced. Particular regard should be had to the second sentence of the above extract from Latham J’s judgment. The present case is distinguishable by virtue of the fact that the ruling that the complainant could give evidence, in part, by way of playing the recorded interview is subject to review in the course of the proceedings. In fact, s 306ZM (in Div 5 Pt 6 Ch 6) specifically provides for such review:
	


“306ZM Court orders

The court may make, vary or revoke an order under a provision of this Part either on its own motion or on application by a party to the proceeding or by the vulnerable person giving evidence.”


	
	In R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; 129 A Crim R 126, an appeal by both Crown and accused on a joinder/severance issue which arose as a consequence of evidentiary rulings, Wood CJ at CL said the following about the jurisdiction of this Court under s 5F:
	


“[10] Essential to a review under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act is the existence of an “interlocutory judgment or order”. A wide range of matters have been held to fall within the ambit of this expression, including orders for, or refusal of, separate trials (R v Saunders and R v Georgiou (1999) NSWCCA 125). However, rulings on the admissibility of evidence have been held not to be interlocutory judgments or orders within the meaning of the section: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136, R v Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253, R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 30 and R v Bailey (1988) 36 A Crim R 633; save where the consequence of the judgment is to rule out all of the Crown evidence leaving it without a case: R v Bozatis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296.

[11] The distinction, it seems, depends in the case of a judgment, upon it determining the proceedings, or at least an identifiable part of them, and being capable of entry in the records of the Court: R v Steffan at 636; or in the case of an order, upon it amounting to a command that something be done or not done: The King v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315 at 324, 361, and Steffan at 636. In Steffan it was said that it was not immediately self evident how a ruling upon the admissibility of evidence could answer either description. Additionally it was noted that an evidentiary ruling lacks finality, in that it can be changed in the course of the trial.”


	
	It has been acknowledged that there is no bright line test for discriminating between judgments or orders, on the one hand, and rulings which do not constitute judgments or orders, on the other. After referring in this respect to the judgment of Sheller JA in R v Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197, Gleeson CJ continued in his judgment in R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303 as follows:
	


“King CJ, in Legal Practitioners’ Complaint Committee v A Practitioner (1987) 46 SASR 126 drew a distinction between judgments or orders and what he called “incidental rulings”. A judgment or order, he said, is a ‘judicial act which decides the question or one of the questions which is raised for decision in the particular proceedings’. However, rulings also decide questions. It is the character of the question, and the effect of the decision, that makes the difference.

One of the reasons given for denying to a ruling on evidence, in the ordinary case, the quality of a judgment or order is that it can be changed during the course of the proceedings. It lacks finality. It does not require a decision of an appellate court to reverse it; at least in theory the judge can be persuaded to alter it.

In Commonwealth v Mullane (1961) 106 CLR 166 the High Court had to consider whether a decision under review, which involved a ruling on a point of law, amounted to a judgment, decree, order or sentence. In a passage at 169, cited by Sheller JA in Lethlean, the court said:

‘What his Honour did was simply to give a ruling on a point of law which was raised. It did not conclude the rights of the parties before the hearing of the case was completed. The County Court judge might have altered his mind, he might have ruled otherwise, he might have qualified his ruling, there was no determination.’” [Emphasis added]


	
	The ruling of Payne DCJ is not concerned with the admissibility of evidence but with the manner in which evidence may be given. However, it has very much the same character as a procedural matter that does not finally dispose of any discrete part of the proceedings. It was not a judgment or order in the sense identified in R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 636: “the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court” or “a command by a court that something be done (or not done)”. It may be contrasted with the decision in R v RAG that a complainant was not competent to give unsworn evidence. The effect of that decision was that the complainant could not give evidence at all; it was a decision which had the effect that something not be done.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was finality in the decision to permit part of the complainant’s evidence to be given by way of playing the recorded interview: “once the video is played, it cannot be unplayed by judicial reconsideration”. However, whilst it is obvious that the recording could not be “unplayed”, if it were determined that the evidence should not have been given in that manner, there are other remedies open to a trial judge.
	
	
	It was also submitted that one of the criteria sometimes referred to in the authorities for denying jurisdiction (or leave) under s 5F does not apply in this case, namely the availability of a subsequent appeal against conviction to have the issue in question determined. The applicant pointed to s 306ZJ(1) (in Div 5 Pt 6 Ch 6):
	


“306ZJ Validity of proceedings not affected

(1) The failure of a vulnerable person to give evidence in accordance with a provision of this Part does not affect the validity of any proceeding or any decision made in connection with that proceeding.”


	
	In Panchal v R; R v Panchal [2014] NSWCCA 275 there was a ground of appeal against conviction asserting that a trial judge had erred by permitting a vulnerable complainant to give evidence by way of recorded interview and closed-circuit television without stating her satisfaction that “the facts of the case may be better ascertained if the person’s evidence is given in such a manner” (s 306P(2)). The Court (Leeming JA, Fullerton and Bellew JJ) found (at [61]) that there was nothing in the ground and that it was difficult to resist a conclusion that the judge would have been satisfied of the matter if her attention had been drawn to it (the defence acquiesced in the evidence being given as it was). However, the Court determined the ground by reference to s 306ZJ, holding that it was a “complete answer”:
	


“[63] … the ""validity"" mandated by statute denies the availability of any error which would attract the operation of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. The decision to permit evidence being adduced in accordance with ss 306U(1) and 306ZB(1) without the formation of the opinion required by 306P(2) is not susceptible to challenge.”


	
	For myself, and with great respect, I am doubtful about s 306ZJ being a complete answer to any complaint of error or miscarriage of justice in an appeal against conviction. Moreover, it should be noted that the validity mandated by the section applies in the case of “the failure of a vulnerable person to give evidence in accordance with a provision of this Part”. In Panchal v R; R v Panchal, there was no failure; the complainant in fact gave evidence in accordance with the Part.
	
	
	It is unnecessary, however, to say more about this as the availability or unavailability of an avenue of post-conviction appeal is not determinative of the question of whether a ruling has the character of being an interlocutory judgment or order.
	


Conclusion


	
	I am not persuaded that the decision of Payne DCJ to permit the complainant to give evidence in a manner that has become common practice in the case of vulnerable witnesses, by pre-recorded interview, was an interlocutory judgment or order.
	
	
	For these reasons an appeal would be incompetent.
	


Order


	
	I propose the following order:
	


Leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) refused.

		28 May 2015",2015-03-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703779,R v Youssef [2015] NSWDC 49,"Judgment

Admissibility of Electronic Interview of 24 September 2013.

Introduction


	
	The accused, Hamzey Youssef, seeks the exclusion from evidence of the electronically recorded interview conducted with him on 24 September 2013 at the St George Local Area Command situated at Kogarah. The interview was conducted from approximately 7:41 am onwards over a period of about 45 minutes. He had been arrested by police at about 3.30 am, after report of a robbery that occurred within the previous hour. The application to exclude the interview is concerned with a number of matters, each discrete in a legal sense, but requiring in some instances consideration of evidence that is common to the matters advanced.
	


The issues


	
	To summarise the situation by reference to the ultimate submissions of counsel for the accused, it is submitted that there has been a breach of s 139(3) Evidence Act 1995 (‘the Act’) and that consequently there has been an “illegality” or “impropriety” that enlivens the discretion available under s 138 of the Act. Further, in the context of the surrounding circumstances of the conduct of the interview and particularly the demeanour and presentation of the accused, including his capacity to fully participate and understand the caution to remain silent if he wished, the probative value of the contents of the interview is outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the accused of its admission and the interview should thus be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Act.
	
	
	It is further submitted that, having regard to the terms of s 85 of the Act, the contents of the interview should be excluded, it being specifically submitted that the tiredness of the accused and the possibility of the accused being drug affected were such that, in the circumstances in which relevant admissions were made, the Court could not be satisfied that it is unlikely that the truth of the submissions were adversely affected. This is a matter of which the Crown bears the onus of proof.
	
	
	Further, it is submitted that pursuant to s 90 of the Act, having regard to circumstances in which the caution was purportedly administered, the physical condition and presentation of the accused, the various answers given by the accused and other matters relating to the circumstances in which any relevant admissions were made, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence in the proceedings.
	


The voir dire


	
	The evidence on the voir dire comprised, the statement and oral evidence of the interviewing officer (Senior Constable Maher), the recording and transcript of the electronic interview, the Custody Management Record, the ‘Crown Case’ statement of facts. There was no evidence from accused. Ultimately, save for one issue that arose from evidence volunteered by Detective Maher, there was no issue as to the accuracy of the evidence of the police officer contained within his statement.
	
	
	Given the detail of the oral submissions given by counsel for the accused and the response of the prosecutor I do not propose to survey the evidence, but rather deal with the issues that emerged from the submissions.
	
	
	The key statutory provisions to which I was referred were ss 139, 138, 137, 85 and 90 of the Act. I am mindful of the need to have regard to Pt 9 of LEPRA, although ultimately no specific issue was raised in respect of any specific provision of that Act.
	
	
	There is no issue that various representations made by the accused constitute relevant “admissions” in consideration of issues arising in Pt 3.4 Evidence Act 1995. There was no issue that the terms of s 139 arose for consideration, in that there was an obligation for relevant investigating police to caution the accused in accordance with the terms of s 139(1)(c). There was no issue that if there had been a breach of s 139 consideration of s 138 arose.
	
	
	With regard to the issues that arise from the evidence concerning s 139, I accept the submissions made by counsel for the accused that in accordance with the decision of the Deng ([2001] NSWCCA 153 at [17)) the section is ‘purposive’ and is not confined to consideration of language ability. It is concerned with the capacity of an accused person to understand that he has the right to choose remained silent and that what he or she says maybe given evidence at a later time. I also have regard to the observations of Higgins J (as he then was) of the ACT Supreme Court in the decision of R v Taylor to which I was referred ([1999] ACTSC 47 at [19]-[20]).
	


The submissions


	
	It is submitted on behalf of the accused that he gave the appearance at the commencement of the interview of extreme tiredness and that the police officer, given his observations of the accused and information given to him in a previous interview of a co-accused that he believed the accused had ingested amphetamines at some earlier stage, was drug affected. Thus, the investigating officer should have known, or did know, that the accused did not understand any caution administered. The evidence of the interview shows that the accused did not hear and/or understand the caution required to be given pursuant to s 139(1)(c) of the Act.
	
	
	The passage in Taylor to which I refer, is said to give some indication of the type of matters that Detective Maher should have been put on notice of in this regard or the wider context in which s 139 obligations arise. As to consideration of s 138 Evidence Act 1995, failure to comply with s 139(1)(c) and (3), is said to constitute the impropriety or illegality that engages s 138 of the Act.
	
	
	The prosecution submitted that the fact of cautions being administered by the Custody Manager and Detective Maher before the interview, as set out in his statement, show that s 139 had been complied with in all respects. As well as what can be seen in the recording of the interview, with regard to Q 5, 6 and 7, there were the answers the accused gave later in the interview to queries about his fitness to proceed and his answers at the end of the interview to the independent officer. It was submitted that the matters raised in Taylor did not apply here, because the officer had no reason to believe that the accused was not able to understand the caution administered. There was in fact no evidence that he was not cautioned before the formal interview. The evidence it is submitted by the Crown was all ‘one way’ as to whether he understood his rights to remain silent.
	
	
	With regard to s 137, the defence submitted that the probative value of the evidence was slight, but the unfair prejudice arose from the state of the accused, which showed him in a bad light and not in a state to rationally involve himself in the interview. It was submitted that he was clearly under the influence of drugs.
	
	
	The prosecution says in its submissions that the accused was not under the influence of drugs. On the evidence the police officer did not believe so and the accused said he was not. There was nothing in the Custody Management Records to indicate that he was affected by drugs (see Exhibit 4) and in any event there was no evidence of “unfair prejudice”. The Crown submitted that in fact the accused on a number of occasions was quite lucid.
	
	
	With regard to s 85 Evidence Act 1995, the defence pointed to the accused’s tiredness and his drug affected state, with the police officer on notice of an allegation by a co-accused in an earlier interview that the accused had ingested methylamphetamine sometime earlier (Q 322 – Exhibit 12 - interview of Raja Abokhalil). It was submitted that in these circumstances there were aspects of his presentation which demonstrated the prosecution had not satisfied the subsection. He had difficulty in speaking, difficulty in remembering particular facts (such as his date of birth), wrong answers or need to correct himself and specific or general confusion in answers. If it was found that the accused was drug affected then that established there was a likelihood that the truth of any representations made by him was also impugned.
	
	
	The Crown, by reference to his presentation and his own statements, said there was no positive evidence that he was affected by drugs, that his tiredness was only evident in the early stages of the interview and that the purported untruths and inconsistencies are not because of tiredness, but arose from his endeavour to explain matters that he understood were being put to him by the police and to explain himself out of his situation.
	
	
	With regard to s 90 the defence submitted that the accused did not understand the caution, and fell asleep at key stages of the interview (around Q 8 to 9 in the transcript of the interview and on being asked Q 18). The officers could have done other things having seen him fall asleep, such as discontinuing the interview. Thus the accused was, because of his state, not able to understand his right to silence. His condition was such that he had no choice as to whether he would participate in the interview or not. The Court could draw the inference that he was in a similar state immediately before the interview when explained his rights under Pt 9 LEPRA. It was submitted that the smile of the interviewing officer, recorded being made to the other police office on the video, reflected that the officer was taking advantage of the accused.
	
	
	With regard to s 90 the Crown pointed out that he was cautioned “repeatedly” and when one looks at Q 20 - 25, the officers interviewing did all they could to ask if he wanted to continue. Both objectively and having regard to the surrounding circumstances, it was not unfair to rely upon the contents of the interview. Nothing about the circumstances of the interview affected the integrity of it. It had ceased to be unfair at the time that the accused had agreed to continue. It is submitted that when one looks at the interview in its entirety the accused understood what was happening and there was nothing said or done by the accused to make his admissions unreliable.
	
	
	In reply learned counsel for the accused referred to the video being the best evidence, the police officer had not acted reasonably in the context of the matters averted to in Taylor, here there were obvious “flags” that should have been acted upon, also referring to Deng at [17].
	


Consideration


	
	With regard to the practicalities of s 139 Evidence Act 1995, I accept the analysis of Higgins J in Taylor, and, of course, the observations in Deng as to the purpose and need for wider consideration of the situation to ensure that the caution to remain silent is understood. However, the evidence here establishes that the accused was relevantly cautioned at least twice before the interview commenced, allowing for the real possibility that the accused was in a similar tired condition at the time of the earlier interview, and had understanding throughout the interview of his entitlement to remain silent.
	
	
	I do not accept the evidence of the police officer that the accused said words to the effect that he was anxious to get on with the interview before it started, given the officer’s prepared statement does not refer to that matter. That assertion has all the hallmarks of recent invention. But I have taken this matter into account in considering other matters in the assessment of the officer’s credibility relevant to the application and nothing turns upon it given other evidence, particularly the recording of the interview. As counsel herself said, the electronic recording itself was the key evidence. Having viewed the interview, and observed the tiredness of the accused which is self evident at the beginning, I am also satisfied that the accused indicated early in the interview that he understood the caution that had been administered having regard to the particular questions that were asked and answers given at Q 5-7, as per the transcript of the interview. I am mindful that the accused stated, after being asked question 18, “I just feel asleep in there … ”. However, he was also asked by the police officers questions about whether he was ready to continue, whether he wanted a break or some refreshment, all of which he declined. He said that he did not want to have a sleep when asked if he wanted to do that (Q 20) – the answer is “Yes, yeah, no, no”. But he clearly said he did not want to sleep. He then said … “I’m all right … I’ll be all right … thank you … I’ll just stay”.
	
	
	I also have regard to, Q 308 and 312 and his direct answers to them, questions asked of him by the independent officer. I have come to the view, despite his tiredness, the accused at relevant times indicated that he understood that he did not have to answer questions, participated in the interview with that knowledge and willingly. I conclude that there was no breach of s 139 of the Act and, thus, s 138 is not engaged.
	
	
	With regard to the objection pursuant to s 137, bearing in mind for this section the Court is not required to assess the reliability of the admissions (see XY [2013] NSWCCA 121 and Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112, at [60]-[68]), in my view the probative value of the evidence is at face value considerable, having regard to what I understand to be the nature of the Crown case and the characteristics of the circumstantial evidence case that the accused’s admissions bring into dispute. These matters were summarised in the course of submissions, with the Crown also pointing out some other matters relating to CCTV footage of a person the Crown says is the accused from the previous day.
	
	
	On the other hand no relevant unfair prejudice was identified that could not be dealt with by direction or could not be met by appropriate editing of the recording, such as reliance upon the sound rather than the images, or simply tender of the transcript, assuming that its contents could be agreed upon. It would appear to me, in any event, that the appearance of the accused is something that would be relevant for argument on the behalf of the accused in assessing the weight to be given to the representations made by the accused and, if need be, to address the issue that the Crown would seek to argue that the accused told “deliberate lies” as evidence of consciousness of guilt. I would not exclude the evidence of the interview pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act. 
	
	
	With regard to s 85 and s 90, there are a number of issues that are common. I accept that the accused started out appearing very tired. I accept that on two occasions during the formal preliminary questions the accused gave the appearance of having some difficulty staying awake and on other occasions seemed to have some difficulty responding to or concentrating on particular questions. For example, in one of the preliminary questions, he was asked his birth date and initially said, “23”, which is in fact the number of an address he gives (Q 28). But I also note that he corrected himself quickly.
	
	
	However, his tiredness diminished over time and during the course of the interview he became more engaged as the interview proceeded. His answers and the method of giving them taken together as whole, lead the Court to the conclusion that he was endeavouring to explain himself out of an inculpatory situation having digested and understood aspects of the matter brought to his attention, which as I understand it are constituent parts of the Crown case to inculpate him. An example of this is his explanation as to how he may have come in contact with a replica firearm, which is also a cigarette lighter, that is said on the Crown case to be similar to the weapon used in the alleged armed robbery.
	
	
	I note his answer to Q 279 as showing a nimbleness of mind on his part, with a suggestion that the replica firearm which was found nearby to him on his arrest (subsequently found with his DNA profile on it) could have been discarded by someone from a nearby bakery. But there are other features to be borne in mind. Before the nub of the interview was commenced he was given the opportunity to stop or be refreshed (Q 20 - 25). There is no doubt that if he said he did not want to continue, given his presentation, this issue would not have been debated here as was conceded in submissions. The police were captive to his wishes. He not necessarily to theirs, although he was in custody. I note that half an hour later when asked at Q 292 if he wished to participate in an identification parade he said he was ‘too tired’ and did not participate.
	
	
	I also note that after Detective Maher had finished asking the questions of the accused where some suggestion of confusion arises (said to reflect matters for consideration under ss 85(2) or 90 – see Q 28 – 147). Constable Perry asked a series of questions (Q 154 – 177) in which she recapped upon the accused’s earlier answers. His responses to those questions are not only lucid, but on occasions he either corrects her or adds information to that previously supplied. There was no ‘gratuitous congruence’ in the course of that part of the interview by the accused.
	
	
	Even in the earlier part of the interview when questioned by Detective Maher, he gave an account about the circumstances of his arrest that reflected, at least from his perspective, a clear memory of what he claimed had happened. He could remember the name of the arresting officer and details of his interaction with him (see Q 135 – 138).
	
	
	When the independent officer came in to speak to him (see Q 300 – 312) he had clearly heightened alertness and gave direct answers not suggestive of any disadvantage or unfairness in the earlier questioning. I have taken into account the reference to the smiling of Detective Maher in the course of the early part of the interview, but could not conclude that it necessarily reflected a deliberate “taking advantage” of the accused.
	
	
	As to the issue of his drug affectedness, I am not satisfied that he was drug affected. It was not the opinion of the police officer that he was, he did not admit to taking drugs, and the assertion by Raja that he had taken drugs was never put to him. In that regard I note Raja’s ‘admission’ that he took drugs, yet his presentation was entirely different from the accused. One might have thought that the use of amphetamines would have heightened the accused’s presentation rather than rendering him drowsy. There is no evidence of him at that time taking any particular medication or other prohibited drug that might have caused his drowsiness, although he was using medication of various types according to Custody Management Records.
	
	
	Ultimately, in the context of what I understood the Crown’s case to be, the prosecution has satisfied me that in all the circumstances the truth of the representations made by the accused is unlikely to have been affected by the surrounding and particular circumstances of the interview.
	
	
	Further, in the context of the various answers the accused gave to questions and the opportunities the accused had to discontinue the interview and remain silent, I do not consider that I should exercise the discretion available pursuant to s 90 of the Act to exclude the contents of the interview.

	GLEESON JA: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: On 22 February 2010, the appellant, Mathew Reynolds, was indicted in respect of six counts of manslaughter and, in the alternative, to six counts of aiding and abetting dangerous navigation occasioning death.
	
	
	A co-accused, Percy Small, was indicted on six counts of dangerous navigation occasioning death. The appellant and Mr Small both pleaded not guilty to each count charged and they were tried together.
	
	
	On 6 April 2010 the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of each of the six charges of manslaughter against the appellant. Mr Small was found guilty on each of the six charges of dangerous navigation occasioning death.
	
	
	On 25 June 2010 the appellant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 7 years and 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 5 years commencing 12 February 2010. The appellant was eligible for release to parole on 11 February 2015. Mr Small was sentenced to the same effective sentence, the commencement date of which was 3 April 2010. (Crown Submissions “A” at p 1)
	
	
	The appellant now seeks leave to appeal, out of time, against his convictions in respect of all six counts.
	
	
	The Notice of Appeal filed on 29 October 2014 contained a single ground of appeal which sought to impugn a direction given by the trial judge by way of answer to a jury question, details of which are set out below.
	
	
	In support of the application to appeal out of time, the appellant relies upon the affidavit of Timothy John Heenan, solicitor, sworn 2 February 2015. In that affidavit a history explaining the delay in pursuing proceedings in this Court is set out prior to 1 October 2013 on which date initial contact was made between the applicant’s present solicitors and the applicant’s mother. Mr Heenan then set out the relevant history concerning a Legal Aid application and prior applications that had been made for extensions of time following the filing of a Notice of Intention to Appeal against conviction on 14 July 2010.
	
	
	The Crown did not advance any particular matters against the grant of leave.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider that leave should be granted to the applicant to appeal out of time.
	


Overview of the Proceedings


	
	The following paragraphs address the factual context within which the impugned trial direction takes its place. A more detailed factual analysis is set out below.
	
	
	The case brought by the Crown against the appellant arose out of a tragic boating collision in the early hours of the morning of 1 May 2008. There were two vessels involved.
	
	
	The appellant obtained a work boat which he had access to for the purposes of his employment. Fourteen young persons, including the appellant, were in the work boat at the time of the accident. The boat had uneventfully proceeded from East Balmain to Watson’s Bay. On the return journey at about 2:30am, the appellant transferred the helm of the boat to Percy Small.
	
	
	The other vessel was a fishing vessel referred to in evidence as the Jordons. That vessel, prior to the collision, was travelling on a course between a safe water marker located in the Harbour and the Bradley’s Headland. Both boats were showing navigation lights. According to the appellant’s written submissions at [19], Percy Small said that the Jordons was “Lit up like a Christmas tree” although he failed to see the vessel until the last moment. The vessels were approaching each other bow to bow. There was an issue at trial as to whether the work boat was approaching the Jordons from its starboard aspect so as to have required the Jordons to yield in order to avoid a collision. For the purpose of sentencing the trial judge found on the evidence that the Jordons was proceeding at about 8 to 9 knots and the work boat was travelling at between 20 and 25 knots.
	
	
	The vessels collided. Six passengers were fatally injured. All of the fatally injured victims were seated along the port side bench of the work boat, except for one female who was in the port seat.
	
	
	The defence rested essentially on two propositions. Firstly, that the skipper of the Jordons had contributed causatively to the collision. Secondly, that the Jordons was on the wrong side of the channel, as indicated by its position in relation to a safe water marker.
	
	
	The trial judge in the course of his sentencing remarks analysed the evidence and made findings against both of the above propositions: Remarks on Sentence at pp 6-8.
	
	
	As discussed in detail below, the trial judge gave the jury directions in the course of his summing up upon each of the elements of the offence of manslaughter including, in particular, the issue of causation. That is the issue upon which the ground of appeal focuses.
	
	
	The particular jury question and the challenged direction given by the trial judge in answer to the question were in the following terms:
	


JURY QUESTION: “Could we please have an explanation in relation to the charge against Mr Reynolds. Note a significant and substantial contribution etcetera. What is the legal definition of these terms. Is there any difference between the two?” (AB at p 71)

TRIAL JUDGE’S ANSWER (direction): “Thank you members of the jury, I have your note. In response can I say this to you, significant and substantial are ordinary words. They do not have any particular legal definition. They are by their very nature words which are quantitative in their nature. Insofar as you ask me the difference there is no essential difference between the word ‘significant’ and ‘substantial’. It is not a legal definition but if you require some definition of these ordinary English words the best I can do, if it helps you, is to say in reverse substantial and significant means not trivial. That is as much as I can say in response to your enquiry. If you would be good enough to resume your deliberations that is what I can tell you in response to your question.” (AB at p 72)


	
	The sole ground of appeal is that this answer was erroneous.
	


Factual Matters


	
	The factual background is set out in the Crown’s Submissions “A”, filed 19 December 2014, as follows:
	


“On the night of 30 April 2008 various people attended the Commercial Hotel in Balmain. The hotel had been sold and was to be handed over to the new owners the following day. Staff had been advised that their employment would not continue and the gathering was in the nature of a ‘farewell’ celebration.

The appellant was in attendance at the hotel as was the co-accused, Mr Small, who had worked part-time at the hotel.

The appellant had an employment contract with either Sydney Ship Repairs or a director of Sydney Ship Repairs. The appellant and his uncle had been residing on Goat Island and they had access to a work boat that was owned by Sydney Ship Repairs. The work boat, which was licensed to carry eight people, was available to the appellant for the purpose of transit to and from the island to access food, laundry facilities and the like. The boat was not made available to the appellant for private purposes such as recreational use or fishing (T 1059-1060, 1075). The appellant was the holder of a Certificate of Competency as a Coxswain. He was thereby authorised to undertake duties of a master and/or engineer of a vessel less than 12 metres in length with propulsion power less than 250 kilowatts (T 1164).

During the course of the evening, Mr Gene Robson, who was employed as the Night Manager at the hotel, asked the appellant if he would take him, by boat, to Watsons Bay. The appellant agreed that he would do so. The purpose of the journey was to take keys to the current owners so that they could be handed to the new owners the next morning (T 249).

After the hotel closed at midnight a number of persons who had been at the hotel gathered at a nearby residence, referred to by a number of witnesses as ""Pondy's place”. The appellant did not go to the residence. He, in the company of his girlfriend, Ashlie Ayres, went to get the work boat and he drove it to the East Balmain wharf.

It became known amongst those who had gathered at the residence that there was to be an excursion on the harbour. Ultimately all twelve persons who were at the residence left and made their way to the wharf and boarded the work boat. A total of fourteen people were on the work boat when it left the wharf.

Most of the persons on board the work boat, including the appellant and Mr Small, had consumed alcohol in various quantities during the night. Marijuana and cocaine had also been used by some persons. A quantity of alcohol as well as some marijuana and an implement used for the ingestion of drugs were taken on board the work boat. Cocaine was also available on the work boat.

The work boat left the East Balmain wharf at about 1.23 am with the appellant at the helm. As the work boat left the wharf some fishermen who were on the wharf commented to the effect that the work boat appeared to be overloaded. The appellant responded, to the effect, that they would be ‘right’ (T 232, 325).

The work boat proceeded east towards Watsons Bay. At some point during the journey the appellant permitted one of the passengers, Mr Jarrod Chivers, to drive the work boat for a period, estimated by Mr Chivers to be about 5 minutes (T 435). Mr Chivers was the holder of a boat licence (T 434). Mr Robson gave evidence that when he observed Mr Chivers driving he expressed concern to the appellant and told the appellant that he, the appellant, should be driving. The appellant then took back the helm of the work boat and drove it to the wharf at Watsons Bay (T 253).

At Watsons Bay, all 14 persons on board the work boat disembarked. The female passengers accompanied Mr Robson to the premises where he delivered the keys. The other males went to a nearby park where alcohol and drugs were consumed by some of them (T 338,440).

After about half an hour the 14 persons re-boarded the work boat. The appellant drove the work boat from Watsons Bay to a harbour light marker, described in evidence as the ‘Wedding Cake’. Three of the males on board, including Mr Small, got off the work boat and climbed onto the Wedding Cake. While the work boat was stopped at the Wedding Cake there was some discussion about where the work boat would go next and it was decided that it would return to Balmain (T 696).

After the three males reboarded the work boat the appellant drove away from the Wedding Cake, heading towards Bradleys Head. As the work boat left the Wedding Cake the appellant raised the boat's propeller to the surface of the water and revved the motor, causing water to spray in what Mr Small described in evidence as a ‘rooster tail effect’.

The work boat was fitted with two forward facing seats in the partly enclosed cabin. The helm was located in front of the starboard seat. Behind the two forward facing seats were two inward facing benches and most of the passengers were seated along them.

When the work boat left the Wedding Cake, Mr Small was sitting on the starboard bench immediately behind the appellant who was in the front starboard seat behind the helm. Ms Ayers [sic] was seated in the front port seat.

Shortly after leaving the Wedding Cake the appellant transferred the helm to Mr Small. Mr Small did not have a boat licence and had not previously driven a boat at night (T 1531, 1537). Mr Small gave evidence that the appellant looked down at him and jumped up with his right hand on the steering wheel, pointed to the driver's seat and said ‘sit here’. Mr Small did so and grabbed the wheel. The appellant told Mr Small to ‘head towards the green marker’ (T 1537). The ‘green marker’ was the marker light at Bradleys Head. Mr Small gave evidence that the work boat was ‘probably a degree to the left of the marker’ and that he straightened the work boat to that degree and proceeded towards the green marker. Mr Small said that the appellant was on his, Mr Small's, left and standing up. When the work boat was about 400 metres from the marker, the appellant leaned over to Mr Small and told him to ‘Make a hard left. That's a peninsula’. Mr Small gave evidence that he then turned the work boat to the left so that it would pass Bradleys Head by about 100 metres (T 1539).

At about 2am a fishing trawler, the Jordons, left the Sydney Fish Markets at Blackwattle Bay and proceeded outbound with the intention of proceeding to fishing grounds located off the coast. The vessel was skippered by Mr Peter Evans. A deckhand, Mr Douglas Seiffert, was also on board.

At about 2.30am the Jordons rounded Bradleys Head. Mr Evans gave evidence that when he did so the safe water mark was nearly directly behind him (T 757). At the trial a number of witnesses expressed differing views of what was required of vessels passing by the safe water mark.

After the Jordons rounded Bradleys Head the two vessels, the Jordons and the work boat, were on courses with their respective bows generally approaching each other. Neither Mr Evans nor Mr Small sighted the other vessel in time to be able to avoid a collision. The vessels collided and the metal anchor fairlead of the Jordons swept along the port side of the work boat (T 1299-1300). The six fatally injured persons were all seated on the port side of the work boat.

During the course of cross-examination Mr Evans denied that his vessel was on auto pilot (T 855). He denied that he was not at the helm of the vessel. He denied he was not keeping a proper lookout and he denied that he was on the wrong side of the channel (T 856, 858).

There was agreement amongst the expert witnesses who gave evidence as to the speed of the vessels at the time of impact. The Jordons, a displacement vessel, was travelling at a speed of about eight to nine knots and the work boat, a planing vessel, was travelling at between twenty and twenty-five knots (T 1292, 1293). There was evidence that a speed of twenty-five knots was not normally considered to be excessive in that part of the harbour (T 1345). The expert witnesses agreed that the angle of collision was approximately 15 degrees on the Jordons' starboard bow (T 1301).

It was considered by those investigating the collision that the weather conditions did not appear to have been a factor in the collision. The conditions were generally very good. There was no breeze and the water surface was rippled or calm (T 1291).

A blood sample was taken from Mr Small at 5.30am on 1 May 2008. Analysis revealed the presence of alcohol, the metabolite of cocaine, the active constituent of cannabis and the metabolite of its breakdown. The blood alcohol reading was 0.079 grams per 100 millilitres (T 961).

Dr Judith Perl gave evidence that the various readings indicated that Mr Small had most likely used cocaine within a period of probably five or six hours of the sample being taken (T 962) and that he had used cannabis very recently, within about four hours, and probably within a shorter period (T 963). Dr Perl's evidence was that the most likely concentration of alcohol in Mr Small's blood at 2.30am was 0.124 grams per 100 millilitres. The lowest possible level was 0.109 grams per 100 millilitres and the highest was 0.154 grams per 100 millilitres (T 965).

Dr Perl gave evidence that at a reading of 0.109 every aspect of one's cognitive and motor skills would be impaired, including impairment of perceptions, judgment, decision making, reaction skills and motor coordination. One's visual functions would also be impaired including a reduction of peripheral vision, as well as an affect upon one's scanning ability and glare resistance (T 965-966).

Dr Perl gave evidence that a social drinker, at 0.109, would appear moderately affected by alcohol. At a level of 0.154 a social drinker could be described as ‘being drunk’. At a level of 0.124 there would be significant impairment of cognitive and motor skills and the effects would be blatantly obvious to an observer (T 966).

Dr Perl's evidence was that there may have been impairment due to cocaine. She said that she would expect it but that she could not say definitely that there was impairment and any impairment would be merely additive to the effects of alcohol (T 970). She said that cannabis is a depressant drug that depresses brain function. It results in similar types of impairment to alcohol with the exception that unlike alcohol it does not increase risk taking but tends to make the user more cautious. However where alcohol is also present, depending on the blood level, the alcohol might be the predominant effect. She said that recent studies had demonstrated that the effects of alcohol and cannabis combined were more than merely additive (T 972).

A blood sample was taken from the appellant at 4.30am on 1 May 2008. Analysis of the sample showed a blood alcohol reading of 0.051 grams per 100 millilitres as well as the presence of cocaine and its metabolite (T 974). Dr Perl's evidence was that the minimum level of alcohol in the appellant's blood at 2.30am was 0.071 grams per 100 millilitres, the maximum was 0.101 grams per 100 millilitres and the most likely was 0.081 grams per 100 millilitres (T 975). Dr Perl's evidence was that the effect of alcohol at a level of 0.071 would be that higher levels of performance or cognitive functions and skills performance things such as perception, judgment, information processing, decision making and visual functions would be impaired. At a level of 0.071 simple motor function may or may not be impaired depending on one's level of experience with alcohol (T 975). Dr Perl said that there may have been some additional impairment due to the effect of cocaine but she could not be absolutely certain (T 976).”


	
	As noted in the appellant’s written submissions, the trial judge identified the principal issues at trial. Importantly, it was conceded by the appellant in his written submissions that he was the master of the vessel at the time of the collision and that he owed the passengers a duty of care.
	


Trial Judge’s Findings


	
	In his Remarks on Sentence concerning the appellant and his co-offender, the trial judge made a number of factual findings including findings that were directly relevant to the appellant’s culpability including his breach or breaches of duty and the issue of causation. As the single ground of appeal relied upon by the appellant focusses upon an asserted error in a trial direction on the issue of causation, it is necessary to examine in some detail the abovementioned findings and conclusions of the trial judge in his sentencing remarks. I note that in the course of the hearing Senior Counsel for the appellant indicated that he accepted that the findings made by his Honour were consistent with the jury’s verdict: T 3 February 2015 at p 7:5-15. The evidence, in my opinion, well-supported the findings. In his Remarks on Sentence the Trial Judge made the following comments:
	


“65.   The issue of breach of duty was left to the jury on the bases of three alternatives, that Matthew Reynolds permitted the navigation of the work boat by Percy Small when he knew or ought to have known that Percy Small was affected by the prior ingestion of liquor or drugs, that he failed to supervise Percy Small whilst he was at the helm of the work boat and that he failed to keep a proper look out himself for other vessels which might have been navigating the harbour waters, and to warn Percy Small of the presence of an oncoming craft. It is submitted on behalf of Matthew Reynolds that, for the purposes of sentence, I should be satisfied to the necessary standard only of the breach of the third of those stated reasons. I reject that submission and I am satisfied of his breaches of all three.

66.   I accept that Matthew Reynolds would not have known the exact quantities of Percy Small’s ingestion of alcohol or drugs prior to his asking him to take the helm and that Percy Small did not say anything to him about it. I recognize that Percy Small himself claimed that he was not staggering but, having regard to the evidence of Dr Perl, I am satisfied that the level of Percy Small’s drug and alcohol induced intoxication was such that he would have been manifesting signs that a reasonable observer in the position of Matthew Reynolds must have appreciated Percy Small’s unfitness to control the helm of the vessel.

67.   Matthew Reynolds’ blood analysis (from a sample taken at 4.30 am on 1 May) was 0.051 grams per 100 ml and some trace of cocaine. Dr Perl calculated that at 2.30 am the alcohol level was likely to be in the order of 0.071 grams per 100 ml. In the context, I agree with counsel’s submission that the quantity of cocaine was apparently small and that the alcohol ingestion was not (in a broad sense) excessive although I note that it would still lie within the low range of offending if he had been driving a motor vehicle. The essential issue, noting that Dr Perl said that he may have had some impairment, is whether or not Matthew Reynolds should have perceived Percy Small’s unfitness. I have discussed Percy Small’s situation earlier and am satisfied that his impairment would have been obvious and that Matthew Reynolds ought to have appreciated it.

68.   The second alternative relied on as breach concerned lack of supervision. It was submitted that Matthew Reynolds sat close to Percy Small and that the work boat was travelling comfortably in the water. That latter perhaps may offer an explanation for the circumstance that Matthew Reynolds did not watch Percy Small at the helm but rather turned his attention towards Ashlie Ayres who was sitting in the other front seat. Reference was made to Matthew Reynolds saying, according to Percy Small, words to the effect of making a hard left because they were approaching a peninsula. It does not appear that Percy Small in fact precisely made such a turn. The evidence falls far short of demonstrating that Matthew Reynolds was actually supervising him. I am satisfied that he was not so doing because his attention was being directed, as I have already said. The mere fact that Matthew Reynolds was sitting close to Percy Small did not amount to supervising him.

69.   The third alternative was conceded by counsel on behalf of Matthew Reynolds. Matthew Reynolds was seated with his back to the direction in which the work boat was travelling. He probably was slightly inclined to port where Ashlie Ayres was sitting. I find this slight turn to be of no significance. Although experts testified, as referred to in written submissions, that there is no requirement only to look ahead when keeping a proper lookout I am abundantly satisfied that Matthew Reynolds was not positioned where he was, generally looking rearwards for the purpose of seeing whether other vessels were approaching from behind.

70.   Those breaches of duty in cumulation demonstrate a serious departure from the standards which Matthew Reynolds ought to have observed as skipper of the work boat.”


	
	As the abovementioned findings indicate, the appellant’s breaches of duty occurred at three levels. It is plain that they represented a serious departure from the standards that the appellant was required to have observed as skipper of the work boat: Remarks on Sentence, 25 June 2010, at [70].
	
	
	The number and nature of the appellant’s breaches of duty and, in particular, the extent to which there was a departure from acceptable standards, is directly relevant to the causation element of the offence of manslaughter charged, particularly, as expressed by the trial judge, whether the appellant’s breaches of duty “… contributed significantly and substantially to the harm suffered by each of the victims which led to their deaths …”: Summing Up, 31 March 2010, at p 2-28.
	


Summing Up by Trial Judge


	
	The jury were told by the trial judge that the case was one in which involuntary manslaughter was charged, the elements of which were set out in a written statement. Additionally, the trial judge provided detailed supplementary oral directions on each element: Summing Up at pp 22-28. The jury was instructed that the Crown had to prove the four elements beyond reasonable doubt, they being:
	



	
	That the appellant owed a duty of care towards each of the passengers on the work boat;
	
	
	That the appellant was negligent;
	
	
	That the breach of duty caused the death of each individual deceased;
	
	
	That the breach of duty of care merited criminal punishment.
	



	
	As was made clear to the jury in the summing up, the Crown case alleged negligence in one or more of the following three ways:
	



	
	That the appellant permitted the navigation (that is control of the helm of the work boat) by his co-offender, Percy Small when he knew or ought to have known that Percy Small was affected by the prior ingestion of alcohol or drugs;
	
	
	The appellant failed to supervise Percy Small after he put him at the helm of the work boat;
	
	
	The appellant, having given over the helm of the work boat to Percy Small, had a continuing duty to keep a proper lookout for other vessels which were navigating the Harbour waters and he should have, if he had kept a proper lookout, warned Percy Small of the presence of an oncoming craft but that he failed to do so.
	


Submissions


	
	As stated above, this appeal concerns a direction given by the trial judge to the jury in response to a question about causation set out at [18] above.
	


Appellant’s Submissions


	
	The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in directing the jury, firstly, that there was no essential difference in meaning between the words “significant” and “substantial” and, secondly, that the phrase “significant and substantial” meant “not trivial”. The appellant submitted that the two terms had different definitions according to the Oxford Dictionary, and that to state that the words meant “not trivial” devalued their true meaning. The appellant submitted that the error was serious because the defence at trial was based on a claimed absence of evidence on the issue of causation.
	
	
	In the appellant’s written submissions it was stated:
	


“While dictionary definitions of ‘trivial’ include ‘not important’ and/or ‘not significant’ it is submitted that to direct the jury that anything other than the ‘trivial’ will suffice even for the term ‘significant’ was in the circumstances to devalue the term. It is submitted something could be of minimal probative weight and not be trivial. For instance something may be an ordinary or routine consideration although not trivial, and yet not ‘important’ and certainly not ‘of considerable importance’. In any event, it is submitted that the term ‘substantial’ in this context could not be described as anything other than the ‘trivial.’” (Appellant’s Written Submissions at [32])


	
	It was also submitted for the appellant that:
	


“… this was an error of considerable importance in the context of this trial because much of the appellant’s case was to the effect that if he was negligent, his negligence was not the substantial cause of the collision and that the substantial cause was that of Mr Evans. The jury were in effect directed that as long as any negligence on the appellant’s part was found to have even slightly, although not trivially, contributed to the collision then the jury was required to find him guilty in this regard.” (Appellant’s Written Submissions at [33])

Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the trial judge had been correct in directing the jury that there was no difference between the terms “significant” and “substantial” in the context of legal causation. Reliance was placed in this respect upon the decision of this Court in R v Moffatt (2000) 112 A Crim R 201; [2000] NSWCCA 174 at [69]-[71].
	
	
	The Crown observed that the current Bench Book direction on causation models the direction endorsed by the High Court in McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 at 118, that being the use of the words significant OR substantial: Crown Written Submissions at [10].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that although the trial judge’s direction to the jury that “it is sufficient that the Crown has proved that his negligence contributed significantly and substantially to the harm” was inconsistent with the Bench Book direction and the weight of the authority, it could not have caused any injustice to the appellant because the formulation stated by the trial judge posed a more stringent test which, in fact, favoured the appellant.
	
	
	In oral submissions the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, who represented the Crown in the present proceedings, drew the Court’s attention to the decision of this Court in R v Andrew [2000] NSWCCA 310 in support of the proposition that there was no material difference in the way a jury would understand the word “substantial” or “significant” in a context such as arises in the present case.
	
	
	The Crown additionally submitted that the judge was correct to direct the jury that the phrase “significant and substantial” meant “not trivial” in reverse because “not trivial” is an antonym for those terms.
	
	
	In oral submissions the Crown emphasised:
	


“… nowhere in that direction does his Honour say anything other than trivial will make out the offence or demeans the words in any way, shape or form. What his Honour actually just says is, in reverse, substantial and significant means not “trivial”. (T 3 February 2015 at p 10)


	
	The Crown submitted that, in any event, it was difficult to conceive of the appellant’s actions as having been anything other than a substantial or significant cause in the collision.
	


Test for Causation in Homicide


	
	Because this appeal is concerned with a direction made by the trial judge on the issue of causation it is necessary to briefly outline the authorities on causation in homicide cases.
	
	
	The proper test for causation in a case such as the present was whether the accused’s conduct was a ‘substantial or significant cause of death.’ Different formulations of this test were stated by their Honours in Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378 (‘Royall’) and Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316. Subsequently there has been some debate in the case law as to whether the terms “significant” and “substantial” are interchangeable.
	
	
	In R v Andrew this Court, having referred to Royall, noted at [58] that “There would be no material difference in the way a jury would understand the words ‘substantial’ and ‘significant’ in this context” and then proceeded to adopt the “substantial or significant cause” formulation stated by Deane and Dawson JJ at 411 in that case. In R v Moffatt at [69] Wood CJ at CL made the following observations in relation to a trial judge’s summing up:
	


“69. On that issue of causation his Honour then correctly directed himself by reference to the fact that in Royall (1990) 172 CLR 378; 54 A Crim R 53, each of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, and Gaudron and Toohey JJ, in their separate judgments, cited with approval:

“…the comments of Burt CJ in Campbell [1981] WAR 286’ (1981) 2 A Crim R 157, where the following was said (at 290; 161):

‘(It is) enough if juries [are] told that the question of cause for them to decide is not a philosophical or a scientific question, but a question to be determined by them applying their common sense to the facts as they find them they appreciating that the purpose of the inquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter.’”

70. The formulation of the test to be applied was not stated by their Honours in identical terms. Brennan J said that the accused’s act or omission “must contribute significantly to the death of the victim” (at 398; [66]). Deane and Dawson JJ said that it would be sufficient if the accused’s conduct “is a substantial or significant cause of death” (at 411, [77]). The “causal connection must be sufficiently substantial to enable responsibility for the crime to be attributed to the accused” (at 412; [78]). Toohey and Gaudron JJ said the jury will inevitably concentrate its attention upon “whether the act of the accused substantially contributed to the death” (at 423; [86]). McHugh J said that the wrongful act must be “An operating cause and a substantial cause” (at 444; [109]).

71. What is clear is that the act of the appellant must have more than a coincidental or insignificant effect – rather it must provide a substantial contribution towards the death of the accused: see also Smith [1959] 2 WB 35; (1959) 42 Cr App R 121; Evans and Gardiner (No 2) [1976] VR 523; Bingapore (1975) 11 SASR 469 at 480; Hallett (1969) SASR 141; and Osland (1998) 159 ALR 170 at 174. Although there has been some debate as to whether the expression “significant” is interchangeable for “substantial” in this context (see S J Odgers and S M H Yeo, “Semantics and the Threshold Test for Imputable Causation” (2000) 24 Crim LJ 73) I am content to accept for the present purpose the latter.’


	
	Finally, it is noted that the term ‘substantial’ in the context of causation has been said to be “a convenient word to use to indicate to the jury that it must be something more than de minimis”: Royall at 442 per McHugh J referring to Reg v Hennigan [1971] 3 All ER 133 at 135.
	


Consideration


	
	Contextual Matters
	
	
	The jury question, and the trial judge’s answer set out at [18] above, should be considered in the context of the trial. “Context” in the present case has two aspects. The first relates to the content of the trial judge’s directions on the elements of the offence of manslaughter given before the jury’s question was asked. The second concerns the evidence in the trial, which the jury must be taken as having been established, that the appellant’s alleged breaches of duty separately and together represented serious departures from the required standard of care and, on any view, could only be adjudged as having carried powerful and substantive, not trivial, causal consequences.
	


The Judge’s Trial Directions


	
	The trial judge gave, and later repeated, clear directions on the issue of causation. The written directions included the following:
	


“The breach of duty need not be the sole cause of death but must have been a significant and substantial contributor to its being occasioned.” (AB at pp 37‑38)


	
	In his oral directions the trial judge stated:
	


“I would expect, although again it is a matter for you, that you would contemplate that there were other contributors towards the deaths occurring. What you have to determine for the purpose of this exercise is whether or not the breach of duty that is to say the negligence of Matthew Reynolds was a significant and substantial contributor to its being occasioned. That assessment is something which is entirely and appropriately within your discretion of practical judgment.” (emphasis added) (AB at p 38)


	
	The trial judge returned to the causation element in his summing up, stating:
	


“The next thing that the Crown has to prove after the issue of negligence is that the death was caused by that negligence. As I understand it nobody has suggested that any deceased did not die as a result of the impact when the boats collided. It is the Crown case in relation to this issue of causation that the death of each deceased was caused by the assigning by Reynolds to Percy Small of the control of steering the vessel in the circumstances which amounted to negligence. …

When you are looking at the question of cause it is not necessary that the Crown prove that the act of Matthew Reynolds was the sole or the direct cause of the harm to each deceased which led to their deaths. It is sufficient that the Crown has proved that this negligence contributed significantly and substantially to the harm suffered by each of the victims when led to their deaths. You will recall from what you were told yesterday that Mr Turnbull submitted to you that, in effect, it was deficiencies on the part of Mr Evans, the operator of the fishing boat, in being in the wrong place and he himself not keeping a proper lookout or not being at the helm and defects in respect of his ship, who was the causative person in relation to the deaths. It is possible, of course, that more than one person contributes by reason of default to the deaths which occurred. The question you have to ask yourselves is whether the Crown has proved that in the circumstances the action which you find, if you find it was negligent on the part of Reynolds, contributed significantly and substantially to the harm suffered which resulted in the deaths.” (emphasis added) (AB at pp 40-41)


	
	In addition to the above directions, the trial judge made reference in the course of his summing up to the closing addresses on behalf of the appellant and the Crown on the issue of causation. The jury was reminded of the submission for the appellant that ‘the cause of the matter was not significantly or substantially contributed to by any breach of duty on the part of [the appellant]’: Summing Up at p 38.
	
	
	The trial judge referred to the Crown closing address on the causation issue in the following terms:
	


“In relation to causation the Crown says look at the overall behaviour, how the circumstances led up to the collision, and the Crown says that on any view once you take a calm, objective and dispassionate view of the circumstances then the negligence which it alleges against Matthew Reynolds must have been a significant substantial contributor to the damage that was caused. (emphasis added) (AB at p 53)


	
	Accordingly, the test, which set a high standard for causation, was enunciated and repeated on a number of occasions by the trial judge. The directions left no room for doubt or confusion as to what the proper causal test was and that it was the test which the jury were directed to apply in determining the third element of the offence of manslaughter.
	
	
	The test, as stated by the trial judge, was in line with the authorities discussed above except to the extent that the trial judge used the word ‘and’ instead of ‘or’. I accept the Crown’s submission that this could not have prejudiced the appellant in any event.
	


The Evidentiary Context


	
	As stated above, the evidence at trial could not have left any room for doubt that the Crown case, if accepted, was alleging that the appellant’s conduct was a major cause of the accident. In practical terms, the jury, upon hearing the trial judge’s answer to their question, could not have understood the judge to be indicating that causation need only have been established at a low level somewhere above the point of “trivial”. The clear directions given and repeatedly emphasised that the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant’s negligence was a significant and substantial contributor to the harm suffered by each of the victims which caused their death. The test as so expressed, imposed a high standard for the element of causation.
	
	
	The evidence at trial, in my assessment, undoubtedly proved that fact to the stated standard. Understandably, the contrary was not suggested in this appeal.
	
	
	Whilst it is doubtful as to whether there is any marked distinction between the words “significant” and “substantial” (see [40] above) the evidence in the present case, as I have indicated, established both a significant and substantial causal connection. The trial judge’s reference to “not trivial” must be considered and interpreted in the context of the clear and strong directions given. When so considered, there is no basis, in my assessment, for concluding that the answer given to the jury’s question undermined or qualified in any way what had been conveyed as necessary before the Crown could be considered to have proved the element to the requisite standard.
	
	
	I do not consider there is any merit in the ground of appeal relied upon in these proceedings and it should be dismissed.
	
	
	I have concluded that no error has been established and the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Leave be granted to the appellant to appeal out of time.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.

2703799,Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2015] NSWSC 152,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR:
	


Nature of proceedings

The Attorney General (the plaintiff) seeks the orders set out in the Summons filed on 13 February 2015.

1.   Pursuant to clause 6(5) of Schedule 1 to the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (MHFP Act) an order appointing two psychiatrists/psychologists to conduct examinations of Mr McGuire (the defendant) and to provide a report and for him to attend those examinations.

2.   Pursuant to clause 10 of Schedule 1 to the MHFP Act an interim extension order commencing 21 March 2015 and expiring 28 days later.

3.   Pursuant to clause 1 of Schedule 1 to the MHFP Act an order for the extension of the defendant’s status as a forensic patient from the date of the order and expiring 2 years later.


	
	This judgment relates to the preliminary hearing in which the plaintiff sought that Orders 1 and 2 be made. Should those orders be made, the plaintiff will seek Order 3 at a subsequent final hearing.
	
	
	The defendant opposes the making of all three orders.
	


Background


	
	The defendant was born in November 1972 and is now aged 42. His criminal history commenced in 1996 when he was aged 24. Convictions exist for breach of an apprehended violence order, malicious damage, unlawfully use conveyance, stealing, drive in dangerous manner, take conveyance without consent, assault with intent, larceny, destroy or damage property, behave in offensive manner, having custody of offensive implement in a public place, drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs, drive recklessly or furiously or speed in dangerous manner, use unregistered and uninsured vehicle, drive while unlicensed, having an unauthorised number plate, possess or use prohibited weapon, disobey request to stop for breath test and drive while disqualified.
	
	
	On 17 August 2006, the defendant was charged with three offences contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900, namely that he had sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the victim was not consenting (the index offences). He was also charged with one offence of aggravated break and enter, and commit a serious indictable offence. The facts of the three index offences were as follows.
	
	
	At midday on 4 April 2006 the defendant was drinking alcohol with two acquaintances at premises adjacent to the victim’s residence. During the course of the afternoon, the defendant consumed at least 8 stubbies of beer (probably more) and observed the victim in the next door premises. He remarked that “she would be all right for a girlfriend”.
	
	
	Thereafter the defendant went to the victim’s residence, asked if he could come in for a drink and spoke of “wanting to be with [the victim] and wanting to be [her] friend”. The victim refused his request. The defendant then went into the backyard of the house and played with the victim’s young daughter. When the defendant followed the victim’s daughter into the house, the victim asked him to leave. The defendant refused.
	
	
	The victim walked to the front of the house and successfully enticed the defendant outside. Having done so, the victim secured the latch on the front door and went further inside the house to obtain the key to lock the front door. While she was standing in the living room, the defendant entered the house and committed a series of sexual assaults upon her.
	
	
	The conduct forming the first count involved forced penile/vaginal intercourse that extended between five to fifteen minutes and caused the victim to feel some pain. The victim struggled and even managed to hit the defendant over the head with a telephone but he continued undeterred.
	
	
	The conduct forming the second count involved forced penile/anal intercourse that continued for some five to ten minutes.
	
	
	The conduct involving the third count involved forced penile/vaginal intercourse, although by this time with a ""soft"" penis which the victim succeeded in yanking. After words were exchanged, the defendant left the house saying he would ""come back next week to finish the job"".
	
	
	The sexual assaults were witnessed by the victim's five year old daughter.
	
	
	In October 2007, subsequent to the index offences, the defendant was charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm on a police officer, assaulting a police officer and resisting an officer in the performance of his duty. He was convicted of the inflict grievous bodily harm offence on 19 June 2009 with the other two offences taken into account on a Form 1. The circumstances were that a police officer suffered a fractured hand requiring surgery when the defendant was resisting arrest. At the time he was arrested, he was too intoxicated and violent to be interviewed.
	
	
	On 25 August 2008 in the District Court at Nowra, Garling DCJ determined, after an inquiry conducted in accordance with the MHFP Act, that the defendant was not fit to be tried. The existence of an intellectual disability provided the basis of the finding. The defendant, who was then in custody, was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal), and was remanded in custody.
	
	
	On 4 September 2009, Murrell DCJ held that on the limited evidence available, the defendant had committed each of the index offences charged. Her Honour ordered, under s23(1)(b) of the MHFP Act, that the defendant be subject to a limiting term of five years for the offences, which would expire on 31 December 2013.
	
	
	Under s24 of the MHFP Act the defendant became a forensic patient, subject to regular review by the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal).
	
	
	Under s24 of the MHFP Act, the defendant was referred to the Tribunal together with an order that he be detained in custody as a forensic patient.
	
	
	On 26 August 2013, the Tribunal, pursuant to s47(1)(b) of the MHFP Act, released the defendant into the community subject to a comprehensive set of conditions.
	
	
	By reason of the expiration of the limiting term on 31 December 2013, the defendant's status as a forensic patient was to cease. However, following an application made by the plaintiff (Attorney General of NSW v McGuire [2013] NSWSC 1862) Davies J made an interim extension order under cl 10 of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act (the preliminary hearing). This extended the defendant’s status as a forensic patient from 31 December 2013 for a period of 28 days. Other interim orders were subsequently made, such that the order was ultimately set to expire on 25 March 2014.
	
	
	A final hearing of the application by the plaintiff for an extension order was held on 4 - 5 March 2014 before Garling J (Attorney General of NSW v McGuire (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 288 (McGuire No 2 [2014])). The plaintiff had initially sought an order for a period of five years, however, this was varied at the hearing to a period of two and a half years. The Court handed down its decision on 21 March 2014, making an order for an extension order for a period of 12 months.
	
	
	The defendant’s current extension order expires on 21 March 2015.
	
	
	On 21 March 2014 the Tribunal concluded that the previous conditions of release were necessary and should continue. It amended the existing orders for the defendant’s release from 70 hours of supervision to 35 hours.
	
	
	On 3 June 2014 the Tribunal determined that the conditions were necessary and should continue.
	
	
	On 2 August 2014 the Tribunal determined that the existing orders were necessary and should continue.
	
	
	On 11 December 2014 and 17 February 2015 Dr Lennings, psychologist, provided reports to the plaintiff in this application.
	


Applicable legislation and legal principles


	
	Applications for extension orders may only be made in relation to forensic patients (MHFP Act – Schedule 1, clause 3). A forensic patient is defined within the MHFP Act at s42. There is no issue that the defendant is currently a forensic patient.
	
	
	Section 40 of the MHFP Act sets out the objects of Pt 5 as follows:
	


“40   Objects

The objects of this Part are as follows:

(a)    to protect the safety of members of the public,

(b)    to provide for the care, treatment and control of persons subject to criminal proceedings who are suffering from a mental illness or mental condition,

(c)    to facilitate the care, treatment and control of any of those persons in correctional centres through community treatment orders,

(d)    to facilitate the provision of hospital care or care in the community through community treatment orders for any of those persons who require involuntary treatment,

(e)    to give an opportunity for those persons to have access to appropriate care.”


	
	The objects which relate to Pt 5 extend to Schedule 1 by virtue of s54A (within Pt 5) which provides as follows:
	


“Extension of status as forensic patient

A person’s status as a forensic patient may be extended in accordance with Schedule 1.”


	
	Under Schedule 1 of the MHFP Act, the test to be applied by the Court in relation to the making of an extension order is set out in clause 2:
	


“Clause 2 Forensic patients in respect of whom extension orders may be made

(1)    A forensic patient can be made the subject of an extension order as provided for by this Schedule if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that:

(a)    the forensic patient poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he or she ceases being a forensic patient, and

(b)    the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under section 53).

(2)    The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person causing serious harm to others is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.”


	
	Clause 5 of Schedule 1 sets out the requirements with respect to applications for an extension order:
	


Clause 5 Requirements with respect to application

An application for an extension order must be supported by documentation:

(a)    that addresses each of the matters referred to in clause 7 (2) (to the extent relevant to the application), and

(b)    that includes a report (prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner):

(i) that assesses the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others, and

(ii) that addresses the need for ongoing management of the patient as a forensic patient and the reasons why the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means.”


	
	A preliminary hearing into the application for an extension order is to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed or within such further time as the Court may allow (clause 6(4)). The task of the Court is:
	


“6(6)   If, following the preliminary hearing, it is not satisfied that the matters alleged in supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order, the Supreme Court must dismiss the application.”


	
	Matters to be considered by the Court are set out in clause 7(2) of Schedule 1:
	


“7    Determination of application for extension order

…

(2)    In determining whether or not to make an extension order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a)    the safety of the community,

(b)    the reports received from the persons appointed under clause 6 (5) to conduct examinations of the forensic patient,

(c)    the report of the qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided under clause 5 (b),

(d)    any other report of a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided in support of the application or by the forensic patient,

(e)    any order or decision made by the Tribunal with respect to the forensic patient that is relevant to the application,

(f)    any report of the Director-General of the Ministry of Health, the Commissioner of Corrective Services, the Director-General of the Department of Family and Community Services or any other government Department or agency responsible for the detention, care or treatment of the forensic patient,

(g)    the level of the forensic patient’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while a forensic patient (including while released from custody subject to conditions and while on a leave of absence in accordance with section 49 or 50),

(h)    the views of the court that imposed the limiting term or existing extension order on the forensic patient at the time the limiting term or extension order was imposed,

(i)    any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others.

…”


	
	Clause 10 of Schedule 1 makes provision for an interim extension order:
	


“10    Interim extension order

The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim extension of a person’s status as a forensic patient if, in proceedings on an application for an extension order, it appears to the Court:

(a)    that the limiting term or existing extension order to which the forensic patient is subject will expire before the proceedings are determined, and

(b)    that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order.”


	
	The test to be applied by the Court in determining whether a forensic patient “can” be made the subject of an extension order is set out in clause 2 of schedule 1. A number of the phrases used in that clause are identical to those found in the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act  2006 (HRO Act). It was accepted by the parties that judicial consideration of those phrases in the context of the HRO Act has relevance to the meaning of those same provisions as found in the MHFP Act.
	
	
	Clause 2 of Schedule 1, provides that a forensic patient can only be made the subject of an order “if and only if” the Court is satisfied on a number of issues. Of this phrase McClellan CJ at CL in Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 said at [34]:
	


“34   … The caution that an order can only be made “if and only if” the Court is relevantly satisfied emphasises the care with which the Court must approach the question of whether to make orders imposing continuing restrictions, in whatever form, on a person’s liberty….”


	
	Clause 2 further requires the Court to be satisfied to a “high degree of probability” in relation to its satisfaction as to the provisions of clauses 2(1)(a) and (b). This constitutes a standard of proof which is higher than the civil standard but lower than the criminal standard.
	
	
	In Cornwall v Attorney-General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 at [21] the Court of Appeal (Mason P, Giles JA and Hodgson JA at 1) observed that:
	


“21    The expression “a high degree of probability” indicates something “beyond more probably than not”; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. …”


	
	The position is further clarified by the terms of clause 2(2) which provides that the Court:
	


“Is not required to determine that the risk of a person causing serious harm to others is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.”


	
	In State of NSW v Colin John Fisk [2009] NSWSC 778 Howie J said at [27] that the prediction the Court undertakes as to the risk of committing a further offence is concerned with the period in which it can make an order – i.e. a period of 5 years (citing Mason P in Tillman v Attorney-General for the State of NSW [2007] NSWCA 327; 70 NSWLR 448 at [8]).
	
	
	The Court’s task at the preliminary hearing stage was stated by Johnson J in State of NSW v Manners [2008] NSWSC 1242 at [8] as follows:
	


8    In Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [98], the Court of Appeal emphasised that the task of the Court, at the preliminary hearing stage, was not to weigh up the documentation or to predict the ultimate result or to consider what evidence the Defendant might call at the final hearing. It has been said that the test to be applied at this stage is similar to the prima facie case test applied by magistrates as part of committal proceedings: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Hayter at [6]; State of New South Wales v Brookes [2008] NSWSC 150 at [13].”

The parties agreed that this accurately stated the Court’s task.


	
	The phrase “unacceptable risk” is not defined by the MHFP Act. In first instance decisions in New South Wales, a difference of opinion has emerged. The current position may be summarised as follows. In State of NSW v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 R A Hulme J set out his preliminary view that an “unacceptable risk” is one where “the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made” (at [20]). In his final decision in relation to the same application (State of NSW v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 308 at [28]) R A Hulme J indicated that the words “unacceptable risk” ought to be given their everyday meaning in the context of the provision in which they appear and having regard to the objects of the Act (at [58]). This approach has been followed by Fullerton J and McCallum J.
	
	
	In contrast, Davies J has applied a “balancing exercise” approach which he took from two decisions of the Western Australian Court of Appeal (Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASCA 206; 176 A Crim R 110 per Wheeler JA, with whom Le Miere AJA agreed) at [63]; Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; 198 A Crim R 149 at [27]). In this approach the test for “unacceptable risk” involves a balancing exercise of the following factors. First, the likelihood of committing a further serious offence; second, the gravity of such an offence; and third, the consequences of an order on the offender.
	
	
	In State of NSW v Graeme Allan Reed (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 625 McCallum J noted the two approaches and cited the submissions of the State “that it may be appropriate to treat the interstate authorities (and implicitly the decision of Davies J to the extent his Honour relied upon those authorities) with caution”. Her Honour observed “the impact of an order on the offender is not a factor in the relevant balancing exercise, which focuses rather on the assessment of factors relevant to the content of the risk itself (such as the degree of risk and likely consequences if an offence is committed)” (at [15]). Otherwise her Honour did not consider that it was necessary to resolve the issue.
	
	
	There are thus two approaches which have been taken by first instance decisions in NSW as to what factors the Court ought have regard to in considering what will constitute an “unacceptable risk”. The issue as to which of these approaches is correct remains to be resolved. I am of the opinion that the preferable approach is that adopted by R A Hulme J and I propose to apply it in this case.
	


The evidence


	
	At the time of the first extension order application, the Court was provided with expert assessment evidence from a psychiatrist, Dr Andrew Ellis, and a psychologist, Professor Susan Hayes.
	
	
	Dr Ellis concluded that the defendant met the criteria (DSM 5) for intellectual disability. Dr Ellis said that the defendant’s level of function showed consistent requirements for assistance in literacy, life skills, problem solving and emotional regulation. He also identified an alcohol use disorder, but noted that in the defendant’s partially controlled environment, this disorder was in remission. He also noted that the defendant had been assessed at various times as suffering from a personality disorder and that there was sufficient information to conclude that he had adult anti-social personality traits.
	
	
	In relation to ongoing risk factors for future offending, Dr Ellis stated:
	


“Identified risk factors are poor coping skills arising from his intellectual disability, lack of stable relationships, impulsivity, historical substance abuse, anti-social personality traits, his history of offending, including whilst on conditional liberty, negative attitude towards his offences and authority, childhood maladjustment, employment problems, poor prior engagement with rehabilitation.”


	
	Professor Hayes, who appears to have had a good rapport with the defendant, confirmed that he suffered from an intellectual disability citing performance on a number of psychometric tests to confirm this. In keeping with the opinion of Dr Ellis, she concluded that the defendant met three sets of DSM 5 criteria: intellectual disability, anti-social personality disorder and alcohol use disorder. Professor Hayes had additionally carried out risk assessments on the Static-99 test which showed that the defendant fell into the category of moderate-high risk (of sexual re-offending). Professor Hayes noted, however, that this instrument did not include populations of individuals with disabilities. She also noted that the static-2002R test had included a small sample of sex offenders with intellectual disabilities and that on that instrument the defendant was placed in the high risk category.
	
	
	Professor Hayes assessed the defendant on an instrument specifically designed for assessing risk in intellectually disabled sex offenders, the ARMIDILO-S (Assessment and Risk Manageability of Individuals with Developmental and Intellectual Limitations who offend – sexually). She concluded that the defendant presented an overall convergent risk to a moderate level and identified a similar range of risk factors for future offences as set out by Dr Ellis. Overall, she was of the opinion that the defendant posed a moderate to high risk of causing serious harm to others which could be significantly reduced by risk management strategies.
	
	
	There was evidence in the form of reports of personnel from New Horizons who provide some supervision for the defendant. He continues to live alone in the community in a house in Panania. To occupy himself he works on a car he is restoring and collects and sells scrap metal. He continues to receive supervision and support from a case manager from New Horizons as part of the Community Justice Program of no less than 35 hours per week. He remains subject to all of the other conditions attached to the order for his conditional release.
	
	
	The most recent review under s46 of the MHFP Act occurred on 2 December 2014. On that occasion the Tribunal was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the present arrangement for care, treatment and release of the defendant were necessary and sufficient for the protection of him from serious harm and for the protection of others from serious harm. The Tribunal did not vary any of the conditions already in place.
	
	
	On behalf of the defendant, a number of reports have been obtained from a psychologist, Dr Seidler. Her most recent reports advise as follows:
	


“Based on my contact with Herbert to date, my impression is very similar to that of my colleague Caroline Hare from last year. That is, he is not really a candidate for psychological treatment. Let me preface this by saying that Herbert is pleasant and willing to attend sessions and he is very talkative through the sessions but there are three primary issues with his treatment. Firstly, the offence happened many years ago now and under a particular set of circumstances that given Mr Herbert’s cognitive and psychological functioning, he cannot much remember or access or discuss in enough detail that we can reasonably work on relapse prevention. Secondly, Mr Herbert is a low functioning individual who is not psychologically minded, reflective or able to consistently or reasonably access his thoughts and feelings which is essential to profit from an engage in psychological treatment. This means the content of sessions is often confusing, circular, and unrelated to the primary issues, such that he needs a great deal of assistance to focus. This is not his fault but a function of how he operates cognitively and socially. Thirdly, despite the seriousness of Mr Herbert’s sexual offending, he is a low risk offender in terms of sexual deviancy. His primary issues are alcohol abuse, negative peer associations (including his social vulnerability to these kinds of people) and an unstructured personal routine. These risks remain and are best managed by intensive case management and disability services support. There is no need for psychological treatment to address these issues on an ongoing basis. …” (17 September 2004)

“I do not see Herbert as possessing significant mental health issues that require psychological counselling. He does express low mood and frustration at times but this usually in relation to normal life events and not something that in my opinion required psychological therapy. He does need someone who he can talk to on an ongoing basis so he can debrief about those things that impact upon him, such as time with his daughter etc. In my opinion, ongoing disability and case management support, which includes someone he has a positive enough relationship with that he can talk to and get some support from will meet his needs on an ongoing basis. However, if this situation changes, he starts to drink etc, or has a significant relationship setback or if his mental health obviously deteriorates that this changes things and he can always come back to our Service. It is not that I don’t want to see him but that I don’t consider he has ongoing need for treatment at this time that require specialist intervention. ...” (6 October 2004)


	
	For this preliminary application, two reports were obtained by the plaintiff from Dr Lennings, psychologist, dated 11 November 2014 and 17 February 2015. In the November 2014 report, Dr Lennings had this to say about “risk assessment”:
	


“24   In reviewing my risk assessments previously reported in my reports I see no reason to change my prior assessment level, despite the good response to date from Mr McGuire to his return to the community and Professor Hayes moderation of dynamic risk to moderate. Mr McGuire remains at moderately high risk of committing another serious offence, with abstention from alcohol the most likely inhibitor of such an offence. Factors that continue to underlie Mr McGuire’s risk remain his lack of insight into his own or others feelings and motivations, his high impulsivity, his hedonism or pleasure seeking orientation, and the concern I have that left to his own devices he would rapidly resume a habit of significant alcohol intake. However, it appears likely that as long as Mr McGuire abstains from alcohol he is not likely to commit another serious offence.

25   The mitigation of risk is dependent upon the identification of risk factors that can be managed within a community setting. In previous reports the primary treatment targets identified have been sexual deviancy and alcohol risk. More general risks include his impulsivity and hedonistic attitude to life. However, it is generally accepted by most of the people who have reviewed Mr McGuire, and thereby strengthens my opinion, that Mr McGuire is unlikely to suffer from any sexual deviancy.”


	
	Dr Lennings set out his conclusions as follows:
	


“36   The primary needs for Mr McGuire are to abstain from alcohol, to be engaged in a reasonable daily routine and to have secure accommodation. In addition, an external incentive to manage his behaviour via supervision has been to date required. A dilemma arises in that Mr McGuire’s failure to internalise his need for restraint or abstinence suggests that he will likely continue to require supervision. …

37   The thesis of this report is that managing Mr McGuire’s access to alcohol remains a key issue in reduction of risk. There are three means to manage such a need. The first is via treatment (therapy) such that Mr McGuire gains insight into his need not to drink, develops behavioural skills in avoiding alcohol and maintains the motivation to remain abstinent. I see no likelihood of such treatment occurring or being of any real use in this situation.

38   The second approach is the administration of pharmacological agents such as Campral or Naltrexone to moderate his desire to drink alcohol, or, in the alternate, the administration of a drug such as Antabuse to establish an aversive reaction should Mr McGuire drink. However, both approaches require motivation by Mr McGuire to take such medication, especially as side effects (especially to Antabuse and Naltrexone) can be anticipated. …

39   The third approach is based on supervision. Supervision has two outcomes. The first is that it acts as a reminder to Mr McGuire that he is on an order and hopefully leads to some external inhibition of behaviour out of fear of being caught and returned to gaol. Such supervision needs to be highly visible and frequent in order to achieve that aim. Such supervision is designed to inhibit behaviour as well as increase the probability of medication adherence. The second role of supervision is to allow observation of Mr McGuire should he lapse in a significant way and intervene before his behaviour reaches a threshold where a serious criminal offence may occur. …

40   To date the supervision and accommodation package has established a situation where Mr McGuire is functioning as effectively as he can in the community, and this is attested by the comments of his family and the welcoming him back into their lives. In my view there is little more that can be gained by extending the supervision order on Mr McGuire other than making the decision that the supervision order will need to be effectively life long.

…

42 Mr McGuire is unlikely to be accepted as a mental health patient by a mental health service in the absence of any meaningful mental illness diagnosis. If he does travel to be with his brother, which seems to be the most likely outcome if the supervision order lapses, there are unlikely to be any services available for him or capable of acting as a case manager. Thus there appear to be no services that can provide a lesser level of restriction in managing his behaviour.

…

44   For the above reasons I see no prospect for managing Mr McGuire by any less restrictive means that by a supervision order if supervision of his behaviour is to be considered a requirement.

…

47   As I have noted earlier, the prevention of relapse into alcohol use remains a major concern and one most likely to minimise his risk of a serious criminal offence. To my mind the supervision and monitoring to date have been effective in preventing a relapse. His relapse potential in the absence of such monitoring remains unknown but I presume it to be high. If he were to remain in Sydney in proximity to liquor outlets, and especially if he were not supervised, I expect his relapse potential to be high. Living on an isolated property with his brother, who professes a strong anti alcohol/drug philosophy and without independent transport his potential for relapse is low. If he obtains independent transport I believe that the relapse potential will likely become high at some point.

…

49   In summary the current case management plan, with the removal of requirements for treatments of sexual deviancy appears adequate to maintain his risk if an extended supervision order is to be granted. Given the development of gambling in his behavioural repertoire it seems wise to maintain the scrutiny of his finances by the Guardianship Board. In the alternate, there seems little further rehabilitation that can occur for Mr McGuire: his continued placement under a supervision order delays the point at which time he will have to assume some responsibility for living offence free in society.”


	
	Dr Lennings’ report of 17 February 2015 was based on a review by him of the records of New Horizons’ contact with the defendant between October 2014 and February 2015. Dr Lennings described the results of his documentary review as follows:
	


“3   The documents consisted of additional records of New Horizons’ contact with Mr McGuire. The documents reveal generally reasonable conduct although he appears to get sets against certain workers and becomes more difficult in his response to them. At times he can become quite aggressive to staff and at other times was reported as being aggressive in speech patterns. He shows an inability to focus on goals (e.g. obtaining his licence) although he continues to assert his desire to live in the country with his brother and to have some relationship with his daughter. He shows some signs of potential conflict about linking with family members – for instance he complained about how little money he received from his brother in Young when working for him, and also seemed “paranoid” about his sister’s reactions to his former partner and daughter but generally seems to have a positive relationship with them. He can get exasperated with his family at times referring to them “treating me like shit” but seemingly such outbursts are rare and he maintained contact with his sister. …

…

6   I had indicated in my previous report that the primary needs for Mr McGuire are to abstain from alcohol, to be engaged in a reasonable daily routine and to have secure accommodation. I raised my concern that on the strength of my reading of the New Horizon reports, Mr McGuire had not been able to achieve a satisfactory level of routine and structure in his life without assistance and supervisory support. Supervision currently supplements his lack of social support … In general he has abstained from alcohol but it seemed to me that was largely a function of his continued supervision and testing. In order to maintain the benefits of supervision it seems necessary to consider retaining his status as a forensic patient. It is difficult to see what alternate, meaningful source of supervision with sufficient force to ensure compliance from Mr McGuire there is other than the current system…

11   My views have not changed. The difficulty for Mr McGuire is he does not have insight into his behaviour, the anti-sociality of his underlying personality will encourage impulsive, self-gratifying and abrasive behaviour, and he will remain limited in his ability to set and achieve meaningful goals. His risk is based on a mix of historical features and maladaptive behaviours, and his lack of insight means that his risk rating is unlikely to change in the medium term. …”

Submissions


	
	On behalf of the defendant it was submitted that the following matters were of primary consideration:
	



	
	What is the assessment of risk of further serious sexual offending or serious sexual harm occurring and is that risk unacceptable.
	
	
	What is the assessment of further serious harm occurring generally and is the risk unacceptable.
	



	
	It was submitted by reference to the reports of Dr Ellis, Dr Hayes and Dr Lennings that the defendant’s responses were not indicative of sexual deviancy or a desire to inflict violence or pain for his own enjoyment within a sexual context.
	
	
	It was submitted that the risk of the commission of further sexual offences or the infliction of sexual violence was low, given the relatively low level of supervision which the defendant was receiving. It was submitted that since 10 January 2014 he was receiving 35 hours of supervision per week, between the hours of 8.30am and 2.30pm Monday to Friday. He was not monitored at night or on weekends. The supervision provided does not include treatment by psychiatrists or psychologists but by intellectual disability health workers. It was submitted that the extent of the supervision was effectively to drive the defendant around to medical appointments and to assist him collect scrap metal. It was submitted that the supervision by New Horizons provides no other value than a regular structure for the defendant.
	
	
	In relation to the risk of further serious offences or harm occurring generally, it was submitted that Dr Lennings’ conclusion as to supervision was incorrect. It was submitted that Dr Lennings’ conclusion was based on the assumption that if an extension order was not continued, the defendant would lose the structure and support that has been carefully built around him. It was submitted that even without the assistance of New Horizons, the defendant retained strong family support, particularly from his sister. There was an offer of support from his brother David who lives at Young.
	
	
	It was submitted that should an extension order not be made, the defendant would not lose the support of the Community Justice Program, which could continue to provide services for him. It was submitted that the extent of that supervision at the present time was modest and principally involved providing transportation.
	
	
	It was submitted that, if without supervision the prospects of the defendant relapsing into further serious offences or the commission of harm was low, the NSW Trustee and Guardian as the financial manager of his affairs would reduce the amount of alcohol and drug consumption available to him. It was submitted that the bulk of medical opinion was to the effect that no further psychological treatment was required by the defendant.
	
	
	In summary, the submissions put on behalf of the defendant were:
	


“This Court could not be satisfied that Dr Lennings’ reports and other relevant documents relied upon the plaintiff would prove to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if the interim extension order was not granted because:

(a)   Dr Lennings concludes that there is little more that can be done for the defendant from a therapeutic or pharmacological point of view;

(b)   While the defendant has been assessed as a moderately high risk of causing serious harm, he lacks the primary indicator for sexual re-offending being sexual deviancy or preoccupation. Further he has not re-offended since his release.

(c)   The defendant has largely abstained from alcohol and drugs whilst in the community.

(d)   He doesn’t have significant matters of violence on his criminal record.

(e)   He retains sufficient family connection in the community to provide him with the structure and support that he requires.

(f)   He remains under a financial management order that controls his finances lessening the risk of gambling or alcohol abuse to arise.”

Consideration


	
	In having regard to the requirements of the MHFP Act, and in particular Schedule 1, it needs to be kept in mind that the task of the Court is not to weigh up the documentation or to predict the ultimate result, but to consider the material globally and be satisfied on a prima facie basis that the relevant matters have been established. The submissions on behalf of the defendant are more appropriate to a final order rather than to a preliminary hearing.
	
	
	By reference to Clause 7(2) matters, the safety of the community remains an important consideration. This is the first stated object of Part 5 of the MHFP Act. A matter which supports the making of the order sought by the plaintiff is the defendant’s criminal history involving as it does episodes of violence. While there is no evidence of sexual deviancy, the defendant’s relatively good behaviour since his release into the community is adequately explained by the very caring supervision of the New Horizons personnel who perform a function which goes far beyond that of the provision of transportation. They not only provide structure to the defendant’s life, but companionship which would be otherwise lacking. As appears from their reports, they are also able to divert the defendant from potential episodes of aggression.
	
	
	The medical evidence, at least insofar as the preliminary hearing is concerned, is all one way. While the psychologists and psychiatrists have not identified any propensity towards sexual offending, all have confirmed the need for continuing supervision to prevent a lapse into alcohol and other substance abuse with consequent episodes of violence. The recent reports of Dr Lennings consistently emphasise that fact. He is blunt in his assessment that without the current level of supervision, the risk of the defendant relapsing into violent conduct is high.
	
	
	The assessment of the medical practitioners is consistent with the various decisions of the Tribunal, to which reference has been made elsewhere in this judgment.
	
	
	There is nothing in the orders sought by the plaintiff which runs counter to the judgment of Garling J when imposing the existing extension order (Attorney General of NSW v McGuire (No 2)).
	
	
	Not only the medical evidence, but also the regular reports of the New Horizons personnel, make it clear that it is their presence and their ability to distract or divert the defendant from aggressive behaviour which have played a significant part in preventing offending during the operation of the current extension order. There is nothing in the reports of Dr Seidler to contrary effect.
	
	
	It is not without significance that the following issues have arisen from time to time since the defendant was released into the community:
	


(a)   Consumption of alcohol.

(b)   Non-compliance with taking medication.

(c)   Refusing breath tests and blood tests.

(d)   Gambling.

(e)   Unstable relationship with family (including sister, brothers and daughter).

(f)   Poor coping skills and a perceived need (by the New Horizons personnel) of a need to see a psychologist/counsellor.

These issues have been largely ameliorated or defused by the actions of the New Horizons personnel.


	
	It follows that I am satisfied to the standard relevant to a preliminary hearing, that the requirements of Clause 7(2) of Schedule 1 have been made out by the plaintiff.
	
	
	Given the complexity of the material which is before the Court, and which will form part of the matters to be considered at the final hearing, I have concluded that it is appropriate to appoint two health professionals to examine the defendant and to provide a report. I am also satisfied that the existing extension order, to which the defendant is subject, will expire before the proceedings are determined.
	
	
	For the purpose of the preliminary hearing, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability, that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm if he ceases to be a forensic patient for the following reasons.
	



	
	The existence of such a risk was accepted in Attorney General of NSW v McGuire (No 2) and there has been no real mitigation of those risk factors since.
	
	
	More recently, Dr Lennings in his reports of November 2014 and February 2015 is of the opinion that the defendant continues to pose a moderately high risk of harm to others.
	
	
	The New Horizons notes confirm the ongoing existence of risk factors associated with this moderately high risk.
	
	
	In the circumstances, and giving the words “unacceptable risk” their normal meaning, the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made and therefore the risk is unacceptable.
	



	
	I am also satisfied on the basis of the material above to a high degree of probability, that the risk which has been identified cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means. While there has been some (albeit sparse) evidence of voluntary assistance which can be provided to the defendant should supervision cease, I am not persuaded that the defendant would participate in any voluntary programs. The effect of the evidence is that it is the punitive element which ensures his compliance with supervision and the conditions which have been imposed on his liberty.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the above reasons, I make the following orders which have been agreed between the parties.

		12 March 2015",2015-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703805,SB v R [2015] NSWCCA 31,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: SB (“the applicant”), who is a juvenile who cannot be identified because of the provisions of s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), applies for leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed upon him by her Honour Judge Wells SC in the District Court at Lismore on 21 February 2014.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence in respect of an offence of take and detain child with the intention of removing and keeping the child from the lawful control of her parent, contrary to s 87(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and reckless wounding, contrary to s 35(4) of that Act. The maximum penalties for these offences are imprisonment for 10 years and 7 years respectively.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant for the first of these offences her Honour took into account, at the applicant’s request, six further offences listed on a Form 1 document. They were offences of assault and armed with intent to commit an indictable offence committed on 26 April 2013, and offences that were associated with the primary offence, namely armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, face blackened/disguised with intent to commit indictable offence, larceny and assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 17 May 2013.
	
	
	The learned judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years for the take and detain child offence and imprisonment for 1 year 6 months for the reckless wounding offence. Both sentences were specified to commence on 17 May 2013, the day of the applicant’s arrest.
	


Facts


	
	The facts relating to the offences for which the applicant was sentenced are better understood in the context of some earlier offences. There was no dispute at the hearing of the application as to the facts in relation to any of these matters. I have drawn the following primarily from the written submissions of Ms N Williams, counsel for the Crown.
	


Ballina High School knife incident on 12 October 2011


	
	On 11 October 2011 the applicant had an altercation with another student at school. He became upset and agitated. This was observed by the victim, the Deputy Principal, who calmed him down and contacted his carer. However, the applicant walked out and left the school grounds.
	
	
	The applicant went home that night and, after having “words” with his carer, he packed a bag and left. He was later found by police and taken to another foster carer for the night.
	
	
	The following morning the applicant returned to school. His carer had contacted the school and spoken with the Deputy Principal about the applicant’s actions the previous night, resulting in the Deputy Principal leaving his office to check on the applicant. He found the applicant exiting a classroom, slamming a door, and kicking bins as he walked away. The Deputy Principal tried to talk to him but he replied, “don’t fucking talk to me, I’m sick of school”. He walked away, “slamming doors open” as he left the building and then exited the school grounds.
	
	
	Soon after this the Deputy Principal saw the applicant return to the school grounds and he was carrying a large kitchen knife. He was asked to stop but he continued across the oval carrying the knife in his right hand. He was following his brother and then left the school grounds before returning through a car park. He was again requested to stop, but would not, and he showed the Deputy Principal the knife blade which had some blood from his own hand on it. He then ran into a school building and walked towards a teacher with the knife. There were students in the classroom at the time. The Deputy Principal followed but the applicant turned to him, raised the knife, and told him, “get out or I’ll stab you”. The applicant proceeded to close some doors, he went down some stairs and again raised the knife towards the Deputy Principal. The police attended and arrested the applicant when he surrendered on the school oval. During the course of these events the school had to be placed into “lockdown”.
	
	
	On 1 March 2012, the Ballina Children’s Court placed the applicant on probation for 18 months for the offences of common assault, harass/intimidate school staff member and custody of a knife at a school. He was subject to those probation orders at the time of the following events, including the index offences.
	


Incident at the applicant’s home on 26 April 2013


	
	The victim in relation to this matter was the applicant’s older brother. They had not spoken to one another for 18 months but had recently rekindled their friendship. The brother and his two sons, aged 6 and 7, visited the applicant at his Ballina home on 26 April 2013.
	
	
	That afternoon, when the victim went upstairs to run a bath for the children, he overheard the applicant speaking to the boys in the downstairs games room. The victim went downstairs and saw the boys sitting on lounges in front of the TV. He described the boys as “looking uncomfortable”. The brother sent the boys upstairs for their bath and asked the applicant if everything was alright. The applicant replied that he had asked the boys to show him their penises. The brother asked why, to which the applicant said that he just want to see. He confirmed that he had his own penis out when he was speaking to the boys.
	
	
	The brother became enraged and lectured the applicant on his inappropriate behaviour. A heated argument ensued including a physical altercation. During the course of the argument the applicant repeatedly threatened to commit suicide. He then left the house and drove away but returned a short time later when the victim was upstairs in the bathroom with the children. He came up the stairs with what was described as a 30cm kitchen knife in his hand. He again threatened to commit suicide. The brother locked himself and the children in the bathroom but the applicant tried to kick the door down. His brother rang triple 0 as the applicant was attempting to kick the door down. He was yelling abuse and making threats. He left the house again shortly afterwards.
	
	
	The applicant was charged with offences of assault and armed with intent to commit an indictable offence which were listed on a Form 1 document and taken into account at his request in sentencing for the first of the index offences. He was on bail for these matters when the following events occurred.
	


Facts relating to index offences


	
	On the afternoon of 17 May 2013 the applicant drove to the Ballina Shopping Centre, leaving his car parked on the wrong side of the road. He was wearing a jumper with the hood pulled over his head and a white scarf covering his face from the eyes down (Form 1: face disguised with intent to commit an indictable offence).
	
	
	He walked the length of the shopping centre and entered a supermarket and selected a large carving knife. He moved to different parts of the store and took off the wrapping. He left the supermarket holding the knife (Form 1: larceny), causing alarm among customers and shop assistants, many of whom were screaming and running away (Form 1: armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely assault). He made his way to a coin-operated children’s ride. The area was crowded with people at the time. The five year old female victim was on the ride with her two younger brothers. The mother stood directly beside the ride.
	
	
	The applicant walked straight up to the children’s ride and, as the victim was getting out of the ride, he “aggressively took hold of her arm”. He had the knife pointed out towards persons nearby, including the victim’s mother and brothers. He violently dragged the child away with the knife held in front of him. The child was screaming and struggling to get free. Her shirt was half pulled off during the struggle.
	
	
	A large crowd had gathered by this time. Many screamed at the applicant to release the child. At this stage the second victim, Mr Wayne Marriott, challenged the applicant to release the child but the applicant pointed the knife in his outstretched arm towards him, flicking it toward Mr Marriott as he moved closer to the applicant. At this point the child managed to break free and ran to a nearby witness. Mr Marriott moved in and took hold of the applicant’s arms and pushed him up against the counter of a kiosk. Mr Marriott was stabbed to the left hand during the ensuing struggle. Other witnesses moved in and assisted him to overpower the applicant and bring him to the ground. During this struggle Mr Marriott’s head collided with the display counter of the kiosk, causing a large contusion and laceration to his forehead. A significant amount of blood gushed from his wounds.
	
	
	There were about ten people who assisted in gaining control of the applicant, disarming him and securing the knife. His hands were tied behind his back until the police arrived. He was handcuffed and led away but continued to yell and struggle whilst being escorted to the police vehicle.
	
	
	The applicant was interviewed by police and told them that when he gets stressed and angry he blacks out. He claimed that he did not recall the incident and said that if he had known what he was doing, he would not have done it. He said that he felt regretful and would like to apologise to the entire community.
	
	
	The agreed facts continued by indicating that as a result of the attack the young child was extremely distressed and traumatised. She sustained bruising to her arms where she was held (Form 1: assault occasioning actual bodily harm). Her mother and siblings were also extremely traumatised and distressed.
	
	
	Mr Marriott received eight sutures to his forehead and sustained swelling and bruising as well. He also received one suture to his left hand.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge found that the offence involving the child was “above the mid-range of seriousness” and she found the wounding of Mr Marriott was “at the least at the very high end of recklessness”.
	


Personal circumstances of the applicant


	
	The personal circumstances of the applicant were succinctly summarised in the written submissions for the Crown from which I draw the following.
	
	
	The applicant was born in 1995 and was aged 17 ½ at the time of the offences. He was one of more than 12 siblings and half-siblings who had been abandoned many years before by their parents. His mother’s whereabouts were unknown and his father lived in Ballina. According to a Juvenile Justice Report, the whole family had been subjected to “an alcoholic father and an uncaring mother, who together inflicted physical abuse, chronic neglect, lack of supervision and domestic violence, thus resulting in [the applicant] being placed in the care of the minister”.
	
	
	The applicant had lived with a carer, Ms Linda Marshall, for about 10 years. She gave evidence on his behalf at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	Psychological testing in 2007 indicated that the applicant had a mild intellectual disability. Although he had good superficial verbal skills, it was reported that he had difficulty understanding underlying concepts, and was heavily reliant on structure and routine. This was particularly apparent in the evidence given by Ms Marshall who spoke of the importance of the applicant having boundaries which she provided for him when he lived in her home.
	
	
	The applicant had an attraction to vocations that involved wearing uniforms and was said to have “role-played” in public as a member of these professions. Ms Marshall said that he always wanted to be a policeman, an ambulance officer or some type of authority figure. She described him as functioning intellectually akin to an 11-12 year old child.
	
	
	More recent psychiatric examinations had suggested that the applicant had a cognitive disability at the borderline to mild level, but was not mentally ill.
	
	
	Given some of the issues raised by the grounds of appeal it is worth referring in more detail to some of the reports that were before the District Court. The applicant was brought to the Lismore Adult Mental Health Unit two days after his arrest for the index offences. He was assessed by Dr Justine Hoey-Thompson who provided a report of 21 May 2013. Dr Hoey-Thompson noted the following under the heading “Impression”:
	


“A young man with serious offenses on the background of a traumatic childhood, low IQ, and documented poor frustration tolerance and previous violence. There are not clear psychotic or mood symptoms to explain the event. [The applicant] reports amnesia for the event. There is an element of inconsistency in his descriptions of memory loss and he has previously discussed the knife event at the school in 2011, and the recent incident of a sexual nature with minors with his psychologist, but he denied recollection of either event to me.”


	
	Dr Hoey-Thompson made the following diagnosis: conduct disorder/oppositional defiant disorder and mild intellectual disability. She made a differential diagnosis of “dissociative disorder NOS” (not otherwise specified).
	
	
	A report by Mr Simon DuBois, psychologist, dated 27 May 2013 was before the court. Mr DuBois had been counselling the applicant for a period of 18 months. His opinion is encapsulated in the following from his report:
	


“I believe these patterns of behaviour (social isolation, affect disregulation, inappropriate engagement with others, preoccupation with having a role of importance) are principally born from an inability to make meaningful relationships in the community either through education, work or informally with peers. This incapacity stems from the influences of a mild intellectual disability and exacerbated by poor family experiences as a child.”


	
	Mr DuBois also discussed the applicant’s interest in “authority rule based roles”. In that context he said:
	


“I am also concerned that his interest/fascination in this area may encourage a preoccupation with weapons, and may be a motivator for his use of knives in situations where he is aggravated. Assessments are warranted to investigate this further.”


	
	There was also a report by Dr John Kasinathan dated 21 June 2013 available to her Honour. Dr Kasinathan found that the applicant did not have a mental illness but did have an intellectual disability, diagnosed under DSM-5 as “mild intellectual disability”. The doctor expanded on this as follows:
	


“Specifically in the conceptual domain, [the applicant] had difficulties in arithmetic and complex reading. He displayed a concrete approach to certain issues, such as his anger issues. In the social domain, he displayed some immaturity and difficulty accurately perceiving social cues from others. His language tended to be more concrete than expected for age. His social judgement was immature and he presented as gullible. In the practical domain, he appeared to be functioning age-appropriately in personal care, though he likely needs some support with complex daily living tasks.”


	
	Dr Kasinathan recommended that the applicant engage in comprehensive anger management counselling for at least 12 months. He considered that his cognitive limitations would not prohibit him from actively participating in anger management and violent offender counselling programs. He strongly recommended that the applicant be referred to a community justice program which is able to offer a much higher level of support and accommodation and supervision for young offenders with an intellectual disability in order to support them in the community and reduce the risk of re-offending.
	


Determinations of the sentencing judge


	
	The learned judge referred to a number of matters bearing upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the take and detain child offence. She referred to the very young age of the child (5) and that there was “some degree of rough handling, albeit mild”. She considered that the offence “would have been completely terrifying for the child, for her very young siblings and for her mother, as well as being so for members of the public, who were just going about their business shopping in a public place”. Her Honour also referred to aspects of the victim impact statement made by the child’s mother which indicated a significant degree of enduring and traumatic psychological consequence for her and all of her children. One reason for this was the fact that the offender was a stranger to the child, giving rise to a fear of strangers and public places.
	
	
	Her Honour also had regard to the applicant having deliberately taken a weapon into a public place that was likely to be busy and likely to maximise the danger to others. She said while his motivation was not clear, “he must have known from the prior matter just how serious his actions were on this occasion”. She rejected his claim that he could not explain his actions as he had forgotten or was not aware of what he was doing.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account that the offence was of short duration, but noted that it only stopped as a result of heroic intervention by members of the public, particularly Mr Marriott. In sum, she assessed this offence as being “above the mid-range” of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The wounding of Mr Marriott was assessed as not deliberate but:
	


“at least at the very high end of recklessness, in that he armed himself with a large carving knife in a busy public place in the threatening way that he did. The wounds were not of the worst kind, but certainly much more than trivial. They were caused when Mr Marriott was only trying to calm the situation down and prevent making matters any worse than they already were for the offender.”


	
	Her Honour referred to s 18(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act which provides for offences of this type to be dealt with according to law or under the provisions of that Act. She determined on the former for reasons she specified:
	


“Firstly the offence of detaining a child is a serious offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years as indicated. It is an objectively serious example of this type of offence. The wounding is a serious offence as indicated by the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period.

Secondly, while not overlooking the offender’s age and his mild intellectual disability, he was not far short of 18 years of age when the offences were committed. Despite his mild intellectual disability, he has been otherwise progressing well.

Thirdly, he recently committed a very similar offence involving the use of a knife being wielded in a public place, a school, and putting at risk the safety of others. Despite his problems it would not have been lost on him just how serious that matter was.”


	
	Her Honour found special circumstances for the purposes of s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and ordered that the applicant serve his sentence as a juvenile offender and specified the following reasons:
	


“The reasons that such an order will be made are that he is vulnerable he has an intellectual disability and because of his very difficult early childhood years. He is also currently progressing well in terms of his education and other general behaviour and although they are not the sole consideration, his needs and his rehabilitation are best suited to the programmes that he is currently undertaking.”


	
	Her Honour had regard to the greater emphasis placed on rehabilitation when a young person is dealt with under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act but considered that general and personal deterrence still applied. She added:
	


“They are moderated by his mild intellectual disability, but only to a limited extent. In this case there are adult-like features found in the serious objective factors of the offence, his prior record and the fact that he is approaching maturity.”


	
	Finally, her Honour recorded that she had taken into account “the undoubted effect that his disadvantaged early life has had on his subsequent behaviour”; the pleas of guilty (and her Honour allowed a 25 per cent discount); his expression of remorse; and that he had been progressing well on remand in juvenile detention for the past 10 months.
	


Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending


	
	It was submitted that it was erroneous for the judge to have taken into account in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences matters that were the subject of offences on the Form 1 document; for example, taking into account the mild rough handling of the child because that was encapsulated in the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence. No authority was cited for this proposition which I consider to be untenable, particularly as there was no contention of the judge having erred in the manner in which she took the Form 1 offences into account.
	
	
	Another asserted error was her Honour referring to the abduction of the child only ending through the intervention of members of the public, whereas it was an agreed fact that the child managed to free herself from the applicant’s grasp before he was restrained by the bystanders. To my mind, this is a distinction without a difference; Mr Marriott was moving towards the applicant and others were screaming at him to release the child when she broke free.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted to have been erroneous for her Honour to take into account the wound to Mr Marriott’s head when this was not directly caused by the applicant but resulted from his head having come into contact with a display counter as he endeavoured to restrain the applicant. The suggestion that the applicant should not bear responsibility for this is also untenable.
	
	
	I note that Mr Barrow, counsel for the applicant at the hearing of the application, was not the author of the written submissions and made no oral submissions in support of this ground.
	


Ground 2 - The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the sentencing principles relating to mental illness and failed to give proper weight to the mental illness of the applicant when sentencing him


	
	The submissions for the applicant accepted that the judge had regard to his mental condition. However, it was argued that she was, at least to some extent, dismissive of it; she was unduly swayed by her regard for his criminality that she failed to “afford proper weight” to it; there was very little moderation of the need for general deterrence; and she did not say that his moral culpability was reduced because there was a causal connection between his intellectual disability and the offending.
	
	
	The various ways in which an offender’s mental or intellectual condition may bear upon sentence are well settled. They were conveniently summarised in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177] (citations omitted):
	


●   Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence.

●   It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.

●   It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced.

●   It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence.

●   Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public.


	
	The judge said nothing about the applicant’s moral culpability being reduced on account of a causal connection between the offending and his intellectual disability. If she had made such a finding, it would have permitted a reduction in the need for denunciation of his conduct. But the judge said nothing about denunciation either.
	
	
	It was appropriate for the judge to reduce the emphasis to be given to general deterrence. She said this would only be to “a limited extent” but precisely how much affect this had on the sentence is beyond calculation. She also said the same about personal deterrence, but that is a matter of some controversy given the applicant’s history of similar offending.
	
	
	Her Honour said nothing about protection of society. She would have been well-justified in taking into account this countervailing matter given the applicant’s history of offending and the escalating dangerousness of his conduct. (And see the concern expressed by Mr Dubois in the extract from his report above (at [34].)
	
	
	The complaint about her Honour being dismissive related to something she said about the applicant’s intellectual disability being “mild” during the course of submissions on sentence. The applicant’s solicitor immediately reminded her of what the High Court said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [50] about the significance of a mild intellectual disability. Her Honour thereafter (during submissions and in her sentencing judgment) said nothing to indicate she was at all dismissive.
	
	
	Whether the judge gave inadequate weight to some mitigating aspects relevant to the applicant’s mental condition, or excessive weight to aspects pointing in the opposite direction, is only capable of discernment by a consideration of the sentence itself. There is no misstatement of sentencing principle in anything her Honour said and, having regard to the submissions that were made to her, I would not be prepared to consider that she was not mindful of any of the relevant considerations.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 3 - The sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	The written submissions for the applicant contended that the judge recognised the significant subjective features: young age; difficult early home life; intellectual disability; expressions of remorse; and demonstrated rehabilitation over the remand period. However, it was contended that she allowed her view of the objective seriousness of the offending to “completely overshadow” these matters.
	
	
	It was also contended that the sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of NSW supported a conclusion that the sentences for each offence were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant’s primary contention is really concerned with the weight that was given to his subjective case. He does not contend that the judge failed to take into account any relevant consideration.
	
	
	The statistical analysis does not carry the ground either. There were only eight cases in the database for the take and detain child offence, with no information as to the congeries of facts in any of them. And the analysis for the reckless wounding offence is of passing interest at best, given the sentence for that offence was entirely subsumed within the other sentence.
	
	
	I fully acknowledge the sentiment in Mr Barrow’s submission to the Court that “the incarceration of an intellectually disabled youth is an unpalatable prospect”. However, this case required the imposition of a significant sentence of imprisonment notwithstanding, and despite the applicant’s troubled background. The applicant has not been able to successfully challenge the judge’s assessment that the take and detain child offence was above the mid-range of objective seriousness. And, whilst some moderation was required in relation to the applicant’s intellectual disability and his background, there was the countervailing concern for protection of the community given this was the third occasion that he had engaged in threatening and dangerous behaviour with a potentially lethal weapon.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the individual sentences are manifestly excessive. Moreover, even if I were persuaded that the sentence for the detain child offence was excessive and should be reduced, a principled approach in resentencing would warrant some accumulation to reflect the fact that the offences were concerned with different victims. The overall result would not be less, and potentially could be more.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred by taking the standard non-parole period for the offence of reckless wounding into account: (a) when deciding that the applicant would be dealt with according to law and (b) when sentencing the applicant for the reckless wounding offence


	
	Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides for standard non-parole periods to be prescribed for offences. Reckless wounding is one such offence and the standard non-parole period is 3 years (the maximum penalty being 7 years). However, s 54D(3) provides that Div 1A does not apply in sentencing an offender who was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The judge twice referred to there being a standard non-parole period prescribed for the offence of reckless wounding. The first reference appeared in the first sentence of her judgment:
	


“The young person … entered pleas of guilty to an offence of detaining a child with intent to remove child from parental control, (s 87(1) Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty 10 years) and a charge of reckless wounding, (s 35(4) Crimes Act, maximum penalty seven years with a three year standard non-parole period).”


	
	The second reference appeared in the passage where her Honour set out her reasons for dealing with the matter according to law: see above at [41].
	
	
	At no stage did her Honour indicate that she was taking the standard non-parole period into account in the manner indicated in Muldrock v The Queen; that is, as a benchmark or guidepost. I am not persuaded that she had inappropriate regard to it at all. The first reference to it was really a formulaic introductory sentence in a sentencing judgment. The second reference was to explain how serious, in a general sense, Parliament regards the offence of reckless wounding. It was not to indicate the seriousness of the offence at hand. Indeed, counsel for the applicant conceded that he could take no issue with her Honour’s statement: “The wounding is a serious offence”.
	
	
	This ground is of no practical bearing in any event for two reasons. First, the sentence for the reckless wounding was shorter and entirely subsumed within the sentence for the take and detain child offence. In other words, it had no operative significance upon the overall sentencing disposition. Secondly, the sentence for the reckless wounding has expired, so even if this Court were to find error and reduce it there would be no practical effect.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal granted.

2703807,R v Beattie (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 396,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Objection has been taken by defence counsel to the first two clips contained in the CCTV footage from Nelson Bay RSL at about 1 AM on 30 June 2013 that became voir dire exhibit G. The objection is based upon s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The other clips contained in voir dire exhibit G are not controversial. I have watched the clips twice, once in Chambers and once in court with the assistance of counsel.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that, in assessing whether the accused had an intention to inflict really serious physical injury upon the deceased at approximately 3 AM, one can look to the accused's state of functioning, and bearing in mind his level of intoxication, about two hours before at the RSL Club.
	
	
	Clip 1 shows the accused leaving the screen quickly and returning to the table some minutes later. It does not show the accused inflicting any violence, or indeed verbal aggression, upon any person. It is possible, as defence counsel submits, that the jury could infer that something disruptive or even violent is happening off screen and involving the accused, in light of the movements of the accused and the reactions of other patrons, but I think that that possibility is reasonably low. In any event, the application for exclusion must be seen in the context of the jury having heard evidence read to them today, and reflected in the statement which became MFI 8 and which remains on the Court file, that the accused and deceased were asked to leave the licensed premises after an ""altercation"".
	
	
	I consider that the probative value of the evidence of how the accused moved away from, and back to, the table is quite high. I also consider that the danger of unfair prejudice is quite remote. I do not consider that, with regard to clip 1, s 137 is engaged. It follows that clip 1 will be admitted into evidence.
	
	
	Clip 2 is in a rather different category. Amongst other things, it shows the accused on screen engaged in some sort of pushing and shoving match with at least one other person. The Crown has made it clear that acts of force or violence (other than, of course, those towards the deceased) of the accused that evening are not relied upon as tendency evidence, or on any other basis. I repeat: the Crown Prosecutor has made it clear that the presentation and conduct of the accused at about 1 AM is being led only in order to shed light upon his state of intoxication and state of mind at about 3 AM.
	
	
	Images of the accused engaging in the use of force at about 1 AM have a real potential, in my view, to deflect the jury from a focus on the state of mind of the accused at approximately 3 AM. That is especially the case bearing in mind that the CCTV footage will go into the jury room and could be played, if the members of the jury wish to do so, multiple times.
	
	
	Evidence of the accused engaging in pushing and shoving, combined with the preceding and subsequent reactions of not only other patrons but also of security staff, depicted on clip 2 gives rise to a real danger of unfair prejudice. In my opinion, clip 2 fulfils the test contained in s 137 of the Evidence Act and, therefore, the statute mandates that it must be excluded.
	
	
	In short, clip 1 will be admitted into evidence, but clip 2 will be excluded from evidence.

		09 April 2015",2015-03-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703808,R v Beattie (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 395,"Judgment


	
	Objection is maintained by defence counsel to the last sentence of paragraph five of voir dire exhibit A, that being the statement of Senior Constable McEwen of 15 July 2013. In short, defence counsel submits that evidence of the accused saying something similar to ""What's your fucking name? Wait till I find your wife and kids"" to a police officer at about 4.30 AM on 30 June 2013 infringes the rule of exclusion in s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	The background of the issue may be shortly stated. The accused is alleged to have murdered his close friend, the deceased, at about 3 AM on 30 June 2013 by administering a severe beating to him, although the deceased did not die until several days later. The accused has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and it is quite clear that the real issue in the trial for murder is whether the Crown can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed a contemporaneous intention to inflict really serious physical injury upon the deceased.
	
	
	The position of defence counsel is that, due to the effects of alcohol, amphetamines and a prescription drug, the jury would have a reasonable doubt about that mental element.
	
	
	Evidence has been led without objection as to the aggressive and offensive behaviour of the accused at about 1 AM earlier that morning, when he was escorted out of licensed premises.
	
	
	There has also been evidence led without objection about the behaviour of the accused when he was arrested at the scene very shortly after the assault, and no doubt each counsel will seek to call in aid aspects of that conduct in his case.
	
	
	It is noteworthy that very similar evidence was led before the jury of the accused saying the same thing when he was arrested at the scene (see the evidence of Constable Cook at trial transcript p 200 line 16). Although defence counsel explained that his failure to object to that is an oversight, there has been no application for discharge based upon it. In any event, although that matter has not formally been discussed between Bench and Bar table, I would have thought that all of the things said and done by the accused during, very shortly before, and very shortly after the fatal assault are highly probative with regard to the central issue.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the maintenance of the same threat at 4.30 AM shows that the adoption of that course was by no means a fleeting effect of intoxication, but rather a settled effort on the part of the accused to threaten police into refraining from conduct to which he took objection.
	
	
	I respectfully think that there is force in that submission of the learned Crown Prosecutor. But the crucial time is the time of the assault, and the conduct of the accused well before and well after that time, although relevant, is not of the greatest probative value. The Crown already has evidence that the accused said much the same thing moments after the assault came to an end. And the Crown can argue, based upon that evidence, that the accused was thinking rationally and soundly in touch with the real world.
	
	
	In the circumstances I assess the probative value of the fact that the accused said the same thing an hour or so later, and in a different place and context, as possessing a probative value that is not overly high.
	
	
	Turning to the danger of unfair prejudice, the jury has already heard that the accused engaged in very aggressive conduct towards police and used highly offensive language towards them. Although the accused has admitted to committing a brutal bashing, it is to be recalled that he is facing the most serious charge known to law. I think evidence that he saw fit to threaten the innocent families of police officers, presumably with physical harm or death, has a potential, if emphasised by repetition, to inflame the jury against the accused.
	
	
	Whilst I accept that evidence of things said and done by the accused at 4.30 that morning has some probative value, I consider that that attribute with regard to this particular alleged utterance is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, if these alleged words are placed before the jury, as it were a second time. It can be seen that in those circumstances the statute mandates exclusion.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, the Crown will not be permitted to lead the last sentence of paragraph five of voir dire exhibit A.

		09 April 2015",2015-03-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703816,R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189,"Judgment


	
	Kieran Moore (“the accused”) stands charged with an offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Andrew Russell by his co-accused Anthony James Simmons (Mr Simmons). Both accused men have objected to various admissions (or statements alleged to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt) made by them in the course of the police investigation. The objection to the admissions made by the accused Simmons was the subject of a two-week pre-trial voir dire concluding on Tuesday 3 March 2015. On Wednesday 4 March 2015, I ruled that confessional statements made in the course of a police operation of the kind considered by the High Court in Tofilau v The Queen [2007] HCA 39; 231 CLR 396 were admissible against him: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143.
	
	
	Mr Moore’s objection raises different issues. While there is a degree of common evidence to be led in the trial against both men, and while both objections require consideration of ss 90 and 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), the evidence concerning the statements made by the accused is separate and distinct.
	
	
	This accused objects to two pieces of evidence. I will deal with them in the chronological sequence in which they arose.
	
	
	First, there is an objection to evidence of conversations between the accused and a witness, Jodi Biles. These occurred on 1 and 6 September 2011 at Bloomfield Hospital in Orange where the accused was an involuntary patient. The conversations were recorded covertly by police pursuant to a warrant issued under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW). The basis of this objection is that the evidence was unlawfully or improperly obtained (s 138 Evidence Act) and that it is unfair to use the evidence against the accused in view of the circumstances in which the statements were made (s 90). The accused contends that the police misled the judge who issued the warrant authorising the use of the listening devices. The accused also contends that, in the circumstances, it was unfair to use the witness Jodi Biles as an “agent of the state” to elicit admissions from the accused.
	
	
	The second objection concerns evidence of admissions made by the accused on 18 January 2013 to police officers in the presence of his step-father. These occurred a few hours after he was arrested on a charge of murder and while he was in custody at Bathurst Police Station. The accused alleges that he was induced to confess by a representation to him that anything he said was “off the record”. He says that he understood that to mean that the things he said would not later be used against him in evidence or be disclosed to his co-accused. The accused relies on s 85 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (reliability of admissions) and s 90 (discretion to exclude admissions).
	
	
	I will refer to the material respectively as “the Biles conversations” and “the 2013 admissions”.
	


An overview of the events leading to the arrest of the two accused men


	
	In June 2009 Andrew Russell, a resident of Bathurst, went missing. He was last seen, at least by a source that is considered by the Crown to be reliable, on 2 June 2009. His family and friends have not seen him since that date. A witness, Michael O’Neill, saw a man near the intersection of Littlebourne Street and the Sydney Road (Great Western Highway) in Kelso at around 10:30 pm and then again a short (unspecified) time later. The man was in the middle of the highway and Mr O’Neill was concerned and spoke to him. He reported the incident to Bathurst Police. A few weeks later, after Mr Russell was reported missing, Mr O’Neill was shown a photograph and said he was “quite confident” that it depicted the same man.
	
	
	Suspicion attached fairly quickly to the accused Simmons because there was known animosity between him and Mr Russell. It is alleged (and, based on his plea on arraignment, not disputed) that on 20-21 March 2009, Simmons assaulted Mr Russell. However, while Simmons seemed to be the prime suspect, orthodox police investigations failed to uncover any cogent or admissible evidence against him. There was a good deal of rumour and some evidence of things that he had said, but no reliable evidence of real substance was uncovered between June 2009 and September 2012.
	
	
	The accused (Moore) was a close friend and associate of Mr Simmons and the rumour mill suggested that he too was involved, either as an accomplice in the murder or in assisting with the disposal of the body.
	
	
	Between September 2012 and January 2013, the police employed a sophisticated undercover operation targeting Simmons. The details of that operation are set out in some detail in my judgment admitting the evidence of Simmons’ admissions: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) at [9]-[42]. The admissions made are detailed at [84]-[97]. In short, Simmons asserted that he and the accused had come upon Mr Russell at a bridge on the Sydney Road outside Bathurst, had taken him by car to a cliff near the town of Sofala and pushed him off the cliff. They retrieved the victim’s body and buried it in a mineshaft in another location near Sofala. Mr Simmons took the undercover police to the location where they buried the body. No mineshaft or human remains have been found in that area in spite of a thorough search. It is clear from the submissions on the voir dire that Mr Simmons’ case is that the admissions are untrue and that he was boasting or big noting himself for reasons of no present relevance.
	
	
	The admissions made by Simmons would suggest that Mr Moore is guilty of murder. He was part of the joint enterprise of abducting Mr Russell and played a part in pushing him off the cliff. Of course, those admissions are not admissible against the accused. The Crown case against the accused Moore is that Simmons killed Mr Russell and that the accused assisted in disposing of the corpse.
	
	
	The Biles conversations occurred in September 2011. The accused was not thereafter arrested or charged. Those conversations contained statements that the prosecution relies on as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. No direct admissions were made. The police did not charge the accused and (as far as I am aware) did not attempt to interview him in the aftermath of those conversations. Simmons made his admissions in the course of the covert operation on 9, 15 and 16 January 2013. Simmons was arrested in Pyrmont immediately after the conversation of 16 January 2013. Moore was arrested in Walmer Park in Bathurst two days later on 18 January 2013. He was interviewed and indicated that he wished to exercise his right to silence (Ex VD 1, Tab 136). He then spoke to his step-father (John Fazio) and thereafter made the 2013 admissions.
	


The voir dire


	
	The present voir dire commenced on Tuesday 3 March 2015 at the conclusion of the voir dire into Mr Simmons’ admissions. The exhibits continued and so, technically, all of the evidence admitted in the Simmons’ voir dire is before me. In particular, the entire prosecution brief (13 volumes, Ex VD 1) is before me. However, the parties agreed that the only parts of Ex VD 1 that are relevant to the present issue are the following:

	Submissions were received in writing (MFI 6 and 7) and orally on 4-5 March 2015. There were further brief submissions on 9 March 2015. By that stage each of the accused had made an application under s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) for a trial by Judge alone and submissions were being made on that issue. The evidence was re-opened on 10 March 2015 to allow for the tender of Ex VD 15 (the Court Attendance Notice & and Facts Sheet relating to Ms Biles). This judgment was prepared in that context and delivered later on 10 March 2015.
	


The evidence against the accused


	
	Apart from the evidence led to establish Mr Simmons’ guilt (necessary for proof of the accessory charge), the evidence against the accused is relatively confined. It includes the evidence concerning the disappearance of Mr Russell including when and where he was last seen, some statements concerning the movement of the accused men at relevant times, admissions made to a witness Luke Salter, the Biles conversations and the 2013 admissions.
	
	
	Luke Salter provided a statement (Ex VD 1, Tab 16) that he had a conversation with the accused in which the accused made admissions to assisting Simmons in moving a car and disposing of the corpse. According to Mr Salter, the accused said to him that “Sofala … is a good place to bury a body”. He said that “they took the body to Sofala”. The interview continued:
	


“Q137. Did you overhear Kieran say he was involved in ---

A. Yeah ---

Q138.   ---taking the body?

A.   Kieran was involved in moving the body out there to Sofala, and he would probably be able to take you straight to where he’s buried.

Q139.   Yeah

A.   If, if that’s, if they buried him. But I couldn’t tell you what they done once they got out there.”


	
	In a recorded interview dated 29 August 2011 (Ex VD 1, Tab 5), Jodi Biles agreed that she had approached the police with additional information. The new information was enunciated (at Q 44) as:
	


“a statement made by Kieran Moore saying that he and Tony had killed Andrew for me.”


	
	The Biles conversations, which I will set out in more detail below, do not contain direct admissions. However, the prosecution seeks to present them as evidence of consciousness of guilt in that they show an awareness of matters that suggest the accused was involved in the matter and that he was concerned that certain witnesses (who might implicate Simmons) would remain “staunch”.
	
	
	The 2013 admissions were not recorded and there are two versions of precisely what was said. The first is the account of the admissions given by the accused’s step-father, John Fazio. The second is the account given by the detectives. There is no significant difference between those accounts. On either account, what the accused said constituted a confession of guilt. He said that Simmons had bashed Mr Russell and that he (the accused) had assisted to move the body to bush-land behind “The Good Guys” near the Sydney Road outside Bathurst.
	


The Biles conversations


	
	The objection to the Biles conversations involves a consideration of the circumstances in which the warrant was obtained and an analysis of the role of Jodi Biles in the conversations on 1 and 6 September 2011.
	
	
	Before turning to those questions I should describe the conversations themselves and identify the parts that the Crown submits have some capacity rationally to affect the question of whether the accused was involved in the disappearance of Mr Russell or any other fact in issue in the trial.
	


The conversation on 1 September 2011


	
	Ms Biles arrived at Bloomfield at around 6:30 pm on 1 September 2011. The conversation she had with the accused lasted for a little under an hour and the transcript consists of 35 pages (Ex VD 1, Tab 6). No admissions were made by the accused and he repeatedly told Ms Biles that Simmons did not commit the murder. He said that he and Simmons said certain things to scare or impress people but the details of this are somewhat non-specific. He said he was in Bloomfield because he was “mental” and that he would get out on 27 October, his birthday. Ms Biles repeatedly introduced the topic, telling the accused that Simmons had confessed to her. The accused said (p 5) “I know for a fact every time that I was with him he never did it because there was just, he was startin’ to get it in his head that he was, that he did do it”. He said that Simmons [brain] was “fried”. The parties agree that this was a reference to Simmons taking amphetamine or methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The conversation is riddled with inconsistency. A good example is where the accused said (p 7) “I don’t think he’s got it in him” but then immediately said:
	


“tell him to pull his head in and stop talking shit …. ‘cause otherwise it’s just gunna cause more dramas cause they’re (sic) still haven’t found no body, you know, as long as you know bloody, there’s no evidence.”


	
	The conversation went on (at p 7-8):
	


“Biles:   …I just need to know what I'm dealing with before I go to gaol too

Accused:   … tell 'em man, he, Tony, he, he didn't do it so why would he admit something like that. That's how I know he was very fried you know what I mean, 'cause if he's actually believin' 'em-- -

Biles:      He wasn't lyin' this time but Kieran.

Accused:   Yeah.

Biles:      He, no, seriously he did, he said to me I killed Andrew.

Accused:    I don't, I don't believe him man, you know, and the state that he was in when he got locked up, I can understand why he would start thinkin' it because —

Biles:      Well, what about all---

Accused:   ---they wiped him out.

Biles:   What about all them times you said it when you were drunk and that.

Accused:   Yeah, that was just to   the story on you know, because I could see him walkin' out… macho, thinkin', yeah… play on this and that's when I said… it didn't —

Biles:      Is this where you have---

Accused:   ---happen---

Biles:      ---to sit?

Accused:   ---… that---

Biles:      Do you have to sit in here?

Accused:   Yeah. It didn't happen that way---

Biles:      Mmm.

Accused:   ---you know, and like---

Biles:      What way —

Accused:   - - -I, I only - - -

Biles:      ---did it happen then?

Accused:   ---did it for, in his best interest I made up the story, so that way he would think that he didn't do it and go… he was… you know, and unfortunately he got too fried before he went in… so now he is believin'…---“


	
	The Crown Prosecutor relies on comments such as “no body … no evidence” as indicating a consciousness of guilt. He took me to the parts of the conversation that he submits may bear upon the issues at the trial (T 357-365).
	
	
	The conversation is difficult to comprehend at times. However, there is a recurring theme whereby the accused denies that Simmons committed the crime while Ms Biles is saying that Simmons confessed to her. The accused claims that they (he and Simmons) made up stories and told various people that they were involved.
	
	
	There are passages in the conversation of 1 September 2011 capable of being used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. It has not been submitted by Mr Stratton SC that the evidence is not relevant or that it lacks probative value.
	


The conversation on 6 September 2011


	
	Ms Biles returned to Bloomfield at the direction or invitation of the police on 6 September 2011. Again, she was wearing a listening device. She arrived at around 2:17 pm but it took some time before she spoke with the accused because he had been moved to a different part of the Hospital (“Poplars”).
	
	
	The conversation begins with Ms Biles saying that she had been to see Simmons and the accused asking “has he got that shit out of his head yet or not?”. There is then a discussion about Ms Biles’ legal issues, the substance of which is unclear to me, but she said that “I bought myself like 2 weeks or something” (Ex VD 1, Tab 7, p 5). There is then a discussion about the accused’s situation at Bloomfield. He says that Poplars gives him more freedom and that he “got ordered till the 27th of October”. The parties agree, based on evidence within the Hospital file, that the accused was an “involuntary patient” and that he was not due to be released until 27 October 2011.
	
	
	The relevant part of the conversation commences when Ms Biles introduces the subject by saying “Do you reckon Jakey would still be staunch, Jakey Peters?” (p 11). The conversation goes on:
	


“Biles:      No, do you reckon he'd be staunch or you reckon he'd roll?

Accused:   I reckon he'll stay staunch.

Biles:      Yeah

Accused:   I don't reckon, the other fellow that was on the scene at that time too was that Corey cunt.

Biles:      Yeah. Do you reckon they'll stay strong then and ---

Accused:   Yeah. Yeah, because they don't know nothing, nothing happened, you know what I mean?

Biles:   Yeah, I know, but Tony's just got me doing the fucking you know.

Accused:   If they talk, if they talk, they're talking shit. It's letting fucking stories collide you know what I mean because ---

Biles:   Yeah. … one particular time like I have to turn my phone off and everything, you know, like every day. I leave it on for half an hour, turn it off and then visit, you know, just after all this shit, you know, it's not worth it.

Accused:   Yeah, fuck the phones. You can't trust them.

Biles:   Yeah, yeah, I don't talk to my Nan, nothing anymore unless it's pay phone, you know.

Accused:   Even then, you've got to …what pay phone you're using because they fucking ---

Biles:      Yeah, I walk for miles, like, yeah.

Accused:   …fucking phones, technology.

Biles:   The people he's worried about, there's only a few people he's worried about, and that's, he was a bit worried about Jakey.

Accused:   Yeah, Jakey will stay good.

Biles:      Little Jakey Peters has got himself a good life now.

Accused:   Yeah, he's……

Biles:      Got himself a little Hispanic girlfriend.

Accused:   Yeah.

Biles:      He wasn't too sure about Corey.

Accused:   Yeah, he was on the scene at the same time, not Corey, fucking… Carey, that other Carey, remember the big…

Biles:      Corey Maguire?

Accused:   Yeah, that one.

Biles:      Yeah, yeah. And he is dead set ---

Accused:   That's who we, that's who we originally made the story up ....

Biles:      And he's stressing his fucking arse out about Stephanie man.

Accused:   Yeah, no, she's gone.

Biles:      Full on.

Accused:   I haven't heard from her for ages.

Biles:      Yeah, I have but.

Accused:   Have you? Where is she, back in town?

Biles:      No, she will be in four days. It's a bit suspicious on my behalf.

Accused:   Yeah, I know.

Biles:      I don't like it.

Accused:   They don't know nothing because nothing happened. They're just being told stories, you know what I mean?

Biles:   Yeah, Tony just told me to come around and say, do you think or do you have a number that he can reach Jakey on or anything?

Accused:   No, I don't talk to Jakey.

Biles:      Jakey's mum died, man, that's pretty fucked up.

Accused:   Did she? That's no good.

Biles:      Heroin overdose about five weeks ago.

Accused:   …..

Biles:   I seen her the day before and she was harassing me drunk like usual and then she full ---

Accused:   Yeah, you feel bad because you fucking didn't have the time for her and then all of a sudden ---

Biles:      I did, I used to lend her money all the time, like everything ---

Accused:   Yeah, but when they're harassing you like that ---

Biles:   I'd sit there for hours and listen to her drunk and babble on and then I fucking just, yeah. Is there somewhere we can get a drink of water?

Accused:   Eh?

Biles:      Is there somewhere we can get a drink of water?

Accused:   I'll go over to the shop, I'll shout you a cuppa.

Biles:      Mad, no, Coke. I don't drink coffee no more, man

Accused:   Don't you?

Biles:   No, not since I was pregnant with [N], eh. Yeah. But I full on, that's just the questions he asked me to ask you without saying anything, you know.

Accused:   Yeah.

Biles:      Jakey, Corey and Stephanie.

Accused:   Yeah. Well, see, they've only been told stories, so if they do talk, it's not going to make sense.

Biles:      He's stressing, man. He's stressing hard core.

Accused:   Yeah. Tell him to settle down.”


	
	Other potentially relevant parts of the conversation appear to be (at p 15):
	


“Biles:      Yeah, with his brother or something.

Accused:   Lalor Park, Lalor Park.

Biles:      What was it, Ludlar?

Accused:   Lalor Park.

Biles:      I didn't even hear you then. Ludlar?

Accused:   Lalor.

Biles:   Lalor. Yeah, no, he just wants me to try and get his number so I can give it to him, because he just needs to have a yarn with him.

Accused:   I'm pretty sure like Jakey was with us the last time that we ever seen him.

Biles:      Yeah.

Accused:   But… to trick out that Corey Maguire.

Biles:      Yeah.

Accused:   …

Biles:      I forgot all about Corey Maguire.

Accused:   Yeah, because I seen him…

Biles:      He was driving my car, eh?

Accused:   Yeah.

Biles:      Yeah, yeah.

Accused:   So we tricked him.

Biles:      Yeah.   

Accused:   And then from there, the story come out… and then, yeah…”


	
	At p 18:
	


“Biles:      No, he is but, man.

Accused:   If they do talk, if they do talk, they're telling stories, and they're going to all collide with each other because they've all been told different, different stories.

Biles:      Yeah, but the thing is man, what he's worried about, right —

Accused:   It's all non fiction   

Biles:   Listen to this but, I'll tell you what his problem is, right. At the moment, he gets out in 18 months, not three years.”


	
	At p 22-23:
	


“Accused:   He's always back with you.

Biles:   It was never the cheating, it was always the lies and the bullshit that went with it, you know. He doesn't lie to me anymore, he's told me the truth about everything, man, every chick he's ever been with, everything, it's mad, and I've told him the truth about just the last fucking two, three months.

Accused:    That's…you've got to be truthful otherwise you start to believe your own lies and you get fucked up. That's where you get into the mess that he's obviously got himself into. He's starting to get paranoid about other people fucking talking shit, when that's all they are, talking shit, if they are talking, you know what I mean? I honestly believe that fucking Jack's got rid of --- that way they could fucking frame Tony because he was fried and he don't know what he was up to.

Biles:      And Tony is a master mind criminal, so they think.

Accused:   Yeah, so why not ---

Biles:      They've got it all wrong.

Accused:   Why not frame him? How many other people went missing in Bathurst and haven't been found, you know what I mean?

Biles:      Exactly, exactly.

Accused:   And who runs Bathurst, where does all the drugs and shit come from? I know exactly where it comes from, it comes from the cunts that are trying to arrest people for fucking doing it.

Biles:      They need to find something fucking better then.

Accused:   You know, they fucking set me up to the point where I had a hit man and I had to face a hit man fucking, with all that ice because it was a million-dollar bust, you may as well say. That's where I started going fucking stupid, because ---

Biles:      I couldn't handle ---   

Accused:   I had people after me, putting my life in jeopardy because they were fucking tapping my phones.”

Relevance and probative value of the evidence


	
	The Crown accepts that none of this evidence is capable, by itself, of establishing the accused’s guilt. After the conversations, no attempt was made by police to interview the accused and he was not arrested. However, in combination with other evidence, the evidence is capable of supporting an inference that the accused had knowledge of the crime and the surrounding circumstances. References in the conversations to Corey Maguire and to Jakob Peters may dovetail with statements of those witnesses (Ex VD 1, Tabs 57, 90-91).
	
	
	For example, Corey Maguire (Tab 91) told police on 10 August 2009 that he was not in the company of Tony Simmons on the night but in a later statement (3 September 2010) he said that he used Simmons’ white Excel to drop Simmons out to the Sydney Road to a house near View Street. This does not directly impact on the accused but the fact that he engaged in a discussion about Corey Maguire in the context of the Biles conversations suggests, at least, some knowledge on his part of Simmons’ involvement.
	
	
	Jakob Peters (Tab 57) told police about going driving with the accused and Simmons “one night” in “Kieran’s green Commodore” (p 15). He said he was dropped of “near the fruit shop on Sydney Road” (p 17), got changed and then got a lift to Havannah Street (p 18). He said that he could not remember driving past Andrew Russell and did not remember any discussion about Andrew Russell (p 19). When asked whether this was before or after the disappearance of Mr Russell he said “I wouldn’t have a clue” (p 15). There is nothing in Mr Peter’s statement about the accused making any admission to him although he says that “I remember them (Simmons and Jodi Biles) saying that they picked [Andrew Russell] up one time and they give him a lift” (p 23).
	
	
	Just how this fits in with the narrative is unclear to me but, as I have said, it provides some context to the conversation with Ms Biles about whether Mr Peters would “stay staunch” and the reference thereafter to Corey Maguire.
	
	
	The most probative part of the evidence may be the fact that the accused agreed that he and Simmons had made up stories about the disappearance of Mr Russell.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Stratton SC does not submit that the evidence is not relevant. Nor does he submit that the probative value is so slight that the evidence should be excluded in the exercise of the discretion under s 135 or 137.
	


The application for the warrant and the factual dispute that arises


	
	The application for the warrant was made to Johnson J on 1 September 2011. It was supported by an affidavit of Detective Senior Constable Hadley (Ex VD 1, Tab 154). Both Mr Hadley and Detective Senior Constable Maclean gave evidence that they worked on the affidavit together. Relevantly, the affidavit said that the police proposed to use “Source 938907” (that is Jodi Biles) to meet with Mr Moore at a “designated location”. No further information about the location was included in the affidavit. In particular, the affidavit did not disclose that the accused was at that time in Bloomfield Hospital, or that he was in a facility generally known to be a psychiatric hospital.
	
	
	In the course of the voir dire, Detectives Maclean and Hadley both said that the first time that they became aware that the accused was in Bloomfield Hospital was when Jodi Biles told them as much on 1 September 2011. In sharp contradistinction, Jodi Biles said that she learned of the accused’s whereabouts when police told her a couple of days prior to 1 September 2011.
	
	
	Detective Maclean’s evidence on the voir dire included the following (T 278-280):
	


“Q. What sort of hospital is Bloomfield Hospital?

A. The - well, within the Bloomfield campus is a mental health facility.

Q. It's a psychiatric hospital, isn't it?

A. There is a psychiatric hospital there, yes.

Q. Is Bloomfield Hospital a mental health facility?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. It's very well known in the Bathurst and Orange areas that Bloomfield is full of psychiatric patients, correct?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. When did you become aware that the accused Kieran Moore was at Bloomfield Hospital?

A. I believe it was on 1 September 2011.

Q. Did you assist in the preparation of an affidavit in support of a warrant for Ms Biles to wear a listening device?

A. I did.

Q. And was that affidavit prepared on 1 September 2011?

A. Yes, I believe so.

Q. At the time that affidavit was prepared, were you aware that Kieran Moore was a patient at a psychiatric hospital?

A. No, I was not.

Q. Now, 1 September 2011 was also the day when you took Ms Biles to Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital, correct?

A. Yes, that's right.

Q. Does it follow that on your evidence sometime on 1 September 2011 you must have become aware that Kieran Moore was at Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. The affidavit in support does not refer to the fact that Kieran Moore was at Bloomfield, correct?

A. No, it does not.

Q. You say that that was because you weren't aware of that at the time the affidavit was prepared?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. Is it the case that the affidavit was prepared by both you and Detective Hadley?

A. Correct, yes.

Q. But it was sworn by Detective Hadley alone?

A. Yes, that's right.

Q. How did you become aware that the accused Kieran Moore was at Bloomfield Hospital?

A. I believe Jodi Biles told me, or told us.

Q. Do you say that she told you that on 1 September 2011?

A. Yes, I believe so.

Q. Was there an earlier meeting with Jodi Biles where the topic of her wearing a wire or listening device in her conversations with Kieran Moore was discussed?

A. Prior to 1 September, yes, there was.

Q. Wasn't the discussion at that time about the fact that Kieran Moore was at Bloomfield Hospital?

A. No, I don't believe so.

Q. Do you say that if you had known that Kieran Moore was in a psychiatric hospital at the time that you swore the affidavit you would have disclosed that?

A. I didn't swear the affidavit.

Q. I understand that.

A. But yes. I think it would have been something that would have been important to include, yes.

Q. Because you'd regard that as relevant?

A. Yes, it would be relevant.”


	
	Detective Hadley gave evidence (T 264):
	


“Q. Can I ask you this; when did you learn that Kieran Moore was in Bloomfield?

A. Around about the day of deployment.

Q. Did you speak with anyone at Bloomfield about his presence there?

A. No

CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s the evidence in chief.

HIS HONOUR:

Q. Sorry, when you say “around about the day of deployment” --

A. I believe so, your Honour, on the day of deployment or the morning of deployment, I believe that’s when we learned of his location.”

Q. So that’s 1 September 2011.

A. Correct, your Honour.”


	
	In cross-examination he gave the following evidence (T 264):
	


“Q. Detective, you've referred to the day of deployment?

A. Yes.

Q. I take it by that you're referring to the first day when Ms Biles wore a wire and saw the accused?

A. Yes.

Q. That being 1 September?

A. 2011, yes.

Q. Just to be clear about it, your memory is that was the day when you found out that the accused was at Bloomfield Hospital?

A. I believe so.

Q. You knew that Bloomfield Hospital was a psychiatric hospital?

A. Not just a psychiatric hospital. Also there was other issues as well, mental issues or health issues.

Q. What other issues?

A. I believe alcohol dependence, drug related issues, that sort of thing.

Q. It's a psychiatric hospital, isn't it?

A. It is also, yes.

Q. Well, isn't that what it is solely, to deal with people's psychiatric problems?

A. Not just psychiatric problems, no, not from my understanding.

Q. How did you find out that the accused Kieran Moore was at Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital?

A. I believe through Ms Biles.

Q. Your memory is that she told you?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. And was that on 1 September?

A. I believe it was on around about 1 September, yes, from memory.”


	
	Detective Hadley also gave evidence (T 268) that had he been aware that the accused was in a psychiatric hospital he would have “definitely made mention of that” because “that would have been prudent information to put in the affidavit”. He said (T 278) that he used the expression “designated location” in the affidavit because “[t]hat's always to my knowledge and my understanding, every time I've used it that's the wording we use, no matter what warrant it is”.
	
	
	Jodi Biles’ evidence on this subject was as follows (T 251-252):
	


“Q. Did you know the circumstances in which he was taken to Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital?

A. No.

Q. Does this assist you, did anyone ever tell you that he was taken there by police?

A. No.

Q. Prior to your going to Bloomfield Hospital, did you have discussions with police?

A. Yes.

Q. I'm asking, not suggesting, is that with Detectives Hadley and Maclean?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to say how long before you went to Bloomfield Hospital?

A. No, not sure.

Q. I take it it wasn't on the day that you first went there, it was before that?

A. Yeah, couple of days before maybe.

Q. When you spoke, was that the only time you had a conversation with police about going to see Kieran Moore?

A. Yes.

Q. At any stage, was there a discussion about where he was, at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. What was said about where he was?

A. I was just informed he was at Bloomfield Hospital.

Q. Police told you that he was at Bloomfield Hospital?

A. Yes.

Q. You weren't aware of that before?

A. No.

Q. Do you have a recollection of who told you that?

A. No.

Q. Was it either Detective Hadley or Detective MacLean?

A. One of them. I'm not sure which one.

Q. Were they both present when that was said?

A. Usually. I can't remember whether they were both there.

Q. You've told us there was only one conversation with police about your going to see the accused, and in that conversation, both police officers were present; is that right?

A. I'm pretty sure it was Mr Hadley.

Q. You think it was Detective Hadley who told you that

A. Yes.

Q. Mr Moore was at Bloomfield; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he tell you how he knew he was at Bloomfield?

A. No.”


	
	As a matter of known fact, Ms Biles did meet with the detectives “a couple of days before” 1 September 2011. On 29 August 2011, she made a lengthy interview with the police (Ex VD 1, Tab 5). The detectives denied that there had been any conversation with Ms Biles on 29 August 2011 about Mr Moore being in Bloomfield. Mr Maclean said (T 282) that he thought the interview was “a little earlier than [29 August 2011]”.
	
	
	After the interview on 29 August 2011, there was a discussion in which Ms Biles agreed to approach the accused wearing a listening device and attempt to get him to talk about the disappearance of Mr Russell. Apart from what appears in the statements and affidavit, it seems that no record was made of this conversation.
	
	
	As to the events of 1 September 2011 themselves, the warrant was issued at around 4:30 pm or, at least, that is when it became valid according to its terms. The transcript of the conversation indicates that it was commenced at 6:28 pm on Thursday, 1 September 2011. The evidence (T 283, line 18) is that it takes around 40 minutes to drive from Bathurst to Orange.
	
	
	Detective Maclean recorded the events on the day in his statement at (Ex VD 1, Tab 108) [64]-[65]:
	


“On the 1 September 2011, I made an application for a Surveillance Device Warrant. This warrant was to enable conversations to be recorded utilising a body wire on or about the person of Jodi BILES. On the 1 September 2011, a Surveillance Device Warrant was issued by Supreme Court Justice JOHNSON.

About 6.20pm on the 1 September 2011, Detective Senior Constable Justin HADLEY, Megan FAWKNER and I met with Jodi BILES in the Orange area. We placed an electronic recording device about the person of Jodi BILES. The device was turned on at 5.28pm. BILES then attended the Bloomfield mental health facility where she spoke with Kieren MOORE. This conversation was recorded by virtue of the Surveillance Device Warrant. At the conclusion of this conversation, we met with BILES. The listening device was turned off at 7.32pm. I later made arrangements to have this recording copied to a disc and arranged for it to be transcribed.”


	
	Detective Hadley’s statement (Ex VD 1, Tab 104) provides a similar account:

Resolution of the factual dispute


	
	I have set out this evidence in detail because I must resolve the sharp conflict between the evidence of the detectives and the evidence of Ms Biles. Mr Stratton SC submits that I should accept the evidence of Ms Biles and reject the evidence of the police officers.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor says that the evidence of Ms Biles is “equivocal and needs to be carefully examined before [I] can place any reliance upon it” because it “came out” through leading questions. No application was made by the Crown to cross-examine Ms Biles and no challenge was made to her evidence. No objection was taken to the supposedly “leading” questions asked in cross-examination: cf s 42 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Ms Biles is not a witness in a class that ordinarily attracts the necessity for close scrutiny. In spite of the fact that no clear submission was made that the Briginshaw standard should apply, it seemed to be implicit in the Crown’s submission (T 353):
	


“But your Honour, before your Honour can make a finding, a positive finding, it was improperly obtained your Honour would need to be satisfied positively that it was not disclosed deliberately by the police officer contrary to the sworn evidence.”


	
	I am not aware of any authority that places the evidence of police officers in some special category. However, I accept that the suggestion that the officers deliberately or recklessly failed to disclose a significant piece of information in applying to a Supreme Court judge for a warrant is an allegation of significant impropriety. Accordingly, I would need to be satisfied by clear and cogent evidence that the police knew where Mr Moore was and failed to disclose it in the affidavit: cf Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; 60 CLR 336 at [68]; Asim v Penrose & anor [2010] NSWCA 366. I should be wary of ""inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences"": Briginshaw v Briginshaw at 361-362. Having said that, the standard of proof remains on the balance of probabilities. Section 142 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) provides:
	


“142 Admissibility of evidence: standard of proof

(1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, in any proceeding the court is to find that the facts necessary for deciding:

(a) a question whether evidence should be admitted or not admitted, whether in the exercise of a discretion or not, or

(b) any other question arising under this Act,

have been proved if it is satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities.

(2) In determining whether it is so satisfied, the matters that the court must take into account include:

(a) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(b) the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question.”


	
	Sub-section (2)(a) may be a statutory reminder or formulation of the principles enunciated in Briginshaw in that it requires me, in determining whether the facts are established on balance, to take into account the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question.
	
	
	As I have said in a different context, whether these matters create a different standard of proof is questionable in the light of decisions such as Neat Holding Pty Ltd v Karajan Holding Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66; 67 ALJR 170: see Pallier v Solomons (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1524.
	
	
	I approach the matter in accordance with s 142 and on the basis that what is alleged is a matter of real gravity.
	
	
	To summarise the evidence:
	



	
	The accused was in Bloomfield Hospital between 21 July 2011 and 12 August 2011.
	
	
	He was re-admitted after he was taken there by four police officers on 17 August 2011.
	
	
	On 29 August 2011 Jodi Biles made a recorded interview at the Bathurst Police Station and afterwards agreed to wear a listening device while meeting with Kieran Moore.
	
	
	There is a dispute as to what was said in the meeting that occurred after the interview. Ms Biles says that she was told by one of the detectives that the accused was in Bloomfield Hospital. Both detectives say that there was no discussion about the whereabouts of Mr Moore and that they did not know that he was in Bloomfield at that stage. No record was kept of the conversation with Ms Biles in which she agreed to wear a listening device.
	
	
	On 1 September 2011 (and, given its length, probably on the day before) the two detectives prepared an affidavit to support an application for the warrant. This was sworn by Detective Hadley.
	
	
	At 4:30 pm on 1 September 2011 the warrant came into effect and I infer that it was issued a short time earlier although the evidence is silent on precisely when it was issued.
	
	
	Arrangements were then made for Ms Biles to wear the listening device and to approach Mr Moore.
	
	
	Both detectives say that Ms Biles told them on that day that the accused was at Bloomfield Hospital and that they then travelled to Orange. On their account, this involved a change of plan because they had been of the belief that Mr Moore was in Bathurst. While the police said that they believed the accused was at his parents’ home, there is no evidence as to how they knew that or what inquiries had been made before meeting Ms Biles as to where the “deployment” was to occur.
	
	
	The listening device was activated “in the Orange area” near the Bloomfield Hospital at 6.28 pm (Ex VD 1, Tab 6).
	



	
	While I find the timing to be fairly tight, I accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that I cannot draw any clear inference from the timing of events. I do find the absence of any clear plan or investigation as to where Mr Moore actually was before meeting with Ms Biles after 4:30 pm to be, at least, peculiar. Detective Hadley said (T 267) “I was ‑ we were under the impression we'd be going to his home address, or Ms Biles would be going to his home address.” However, there is no evidence that the police knew that the accused was at home, or even in Bathurst, prior to meeting with Ms Biles.
	
	
	There are other conflicts in the evidence between Ms Biles and the detectives. Ms Biles says that the police offered her assistance in various ways. She says that they offered her money, accommodation, participation in the witness protection programme and assistance in obtaining custody of her children. It was also submitted (T 269) that the police may have suggested that they could assist with a cannabis charge that she was facing. However, Detective Hadley said (T 269) that he believed that the charge arose after the “deployment”, that is after 1 September 2011. No further questions were asked about that issue and no evidence was led to establish one way or another when the cannabis charge was laid. When I asked about the issue in the course of the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions I was told that Ms Biles was charged on 12 September 2011 but the Crown could not tell me when she was arrested. The state of the evidence was unsatisfactory and I raised the matter again before reaching a final conclusion and delivering judgment. By consent, the evidence was re-opened and the Court Attendance Notice and Facts Sheet was tendered (Ex VD 15). This shows that the cannabis charge arose on 12 September 2011. Ms Biles was arrested and charged on that date. This places significant doubt over the following evidence given by Ms Biles (T 254):
	


“Q. At that time, were you also facing criminal charges?

A. No --- yes, I was actually, sorry.

Q. Was that in relation to an amount of marijuana?

A. Yes.

Q. Had you been arrested while transporting an amount of marijuana?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to tell us how much the amount was?

A. 422 grams, I think.

Q. You had that hanging over your head at the time you went to see Mr Moore?

A. Yes.”


	
	Both officers denied that they offered Ms Biles anything, although Detective Hadley (T 269) agreed that Ms Biles had raised difficulties she was having with Housing NSW and Detective Maclean (T 281) agreed that there was discussion about “Ms Biles being offered assistance to relocate to a different town”. Both officers denied the suggestion that she had talked about obtaining assistance to move to somewhere near the beach or that she was offered money.
	
	
	The evidence is silent on just what motivated Ms Biles to agree to wear the listening device. There is evidence that she had some animosity towards Mr Moore but that hardly provides her with a motive to involve herself in a police operation in which she wore a listening device.
	
	
	While Ms Biles was an unsophisticated witness, I found her evidence to be generally responsive and uncomplicated. I do not accept that the evidence was somehow weakened by the fact that leading questions were asked. The question that was criticised as leading - “Police told you that he was at Bloomfield Hospital?” – was plainly a clarification and confirmation of the evidence that had just been given. As I watched the exchange, it was clear that Ms Biles was saying that one of the detectives told her that the accused was at Bloomfield Hospital. I do not accept that the evidence of Ms Biles was equivocal. I reject the Crown submissions concerning the use of the word “any” in the question “At any stage, was there a discussion about where he was, at that time?” Again, watching and listening to the flow of the examination, there was no ambiguity and it was clear that Ms Biles was talking about the conversation on 29 August 2011. Further, as I asked the Crown Prosecutor in the course of submissions, if it was not on 29 August 2011, when was it? The conflict of substance between the two versions is whether it was Ms Biles or the detectives who first knew that the accused was in Bloomfield.
	
	
	A further submission made by the Crown said to support the proposition that it was Ms Biles, rather than the police, who knew that the accused was at Bloomfield came from one of the things she said in the course of the recorded conversation with the accused (Ex VD 1, Tab 6). The Crown relies on the fact that Ms Biles told the accused (p 23) “I’ve been looking for you for two weeks man”. I can take nothing from that evidence. That comment was made in the context of Ms Biles telling the accused that she was visiting him at the request of Mr Simmons. That was untrue. Earlier the accused had asked her who brought her over from Bathurst and she told him “I borrowed a car off my uncle”. That was also untrue. In the circumstances, she was unlikely to tell the accused that the police brought her over and that the police told her that he was in Bloomfield. In the second conversation she again lied to the accused about how she had travelled from Bathurst to Orange to visit him (Ex VD 1, Tab 7, p 5).
	
	
	On the other hand, both police gave evidence that they did not know that the accused was in Bloomfield Hospital until the day of deployment. Neither resiled from that testimony in cross-examination.
	
	
	Further, Ms Biles’ evidence that the police offered her assistance with the cannabis charge on 29 August 2011 cannot be correct in circumstances where she was not arrested or charged with that offence until 12 September 2011. It may be that Ms Biles was mistaken as to this aspect but it shows that her reliability on matters of detail must be approached with caution.
	
	
	The resolution of this factual dispute is difficult. It is made more so by the absence of any record being kept by the police. There was nothing in the demeanour of the three relevant witnesses that causes me to believe that I can tell by observing them who is telling the truth or who is giving accurate evidence. The observations of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at [31] are apposite:
	


“Further, in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. Considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events.”


	
	There is little objective evidence to establish when the police became aware of the fact that the accused was in Bloomfield Hospital. As I said, it seems that no notes or record was kept of the conversation with Ms Biles. The one matter that is established independently is that Ms Biles’ account of having the cannabis charge “hanging over her head” is not reliable. While I find the failure of the police to have any real plan as to the “deployment” of Ms Biles surprising, that is an insufficient basis upon which to make the adverse finding that is sought.
	
	
	In the end, the matter must be resolved by the correct application of the onus of proof. I find that the accused has not discharged the onus of establishing on balance that the two detectives knew that the accused was in Bloomfield private hospital before making the application for the warrant.
	


The consequence of that factual finding and s 138 Evidence Act


	
	Once it is accepted that the accused has failed to discharge the onus to establish that the police knew that the accused was in Bloomfield Hospital, it follows that I am not satisfied that the evidence was obtained improperly or in contravention of the Australian law. There can be no suggestion that the police deliberately or recklessly misled the issuing justice.
	
	
	The warrant is valid on its face and it cannot be subject to a collateral attack on the basis, for example, that relevant evidence is now known that may have caused the Judge not to issue the warrant. That is, as the Crown Prosecutor submitted, an impermissible inquiry.
	
	
	Although it is not strictly necessary to do so, I should make it clear that I do not accept parts of the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions on this issue. For example, the following exchange occurred during the Crown’s submissions (T 344):
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: A court can only consider the validity of the warrant on its face and not go behind the issue of the warrant or the material that was used in order to support the issue of the warrant by a justice.

HIS HONOUR: If one was to take an extreme case, Mr Crown, not this one, but if one were to take an extreme case where the police went to the Supreme Court justice who had the misfortune of being on duty and presented them with 15 pages of perjury, and that came before the trial judge, that's properly obtained evidence because the warrant on its face is valid?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: That's the Crown's submission?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, that's the effect of it.”


	
	I do not accept that the passages in Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49; 192 CLR 69 to which I was taken support that approach (see Toohey J at 80, Gaudron J at 85 and McHugh J at 100, 102 and 103). In fact, McHugh J implicitly approved the following passage from Flanagan v Australian Federal Police [1996] FCA 16; 134 ALR 495, where the Federal Court declined to intervene in collateral proceedings but found at 545:
	


“In short, we are of the opinion that, in the criminal trial, it is open to the applicants to urge that the product, and the fruits of the product, be excluded. Whether the allegations of bad faith and impropriety will in fact be made out, and whether, if so, the power, duty or discretion to exclude the product and its fruits should be exercised, the questions entirely within the jurisdiction of the County Court.”


	
	The Crown Prosecutor later accepted that if an allegation of perjury in the affidavit for the warrant was established, the Court would “be entitled to take the view that it was improperly obtained” (T 348).
	
	
	However, it is unnecessary further to consider this issue in the light of the factual finding that I have made.
	
	
	No submission was made that it was improper (for the purpose of s 138) for the police to carry out the deployment of Ms Biles once they became aware that the accused was in Bloomfield Hospital.
	
	
	For those reasons, I am not satisfied that the evidence should be excluded pursuant to s 138 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	


The unfairness discretion and s 90 Evidence Act


	
	While the Biles conversations are not direct admissions, it is accepted by the Crown that s 90 applies to them as the statements are to be used as statements against interest or implied admissions. See, the definition of “admission” in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act; R v Horton (1998) 104 A Crim R 306; R v Esposito (1998) 105 A Crim R 27 at 42.
	
	
	I considered the operation of s 90 in some detail in the course of my earlier judgment and I will not repeat my analysis of the relevant principles: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143. That analysis informs my assessment of the present voir dire and, where necessary, it should be incorporated into this judgment.
	
	
	However, I remind myself that it has been held that the probative value of the evidence has “little significance in the exercise of the discretion under section 90”: see R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 at [110], cf R v Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29; 53 NSWLR 480. The evidence is relevant. Its weight, probative value and reliability are matters for determination of the tribunal of fact. It is admissible unless the accused establishes that it should be excluded in the exercise of the discretion under s 90.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC submits that the circumstances in which the “admissions” were made makes it unfair to use them against the accused. There are various components to this. Firstly, the accused relies on his status as an involuntary patient at a psychiatric hospital. Secondly, he relies on his psychiatric state at the time of the conversation with Ms Biles. Third, he relies on the fact that the admissions were elicited by Ms Biles who was acting as an agent of the state at the time.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC pointed to a number of entries in the Bloomfield Hospital records (Ex VD 14) concerning the accused’s mental state. These included a number of notes and comments that establish that at the time of his admission and for a period thereafter he was in a psychotic state. He was speaking in “numbers and riddles” and was diagnosed with “acute relapse of psychosis”. Many entries in the days following his admission described him in terms such as “psychotic”, “acutely delusional, incoherent in thought form and speech”, “paranoid and grandiose”. He was also described as aggressive and dangerous, both to himself and to others. He required four police officers to escort him to Bloomfield.
	
	
	However, by the time that he was visited by Ms Biles, his condition had improved significantly and there was a plan to move him to a less secure part of the hospital (“Poplars”). In fact, this occurred between the visit on 1 September 2011 and the visit on 6 September 2011. On 31 August 2011 he was described as “bright and reactive”. On 1 September 2011 Dr Chau (Psychiatrist) made a note:
	


“Polite, cooperative.

Not expressing any psychotic thoughts.

Normal affect and thought form”.


	
	I accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that by, 1 September 2011, the accused’s psychiatric state had settled and cannot, of itself, justify a conclusion that the use of the evidence obtained by Ms Biles is unfair.
	
	
	On the other hand, the accused remained an involuntary patient. Ms Biles gave evidence that the accused was not himself and that he was “different mentally” when she visited him (T 249-250, 259).
	
	
	It is also noted that, once the police became aware shortly after 4:30 pm that the accused was in Bloomfield, they made no investigation into the state of the accused’s mental health. They simply determined to take Ms Biles to Bloomfield and to deploy her without any further investigation. It was purely fortuitous that the accused’s symptoms of acute psychosis had improved. I have read the thorough analysis of somewhat similar cases by Bellew J in R v Gallagher [2013] NSWSC 1102 at [223]-[242] and note that R v Gallagher was a more extreme case.
	
	
	The helpful observations of McColl JA and Latham J in Pavitt v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 88; 169 A Crim R 452 are relevant to the admissibility of a covertly recorded conversation in circumstances where the police engage a witness or complainant to speak to a suspect while the conversation is being covertly recorded by listening device (at [70]):
	


“70. In our view, without being exhaustive, the following propositions relevant to the present case can be extracted from the authorities to which we have referred concerning the admissibility of covertly recorded conversations:

(a) The underlying consideration in the admissibility of covertly recorded conversations is to look at the accused's freedom to choose to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned: Swaffield (at [91]) per Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; (at [155]) per Kirby J.

(b) If that freedom is impugned, the court has a discretion to reject the evidence, the exercise of which will turn on all the circumstances which may point to unfairness to the accused if the confession is admitted: Swaffield (at [91]); a conclusion that some or all of the Broyles factors were present did not lead to the admissions being excluded in either Pavic or Carter’s cases;

(c) Even if there is no unfairness the court may consider that, having regard to the means by which the confession was elicited, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable having regard to prevailing community standards: Swaffield (at [91]).

(d) The question whether the conversation was recorded in circumstances such that it might be characterised as either unfair and/or improper include whether the accused had previously indicated that he/she refused to speak to the police;

(e) The right to silence will only be infringed where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement, and where the informer was acting as an agent of the state at the time the accused made the statement. Accordingly, two distinct inquiries are required:

(i) as a threshold question, was the evidence obtained by an agent of the state?

(ii) was the evidence elicited?

(f) A person is a state agent if the exchange between the accused and the informer would not have taken place, in the form and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or its agents: Broyles (at [30]);

(g) Absent eliciting behaviour on the part of the police, there is no violation of the accused’s right to choose whether or not to speak to the police. If the suspect speaks, it is by his or her own choice, and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform the police: Hebert;

(h) Admissions will have been elicited if the relevant parts of the conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation and if the state agent exploited any special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement; evidence of the instructions given to the state agent for the conduct of the conversation may also be important: Broyles.

(i) The fact that the conversation was covertly recorded is not, of itself, unfair or improper, at least where the recording was lawful.”


	
	The Crown Prosecutor accepted that Ms Biles was acting as an agent of the state on 1 and 6 September 2011 (T 254). That concession was justified in the circumstances. There was no evidence that Ms Biles would otherwise have gone to visit the accused. The two were not friends and their only connection was through Mr Simmons. The nature of the conversation strongly supports the proposition that she was acting at the behest of the police.
	
	
	The question of whether the things said by the accused were elicited, in the sense contemplated in Pavitt, is not straightforward. I discussed the meaning of “eliciting” in this context in my earlier judgment. There is no doubt that the accused could have refused to speak to Ms Biles. However, a careful examination of the transcript of both conversations leads me to the conclusion that Ms Biles did elicit those responses relied upon by the Crown. The accused’s repeated denials that Simmons was involved were constantly met with statements to the effect that Simmons had told her differently and that Simmons had said that they “did it for her”. She repeatedly re-introduced the subject matter and did so quite relentlessly. She did not accept his denials. The conversation was the “functional equivalent of an interrogation”.
	
	
	The accused had not exercised his right to silence prior to these conversations. On the other hand, counsel agreed that he had never been advised of that right and the police had not previously spoken to him about the matter. When police arrested him in 2013, he exercised his right to silence.
	
	
	As I said in my earlier judgment allowing the admissions made by Simmons, the non-exhaustive list of criteria provided by their Honours in Pavitt cannot be allowed to distract from the question posed by the statutory language of s 90. That question is whether it would be unfair to use the “admissions” in view of the circumstances in which they were made. The accused bears the onus of establishing unfairness and in persuading me that the discretion should be exercised in his favour.
	
	
	I have concluded that I should exercise my discretion under s 90 to exclude the content of the conversations. I am of the opinion that it would be unfair to use them given the circumstances in which they were made. The matters that lead me to those conclusions include:
	



	
	The accused was an involuntary patient at a psychiatric hospital in recovery from a severe psychotic illness. I accept the Crown’s proper concession that the fact that the recurrence of the psychotic illness was brought about by drug or alcohol use is not relevant.
	
	
	While he was in recovery and the hospital notes suggest that his condition had settled, he was subject to an order under the current mental health legislation to remain at Bloomfield Hospital until 27 October 2011.
	
	
	Ms Biles said that on 1 September the accused was “not himself” and was “different” (T 249-250). In cross-examination, she agreed that he was “different mentally” and that he was also different mentally the second time she visited (T 259).
	
	
	No enquiry was made by police as to the accused mental health between the time they found out that he was in Bloomfield hospital (a little after 4:30 pm) and the time Ms Biles was “deployed”.
	
	
	Ms Biles was engaged as an agent of the police investigators and persistently sought to elicit admissions from the accused in the face of his denials. The conversation was the functional equivalent of an interrogation.
	
	
	The accused had not been advised of his right to silence and not previously been approached by police for the purpose of conducting a recorded interview or obtaining a statement from him.
	
	
	The accused exercised his right to silence when he was arrested in 2013 (Ex VD 1, Tab 136, Q 23) although this is not a significant matter in light of the passage of time between the Biles conversation and his arrest.
	



	
	In the exercise of the discretion under s 90 I rule that the evidence is inadmissible.
	


The 2013 admissions


	
	It is common ground that on 18 January 2013 the police arrested the accused for the murder of Andrew Russell. The accused gave evidence that he was not aware that he had been arrested for murder (T 286-287). However, evidence of what he said whilst in custody establishes that he was aware that he was arrested for murder. The custody management record supports that conclusion (Ex VD 1, Tab 150) and in the course of an electronically recorded interview commencing at 12:09 pm on 18 January 2013, the following is recorded:
	


“Q12.   And do you agree that, that we met near Walmer Park?

A.   Yes.

Q13.   Where you were arrested and [brought] back here to the police station?

A.   Yeah.

…

Q25.   I am going to ask you some questions about a murder that, do you understand that you were arrested for the murder of Andrew Russell?

A.   Yeah”


	
	It is also common ground that the police allowed the accused to speak to his stepfather John Fazio and other relatives.
	
	
	In the interview the accused indicated that he wished to exercise his right to silence (Ex VD 1, Tab 136, Q 23). Some time after the recorded interview, the accused made an admission, the effect of which was that Simmons had bashed the deceased (and killed him) and that the accused assisted Simmons to move the body.
	
	
	The objection to the evidence of these admissions is based on the circumstances in which that admission was made and what prompted it. The accused says that he was induced to make the admissions by a promise that what he said would not be used against him. The accused relies on ss 85 and 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The prosecution says that no such inducement was offered.
	


The admissions


	
	Detective Fawkner’s statement dated 13 March 2013 sets out the following conversation (Ex VD 1, Tab 102, para 54-55):
	


“About 12.30pm, I was asked by Sergeant Craig Spice to speak to the accused Kieran MOORE and his step father John Fazio. I returned to the charge room and had a brief conversation with Kieran MOORE, John Fazio and Detective Senior Constable Justin Hadley. This conversation was not recorded, at the request of Kieran MOORE. I took Kieran MOORE to the interview room, where I became seated with John Fazio and Kieran MOORE.

I said, ‘Kieran, you have asked me to come and speak with you. What do you want to speak about?""

Kieran MOORE said,’ I want to tell you everything, but I want my solicitor present.’

I said, ’Ok, what do you want to tell me.’

Kieran MOORE said. 'Tony and I were coming back into town one night and saw old mate walking along the road, near the bridge coming into Bathurst.""

I said, ""Do you mean Andrew RUSSELL.""

Kieran MOORE said, ""Yeah.""

I said, ""What car were you in?""

Kieran MOORE said, ""My car, a VT Green Commodore.""

I said, ""Not the white excel?""

Kieran MOORE said, ""No, I can't drive a manual.""

I said, ""Ok, so, you were coming back into town.""

Kieran MOORE said, ""Yeah, it was raining this night, Tony was in the passenger seat and he asked me to pull over. Tony got out and bashed old mate. He wasn't movin, he was dead.""

I said, ""What happened then.""

Kieran MOORE said, ""We moved the body into the bushes. The body is behind the Good guys there.""

I said, ""Ok, what time was that.""

Kieran MOORE said, ""It was late, about 11.30.""

I said, ""Ok. I will contact Bathurst Court House and have your solicitor present.""

55.1 returned to the charge room area with the accused Kieran MOORE and step father John Fazio. I asked Sergeant Craig Spice to contact legal aid solicitor Leigh Haywood. Leigh Haywood attended Bathurst Police Station, where I had a brief conversation with her. I escorted Leigh Haywood to the charge room. I then attended to other duties.”


	
	Detective Hadley recounts the same conversation (Ex VD 1, Tab 104, para 39).
	
	
	Mr Fazio provided the following version of the conversation (Ex VD 1, Tab 39, Q 160):
	


“A. Kieran said that, ""All right, I will tell you what I know."" And then he started to say, We were driving along Durham Street, pissing down rain, about 11.00, 11.30 at night. We were driving along, and Tony Simmons must have been in the passenger seat, said to Kieran, they must have spotted this old mate and Tony's gone, as they've approached him he must have seen him and he's gone, ""Pull over. I hate this cunt."" So Kieran's pulled over at a bridge, waited for this fella to approach the car, then Tony Simmons has got out and bashed him. And then Kieran said he then, he didn't wake up, so moved him over into the bush opposite the Good Guys, into the paddock area.”

What was said before the admission was made?


	
	The accused gave evidence on the voir dire and said that he was offered an “off the record conversation”. He said, without much certainty, that he thought it was Detective Hadley who “raised the topic of an off the record conversation”. He gave the following evidence (T 286):
	


“Q. Now what did you understand to be meant by an off the record conversation?

A. Give them information about what I knew and it wouldn’t be used in court.

Q. Did you then give the Detective an account of what had happened on a particular night?

A. It never happened but I did tell the story.

Q. If police had not told you that this was to be an off the record conversation, would you have spoken to them?

A. No, I would have exercised my right of silence.”


	
	The accused was cross-examined as to precisely when this conversation occurred and he gave a variety of answers to those questions. For example, he said at one stage “they offered it to me all day.” (T 292) Earlier, he said that the matter was raised in the presence of his stepfather (T 285). He was cross-examined (T 297-298):
	


“Q. You told the detectives that you didn’t want it recorded, didn’t you?

A. They said it was an off the record conversation and wouldn’t be recorded.

Q. I’ll ask you the question again. You told the detectives you didn’t want it recorded?

A. No.”


	
	The accused also gave evidence (T 294):
	


“Once they turned off the machine after I declined to give any statement or exercise my right of silence they turned off the machine and said ‘well you can give us an off the record conversation if you’re worried about Tony or anything like that along them lines’”


	
	The tenor of the cross-examination was that the detectives did not tell the accused that he could have an off the record conversation with them.
	
	
	Detective Hadley gave the following evidence in committal proceedings in March 2014 (Ex VD 12, p 107):
	


“Q. In your presence did Detective Faulkner say “we can have a conversation off the record?”

A. I can’t remember the exact words that he may have said that to me that just meant the defendant indicated that he did not wish to be interviewed officially but he was happy to speak off the record.

Q. You understand that this was what – well what I’m putting to you is that this is what Detective Fawkner said to the defendant, you understand that?

A. Yes I do.

Q. It’s you –

A. I can’t remember the exact conversation but yeah.”


	
	Detective Fawkner’s evidence at the committal (Ex VD 11, pp 61-62) was:
	


“Q. And at the start of the conversation did you say ""We can have a conversation off the record""?

A. No.

Q. Are you sure about that?

A. I don't recall saying ""off the record"". I would've said something about not being recorded I don't know if you're - unless you can draw my attention to a particular-

Q. I can

A. Yep.

Q. You later interviewed John Fazio?

A. Sure.

Q. The record of interview took place on 23 January 2013?

A. Yeah.

Q. In the course of that interview do you remember asking these questions and receiving these answers - your Honour from question 150-151 I'm sorry. Q. And do you agree that Kieran said something like 'I want to tell you everything but I want my solicitor present’?

A. Yep.

Q. Mr Fazio answered ‘Yes’?

A. Yep.

Q. You asked ‘And do you agree I said something like 'Well do you, do you remember what I said?’ Mr Fazio answered ‘You said We can have a conversation off the record’?

A. Mr Fazio said that?

Q. Yes?

A. If you're saying that he said that yeah, I can't recall it.

Q. And you then are recorded as saying ‘Yeah’?

A. Yeah.

Q. And do you agree that - and Mr Fazio answered ‘With me, with myself in the room with everybody’ - question 154 ‘With you being present?’ Answer, ‘Yes’. Do you remember those answers to those questions?

A. I don't know if-

Q. Can I show - ask that the witness be shown a document

A. Sure.

Q. I understand there's no issue that its page 13 of the record of interview?

A. Yep.

Q. Do you agree that Mr Fazio - let me just take you to the crux of it?

A. Yeah sure.

Q. Did you ask - question 152 and do you agree ‘I said something like 'well do you remember what I said?’ Mr Fazio answered ‘Aah you said we can have a conversation off record’?

A. Yep.

Q. You said ‘Yeah’ and do you agree that answer ‘With me, with myself in the room with everybody’ --

A. Right.

Q. Have I read correctly from the transcript of the interview?

A. Yep.

Q. In summary Mr Fazio said that you said ‘We can have a conversation off record’ and you agreed that that was what was said correct?

A. Yeah that's his - the interpretation of what I said yes but what-

Q. But that--

A. --I think it’s taken out of text (as said) when I said the conversation is not recorded we're standing in the - when we were sitting in the interview room.

Q. Were they the words you used?

A. They're his words not -I would've said something that - my words-

Q. They're his words?

A. They're his words that I say.

Q. Yes?

A. I agree with that.”


	
	The accused’s stepfather Mr Fazio also gave evidence at the committal hearing (Ex VD 10 p 42):
	


“Q. What happened then?

A. We went into an interview room.

Q. Yes?

A. And Kieran said he’d like to tell them something with his solicitor present.

Q. Yes?

A. And they, that – the police said that we could have a conversation off the record.

Q. Yes?

A. And we had a conversation.”


	
	Later he said (at p 50):
	


“Q. did you see anyone turn on a tape recorder or a video machine?

A. No.

Q. And did you see anyone making notes during the time that you had, the four of you had the conversation?

A. Unsure.

Q. And you understood that the – throughout the conversation you understood that it was to be off the record?

A. I did. which is not recorded.”


	
	As Mr Stratton SC submitted, three of the four people present (that is, the accused, Mr Fazio and Detective Hadley) recalled that one of the police officers said something to the effect that the accused could speak “off the record”. Detective Hadley could not remember the exact words. Detective Fawkner denied using those words but seemed to say that the accused may have done so.
	
	
	In making a factual finding as to what was said, I am particularly persuaded by the recorded interview between Mr Fazio and Detective Fawkner that took place five days after the impugned admission. This was the conversation to which Detective Fawkner was taken at the committal hearing.
	
	
	On 23 January 2013 Mr Fazio attended the Bathurst Police Station and made a statement. The statement was recorded electronically and made by way of question and answer with Detective Fawkner. The important part of that interview for present purposes is the following (Ex VD 1, Vol 1, Tab 39):
	


“Q150. And then we went back into a little interview room.

A. Interview room, yeah.

Q151. And do you agree that Kieran said something like, I want to tell you everything but I want my solicitor present?

A. Yes.

Q152. And do you agree I said something like, or do you, do you remember what I said?

A. Ah, you said, we ‘we can have a conversation off-record’.

Q153. Yeah. And do you agree that —

A. With me, with myself in the room with, with everybody.

Q154. With you being present.

A. Yes.

Q155. Yeah. And do you agree that I said, ‘We can contact your solicitor at Bathurst’ —

A. Yes.

Q155. — ‘Courthouse’ —

A. Yes.

Q155. — ‘and have them present?’

A. Yes.

Q156. I just wanted to know what that conversation was going to be about.

A. About what Kieran Moore —

Q157. But that's what I said to him.

A. Yeah.

Q158. ‘I want to know what that conversation was about.’

A. Yes.

Q159. And, and do you agree then he freely said, do you know what he said after that?

A. I do.”


	
	Mr Fazio then (Q 160) set out his memory of what his step-son said. This is set out above (at [99]). It is in very similar terms to the conversation recalled by the detectives in their statements. It is an account which is against his step-son’s interest. It establishes in my mind the fact that Mr Fazio was an honest and reliable witness. Mr Fazio was not cross-examined on the voir dire although he gave evidence at the committal hearing.
	
	
	Mr Fawkner said nothing during the course of the interview with Mr Fazio to indicate any disagreement with the suggestion that he had offered the accused an “off-record” conversation. I do not accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that it would have been improper for him to clarify or correct the record. It would not have been necessary to engage in impermissible cross-examination of the witness for him to do so.
	
	
	Detective Fawkner’s Duty Book (Ex VD 1, Tab 103) does not record any exchange where words to the effect that the conversation was to be off the record were used. It does record an earlier conversation that took place at Walmer Park in which the accused said that he knew nothing about the murder of Andrew Russell. Based on the custody management record (Ex VD 1, Tab 150) that conversation must have taken place at around 8:15 am. The custody management record says that the accused arrived at Bathurst Police Station at around 8:25 am. The Duty Book also records a “heated discussion” between the accused and his mother (Tracey Moore). According to the record in the Duty Book, Ms Moore told the detectives that the accused had told her that he had nothing to do with the murder but that she believed he was lying to her.
	
	
	The Custody Manager, Sgt Spice, did not give evidence on the voir dire. His statement (Ex VD 1, Tab 149) records that Mr Fazio spoke to the accused while the accused was having a cigarette. (From other evidence, this was in a garage attached to the Police Station). Mr Fazio then asked for the detectives. Sgt Spice then relayed the request. Sgt Spice was not present during any of the relevant conversations.
	
	
	Mr Fazio said that in the conversation he had with the accused in the garage he told the accused that he should tell the police “what he knows … everything you know, everything you know”. At the committal hearing he said that he told the accused (Ex VD 10, p 41):
	


“Tell them what you know mate, you’ve got to tell them what you know. You’ve got to look after yourself, no-one’s going to look after you.”


	
	The accused gave evidence (T 291):
	


“My stepfather was crying to me and kept on telling me I have to tell them something, you have to tell them something, they’re going to take you down for murder and you have to tell them something.”

Factual findings based on the evidence


	
	The accused gave inconsistent evidence on various issues. For example, he said that he could not recall meeting the custody manager (Sgt Spice) but went on to agree with a series of propositions about what was said by the custody manager. He initially said that he could not recall what he said to Sgt Spice about speaking to the detectives again (T 292) but later testified that he said “Get the detectives. I’ll have the off the record conversation” (T 293). Sgt Spice said that it was Mr Fazio (not the accused) who requested to see the detectives again and I accept that is more likely to be what happened. I have also referred to the fact that the accused said that he could not remember being arrested for murder and gave different accounts as to when the “off the record” conversation was offered to him. I have taken those, and other, inconsistencies into account in assessing his credibility. On the whole, however, I accept the accused’s evidence. His evidence of there being a discussion about an “off the record” conversation receives support from the evidence of Mr Fazio and, to a degree, from the evidence of Detective Hadley.
	
	
	Having considered the whole of the evidence closely, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at least one of the police officers, probably Detective Fawkner, said words to the effect that the accused could speak to the police “off the record” or “off-record” immediately before the impugned confession was made.
	
	
	I am satisfied that this was said at least once (in the presence of Mr Fazio) and, more likely than not, earlier in the day as well. The latter finding is based on the accused’s evidence (“they were offering it to me all day”) and on the meeting at Walmer Park, the details of which are not recorded in the statements of the detectives although some detail is contained in the Duty Book. I also accept Mr Fazio’s clear evidence that an “off-record” conversation was mentioned almost immediately upon the detectives returning. That is unlikely to have occurred unless there was some earlier discussion of the possibility.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that the accused understood that what he said would not be recorded and that it would not be used against him or disclosed to the co-accused Simmons. I do not accept that what was conveyed was no more than an indication that the conversation would not be recorded electronically (or in writing). There is nothing in the police statements, custody management record or Detective Fawkner’s duty book of a conversation where the accused was offered a discussion that would not be recorded.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the accused denied any involvement when first spoken to by police at Walmer Park and again when he spoke to his mother at the police station. I accept that there was a heated conversation with his mother and that, later, the accused was told by his step-father that he should tell the police what he knew and had “to look after yourself”.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the accused exercised his right to silence when interviewed by police electronically.
	


Relevant legal principles


	
	Mr Stratton SC took me to a number of authorities concerning the admissibility of statements made after a suspect was told that the things they said would be and remain “off the record”. The issue arose in The Queen v Noakes (1986) 42 SASR 489. King CJ said this (at 492-493):
	


“That something said by the interrogated suspect will not be used in evidence is an improper inducement and one which, if it does in fact induce the suspect to make the statement, deprives that statement of its voluntary character.

… In the present case the appellant asked the police officer whether he could say something off the record. I have no doubt that by that he meant, and was understood by the detectives to mean, that he was asking whether, if he said something, it would not be used in evidence. The interrogating detective responded by saying to the detective who was doing the typing, ""Stop typing"". What followed was not typed.

… It seems to me, therefore, that what occurred was tantamount to a statement by the police officers to the appellant that anything which he said following his request that it be considered as off the record, would not be used in evidence. In my opinion, whatever might have been the intention of the detectives, the effect of what occurred was the offer of an improper inducement to the appellant to make a further statement. In those circumstances I am of the opinion that what was said following Detective Klaer's remark ""Stop typing"" was inadmissible as being involuntary.”


	
	A similar approach was taken in Walsh v The Queen [1996] TASSC 59 when Cox CJ said at [9]:
	


“had the Detective induced the appellant to speak to him at the car park by conveying to him that such a conversation was “off the record” in the sense that what was said would not be given in evidence on any trial of the appellant, the statements made by the appellant would not have been voluntary.”


	
	His Honour cited Noakes and the Queensland case of R v Plotzki (1972) QDR 379.
	
	
	In R v Chadd [2006] NZCA 449, the New Zealand Court of Appeal appeared (obiter) to take a similar approach at [24]:
	


“It is clear that the discussion with Detective Constable Barnard concluded with the “off the record” discussion. Such discussions sometimes can mean that any statement made will not be given in evidence: R v Moresi (No. 2) (1996) 14 CRNZ 322 (HC). The “off the record” disclosures in the present case are not sought to be given in evidence and it is accepted between the parties that those are not admissible.”


	
	The only New South Wales case to which I was taken has a storeyed history. That is the case of Sophear Em. That case made its way to the High Court in relation to a different, although superficially similar, issue. There were two trials in this Court and two appeals to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	The issue that arises in the present case was not subject to the appeal to the High Court: Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67. That appeal concerned a situation where the police covertly recorded admissions made by a suspect who had previously indicated that he did not wish to have any conversation recorded. The accused was told that he did not have to speak but he was not told that what he said was being recorded and that it might later be used in evidence. The meeting took place in a park. The accused was under the misapprehension that what he was saying was not being recorded and would not be used against him. The High Court held that recording the conversation in this way was not relevantly unfair for the purpose of s 90 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): per Gleeson CJ, Heydon, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Kirby J dissenting.
	
	
	The High Court was not called upon to consider the correctness of a ruling made by the trial Judge (James J) that another admission, induced by a representation that implied that the conversation “would not be used to his disadvantage” was inadmissible. (See the judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ at [123]).
	
	
	That ruling was referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal: Em v R [2006] NSWCCA 336. Giles JA said at [51]-[52]:
	


“51. The words his Honour had quoted were the part of the conversation in [43] above. His Honour considered that they -

‘134. … would have conveyed to the accused that, if he gave information to the police about the shooting, the consequence might be a consequence beneficial to him, that he would have a greater sense of well-being (‘He might feel better’), but a consequence that would not ensue was his being arrested and deprived of his liberty. In my opinion, it was implicit in what was said that, if the accused spoke to the police about the shooting, what he said would not be used to his disadvantage.’

52. His Honour found that, when he spoke these words, Detective Abdy intended to induce or promote a belief on the part of the appellant that, if he spoke to the police about the shooting, what he said would not be used disadvantageously to him. His Honour came to the conclusion -

‘140. I have already found that the accused had come to the belief, quite independently of anything said or done by the police, that, if a conversation he had with the police was not being recorded, it was ‘off the record’ and could not be used in evidence against him. However, I find that what Detective Abdy said at page 25 of the transcript strengthened this belief and encouraged the accused to speak to the police about the shooting when previously in the conversation he had been reluctant to do so.

141. I conclude that what Detective Abdy said at page 25 of the transcript impugned the accused’s freedom to choose whether to speak to police. Detective Abdy had intentionally said to the accused that, if the accused spoke to the police he would not be arrested and what he said could not be used against him. It would be unfair to use against the accused evidence of admissions made by him after the words spoken by Detective Abdy at page 25 of the transcript, and, therefore, evidence of those admissions should be excluded.’”


	
	Giles JA went on to say at [77]:
	


“77. The appellant referred to The Queen v Noakes (1986) 42 SASR 489, in which the accused asked the police if he could say something off the record, the police agreed, and it was thought that the accused meant and the police agreed that what was to follow “would be off the record in the sense that it would not be used in evidence” (at 492). This was held to be the offer of an improper inducement to make a further statement. The contrast with the present case is marked; there was a positive holding-out that what the accused said would not be used against him.”


	
	In an earlier appeal (R v Sophear Em [2003] NSWCCA 374), Howie J referred to the same distinction (at [133]):
	


“133. In my opinion there is a very significant difference, for the purposes of the admission of evidence of confessional statements, between, on the one hand, subterfuge by the police which is aimed merely at inducing a suspect to believe that what he said to them was not being recorded, and, on the other hand, subterfuge which is aimed at inducing in a suspect the belief that what he said would not be used in evidence against him. I do not believe that conduct of the first type necessarily requires that the admissions obtained as a result of the subterfuge be rejected under s 90 or otherwise. On the other hand conduct of the second type would clearly enliven the discretion to reject the evidence under s 90 and it may be the case that, generally speaking, any admission resulting from such a representation would be rejected in the exercise of discretion.”


	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor did not take me to any additional authorities on the subject but says that, properly analysed, the situation here is more analogous to the issue that arose for the High Court’s consideration in Sophear Em. He says that I would not accept that the accused was offered an “off the record conversation”. He fairly concedes (T 372) that if I am satisfied that the accused was induced to believe that what he was saying was off the record in the sense that it would not be used against him or disclosed to Mr Simmons he “couldn't quarrel with your Honour exercising the discretion to exclude it”.
	
	
	In spite of the case law in other jurisdictions, the concession made by the Crown Prosecutor and the findings that I have made, it is necessary to determine whether a proper application of the provisions of the Evidence Act lead to a conclusion that the evidence should or must be excluded. The language employed in the case law ought not to distract from the terms of the statute.
	


Section 85 Evidence Act


	
	Section 85 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) provides:
	


“85 Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants

(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:

(a) to, or in the presence of, an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence, or

(b) as a result of an act of another person who was, and who the defendant knew or reasonably believed to be, capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.

Note : Subsection (1) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Kelly v The Queen(2004) 218 CLR 216.

(2) Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account:

(a) any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and

(b) if the admission was made in response to questioning:

(i) the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and

(ii) the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.”


	
	The terms of s 85(1)(a) are clearly satisfied. Accordingly, the question is whether, taking into account all of the circumstances including the particular matters referred to in sub-s (3), “it is unlikely that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected”. While sub-s (3)(b)(ii) makes specific reference to an inducement, the enquiry required by the section remains focussed on the likelihood that the truth of the admissions was affected adversely.
	
	
	The section does not call for analysis as to whether the confession is (in fact) true unless, perhaps, the issue is raised by the party taking the objection: s 189(3) Evidence Act. In R v Ye Zhang [2000] NSWSC 1099 Simpson J said at [52]: 
	


“52. It seems to me that sub s (3) is designed to obviate a “bootstraps” argument in the determination of the admission of the evidence. That is, evidence of an admission will not be admitted because the admission can be shown, by other evidence, to be truthful. The attention of the court is to be directed to the circumstances in which the admission was made, excluding evidence that would substantiate or contradict the admission. The legislation delineates the circumstances in which the admission was made from its independently verifiable (or otherwise) content. An exception to that position, provided in s 189(3), is made where the accused introduces the question of truth or falsity of the admission. Where the accused takes that course, neither the Crown or the court is precluded from embarking on an examination of the proof of the admission, although it may be that the extent to which that will be considered is limited.”


	
	There is some question over whether the enquiry is an objective or subjective one and a number of other controversies surrounding the application of the section: see the helpful discussion of the authorities and typically robust expressions of opinion in Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (11th Edition) at pp 429-430 [1.3.5220]. These controversies do not really arise in this case. For example, I propose to put to one side any vulnerability that the accused may have had due to his psychiatric condition and drug addictions in spite of the requirement in sub-s (3)(a) to take into account any relevant condition or characteristic of the accused. This aspect has not been subject of argument and, while there is some evidence that the accused’s problems continued, it does not appear to be “relevant” to the question that arises under s 85.
	
	
	Equally, I do not propose to engage in a consideration of whether the admission is actually true based around a consideration of the other evidence in the case. What I will do is to apply the words of sub-s (2) – do the circumstances make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected?
	
	
	I have considered the prosecutor’s submission that the accused did not confess as a result of any inducement offered by the police but, rather, as a result of what his step-father said to him. While that submission has some force given the timing of events, the whole of the circumstances must be considered and the conversation with Mr Fazio must be considered in the light of my finding that the police told the accused that he could speak “off the record” and that the accused believed that this meant the evidence would not be used against him.
	
	
	On careful reflection, I have reached the conclusion that the circumstances do not make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. In the precise terms of s 85(2), I am not satisfied that “the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected”.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion, I have given effect to my finding that the accused was induced by a statement that the conversation was “off the record” and his belief that this meant it could not be used against him or disclosed to Simmons. I have also taken into account the fact that the accused was told that he was under arrest for murder and that, after he exercised his right to silence, he was engaged in a “heated discussion” with his mother. He was thereafter told by his step-father that he had to help himself and tell the police what he knew or, on the accused’s account, tell them something. On either account the accused was under considerable pressure to say something and, with the inducement and pressure of the murder charge hanging over him, I am not satisfied that the circumstances were such that it is unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.
	
	
	Having reached that conclusion, s 85 is in mandatory terms. The evidence is not admissible.
	


Section 90 Evidence Act


	
	In view of that conclusion, it is strictly unnecessary to consider the discretionary exclusion of the evidence on the grounds that the circumstances in which it was made make it unfair to the accused to use the evidence.
	
	
	However, I have also reached the opinion that the discretion under s 90 is engaged given the circumstances as I have outlined them and the factual findings that I have made.
	
	
	I have made extensive reference to the operation of s 90 earlier in this judgment and in the judgment allowing the admissions of Mr Simmons to be led in evidence.
	
	
	In this case the accused was arrested and told that he was to be charged with murder. Given the timing, that allegation must have been based on the evidence contained in Simmons’ admissions to the police. It may also have received some support from Jodi Biles’ interview back in 2011 but that evidence was insufficient for the police to seek to interview the accused, let alone charge him. The accused denied involvement to Ms Biles in 2011 when she recorded the conversations covertly on behalf of the investigators. He denied involvement when the police met him in the park to arrest him. He exercised his right to silence when he was interviewed formally. He was then offered an inducement namely, that that what he said would be off the record.
	
	
	Taking into account all of those circumstances, it would be unfair to use the evidence against him.
	


ORDERS


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	The evidence of recorded conversations between the accused and Jodi Biles on 1 September 2011 and 6 September 2011 is excluded.
	
	
	The evidence of the unrecorded statements of the accused at the Bathurst Police Station on 18 January 2013 is excluded.

On admissibility of psychologists’ evidence in defence case: see transcript p85  

 


	
	HIS HONOUR: Yesterday before the empanelment of the jury of the trial of this accused, a number of so-called “pre-trial” issues were raised for determination. One of those matters was the indication by counsel for the accused that he would wish to lead evidence in the case of his client from two psychologists concerning their assessment of the accused’s intellectual capacity, and particularly opinions as to his impairment, or “limitations”, as to aspects of his capacity for communication and social interaction.
	
	
	In relation to this matter, it was understood by the accused that the evidence he would lead called in his case would permit of the Crown a case in reply. There is no issue as to the opportunity for the Crown, if it so desired, to call evidence in reply if this evidence was admissible. The Crown opposes its admission.
	
	
	The prosecution prosecutes the accused in relation to two counts of sexual assault and one count of attempted sexual assault committed against a complainant with a cognitive impairment. I do not need to particularise, of course, the counts in the indictment. They are a matter of record.
	
	
	These events allegedly occurred at Mt Druitt on 10 May 2012 shortly after the accused met the complainant outside premises where a social service provider was located. The alleged sexual assaults occurred shortly after 2pm on a weekday - that is, as I understand it, a Thursday - in a location that was described in the Crown case statement as a “pad mounted electrical substation behind the Shop Smart shopping Centre”.
	
	
	My understanding of the Crown case from the Crown Case Statement is that the location of the alleged sexual assaults was approximately 200 metres, perhaps a little further away, from where the two people first met. As I understand the chronology of events, the sexual activity occurred within a matter of 15 minutes to half an hour after their first meeting. It follows from what I have said the accused and the complainant apparently, until that first meeting, were strangers to one another. The three assaults alleged in the Crown’s indictment occurred within a short period of time of one another.
	
	
	The accused is a person originally from Togo who has Ewe as his primary language, French as his secondary language and English as his third language. It is clear from the contents of an electronically recorded interview conducted with him on 11 September 2012 that he has reasonably good conversational English.
	
	
	He was interviewed by police in a lengthy interview on that day and was offered the services of a French interpreter but declined those services. It is a matter ultimately that will require a warning in any event to the jury that the accused, although conversant in English, had an inelegance of expression, at least, that may not reflect exactly what he was intending to convey in his spoken English and he may not fully have understood the character, or particularity, of specific questions asked of him.
	
	
	This matter was highlighted for example when it was drawn to my attention in another context that Q 630 of the police interview involved a misstatement or misrepresentation, not deliberate, but still a misstatement or misrepresentation by the police officer as to the detail of a claimed earlier telephone conversation he had had with the accused before the interview was conducted. The answer of the accused to that question, although not in any way an adoption of the truth of the representation within the question, took no issue as to what had been the misrepresentation of fact as to what had been said that in that earlier conversation. The answer given by the accused in any event is not inculpatory but appears to me to remove any equivocation about what he thought the police were seeking to interview him about at that point of time - that is, at the point of time of the telephone conversation.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused indicated that the relevance of the psychological evidence went to issues that arose by consideration of s 108C, Evidence Act 1995. This section, which I need not cite in full, provides an exception to the ‘credibility rule’ of exclusion of evidence for evidence from persons with specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience. In other words, the profile of a “expert witness” that would permit evidence of opinion as an exception to the exclusionary “opinion rule”.
	
	
	I refer generally to the discussion of the operation of this section, a relatively recent amendment to the Evidence Act, reflected in the 11th edition of Odgers’ Uniform Evidence Law, particularly at p 602-606.
	
	
	The prosecution objects to the evidence being given primarily on the basis that the evidence is not relevant to any issue for consideration by the jury.
	
	
	I point out that the relevant psychological opinions sought to be relied upon in due course by the accused have been served upon the prosecution - in fact the prosecution has had the opportunity over a period of some months to obtain further opinions from a suitably qualified person to comment upon the respective reports that I have seen. There is no issue of the Crown being caught by surprise - and that obviously is not taken by the Crown - and there is no issue taken either by the prosecution or the defence as to the relevant expertise, if I might call it, of the psychologists who have prepared the reports that have been provided to this Court.
	
	
	There is, of course, a factual dispute arising as to the character, if any, of the claimed impairment of the accused, or, in fact, whether there is any impairment at all in those opinions.
	
	
	The Crown submits by reference to s 61HA Crimes Act 1900 that the Crown case is one of whether the accused actually knew that the complainant was not consenting. Section 61HA, dealing with “consent in relation to sexual assault offences”, states at ss (3):
	


“A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person, knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, if:

(a)   the person knows that the person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or

(b)   the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or

(c)   the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse.”


	
	In relation to those matters, the subsection goes on to say that for the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but self-induced intoxication offers no consideration in that regard.
	
	
	Intoxication is not an issue in this case.
	
	
	With regard to the Crown’s submissions, the Crown submitted that having regard to the complainant’s account the accused, it would submit to the jury in due course, actually knew that the complainant was not consenting and when one has regard to the account the accused gave in his interview to the police, bearing in mind of course the Crown acknowledged that it could not predict the way in which the accused’s case would be conducted, there was no dispute on his part that there had been sexual activity between himself and the complainant. The accused asserted positively that the complainant was consenting.
	
	
	The complainant’s account is that she was taken from the place of their first meeting, that is, in a public place, in broad daylight outside this facility providing social services to people in the western suburbs of Sydney, and was taken to the place of sexual activity by some type of force, in the sense that she was led to a place that she did not want to go, and that at all relevant times she clearly indicated to the accused that she did not consent to any sexual activity that may have occurred.
	
	
	The Crown informs me, because I do not have all the material in the Crown case, that there are no eye witnesses to the sexual activity, although, as I understood what the learned Crown said, there was one person who saw two people standing outside the social service provider - if I noted the Crown’s word correctly - “embracing” some time before the sexual activity took place.
	
	
	When I read the reports that have been provided to the Court by the defence and the prosecution , I initially thought, without the assistance of counsel, that the primary purpose for the proposed leading of this evidence was concerned with the issue of the accused’s capacity to communicate with the complainant and appreciate or understand her reaction to him.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused, however, said that the primary basis of the leading of the evidence was to assist the jury to understand or assess whether the accused was in a position to adequately explain himself when interviewed and whether he was able to adequately explain himself as to whether he had reasonable grounds to believe she was consenting to sexual activity. It was submitted that this evidence was significant to prevent misinterpretation of his responses to questions asked of him by police, even though he directly denied that he believed that she was not consenting or that he knew that she was not consenting.
	
	
	The learned counsel for the accused and learned Senior Counsel for the prosecution raised a number of matters with me other than what I have outlined in what I took at the time of the preparation of this judgment would be subsequently transcribed. When I prepared this judgment I had no transcript of yesterday’s proceedings.  I asked for a DVD recording of the legal discussion we had which I listened to last night and this morning. I have listened to that recording and taken into account everything that has been said by the parties.
	
	
	The particular matters that arise from the reports obtained by the accused are found in the opinions of Dr Mark Milic and in the report of Dr Ilana Hepner.
	
	
	Dr Milic wrote reports on 30 December 2013 and then again on 20 August 2014. The second report expanded upon his earlier report and was in reply to a report that had been commissioned by the prosecution from Ms Anita Duffy.
	
	
	Dr Milic in his reports dealt with a great deal of history which, in my view, is not relevant to any of the issues for consideration in the trial, but he undertook psychometric assessment including the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence concluding that the accused performed on the average range in verbal skills but his performance on the non-verbal components was “better” than approximately 14% of the normative population. I think that should be “no better” but I am quoting from the report.
	
	
	He said that the accused also completed what Dr Milic described as the “Colour Trails Test” and scored in the bottom 1% of the population on both parts of the test. He concluded, based upon his psychometric testing, that in the context of “poor functioning in work, poor functioning in relationships, naïve presentation and mildly impaired performance on the non-verbal assessment (the accused) suffered from a mild non-verbal intellectual disability”. He formed the opinion that the accused was at a significant disadvantage when it came to understanding the complexities of the workplace and personal relationships and that his interaction with the complainant was possibly “a naïve and immature interaction stemming from his intellectual disability”.
	
	
	He suggested in that report that the performance on the non‑verbal components and the intelligence test indicated that the accused would have “serious limitations in understanding the non-verbal components of communication such as inferring speakers’ intentions from the words, reading facial expressions and reading bodily gestures”.
	
	
	In his second report ,in response to Ms Duffy’s criticisms of his first report, he responded in greater detail. He cited the criteria from DSM V for a finding of “intellectual disability” and pointed out a number of reasons that the accused met the criteria. These matters are particularised largely at p 2 of his report with the context provided from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to which I earlier referred, and its caution, as quoted by him, to be exercised in considering intelligence test results when determining a diagnosis of intellectual disability. That material is at the bottom of p 1 and the top of p 2 of his report.
	
	
	A further report was obtained for the accused from Dr Ilana Hepner, dated 28 January 2015, based upon interviewing sessions conducted with the assistance of a French speaking interpreter. This is a more satisfactory report in the sense of its detail and provides further evidence of the intellectual capacity of the accused based upon a number of tests set out in para 11 of the report. The specific analysis of the testing appears at paras 12.1 and 12.2.
	
	
	The other parts of the report which seems to be of relevance to the issues either identified by the accused’s counsel, or identified by the Crown or arising from my consideration of the matter, are to be found at para 12.9, at 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4.  I also note what is the answer given to question, or query, “No 3” set out at p 9-10 of her report.
	
	
	I am mindful, I hasten to say, of the contrary opinions of Ms Duffy on particular matters raised within the reports that I have referred to, not only in response to Dr Milic but also to Dr Hepner. However, her opinions are matters that go to the weight of the evidence of these persons with specialised knowledge. To my mind they are not matters relevant to the consideration of the admissibility of the evidence. If the evidence is admissible, any conflict between the opinions is a matter for the jury to resolve.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence of the psychologists retained by the accused is relevant to a number of matters. It is relevant to the credibility of the account given by the accused to the police in the interview and thus obviously gives rise to a consideration of s 108C which provides an exception to the credibility rule. It falls, in my view, within the rubric of subject matter that is discussed by the learned author, Mr Odgers SC, in relation to the discussion of the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Report that led to the amendment of the Evidence Act now contained with the section. The evidence, in my view, is relevant, having regard to the terms of s 55 Evidence Act 1995, to understand the character of the representations made by the accused and to assessing the detail of his explanation for the circumstances of his contact with the complainant and his conduct towards her.
	
	
	In my view the evidence is also relevant to assessing the credibility of the account of the complainant and her interrelation with the accused, both as to the circumstances in which she was approached by the accused and effectively propositioned by him, and in assessing her version of his responses to her opposition to his sexual entreaties. Of course, I understand that at the end of the Crown case the character of the circumstances of their contact with one another and the circumstances of any sexual activity may not be as it currently may seem, based upon the accounts given by the complainant in the interviews conducted of her. However, that is a matter to be considered at a later time and certainly is not a matter I can take into account in assessing this matter at the commencement of the trial.
	
	
	It is clear that on her account, in her interviews with police, that the issues are - to use either my words or the learned Crown’s words - “black and white”. The same could also be said, except in one particular respect that I raised with counsel for the accused, as to the account given by the accused in the interview that he gave to the police.
	
	
	I proceed on the basis that the account given by the complainant in the interviews will be the state of the Crown case when the jury is required to consider the issues that arise, subject, of course, to other evidence in the case including the contents of the interview given by the accused.
	
	
	The Crown, as I earlier indicated, said that the matter turned upon an issue of knowledge as it was referred to in s 61HA(3)(a). At this stage of the matter I do not accept that the case may be left to the jury on that isolated basis. The accused’s own account of the circumstances in which he admitted ejaculation occurring may give rise to a consideration of the issue of “recklessness” arising under s 61HA(3)(b) . Matters concerning the accused’s understanding of relevant events may be pertinent to the assessment of that matter, as it would to the matter of “knowledge”.
	
	
	It also may be relevant to an issue that may arise out of the complainant’s account as to whether the accused had “no reasonable grounds for believing that the complainant was consenting”, a matter identified at S 61HA(3 (c).
	
	
	One of the factual issues the jury is going to have to decide, as a contextual matter, is also whether the meeting of the accused and the complainant and the movement of two people from a shopping centre to the location of the sexual activity, in broad daylight on a weekday afternoon within 20 minutes or so of first meeting, was in fact in the circumstances alleged by the complainant, or whether it was reasonably possible that the accused believed that the complainant willingly was prepared to leave with him to engage in sexual activity after a relatively short period of acquaintanceship.
	
	
	In this regard, consideration of the accused’s understanding of the social dynamic, if I might call it, of his interaction with the complainant will be a relevant consideration for the jury. Thus the opinions expressed about matters concerning the accused’s capacity to assess non-verbal communication and his capacity to perform in the area of “adaptive functioning”, that is as to socialisation and social participation, will be, in my view, relevant matters for the jury to consider, again the context of the terms of s 55 Evidence Act.
	
	
	The consideration of this matter will, of course, be relevant to a fundamental issue for consideration by the jury, the real issue in the case - that is, whether the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s account as represented in her interviews is truthful and accurate. This will be an assessment the jury will need to make having regard to all the evidence in the case already anticipated, including any independent observation of the parties and, as I said earlier, the accused’s account in the his police interview.
	
	
	In this regard, matters arising from the opinions of the psychologists that I have already identified will be a relevant consideration to the assessment of that fundamental issue. Thus, I will permit evidence of the opinions that I have identified in the judgment I have just given in the reports of Dr Milic and Dr Hepner.
	
	
	I must say it will be a matter of - if I can use the very bald expression – ‘tactical’ consideration as to whether the defence would wish to call two experts or one. That is a matter of judgment of course for counsel in due course. But to the extent that I have identified the relevant opinions within the respective reports, they appear to be the opinions relevant to the issues that would make the evidence admissible.

		14 April 2015",2015-03-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703843,Eriyo v R [2015] NSWCCA 16,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant pleaded guilty to two offences as follows:
	


Count 1:   Attempt to possess a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin;

Count 2:   Possess a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin.


	
	The maximum sentence for each offence is 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000.
	
	
	On 28 February 2014 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Huggett in the District Court as follows:
	


Count 1:   Imprisonment for six years commencing 21 February 2014 and expiring 20 February 2020 with a non-parole period of four years from 21 February 2014 expiring 20 February 2018;

Count 2:    Imprisonment for six years commencing 21 December 2014 and expiring 20 December 2020 with a non-parole period of four years commencing 21 December 2014 and expiring 20 December 2018.


	
	The overall sentence was a period of six years and ten months imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years and ten months. Her Honour incorrectly said that the balance of the total term was a period of two years and two months. It was, in fact, two years.
	
	
	The Applicant in his Notice of Appeal sought leave to appeal on three grounds as follows:
	


1.   Her Honour erred at law by imposing an effective non-parole period in excess of the statutory ratio.

2.   Her Honour erred at law by setting separate non-parole periods for each offence.

3.   Her Honour incorrectly accounted for the period of pre-sentence custody.


	
	At the hearing of the appeal the Applicant’s counsel accepted that Ground 1 could not succeed because the charges were offences against Commonwealth law and s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) did not apply to the sentence. He sought, and was granted leave, to amend Ground 1 to read:
	


That her Honour erred by imposing an effective non-parole period that was manifestly excessive.

Facts


	
	On 13 May 2012 Australian Customs and Border Protection officers intercepted a UPS consignment from Tanzania purporting to have a telephone number 00 200 577 808 4655 to a person called Christiana Ohia at an address in Pendle Hill purporting to have a telephone number of 0470 457 943. The consignment contained 130.1 grams of pure heroin within the soles of sandals contained therein.
	
	
	On 16 May 2012 an unknown male called the UPS call centre and requested that the consignment be delivered to Unit 6/98-100 Metella Road, Toongabbie rather than the stated Pendle Hill address. The Metella Road address was the home address of the Applicant.
	
	
	On 17 May a controlled delivery was attempted at this address but the front door was not answered. The following day an unknown male called the UPS call centre and requested that the consignment be delivered on 21 May 2012.
	
	
	On 22 May 2012 a controlled delivery of a substitute substance was effected. The Applicant answered the door and when asked if he was Christiana Ohia he agreed. He signed the delivery slip and took possession of the substitute parcel. A few minutes later AFP officers saw the Applicant walk towards a motor vehicle parked at the front of the unit block. When the Applicant saw the officers he ran back into the premises and attempted to exit via the rear door. He was stopped and arrested. This formed the basis for Count 1.
	
	
	During a search of the Applicant officers located a Samsung mobile telephone. The telephone was examined and found to contain a contact listed against the number 00 255 577 808 4655 (sic) which it was accepted was the same number recorded in the consignment.
	
	
	An examination of the phone showed four missed calls from the number ending in 4655 between 16 and 22 May 2012 as well as six outbound calls to that number between 21 May and 22 May 2012. There were also SMS messages which contained references to the UPS tracking number for the consignment, the sender’s name in Tanzania and the receiver’s name (Ohia) and references to the Pendle Hill address to which the consignment was directed. The numbers 25 577 (sic) were accepted by the parties as being the country code digits for Tanzania.
	
	
	The Applicant's premises were searched. The substitute package was on a couch in the lounge room. The Applicant had opened it and the contents had been partially removed. Torn pieces of paper with handwritten notes including the name of the consignee, Christiana Ohia, and the purported contact number 0470 457 943 were located in a recycling bin. Five mobile telephones were located, one of which used a telephone number 0470 457 943. An examination of these five mobile telephones and the torn pieces of paper showed a connection between the Applicant and the consignment.
	
	
	Also located inside a plastic bag within a running shoe under the laundry sink was 118.7 grams of pure heroin. That heroin was the basis for count 2 on the indictment.
	
	
	During a recorded conversation the applicant said that he knew the packages he had been receiving contained drugs.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge was satisfied that in relation to both offences the Applicant's actions went well beyond that of a mere courier or conduit. Her Honour was satisfied the Applicant played a role akin to being a trusted middleman in an organised distribution chain. However, it was not he who conceived of the enterprise, and he did not have the funds to finance it.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge characterised both offences as being objectively serious offences.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant was not a person rendered vulnerable by drug or other addiction. Her Honour said that there was no dispute that the Applicant's motivation was a financial one. However, there was no evidence to indicate he was living a life of luxury or excess. She characterised his motivation as one to earn money to supplement what he was otherwise earning from time to time.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant was born in 1978 and at the time of sentence was aged 35 years. He was of Nigerian descent. He was educated in Nigeria and subsequently employed by the Nigerian government as an athlete. He came to Australia in 2006 to compete in the Commonwealth Games and was then granted refugee status. He has dual Australian and Nigerian citizenship. Since living in Australia he had been employed in the cleaning and security industry.
	
	
	Although the pre-sentence report suggested that the Applicant had limited insight into the seriousness of his offending, her Honour on balance was prepared to accept that he was remorseful although aspects of his remorse related to feelings of shame and regret for himself given the predicament he was in.
	
	
	He had no criminal history but her Honour noted that this was not unusual for persons involved in offences of the type under consideration.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that he pleaded guilty at an early stage for both offences and she said that this entitled him to a 25% discount. There had been limited cooperation with authorities and her Honour made a minor allowance to recognise that matter.
	
	
	Her Honour made reference to the totality principle. She said that the offences before the Court were separate and discrete with the result that there was to be a degree of accumulation to reflect the separate criminality involved in each offence.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The Crown did not contest that error had been made in the imposition of two non-parole periods contrary to s 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Nor did the Crown contest that an error had been made in calculating the period of pre-sentence custody. With the latter error being adjusted in the manner to be described, the sole issue in the appeal concerned the period of the overall non-parole period.
	


Ground 1:   The non-parole period was manifestly excessive.


	
	Although her Honour ought not have imposed separate non-parole periods for the individual offences, in having done so and then accumulating them in the way that she did, her Honour has exposed her reasoning for reaching the overall non-parole period that she imposed.
	
	
	Her Honour adopted a ratio of 66 2/3% in relation to each of the sentences imposed on the Applicant. However, when the sentences were accumulated the effect was to create an overall non-parole period of 71%. Her Honour was not unmindful that this would occur because, having accumulated the sentences to reflect the separate criminality involved in each offence, she went on to say:
	


I recognise that a consequence of this will be a slight increase to the overall ratio between the non-parole period and the overall total term.


	
	The Applicant relied on what was said by Howie AJ in Okeke v R [2010] NSWCCA 266 at [38] where his Honour referred to “the normal range of non-parole period for Commonwealth sentences”. Okeke was decided before Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 and those comments of Howie AJ, if they were intended to have general application or provide some sort of a norm, no longer apply.
	
	
	The applicant also drew attention to nine cases involving sentencing for Commonwealth drug offences to demonstrate that the ratio of the non-parole period to the overall sentence in the present case was such that the non-parole period was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	This Court has recently warned of the difficulties which are prone to arise from a comparison of a number of cases to show some established sentencing range for particular offences: MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [41] –[44]; Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264 at [74] – [78].
	
	
	In any event an examination of the cases put forward by the Applicant shows that in only one of those cases (Alvares v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33; (2011) 209 A Crim R 297) was the issue of the ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence discussed. The relevant ground of appeal asserted a reliance by the sentencing judge on what was described as the “norm” of 60-65%. Buddin J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreed) at [74] – [78] made reference to Hili at [36] – [38] and [44] where the notion of any such “norm” was disapproved.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the ratio involved in the sentencing in all the cases referred to was in the range of 55% to 68%. In none of the cases except Alvares was there any challenge to that aspect of the sentencing and in many cases the grounds of appeal principally concerned conviction. However, by comparison with that range, a ratio of 71% in the present case is not so unusual as to raise any concern that error has occurred. That is the more so when the Sentencing Judge expressly adverted to the matter.
	
	
	Moreover, the Applicant conceded in his written submissions that the sentences imposed by her Honour were reasonable and were clearly within the acceptable range for the types of offences. The offences involved serious amounts of a pure form of the drug, and two separate amounts of the drug pointing strongly to an ongoing involvement of a trusted middleman in what the Sentencing Judge described as an organised distribution chain.
	
	
	In my opinion, no error is shown in relation to the non-parole period imposed by the Sentencing Judge. To the extent that error is demonstrated because she first imposed two separate non-parole periods and then partially accumulated them, no lesser sentence is warranted than the overall non-parole period produced by that exercise.
	


Ground 3:   Period of pre-sentence custody


	
	Her Honour sentenced the Applicant on 28 February 2014. In doing so she said this:
	


I have taken into account the fact he was in custody, bail refused, between 22 May 2012 and 6 June 2012, and of course his pleas of guilty. I intend to backdate the sentence so it commences from the time he was taken into custody, that is, 21 February 2014.


	
	The period from 22 May to 6 June 2012 is a period of 15 days. In addition, her Honour revoked the applicant’s bail at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing on 21 February 2014. In those circumstances Her Honour ought to have backdated the sentence to 6 February, being 22 days prior to the date she imposed the sentence. The Crown accepts that her Honour erred in that regard.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal allowed.

(3)   Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 28 February 2014.

(4)   In lieu thereof sentence the Applicant as follows:

   Count 1:   Imprisonment for six years commencing 6 February    2014 and expiring 5 February 2020;

   Count 2:    Imprisonment for six years commencing 6 December    2014 and expiring 5 December 2020;

   Fix a non-parole period of four years ten months commencing 6    February 2014 and expiring 5 December 2018.

2703849,R v Do (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 144,"Judgment


	
	On 3 March 2015 Anna Huynh gave evidence. During cross-examination she was asked the following two questions and gave the answers set out:
	


Q. And you would say that during that time, when you spent time at home with your mum and Tony, you did not notice anything out of the ordinary, correct?

A. Yeah.

Q. Tony's demeanour seemed normal?

A. Yes, but there was one occasion, though, where my mother seemed worried, and I asked her what was going on and she said, ""Oh, everything's fine,"" and she told me that, mum had told me that he had pushed her downstairs.


	
	At that point Mr Smith of Senior Counsel objected to the answer being given. I indicated that I thought the answer went beyond an answer to the question with which both counsel agreed. The Crown Prosecutor asked if the matter could be discussed in the absence of the jury.
	
	
	After some debate Mr Smith sought and was granted some time to obtain instructions. He thereafter sought that the jury be discharged. That application was made in the light of a prior agreement made between the Crown and the defence that material in both the statements of Aminda Huynh and Anna Huynh that suggested the accused was responsible for the deceased’s falling down the stairs on two occasions would not be led.
	
	
	The Defence submitted that the prejudice to the accused from this evidence having been put before the jury by this witness was irreparable in circumstances where the accused was relying on good character, where Mr Smith opened on good character and on the fact that there was no evidence of any violence in the relationship between the deceased and the accused. Mr Smith submitted that no other evidence to explain the fall on the stairs and/or no careful direction to the jury could cure the prejudice.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that there was an agreement that the evidence would not be led from either Aminda or Anna. However, the Crown said that in the light of the questions asked by Mr Smith it was impossible for her to provide a truthful answer that nothing had happened within the time period being asked about.
	
	
	Two things can be said about the questioning. First, Mr Smith carefully asked the witness about a specified and limited time period as the transcript shows (T 209):
	


Q. Now I then just want to ask you some questions about the last five weeks before your mum passed, do you understand?

A. Yeah.

Q. And in particular I am asking you questions about the period when you're on your placement, firstly to Wyong for four weeks, yes?

A. Yeah.

Q. And that period also where you're on placement at Bega, at least for part of the week?

A. Yeah.

Q. Do you understand what I'm going to ask you about?

A. Yeah.

Q. Just those five weeks?

A. Yeah.

Q. You've described that during that time you would be away during the week and then come back at home on the weekends, correct?

A. Yeah.

In that regard, it should be noted that Anna’s evidence in her statement, about which Mr Smith was cross-examining, made it clear that the incident about the deceased falling down or being pushed down the stairs took place at a much earlier time in 2012, that is, the first few months of that year.


	
	Secondly, the two questions before the witness volunteered the information asked if she noticed anything out of the ordinary and, in particular, if Tony’s demeanour seemed normal.
	
	
	The information volunteered was not an answer to either of those questions and that conclusion is strengthened by the fact, as I have said, that the incident involving the stairs did not happen during the period being asked about.
	
	
	There can be no criticism of the way counsel cross-examined to suggest that he was responsible for what occurred.
	
	
	However, I do not accept that the matter is not able to be dealt with by a clear direction to the jury particularly when the Crown confirmed that it was not asserting any violence in the relationship and would be making a statement to that effect in the final address. Moreover, Aminda had already given evidence, and she did not make any reference to this incident in circumstances where the basis of Anna’s knowledge, as her statement attests, was Aminda repeating something she had ascertained from her mother.
	
	
	The fact that the jury will be told by the Crown that the Crown does not rely upon that answer given by Anna, that the Crown does not say that the accused was violent towards the deceased and that the Crown accepts that the accused was a person of good character, are all powerful matters in overcoming any prejudice that was occasioned by the volunteering of information regarding the incident on the stairs by Anna.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, I consider that the jury should not be discharged. I will give a direction to the jury when they return.

2703853,EG v R [2015] NSWCCA 21,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The applicant entered a plea of guilty in the Lismore District Court for the following offence:

Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age and under his authority, contrary to s66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

This offence has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.


	
	On 4 March 2014 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing 5 March 2014 and expiring 4 September 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring 5 March 2019.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in giving too much weight to the Victim Impact Statement.

Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in giving inadequate weight to the assistance provided to the police by the applicant in the circumstances of the case.

Ground 3 – The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	The applicant is the paternal grandfather of the complainant, who at the time of the offence was aged 2. On 27 February 2013 the police spoke to the applicant and informed him that the complainant had made an allegation about him to her mother. The complainant made no disclosures to the police concerning him. The police officer informed him that there was no evidence and that she (the police officer) was not going to prosecute him.
	
	
	After a sleepless night, the applicant telephoned a Family and Community Services worker and made admissions to her. As a result, the applicant was interviewed by the police and made admissions of the offence to which he has pleaded guilty.
	
	
	He told the police that on or about 5 or 6 February 2013 he was looking after all four of his grandchildren (aged 14, 12, 4 and 2) until his daughter-in-law arrived home to collect them. It had been a difficult afternoon with the children in that one of them was being quite demanding. It was at this point that the complainant told him that she needed to have her nappy changed. The applicant said that at the time he was stressed and having difficulty coping with the circumstances of looking after the children.
	
	
	The applicant said that he changed the complainant’s nappy and cleaned her. While she was on the change table with no clothing on the lower part of her body, he said that he bent down and licked her on the outside of her vagina with his tongue. The applicant said that he had no idea why he did it. He said that it lasted a few seconds and that he put underpants on the complainant and left the room.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and repeated that evidence. He said that he had never done anything of that kind to that child or to any other child.
	
	
	When the applicant was asked to explain what happened he said:
	


“When she was lying there I just knelt down and licked her.”

He confirmed that he had bent down while she was lying on her back and licked her vagina. He said that it was just on the outside, rather than penetrating the lips of the vagina or anything of that kind. He said that he was sure about that. None of the other children were present at the time.

Sentence proceedings


	
	Her Honour reviewed the applicant’s subjective circumstances. He was born in 1947 and until this incident, had led a blameless and positively contributing life. He had no previous criminal convictions. He had children of his own who were grown up and over the years he and his wife had fostered other children.
	
	
	The applicant had worked over the years, being involved in various employments. After marrying and having three children, he was employed at a piggery, as a cleaner, in a small business and in a mail delivery business. He had a number of health issues relating to his age including some mild dementia.
	
	
	A report of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, was before the court. Dr Nielssen opined a diagnosis of a significant depressive illness following a life event. The applicant took care of his wife for a couple of years when she became unwell until she was placed in a nursing home in 2007. She died in 2011. In 2009 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had a radical prostatectomy. This left him with incontinence and a complete loss of sexual function.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen’s alternative diagnosis was that of mild dementia. Dr Nielssen noted that an MRI scan of brain showed widespread small vessel disease, as well as a stroke, affecting the temporal and parietal lobes of the brain. Dr Nielssen noted that the abnormal slowness of the applicant’s answers, his torpid emotional responses and his difficulty in spontaneous generation of a sentence despite prompting were consistent with this diagnosis.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen concluded that any connection between those conditions and the commission of the offence was not clear, although he noted that the applicant reported changes in his usual behaviour which included neglect of the home and garden and feelings of stress and emotional problems after treatment for prostate cancer. Dr Nielssen formed the opinion that the applicant may have had a loss of judgment and inhibition as a result of the effects of the stroke and widespread cerebrovascular disease on his information processing and judgment. Dr Nielssen particularly noted [as her Honour observed when the applicant was giving evidence] that he appeared perplexed by his own behaviour and recognised that what he had done was wrong. Her Honour accepted that the applicant had tried to understand why he did what he did, but remained at a loss to explain his actions with respect to his grandchild on that day.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account that the applicant had placed himself in the hands of a psychologist to be treated for an adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood. She noted that as a result of his actions, the applicant had lost contact with a number of members of his immediate and extended family, not to mention the ostracism that confronted a person who is faced with charges of this kind.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that the applicant had acknowledged the offence at an early point of time. She found this to be rare in offences of this type where, even in the face of very strong evidence, offenders would often continue to deny their behaviour and would expose complainants, often young complainants, to the trauma of giving evidence and all the matters associated with that. Her Honour concluded that the matter could not have been prosecuted without the applicant’s assistance through his admissions to police.
	
	
	Her Honour next assessed the objective seriousness of the offending. She noted that the offence was clearly very serious, as was made obvious by the maximum penalty and the lengthy standard non-parole period. She noted the breach of trust involved in that the applicant was the victim’s grandfather.
	
	
	Her Honour then spent a substantial part of her remarks on sentence (two and a half pages out of ten) setting out the contents of the Victim Impact Statement (VIS) read to the court by the complainant’s mother on her behalf.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the offence had had serious consequences for the complainant and her family. She took into account those decisions (SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 and RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235) to the effect that sexual abuse of children of very tender years will inevitably give rise to psychological damage, emanating at least from the confusion in the young mind of the victim of abuse. Her Honour noted that this could be so even in the case of a single act of sexual abuse.
	
	
	Her Honour found:
	


“In this case the very young victim has sustained significant adverse psychological consequences which may be traced back to the applicant’s crime … although only time will tell how far-reaching the psychological consequences upon the complainant child will be.” (ROS 6.2)


	
	Her Honour summarised the VIS and made findings in accordance with its content. She found that the family had been turned upside down by learning of this offence. She accepted that all members of the family, including the complainant’s older siblings, had experienced “lengthy emotional trauma”. She accepted that the complainant spoke about the abuse almost daily in the weeks after it occurred. Her Honour accepted that both parents had to take leave from work to deal with the emotional trauma.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted in full the detail of the effect this had had upon the applicant’s son (the complainant’s father) including the breakdown in his relationship with the applicant and difficulties which it had caused in his relationship with the complainant. Her Honour accepted that the complainant had developed and was demonstrating what the mother described as “sexualised behaviour” which was confronting and difficult for the parents to understand and deal with. Her Honour found that this “sexualised behaviour” had also adversely affected the complainant’s siblings.
	
	
	Having made those findings based on the VIS, her Honour took into account the following when considering the objective seriousness of the offending:
	


“The nature of the conduct is clearly an important or significant matter to take into account. The conduct amounted to licking her on the outside of her vagina for a few seconds. There is no evidence that there was insertion of any object or exposure of the offender to the child. There was no force, threats or physical pain inflicted. As noted this was of brief duration and an isolated instance. There was no suggestion and I accept that the offence was not premeditated or planned, it has, on all the evidence available to this Court the hallmarks of an opportunistic spontaneous act.

In the circumstances it is very difficult and indeed a finding cannot be made that the motivation was some form of sexual gratification. It was of very short duration. I accept the offender’s account in his sworn evidence that he has honestly tried hard to understand his behaviour and does not know why he acted as he did. He can only consider that it was an accumulation of the circumstances that day, the pressure of minding the children and it not being a very easy day. Against a background of upheaval for the offender it had not been many years since his wife had died. It seems his own physical and mental wellbeing was on a downward slide.

For all of those reasons, I have determined that for an offence of this kind, in particular having regard to the nature of the conduct, the duration and that it was isolated, that it falls at the low end of objective seriousness.” (ROS 7.7 – 8.5)


	
	Her Honour found that it was necessary to impose a sentence which took into account general deterrence to deter others from acting in a similar way and personal deterrence, even though her Honour accepted that there was very little chance that the applicant would re-offend. Her Honour was not prepared to give less weight to the principles of deterrence, denunciation and protection of the community. She observed:
	


“There has been undoubtedly some considerable harm done to this very young child in the commission of the offence and therefore to her family and the broader community … I regard what occurred as a very short-lived aberrant instance of wrong yet very serious criminal behaviour with significant ramifications for the child in the wider community. In some ways the offence is unique and unusual as submitted on his behalf. Nevertheless the court is required not to lose sight of the objective seriousness of the offence despite the subjective matters in formulating the sentence.” (ROS 8.9 – 9.3)


	
	In relation to the applicant’s admissions, her Honour said:
	


“I have had regard to the plea of guilty that was entered at an early stage. In addition to the plea and its utilitarian benefit, I have regard to the fact that his admission in the absence of any evidence available to the prosecuting authorities at the time of the revelation or complaint by the child is strong proof of his genuine remorse. That stands him in a very strong position in terms of the regard that might be had for his prospects of rehabilitation which are very high.” (ROS 9.4)


	
	Her Honour accepted that due to the applicant’s advanced age and his physical and mental infirmity, and the nature of the offence, his time in custody would not be easy. She noted that this was his first time in custody.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in giving too much weight to the Victim Impact Statement.


	
	The VIS by the mother of the complainant, dated 18 December 2013, was tendered by the Crown over objection. The penultimate paragraph of the statement was rejected but the remainder was before the court. Counsel for the applicant made it clear that she was not making any concessions that the events described in the VIS had happened. The Crown pressed the tender of the balance of the VIS on the basis that it provided evidence of the impact on the family. Her Honour admitted the VIS saying:
	


“Those paragraphs do describe what the complainant or what is observed of the complainant and the impact on the family and I have regard to it only to that extent”. (18.12.2013 – T.14.46)


	
	The matter was adjourned and both the Crown and the defence provided further written submissions. In its original outline of submissions and in the further submissions, the defence submitted that there was no injury to the complainant. No submission by the Crown traversed that assertion of “no injury” or “no substantial emotional harm” as a mitigating factor under s21A(3)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Nor did the Crown make any submissions in support of the proposition that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial” as set out in s21A(2)(g) of that Act. It would, of course, have been necessary for the Crown to establish that aggravating feature beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Apart from the VIS, when her Honour came to consider the issue of harm to the complainant and her family, the evidentiary position was this. The agreed facts did not allege an injury to the complainant. There was no material by way of a psychological/psychiatric report in relation to actual or anticipated future psychological or emotional harm to the complainant. She was aged 2 years when the offence occurred and she had made no disclosure to the police. The offence had not involved any penetration and had occupied a few seconds.
	
	
	When her Honour dealt with this issue in her sentence judgment, she observed that the offending had “serious repercussions” and referred to the cases of SW and RR noting in the latter case that the very young victim had sustained significant adverse psychological consequences. Her Honour found “the same might be observed in the circumstances here although only time will tell how far-reaching the psychological consequences upon the complainant child will be”. Her Honour then set out what had been said in the VIS concluding:
	


“And clearly a child of such tender years will be affected for an ongoing period.

…

There has undoubtedly been some considerable harm done to this very young child in the commission of this offence and therefore to her family and the broader community … very serious criminal behaviour with significant ramifications for the child and the wider community.”


	
	It is accepted that a victim of child sexual abuse will usually suffer some emotional harm and that this is not a matter which the Crown is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt (DBW v R [2007] NSWCCA 236 at [39] per Spigelman CJ; R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 per Adamson J). There does, however, need to be a reasonable factual basis for conclusions such as were arrived at by her Honour in this case. The facts in SW were significantly different. There was much more serious sexual offending which occurred on numerous occasions to a much older child. In RR the victim was aged 5 and again had been subjected to significantly more serious offending over a longer time.
	
	
	As was explained by Price J (with whom Simpson and R A Hulme JJ agreed) in RP v R [2013] NSWCCA 192) there can be error where a judge attributes excessive weight to a VIS. At [27] Price J said:
	


“27   It is evident from the judge's discussions with Mr Watts and his sentencing remarks that the judge uncritically accepted LS's statement and considered the harm to be substantial. LS undoubtedly suffered harm, however, the contents of her statement went well beyond what might be regarded as the type of harm expected from the circumstances of the applicant's offending.

28   As the victim impact statement raised harm that was more deleterious than could generally be expected from the circumstances of the offence, the judge was obliged to approach the statement with caution. The harm that LS described was not supported by other evidence: In R v Berg (2004) 41 MVR 399; [2004] NSWCCA 300, Wood CJ at CL said at [48] - [49]:

""... I would sound a note of caution in relation to the proper approach to fact-finding concerning the impact of a crime upon other members of the community or, upon the victim. If that is to be achieved by way of victim impact statements, then an injustice may occur in relation to a person standing for sentence, in so far as the maker of the statement would not normally be available for cross-examination.

I add that caution in support of the general proposition that extreme care needs to be taken by those who prosecute and defend these cases, and also by trial Judges in always ensuring that there is a proper evidentiary basis for any findings of fact which go towards aggravating or mitigating a sentence.""”


	
	The circumstances of this case are to be contrasted with those discussed by the Court (Leeming JA; Johnson and Hall JJ) in R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 where the Court said:
	


“104   The sentencing Judge referred to the victim impact statement, noting that it was ""an eloquent and insightful testimony to the serious psychological consequences that these offences have had upon [the victim]"". Her Honour then stated that, without seeking in any way to trivialise or minimise the effect of the offences upon the victim, ""this is not a matter where the harm is a matter of aggravation"".

105   In so concluding, the sentencing Judge was addressing the statutory aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as to whether the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence is substantial.

106   This Court has stated that sentencing Judges are entitled to proceed on the basis that serious sexual assaults can be expected to have adverse psychological consequences and that, as a result, care needs to be taken to avoid double counting with regard to the aggravating feature of substantial emotional harm: Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183 at [61].

107   In the area of sex offences committed against young children, s.66A(2) provides for a very substantial penalty. It may be taken that a factor which contributes to the setting of this penalty (and the standard non-parole period) is the expectation that substantial harm will result to a young child victim of sex offences.

108   The victim impact statement in this case pointed to many of the adverse psychological consequences affecting an eight-year old girl who had been subjected to a course of sexual abuse by a trusted person over a period of months.

109   The exposure of an eight-year old girl to images and conduct of the type described earlier over a period of months must inevitably have a significant and long-term effect upon her. The victim impact statement made clear that a once ""bubbly, outgoing and fun loving eight-year old girl"" had become confused and apprehensive in home and school settings, with friends and others. By the time the victim impact statement was prepared on 8 March 2013, extensive psychological support had been undertaken, with the victim continuing to manifest anxiety, confusion, mistrust, shame, anger and guilt.”


	
	The weight to be given to a VIS in sentence proceedings was comprehensively examined by Simpson J (with whom Ward JA and Wilson J agreed) in R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8 where her Honour said:
	


“What do these decisions establish?

77   By s 28 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, victim impact statements are part of the landscape in the sentencing process. That is not in issue. What is here in issue is the extent to which a victim impact statement can be used to prove an aggravating factor of the kind specified in s 21A(2). Almost invariably the aggravating factor in question is that specified in s 21A(2)(g). It is to be remembered that such aggravating factors must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

…

79   Further, where the statement tends to be confirmatory of other evidence (either in a trial, or in the sentencing proceedings) or where it attests to harm of the kind that might be expected of the offence in question, there is little difficulty with acceptance of its contents.

80   Difficulties can arise, for example, where:

the facts to which the victim impact statement attests are in question; or

the credibility of the victim is in question; or

the harm which the statement asserts goes well beyond that which might ordinarily be expected of that particular offence; or

the content of the victim impact statement is the only evidence of harm.

RP is an example of the third of these.

81   In these cases, considerable caution must be exercised before the victim impact statement can be used to establish an aggravating factor to the requisite standard.”


	
	While her Honour did not in terms find that the matters in the VIS gave rise to an aggravating factor of the kind specified in s21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 her treatment of that material had the same effect. In my opinion her Honour erred in doing so.
	
	
	As her Honour accepted, the circumstances of this case were “unique and unusual”. The offending was at the bottom level of seriousness for offences of this kind. The consequences described in the VIS, both in relation to their effect on the complainant and the family, went beyond that which would normally be expected. For full weight to be given to those matters, more than an uncritical acceptance of the VIS was required. Some additional support of the kind discussed in RP v R and R v Tuala was required.
	
	
	Given the very different factual circumstances of the offending in this case, the age of complainant and the untested nature of the VIS from a person other than the complainant, I have concluded that this ground of appeal has been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in giving inadequate weight to the assistance provided to the police by the applicant in the circumstances of the case.


	
	Her Honour found in the applicant’s favour that the matter could not have been prosecuted without his assistance through his admissions to the police. Her Honour accepted that although he did not approach the police in the first instance, or acknowledge the offence immediately, he did so soon after and that this in her experience very rarely occurred. She referred to the more common scenario of offenders in child sexual abuse cases continuing to deny their offending in the face of strong evidence, thereby exposing the complainants to the trauma of giving evidence and associated problems.
	
	
	While accepting that the very young age of the complainant presented difficulties to the prosecution in adducing evidence, the Crown submitted that this did not entitle the applicant to an allowance in terms of the principle in R v Ellis [1986] 6 NSWLR 603. I agree that the facts of this case are different to those in Ellis, most particularly because they involved a question of proof rather than an offender making admissions where there was no suspicion of any offending on his or her part. In that regard, her Honour took into account the applicant’s admissions as strong proof of his genuine remorse, which supported her conclusion that his prospects of rehabilitation were very high.
	
	
	Remorse is a separate factor to assistance, and her Honour does not appear to have specifically considered the question of assistance. Accordingly, there is some force in this ground of appeal. I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case, it is not necessary to reach a final decision in relation to this ground. The issue is better taken into account when considering the third ground of appeal.
	


Ground 3 – The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case.


	
	Although the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years, the facts and circumstances of the case make it “unique and unusual”. Both the nature of the act which constituted the offending and the subjective features of the applicant support that conclusion. Her Honour found that by reference to the nature of the conduct, its duration and that it was isolated, it was at the lower end of objective seriousness. Not only was the applicant’s action unplanned, there was no sexual motivation. It constituted a one-off and brief aberration on the part of the applicant. There was no penetration. Her Honour accepted that the applicant had tried with the help of professional experts to understand why he acted in the way he did in that brief moment. The medical evidence was all one way and fully supported those conclusions. At the time of the offending he was suffering from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood or mild dementia. The latter diagnosis was supported by the MRI scan of the brain which showed widespread small vessel disease, as well as a stroke affecting the temporal and parietal lobes of the brain. This condition could have adversely affected his judgment. The medical evidence and that of the applicant (which her Honour accepted), was that this was a one-off event which would not be repeated.
	
	
	General deterrence, denunciation and the protection of the community are principles of sentencing which are relevant to cases involving child sexual abuse. The concern of the courts is to send a message to those who would sexually abuse children intentionally and repeatedly that their actions will not be tolerated and that they will receive significant punishment. In this case, the applicant’s mental condition and his inability to explain or understand his actions (which her Honour accepted) meant that general deterrence had little part to play in his punishment. Similarly, the one-off nature of the offending and the very high unlikelihood of him re-offending meant that specific deterrence and protection of the community were not significant issues.
	
	
	Denunciation, however, does remain an important principle despite the many extenuating features of the applicant’s case. It is for this reason that a custodial penalty for this offending was inevitable. There is a need to denounce the actions of those who would prey on vulnerable children and who intentionally molest them. That having been said, unlike most cases of this kind, this matter is distinguishable because of the absence of any sexual gratification element.
	
	
	A further ameliorating consideration is that custody for the applicant is more onerous because of his age, his deteriorating physical and mental health and the nature of his offence which has led to him being kept in “protection”. It was on this basis that her Honour found special circumstances in the applicant’s favour.
	
	
	The onus of establishing that a sentence is manifestly excessive is a high one and what has to be made out is that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325). By reference to the matters referred to above, however, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed on the applicant in this case was unreasonable and plainly unjust and that the sentencing discretion has miscarried.
	
	
	The factual circumstances of this case are so unusual as to render comparisons with other cases involving offences against s66A(2) of little or no assistance. As was pointed out by the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [60]:
	


“60   … But what reveals manifest excess, or inadequacy, of sentence is consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence. The references made by the Court of Criminal Appeal to the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of each offender were, therefore, important elements in the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal.”


	
	By reference to those matters, the intervention of this Court is warranted. Taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events which have occurred since the sentence hearing, I have concluded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	The sentence imposed by the District Court on the applicant on 5 March 2014 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year, commencing 5 March 2014 and expiring 4 March 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 4 March 2016.
	
	
	The applicant is to be released to parole on the expiration of the parole period.
	



	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2703855,R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143,"Judgment


	
	Tofilau v The Queen [2007] HCA 39; 231 CLR 396 was an appeal from the Victorian Court of Appeal in relation to four convictions arising from unrelated trials, each of which involved a particular form of criminal investigation. Kirby J described the method of policing known as the “scenario” technique from paragraph [118] - [119]:
	


“118.   The ‘scenario’ technique used in the cases varied from one instance to the other.  The following description accurately captures the main ingredients:

‘Typically, the covert technique begins with an apparently chance encounter between the suspect and an undercover operative posing as some sort of criminal.  A relationship is developed between the suspect and the initial contact person, and through that relationship the suspect is gradually drawn into the activities of the criminal gang to which the initial contact supposedly belongs.  As the suspect is drawn into the gang, the activities in which they are involved escalate in seriousness, going from collecting money from brothels as part of an apparent protection racket, to acting as a lookout for robberies, to involvement in a violent 'run through' of a supposed drug dealer's home.  All of this conduct is staged, all of the participants – apart from the suspect – are undercover police officers and none of the activity is in fact criminal; but the suspect is led to believe that it is.’

119.   The initial inducement for the involvement of the accused in the ‘criminal gang’ is the prospect of material gain.  However, the scenario unfolds so as to play on the suspect's fear about past criminality and his hope that the gang (or its ""boss"") will be able to fix up’ the reason for that fear:

‘At this point, the suspect will be made to believe that the formal police investigation has been re-activated: for example, the police will write to the suspect seeking a DNA sample.  The suspect will then be confronted by his contacts and warned that his past crimes could bring 'heat' onto the gang; but he will also be told that the gang can make the investigation go away.  All that the suspect has to do, he will be told, is to tell the truth; indeed, he may be harangued into doing so, or even interrogated.  The suspect may initially deny involvement, but as the pressure mounts to 'tell the truth', a confession may be made, partial at first and then in full.  At this point, the suspect will be charged, whereupon he may repeat his confession, or may revert to his previous silence, denials or version of events.  In either case, the prospects for success of any prosecution are likely to rest very heavily on the question of whether the accused's confession to the undercover operatives is admissible.’”


	
	Kirby J expressed the opinion (at [148]-[149]):
	


“148.   The following arguments of legal principle and policy tend to favour the exclusion of such evidence:

(1)   The use of such evidence, consciously collected by sworn officers of police, tends to undermine both the principle of the common law protective of a suspect's ""right to silence"" and also a basic principle of the international law of human rights to which Australia has subscribed. Such international principles can properly inform the expression of the common law of Australia, and add a new dimension, not considered in past cases, for the elaboration of the common law;

(2)   The ‘scenario technique’, by its psychological impact, has an inherent tendency to overbear the will of the target. It deprives the target of a warning about the fact that statements made may be recorded and later used against him or her, notwithstanding that he or she is in fact being interrogated by police. It also tends to deprive the target of access to a lawyer before providing incriminating confessional evidence that may prove critical at trial;

(3)   The techniques used, including deception and trickery, and the bypassing of ordinary police obligations to warn a suspect before interrogation, sit uncomfortably with the accusatorial character of criminal proceedings in Australia. In several recent decisions, this Court has insisted upon the observance of the requirements of the accusatorial trial. One of the most important of such requirements is the need to uphold both the accused's ‘right to silence’ during official investigation and his or her right to be warned about the potential consequences of self-incrimination during interrogation. The use of ‘scenario techniques’ in effect allows undercover police officers to circumvent these requirements. Yet they are requirements that those officers would be expected to observe if wearing their uniforms. In this sense, the techniques tend to undermine special features of the administration of criminal justice that comprise an important check on the power of the state and on its intrusion into the lives of all persons;

(4)   The use of ‘scenario techniques’ also has an inherent tendency to select vulnerable persons, playing on the very ‘hope’ and ‘fear’ that has traditionally been the source of the common law's insistence upon ‘great chastity’ in the reception into evidence of testimony that has been influenced by threats or promises made by persons in authority. Where the question is whether the will of an individual has been overborne, the vulnerability of the individual concerned, whether on grounds of ‘age, background [or] psychological condition’ has conventionally been treated as significant. As Brennan J repeatedly said:

‘Voluntariness is not an issue to be determined by reference to some hypothetical standard; it requires a careful assessment of the effect of the actual circumstances of a case upon the will of the particular accused.’

(5)   A particular problem with ‘scenarios’ is that they involve the suspect in conduct which shows him or her to be willing to become implicated in illegal acts, even if no real illegality actually eventuates. This of itself puts the suspect into a disadvantageous position. It does so by a type of entrapment, organised by police. It reveals the suspect in a bad light before the trial judge and jury. It makes it next to impossible for the suspect, ‘whose liberty is at stake and who stands to be condemned on the undercover officer's evidence if his credibility is unchallenged’, to make proper checks on the background of the police officers concerned and to challenge them, given that such officers ‘have necessarily led a Jekyll-and-Hyde life and ... in their undercover work have had to lie convincingly and dissimulate’;

(6)   Especially significant in this respect is the fact that the deception and trickery is performed by agents of the state who deliberately set about pretending to perform illegal and improper acts. Displacing the usual assumption that the state and its officials will always act with honesty, integrity and lawfulness, the conduct of ‘scenarios’ comprises an arguable misuse of state power by persons who are expected to behave in an impeccable manner. It involves agents of the state taking advantage of their own apparent criminality and wrong-doing;

(7)   Pessimists might view official involvement in deception, trickery and apparent criminality as a further instance of the attainment of state objectives, and in particular criminal confessions, through undesirable practices (such as torture, prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation, humiliation and psychological manipulation of suspects; and international rendition). As a matter of general principle, the extension of such practices is not to be encouraged. Ultimately, the only institutions that are likely to curb them are the courts;

(8)   Where legislation expressly authorises the employment of novel investigative techniques, individual rules will generally be stated in ways that take into account the need to restrain state officials from descending to unacceptable conduct for the purpose of securing evidence in a particular case. The fact that no such legislation has been enacted in relation to ‘scenario techniques’ should not be permitted to found an assumption that the use of such techniques is subject to no legal restraint. It is possible for the cost of obtaining relevant evidence to be too high; and

(9)   The grave nature of the crime of homicide and the affront that unsolved crimes (or those that must remain unsolved because of the exclusion of inadmissible confessional evidence) occasion do not license disregard for the basic principles of our law. In the gathering of evidence, the end rarely, if ever, justifies the deployment of any means. Were it otherwise, routine torture in the cause of gathering evidence to solve the most serious crimes might be justified, despite the affront that such conduct occasions to human dignity, as well as the danger it presents for the reliability of the resulting testimony and for the integrity of those state officials involved.

149.   Some evidence, even if arguably relevant and reliable, is excluded by the operation of legal rules because of the basic principles observed in our system of criminal justice. Those principles pervade the administration of criminal law in Australia. The securing of convictions, even in cases of unsolved homicide, must comply with the law, which reflects fundamental notions of justice and fairness. The state is a great teacher in society. If it sets debased standards for itself, there is a risk that such standards will proliferate and result in a lowering of confidence in the state and its officials and of respect for the rule of law.”

	The other six High Court justices concluded that the evidence was admissible.
	
	
	In the present case a similar technique was employed in an attempt to solve a murder that allegedly occurred in the town of Sofala, near the city of Bathurst, in 2009. In June of that year Andrew Stephen Russell went missing. Because he had committed an earlier assault on Mr Russell, suspicion attached to the accused man, Tony James Simmons. The police employed a number of orthodox policing techniques without successfully obtaining evidence that they considered capable of supporting a prosecution for the charge of murder. Rumours, hearsay and scuttlebutt—most of it inadmissible, little of it cogent—pointed to the accused as responsible for Mr Russell’s disappearance. However, there was a dearth of direct or admissible evidence against him. So it was that in around September 2012 a number of undercover police officers, acting in concert, played out more than 20 “scenarios” the objective of which was to secure a confession from the accused implicating him in the disappearance and/or murder of Mr Russell.
	
	
	More than 10 officers were involved in the covert operation. It culminated on 15–16 January 2013 in a series of inculpatory statements made by the accused. Those statements were recorded by various surveillance devices.
	
	
	The accused seeks exclusion of the evidence and submits that it would be unfair to allow the prosecution to use the evidence having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made (s 90 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)), that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (s 137) and that the desirability of admitting the evidence does not outweigh the undesirability of admitting it having regard to the illegal and improper way in which it was obtained (s 138).
	
	
	The accused submits that the evidence was obtained in contravention of the provisions of s 7 of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW). It will be necessary to return to the details of that submission, but it is clear that from September 2012, a series of surveillance device warrants were obtained from various justices of the Supreme Court. However, it is common ground that parts of two critical conversations on 9 and 15 January 2013 were not covered by any surveillance device warrant either because any such warrant had expired or because the terms of the warrant did not extend to conversations that occurred outside of a specified vehicle.
	
	
	While the accused acknowledges the decision in Tofilau v The Queen, he submits that it is distinguishable on a number of factual and legal bases and on the basis that it was a decision under the common law. It is also submitted that Tofilau v The Queen was predominately concerned with the question of voluntariness.
	


The “scenarios”


	
	I will now refer in a little more detail to the narrative of the scenarios that were played out between September 2012 and 16 January 2013. [REDACTED].
	
	
	The first contact took place on 18 September 2012 when UCO 1 arranged to be introduced to the accused. [REDACTED] and Mr Simmons expressed an interest and provided his mobile telephone number.
	
	
	On 25 September 2012 UCO 1 met the accused and enlisted his assistance in [REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	On 9 October 2012 it is alleged that the accused said to UCO 3 words to the effect of “they tried to pin me with some bloke that disappeared, they were listening to my phone and got me for supply”. As far as I can tell, that was the first occasion on which there was any reference to the police investigation into the disappearance of Mr Russell. I pause to note that the reference to the accused being arrested for supplying was one of scores of occasions during the course of the recorded conversations when the accused spoke of his involvement in criminal activities. This included his involvement in drug use and supply, his involvement in offences of significant violence, his possession of firearms as well as the fact that he had served a term of imprisonment and was on parole at the time.
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED]. That meeting involved a long car trip and throughout the course of that trip there was a lengthy, not to say tedious, conversation recorded by surveillance device. Amongst other things, the accused made comments about the disposal of bodies and in particular referred to dropping bodies down mine shafts as an effective and convenient method of disposal. He said:
	


“Fuck drop it in, in them cunt, that’s where the coppers thought I’d dropped old Bud, reckon I dropped him down mine shaft, I said boys don’t you go down the mine shaft and have a look mate”


	
	He referred to “fuckin’ old bud that went missing” and went on to say “why would I do that [i.e. drop the body in a mineshaft], wouldn’t it be easier if I dig a hole and bury him?” He questioned the police theory as to why he would go to the trouble of using a mineshaft when he could just “dig a hole and bury him”. He spoke about stories going around town that suggested he had:
	


“hacked him in pieces and fed him to the pig and fuckin’ gutted him and hung him, there is some hectic stories going around man. What the fuck?”


	
	On a great many occasions during the conversation on 6 December 2012 the accused made admissions, or boasted, as to his involvement in a variety of criminal activities including car thefts, break enter and steal and being on parole.
	
	
	On 12 December 2012 the accused, along with UCO 3, UCO 1 and others, met with UCO 9. [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 13 December 2012 a large group of the undercover officers along with the accused went on what was described as a “crabbing” trip on the Hawkesbury River. Again, a large number of comments by the accused indicated his involvement in a variety of crimes including drug supply. At least part of the purpose of this trip, and many of the earlier visits to Eastern suburbs beaches and restaurants, [REDACTED]. Beers flowed and seafood was consumed. [REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	On the 20 December 2012 [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 3 January 2013, [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 8 January 2013 [REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	In the course of recorded conversations on 9 January 2013, the accused began to speak more openly about the investigation of the 2009 disappearance of Mr Russell and his involvement in the events. The conversation started with the accused referring to what the police—wrongly, on his account—believed but it quickly became a series of admissions, initially by clumsy metaphor, to his involvement in the crime. [REDACTED].
	
	
	It will be necessary to return to the things that the accused said and the circumstances in which he said them in more detail but in general he claimed that he and a co-accused had pushed the victim off a cliff and later put the body in a mineshaft. Reference was made to the co-offender by his first name (Kieran), the car or cars used in the offence and steps that were taken to cover up the murder, such as burning the car, disposing of clothing and agreeing not to speak about the matter.
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED] but the UCOs also sought to be shown the area where the murder of Andrew Russell was committed and where his body was buried.
	
	
	The accused and UCOs searched unsuccessfully for the mineshaft where the accused claimed that he had disposed of the body. The mineshaft was never found either on that day or during the course of any subsequent investigation.
	
	
	UCO 4 was present during the attempt to find the mine shaft. After he left, UCO 1 and the accused attempted to go to the cliff where the deceased had allegedly been pushed off. This was said to be a cliff known as Wallaby Rock located above a local swimming hole on the Turon River. However en route to the cliff their motor vehicle became bogged and it was necessary to recall UCO 4 and engage the assistance of a member of the public to get the car out of the bog. They never attended the cliff face where the accused claimed to have pushed the deceased to his death.
	
	
	In the course of the lengthy conversation with UCO 1, the accused made a number of admissions as to his involvement in the disappearance and death of Mr Russell. [REDACTED].
	
	
	The culmination of the operation occurred on Monday, 16 January 2013. On that day there was a meeting between UCO 10, the accused and UCO 1. [REDACTED]. In the course of the conversation, and on direct questioning from UCO 10, the accused made a number of assertions and admissions concerning his involvement in the disappearance and murder of Andrew Russell. The deceased was named in the course of that conversation as “Andrew” and reference was made to the co-accused, namely Kieran Moore.
	


The voir dire


	
	The voir dire was conducted between 16 and 27 February 2015. On the first day of the voir dire, the Crown tendered a 13 volume brief (Ex VD 1) and indicated that I needed to familiarise myself with the entirety of volumes 6 through 11, comprising thousands of pages of transcripts of the conversations recorded between the accused and various undercover operatives. I read those volumes over the following days. After requesting some guidance from the parties, I received correspondence that “the parties agree we are not in a position to agree that all the Listening Device transcripts need not be read”.
	
	
	In the course of reading the statements, I uncovered recordings that had not been transcribed including a crucial conversation on 6 December 2012 and some apparent errors as to the identification of the speakers in a number of the conversations. In one case, a transcript of the [REDACTED] on 29 November 2012, not one of the five or six speakers was identified in the 75 page transcript. As a result, the tenor of this conversation was largely incomprehensible to me. I was assured that the various deficiencies were in the process of being remedied.
	
	
	On Friday 20 February 2015 (that is the fifth day scheduled for the trial and voir dire) the accused sought and obtained an order for short service of a subpoena seeking production of a variety of documents including (but not limited to) a number of police logs summarising telephone intercepts of the accused telephone(s) during late 2012 and early 2013. On Tuesday 24 February the Police Force appeared, represented by counsel and the NSW Crown Solicitor’s office, and objected to the subpoena on a number of bases. Eventually, the parties reached some agreement as to what was to be produced and the voir dire resumed
	
	
	As to volumes 1-5 of the brief, I was advised by the prosecution that I need only read the following documents for the purpose of the voir dire:

	The accused did not indicate whether it was necessary to read any other parts of the brief of evidence. However, I was provided with a folder entitled “admissions” which comprised parts of the brief and summaries of the critical and impugned admissions (MFI 3).
	
	
	Other relevant material included the surveillance device warrants (Ex VD 1, volume 5), a statement of the accused dated 24 July 2009 (Vol 3, Tab 142) and a statement of Detective Senior Constable Maclean dated 19 January 2014 (Vol 3, Tab 109).
	
	
	Four of the undercover police officers (UCO 1, UCO 3, UCO 4 and UCO 10) gave evidence on the voir dire as did the officer co-ordinating the covert operation (Sgt Lukacs) and the officer in charge of the investigation (Det Sgt Fawkner).
	
	
	A large map or plan of the area around Sofala was tendered (Ex VD 2) as were a list of telephone records relating to a telephone associated with the accused (Ex VD 3) and a telephone log that extracted snippets of material from calls intercepted from the accused’s telephone between 5 December 2012 and 16 January 2013 (Ex VD 4). The audio recording of 6 December 2012 (which had not previously been transcribed) was played in Court and the transcript and CD became Ex VD 5(A) and (B). Ex VD 6 was an extract from the transcript of the evidence given by a witness (Jodi Biles) at the committal hearing on 18 March 2013. Ex VD 7 was a particular extract from the telephone intercept log that showed the accused expressing a desire to purchase drugs with part of the money he had been paid following the [REDACTED] on 29 November 2012.
	


Some of the relevant legislation and case law


	
	The accused relies on ss 90, 137 and 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Those sections are in the following terms:
	


“90 Discretion to exclude admissions

In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:

(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and

(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.

137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.

138 Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 

(1) Evidence that was obtained:

(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:

(a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or

(b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:

(a) the probative value of the evidence, and

(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

(d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

(e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

(f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and

(g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

(h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.”


	
	Section 90 is a statutory reformulation of the common law discretion to exclude unfair admissions which had been considered in cases such as Cleland v The Queen [1982] HCA 67; 151 CLR 1 at 34, Duke v The Queen [1989] HCA 1; 63 ALJR 139 and Foster v The Queen [1983] HCA 80; 67 ALJR 550.
	
	
	Section 90 has been considered in a number of cases. This is clearly a case where the accused made an admission (more correctly, as the Crown points out, a number of admissions) and the evidence is sought to be adduced by the prosecution: see section 90(a). The breadth of sub-paragraph (b) has been commented upon more than once and Gleeson CJ and Hayden J said in Em v Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67 at [56]:
	


“the language in s 90 is so general that it would not be possible in any particular case to mark the full extent of its meaning.”


	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the reliability of the admissions was not a matter that could be taken into account in considering the fairness discretion created by s 90. I am unable to accept that submission. In Em v The Queen Gleeson CJ and Hayden J at [72]-[73] concluded that an initial concession by the appellant (subsequently withdrawn) that “the reliability of evidence was a factor affecting the fairness of its use” was correct.
	
	
	In The Queen v Swaffield [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159 Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ said at [76]-[78]:
	


“76.   The wider the operation given to the principle that, to be admissible, a confession must be voluntary, the less scope there is, in practice, for the exercise of the unfairness discretion. Particularly is that so in relation to improprieties calculated to cause the making of an untrue admission. It may be expected that improprieties calculated to have that effect will often impact on the exercise of a free choice to speak if that notion is given its full effect. However, it will not necessarily be so in every case.

77.   In R v Lee, the likelihood of an impropriety resulting in the making of an untrue admission was treated as ""relevant, though not necessarily decisive"". As the authorities stand, the likelihood of an unreliable confession does not mandate the exercise of the unfairness discretion to exclude that evidence. Nevertheless, it is hard to understand why, in such circumstances, the discretion would not be exercised in that way, particularly when regard is had to the consideration that the risk of an untrue admission is the rationale for the inadmissibility of a non-voluntary confessional statement.

78.   Unreliability is an important aspect of the unfairness discretion but it is not exclusive.”  


	
	Odger’s Uniform Evidence Law (11th Edition) states at [1.3.5760] “the High Court has held that it would be good reason for exercise of the common law rule if a trial judge considers that police conduct may have brought about an unreliable admission” and cites the following authorities for that proposition: Cleland v The Queen (1982) 151 CLR 1 at 34; Duke v The Queen (1989) 63 ALJR 139 at 140, 141, 144 and 147; Pollard v The Queen (1992) 176 CLR 177; Foster v The Queen [1983] HCA 80; 67 ALJR 550 at 554-557.
	
	
	On the other hand, “if the evidence is admitted, it remains open for the confessionalist to argue, and for the tribunal of fact to accept, that, even if the statement was made, it is not reliable”: Tofilau v The Queen at [53] (Gummow and Hayne JJ).
	
	
	It has been held that the probative value of the evidence has “little significance in the exercise of the discretion under section 90”: see R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 at [110], cf R v Phan [2001] NSCWWA 29; 53 NSWLR 480. Further in R v Em, Howie J considered at [113] that the seriousness of the offence was not a factor relevant to s 90. However, Gummow and Hayne JJ appeared to take a contrary view in Tofilau v The Queen at [112].
	
	
	Neither counsel appearing before me suggested that there was any relevant legal distinction between the common law unfairness discretion and the operation of s 90 in the context of the issues that arise in this case.
	
	
	The majority judgments in Tofilau v The Queen make it clear that the fact that the accused was tricked by the series of ruses and make believe scenarios enacted convincingly by the police is not a matter that renders the evidence inadmissible as relevantly unfair. While Tofilau v The Queen was decided under the common law, and while the High Court was largely concerned with considerations of voluntariness (“basal” voluntariness and otherwise), various parts of the judgment show that their Honours also turned their minds to the common law discretion to exclude evidence either because of unfairness or because of illegality and impropriety leading to a conclusion that the confession was obtained at too high a price. Such a submission had been made by one of the four appellants (Clarke). Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ rejected the submission at [413]:
	


“413.   It was reasonable for the police to seek to employ this technique, new in Australia, in carrying out their important duty to investigate an old crime. The technique was employed in a discriminating way, with considerable care being taken to avoid illegality. No doubt psychological pressure was built up, but conventional police interrogation of the most proper kind naturally involves pressure. Counsel submitted that the process was ""designed to circumvent the [appellant's] right to silence"". Clarke was in fact an experienced criminal who understood that he did not have to answer anyone's questions. He had not claimed any right to silence when interviewed by non-undercover officers soon after the murder. He actively cooperated in the questioning by the undercover officers. The questioning took place in the course of a relationship which he entered freely, and did not exploit some pre-existing or collateral relationship. The interrogation elements in the conversations were patent, and consistent with the roles which he believed the undercover officers were occupying. He had not been charged, and there was no proper basis to charge him. There was no illegality and no breach of Police Standing Orders. Part III Div 1 Subdiv 30A of the Crimes Act did not apply. The failure of other investigative methods which made it necessary to conduct the undercover operation also made it necessary for a process of active ""elicitation"" to take place. The admissions eventually obtained formed a significant part of the prosecution case. The operatives stressed the need to tell the truth. The undercover officers did not prey upon any special characteristics of Clarke related to his gender, race, age, education or health. The means of elicitation were not so disproportionate to the problem confronting the police as to be inherently unfair or contrary to public policy.”


	
	Gleeson CJ at [24] agreed with those observations. See also Gummow and Hayne JJ at [112]-[114].
	
	
	Counsel for the accused has also brought to my attention the decision of a single judge of the Queensland Supreme Court in the case of R v Cowan [2013] QSC 337. In that case, a similar “scenario” technique was used by undercover police officers attempting to obtain confessional material against the accused in relation to the disappearance of a child on the Sunshine Coast. Atkinson J borrowed liberally from the passage I have cited above from Tofilou v The Queen when he concluded at [121]:
	


“121.   No doubt psychological pressure was built up, but conventional police interrogation of the most proper kind naturally involves pressure. Cowan had experience of police questioning and knew that he was not obliged to answer questions which might incriminate himself. He had not claimed any right to silence when questioned by police in relation to this matter previously. He actively co-operated with the undercover officers. The questioning of him took place in the course of a relationship which he entered freely and did not exploit some pre-existing or collateral relationship. There was no illegality and the rules relating to questioning by covert police did not apply. The failure of other investigative methods made it necessary and desirable to conduct an undercover operation to elicit the truth from Cowan either to substantiate his involvement or exonerate him. The operatives stressed the need to tell the truth. The undercover officers did not prey on any special characteristics of Cowan related to his gender, race, age, education or health.”


	
	There are a number of features of R v Cowan that are distinguishable from the present case. Most starkly, the admissions obtained from Cowan led the police to an area where a number of human bones were located. The admissions included the disclosure of information that could only have been known to the perpetrator. As will be seen, that is not the situation here. In this case, no supporting evidence was found at the scene nominated by the accused and Senior Counsel mounts a submission that the admissions are unreliable.
	
	
	Both parties took me to the majority judgment (McColl JA and Latham J; Adams J dissenting) in Pavitt v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 88; 169 A Crim R 452. That was one of a number of cases in which the complainant in an historic sex case confronted the accused. Admissions were made and covertly recorded by the police. This is a common investigative technique in such cases and the admissibility of confessional material obtained in this way has been considered on more than one occasion. A case (or cases) in which Judge Colefax SC excluded such evidence in the District Court is to be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 3 March 2015: R v LDV (No 2) [2013] NSWDC 215; R v DF [2014] NSWDC 149. These cases are helpful but it should be observed that the two investigative techniques are quite different. In deference to the submissions of experienced counsel on both sides, I have considered the non-exhaustive list of factors said to be relevant by McColl JA and Latham J in Pavitt at [70]:
	


“70.   In our view, without being exhaustive, the following propositions relevant to the present case can be extracted from the authorities to which we have referred concerning the admissibility of covertly recorded conversations:

(a) The underlying consideration in the admissibility of covertly recorded conversations is to look at the accused's freedom to choose to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned: Swaffield (at [91]) per Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; (at [155]) per Kirby J.

(b) If that freedom is impugned, the court has a discretion to reject the evidence, the exercise of which will turn on all the circumstances which may point to unfairness to the accused if the confession is admitted: Swaffield (at [91]); a conclusion that some or all of the Broyles factors were present did not lead to the admissions being excluded in either Pavic or Carter’s cases;

(c) Even if there is no unfairness the court may consider that, having regard to the means by which the confession was elicited, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable having regard to prevailing community standards: Swaffield (at [91]).

(d) The question whether the conversation was recorded in circumstances such that it might be characterised as either unfair and/or improper include whether the accused had previously indicated that he/she refused to speak to the police;

(e) The right to silence will only be infringed where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement, and where the informer was acting as an agent of the state at the time the accused made the statement. Accordingly, two distinct inquiries are required:

(i) as a threshold question, was the evidence obtained by an agent of the state?

(ii) was the evidence elicited?

(f) A person is a state agent if the exchange between the accused and the informer would not have taken place, in the form and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or its agents: Broyles (at [30]);

(g) Absent eliciting behaviour on the part of the police, there is no violation of the accused’s right to choose whether or not to speak to the police. If the suspect speaks, it is by his or her own choice, and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform the police: Hebert;

(h) Admissions will have been elicited if the relevant parts of the conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation and if the state agent exploited any special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement; evidence of the instructions given to the state agent for the conduct of the conversation may also be important: Broyles.

(i) The fact that the conversation was covertly recorded is not, of itself, unfair or improper, at least where the recording was lawful.”


	
	In Swaffield and Pavic v The Queen [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159 the High Court considered two unrelated appeals each of which raised the operation of the common law discretions to reject confessions that had been voluntarily made but in circumstances where the accused was deceived by covert police operations. The cases were decided by reference to the question of whether the admissions were elicited in breach of the accused’s right to choose whether or not to speak: see, for example, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [97]-[98]. In Swaffield’s case, the Court held that the admissions were correctly excluded where the suspect had twice exercised his right to silence and the admissions were obtained by an undercover police officer. In Pavic, the Court held that the evidence was correctly admitted where the admissions were made to a friend acting on behalf of police and where the admissions were made in the course of a normal conversation with no flavour of an interrogation.
	
	
	In Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67 the accused told police that he would refuse to answer questions if they used audio or video recorders to record the conversation. The police later obtained warrants authorising the use of covert listening devices. The officer met the accused in a park and told him that he did not have to speak to them but failed to tell him that the conversation was being recorded and may be later used in evidence. It was held that it was not unfair to use the admissions against the accused in those circumstances. Gleeson CJ and Heydon J said at [78]:
	


“78.   When all the circumstances analysed above are considered, it is impossible to conclude that that freedom was impugned. The appellant knew he was speaking to police officers. He knew they were investigating two home invasions, one involving a murder. He knew, having been cautioned several times on 22 February and 24 April 2002, that he was not obliged to speak to the police officers. He spoke to those officers knowingly and willingly. He gave a version of events. … He had an awareness of his rights and a capacity to act on them. While s 281 compelled the detectives to record what was said if they wanted to tender it, the appellant possessed no right not to be recorded once the listening device warrants had been obtained from O'Keefe J. The appellant was free to leave. The questioning was not overbearing. As counsel for the appellant conceded, neither legislation nor the Police Commissioner's Code created any obligation on the detectives to caution him. The appellant did not know the conversation was being recorded, but he accepted that that did not make it unfair to receive the evidence. The appellant did not contend that he spoke because of any threat of violence, or any illegality, or any impropriety. He did not contend that the circumstances were likely to affect the truth of the admissions. He thought that the conversation could not be used against him in criminal proceedings, but that cannot of itself make it unfair for the conversation to be received in evidence. The detectives kept secret from him the fact that the conversation was being recorded, and hence his freedom to speak was affected in the sense that a factor that was important to him was kept secret from him. But that is true of virtually all cases of lawfully authorised secret surveillance.”


	
	Gummow and Hayne JJ analysed the operation of s 90 at [107]-[112] and concluded at [116]:
	


“116.   The appellant's argument, shorn of expressions like ‘trick’ and ‘trickery’, amounted to the propositions that what the police did, by interviewing the appellant as they did, was to be condemned, and that he had been misled into saying something that could be used in evidence against him. Neither of these propositions, whether taken separately or together, established that use at his trial of the evidence of what he said to police would be unfair.”


	
	As I have said, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the unreliability of the admissions is not relevant under s 90. He went on to submit that reliability “rather should be a consideration, if at all, under s 137”. There is some tension between that submission and a number of decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	The extent to which questions of credibility and reliability of evidence might be relevant to the discretion to exclude evidence under s 137 (where the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice) is controversial. There is direct conflict between the authorities in this state and decisions of the Court of Appeal in Victoria. In Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328 a five member bench of the Victorian Court of Appeal recognised that it should only decline to follow the New South Wales authority of R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 if it was satisfied that it was “plainly wrong”. The Court concluded at [226] that R v Shamouil was:
	


“226. Contrary to a long line of established authority and to considered dicta of the High Court concerning the common law. That conclusion does not give effect to the plain language of the statute, the context or the extrinsic material, which reveal a legislative intention that trial judges should continue to have the power to exclude admissible evidence in order to minimise the risk of wrongful conviction. The effect of the decision in Shamouil is to undermine an important safeguard which the common law provided against an unfair trial and which the legislatures intended should be replicated in the Evidence statutes.”


	
	Their Honour’s were aware that R v Shamouil had been followed in Tasmania (J v Tasmania [2011] TASCCA 7) but found themselves at [228] “compelled to the conclusion that we should depart from the reasoning and conclusion in Shamouil”.
	
	
	In R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121 the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal considered the conflict in the authorities and sat a bench of five to do so.
	
	
	Basten JA decided at [65] that there was “no compelling reason to depart from the general approach accepted in Shamouil”. His Honour was of the view that “it was doubtful as to how far Dupas departed from the principles stated in Shamouil, read in context”.
	
	
	On the other hand, Simpson J considered that the two decisions were “in sharp conflict” (at [97]). At [160]-[161] her Honour set out the position of the two courts:
	


“160.   What this Court said Shamouil was:

""60 The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach.

...

64 To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in Doney v The Queen [[1990] HCA 51] [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible 'basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function'. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s 137.""

161.   What the Victorian Court of Appeal said in Dupas was encapsulated in para [63], set out below:

""For the following reasons, we are compelled to the view that Shamouil and the other decisions that have applied it are manifestly wrong and should not be followed. We are compelled to the conclusion that we should depart from the reasoning and conclusion in Shamouil as error can be demonstrated with a degree of clarity by the application of the correct legal analysis ... Our conclusions are as follows:

(a) The common law did require the trial judge, in assessing probative value, to evaluate the weight that the jury could rationally attach to the evidence. The contrary conclusion was inconsistent with a continuous line of High Court authority.

(b) The legislative intention, as disclosed by the language of s 137 and its context, is that the task under s 137 is the same as that at common law.

(c) The trial judge undertaking the balancing task is only obliged to assume that the jury will accept the evidence to be truthful but is not required to make an assumption that its reliability will be accepted. The phrase 'taken at its highest' is more appropriately used in considering a no case submission, when the judge must accept that the jury may find the evidence credible and reliable.

(d) In order to determine the capacity of the evidence rationally to affect the determination of a fact in issue, the judge is required to make some assessment of the weight that the jury could, acting reasonably, give to that evidence. Where it is contended that the quality or frailties of the evidence would result in the jury attaching more weight to the evidence than it deserved, the trial judge is obliged to assess the extent of the risk. That does not require the trial judge to anticipate the weight that the jury would or will attach to it. The judge is obliged to assess what probative value the jury could assign to the evidence, against which must be balanced the risk that the jury will give the evidence disproportionate weight.

(e) So to construe s 137 accords with the language of the statute and its context. To construe it otherwise does not.

(f) Such a construction does not involve any enlargement of the powers of a trial judge or any encroachment upon the traditional jury function.""

[The emphasis was included by Simpson J]


	
	Her Honour referred to her earlier judgments in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52, R v Mundine [2008] NSWCCA 55, R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338 and her concurrence in R v Shamouil itself. Her Honour adhered to her earlier stated views.
	
	
	Hoeben CJ at CL said (at [86]-[89]):
	


“86. In relation to s137 of the Evidence Act 1995, subject to the following observations, I agree with Basten JA and Simpson J that when assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, the Court should not consider its credibility, reliability or weight. I specifically adopt what was said by Basten JA at [66] - [67].

87. Accordingly, I agree that the Courts of NSW should follow R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 when applying s137 of the Evidence Act 1995.

88. Where I differ from their Honours is as follows. When assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, i.e., its capacity to support the prosecution case, a court can take into account the fact of competing inferences which might be available on the evidence, as distinct from determining which inference or inferences should be or are most likely to be preferred. It was that to which the court was referring in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 at [10] (Bathurst CJ); [11] (Allsop P) and [78] (Whealy JA).

89. Here, as Basten JA, Blanch and Price JJ have pointed out, there were alternative inferences available which were inconsistent with the prosecution case and which were objectively plausible. That is a matter which can properly be taken into account when carrying out the balancing exercise required by s137 to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.”


	
	Blanch J provided a helpful summary of the authorities at [189]-[204] without ever referring to the decision in Dupas. At [201]-[202] Blanch J noted with apparent approval the approach taken by Bathurst CJ and Whealey JA in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 at [201]-[203]:
	


“201.   In assessing the probative value of evidence in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 Bathurst CJ said at [10]:

""However, as Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78]-[81]), the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered.""

(Allsop P agreed with that comment at [11]).

202.   At [78] Whealy JA said:

""... the trial Judge must ask whether the possibility of such an alternative explanation substantially alters his (or her) view as to the significant capacity of the Crown evidence, if accepted, to establish the fact in issue. Does the alternative possibility, in the Judge's view, rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown's case? If it does not, the trial judge may safely conclude that the evidence has significant probative value.""

203.   The judgment of Whealy JA was endorsed by Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CJ and McCallum J.”


	
	Price J said at [224] that it was unnecessary to consider the conflict in the authorities but said at [225]:
	


“225.   In my opinion, the approach taken in Dupas does much to avoid evidence being before a jury which in reality (rather than being taken at its highest in favour of the Crown) has little probative value and is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.”


	
	In R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335 Simpson J observed that DSJ v R was decided under s 98 of the Evidence Act (and not s 101 or s 137) and held at [181] that it “does not necessarily follow that the identical approach must be taken with respect to contentious evidence where objection is taken under s 137”. Her Honour noted at [183] the three steps required by s 137 and at [184] held that the “exercise required by s 98 is different”. As to the decision in XY, Simpson J decided at [194]:
	


“194.   Accordingly, by a majority (Basten JA, Hoeben CJ at CL and myself, Blanch J not expressly deciding, Price J contra) the Court decided that trial judges in NSW should continue to disregard questions of credibility, reliability and weight in dealing with the admission of evidence challenged under s 137. However, Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J further considered that the existence of ""competing inferences"" (or alternative interpretations) was relevant to the assessment of probative value.


	
	It was on the basis of the views expressed by Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J that the primary Judge based his ruling. Simpson J held that this was wrong and the decision was overturned. Her Honour concluded the discussion on s 137 as follows at [196]-[197]:
	


“196.   I am unable to accept that the existence of ""competing inferences"" available to be drawn from (or alternative interpretations of) the proposed prosecution evidence has any part to play in the assessment of probative value for the purpose of s 137 of the Evidence Act. That is because of the different exercise required by (for example) s 98, and s 137. Section 98 requires an assessment of the significance of the probative value of the evidence tendered as coincidence evidence in the context of the whole of the case of the tendering party. That is why, in DSJ, it was held that the existence of alternative explanations could have a bearing on the significance of the probative value of the evidence.

197.   Section 137 requires assessment of the probative value of the evidence without regard to other evidence in the Crown case (s 137 applies only to evidence tendered by the prosecution) but balanced against the danger of any unfair prejudice.”


	
	RA Hulme J and Barr AJ agreed with Simpson J.
	
	
	Neither counsel before me made any submission on the conflict between the decisions in Victoria and NSW. Nor was I taken in any detail to the authorities on s 137 and the extent to which reliability and credibility have a role to play. In the course of the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions (T 219), Mr Young SC brought the following passage from Shamouil (at [63]) to my attention:
	


“63.   There will be circumstances, as envisaged by Simpson J in Cook supra, where issues of credibility or reliability are such that it is possible for a court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. In that limited sense McHugh J’s observations in Papakosmas that “considerations of reliability are necessarily involved.”


	
	A former High Court judge has expressed the opinion that the Victorian Court of Appeal was wrong in Dupas but that the question of whether “probative value” has a different meaning depending on which section of the Evidence Act is under consideration remains open. See the article JD Heydon, 2014 Paul Byrne SC Memorial Lecture, “Is the Weight of Evidence Material to its Admissibility?”
	
	
	In light of the judgments of Hoeben JA, Blanch and Price JJ in XY, the position in New South Wales is unclear. What is clear is that the reliability of evidence will only be taken into account under s 137 in limited and restricted circumstances. Those are where the evidence is so unreliable that it would not be “open” for a jury acting reasonably to use it in the way contended by the Crown. Whether the existence of “competing inferences” that may rob the evidence of its capacity rationally to assist the Crown case is a consideration remains controversial in view of the judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J in XY. However, I feel that I am bound to apply the later (and unanimous) decision in R v Burton regardless of any misgivings that I have arising out of the various views expressed in XY.
	
	
	It is against that overview of the legal landscape that I turn to consider the admissions, the circumstances in which they were made and the issue of the danger of unfair prejudice.
	


The admissions and the circumstances in which they were made


	
	As in most cases, the scenario technique in this case was used because conventional forms of policing had failed to solve the disappearance of Mr Russell. That the case was “cold” was highlighted by some of the things that Mr Simmons said to the undercover police. For example, on 9 January 2013 he told UCO 1 that the “coppers were fucking hopeless” and “I even laughed at the cunts” (Tab 267 p 55). On 15 January 2013 he said the coppers were digging in the wrong place and that “they’re bananas man, they got no idea” (T 272 p 155-156).
	
	
	On 9 October 2012 the accused told UCO 3 about the police investigation when he said “they tried to pin me with some bloke that disappeared, they were listening to my phone and got me for supply”. This was an important moment because it was the first time that the topic of Mr Russell’s disappearance arose. However, no admission was made. The accused simply made reference to the fact that he had been the subject of police suspicions. Counsel indicated that this conversation was not electronically recorded by surveillance device or otherwise. However, no challenge was made to its content.
	
	
	On 6 December 2012, while driving to Newcastle, one of the UCOs made a comment about hiding bodies under highway constructions. This prompted the accused to make comments about the number of mineshafts in the area around Bathurst and Sofala and to refer to the police suspicion that he had “dropped [Old Bud] down a mineshaft”. Again, no admissions were made on this occasion. The conversation was concerned with the police suspicions and the accused’s response to those suspicions. He questioned why he would do such a thing when it would be easier “to dig a hole and bury him”. However, the conversation showed that the accused was becoming more comfortable in talking about the subject.
	
	
	Counsel agreed that there was no conversation between 9 October 2012 and 6 December 2012 on the subject matter. Similarly, counsel agreed that there was no relevant conversation between 6 December 2012 and 9 January 2013.
	


9 January 2013


	
	By 9 January 2013, [REDACTED]. It was in that context that the accused made the first of the admissions upon which the prosecution relies.
	
	
	UCO 1 (P1) was complimenting the accused (V1) for “staying calm” and the accused said “I’m usually good with that shit, bro. Fuckin’ cunts always go missing around my area”. The conversation continued (Ex VD 1, Tab 267, pp 30-32)
	


“P.1   Yeah, so fuckin' he just wanted to make sure, man, you know what I mean?

V.1   Yeah. Yeah.

P.1   I said, No, he's sweet. But that's good.

V.1   Yeah.

P.1   So man, from me, like, I fuckin' respect the fact that you fuckin' stayed calm and you're fuckin’ all good with that, you know what I mean?

V.1   Yeah. I'm usually good with that shit, bro.

P.1   Yeah.

V.1   Fuckin’ cunts always go missin' around my area.

P.1   Yeah.

V.1   Yeah. That's…locked up for, bro, not fuckin' for that but they tapped my phone thinkin' about, that I knocked this cunt, made him disappear but they got me for drugs instead….

P.1   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

V.1    But….supposed to be urn, about me missus and shit, too, so, gave him a touch up, put him in hospital for a couple of weeks —

P.1    Yeah.

V.1   — and then a couple of weeks after   got out of hospital he sort of went

missin'. I never….seen him….one day they'll find, one day they'll find

him but I doubt it.

P.1    You doubt it.

V.1   I doubt it. He went on holiday.

P.1   Gone on a holiday for good.

V.1   Yeah. Vacation.

P.1   What happened then?

V.1   No, he's just a fuckin' little gronk, bro, fuckin' tried to get me charged and shit, me missus took the wrap for me, bro, fuckin' that's when I bashed him and shit I fucked him up.

P.1   Yeah. Yeah.

V.1   Broke both his eye sockets, his jaw, his nose, his arm, all his ribs, his

ankle.

P.1   Fuck.

P.1   Hold on a sec.

P.3   How you goin'?”


	
	It will be seen that the accused went from speaking about what the police suspected to making admissions as to what he actually did. The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of UCO 9 but as soon as she left, UCO 1 asked about “what were you sayin’ bro, before?” The whole content of what was said is recorded over around thirty pages of transcript. It included:
	



	
	Reference to his animosity to the victim who was “walking around town like he’s fuckin’ Mr It”.
	
	
	Reference to the earlier assault and to the fact that the accused’s girlfriend took responsibility for that assault.
	
	
	“We took him and pushed him off a cliff”.
	
	
	“We had to go down and carry the cunt back up, bro, because it was fucken steep …. Hey yeah, dropped him down a mineshaft.”
	
	
	An assertion that they used a stolen car to drive to the cliff and dump the body and later burnt it out .
	
	
	Statements that his mate (referred to as Kieran) was “staunch” and “hasn’t said nothin’ yet”.
	
	
	An admission that they used Kieran’s car to “grab the cunt” with a plan to “bash the cunt”.
	
	
	The suggestion that the victim “started crying” and was taken to Kieran’s mum’s house.
	
	
	Reference to the victim by name (Andrew Russell).
	



	
	UCO 1 asked if the killing was planned and the accused said that it was not and continued (pp 70-72)
	


“V.1   Just sort of got real …one night… got on… from Sydney to Bathurst,

goin' across the bridge, bro, I seen the cunt walkin' across the bridge, pull up…bro, Keiran… fuckin'… rah rah rah….

P.1   That's it, man. It's good that you boys fuckin' stayed staunch with each

15 January 2013


	
	On 15 January 2013, the accused was with UCO 1 in the Sofala area and showed him where he claimed to have dumped Mr Russell’s body in a mineshaft. He repeated many of the admissions that he had made on 9 January 2013 and expanded upon them. He said that he looked for a wallet on the deceased, explaining “already done the damage, might as well rob the cunt too”. He said that it was pitch black on the night. He said that they had dropped the deceased’s shoes, went back and got them and then threw them down the mineshaft as well.
	
	
	Importantly, from the point of view of the accused’s submissions that the admissions are not reliable, he said that these things occurred on 22 June 2009. The Crown case is that it occurred on 2 June 2009.
	
	
	The accused again said that his mate (Kieran) was “solid” but had a drug habit. He said that the police had questioned him two years earlier but that he and Kieran had covered their tracks by burning their clothes and shoes as well as torching the car that was used.
	


16 January 2013


	
	On 16 January 2013 the accused met UCO 10 in a hotel room in Sydney. [REDACTED].
	
	
	The accused proceeded to supply UCO 10 with a lengthy account of his relationship with “Andrew” including the earlier assault and the fact that his girlfriend took responsibility for the assault which had left the victim with significant injuries. Once “Andrew” got out of hospital “he was walking around like this, high and mighty shit”. He said that what occurred was not planned and he repeated, confirmed and expanded upon many parts of the admissions that he had made on 9 and 15 January 2013. The admissions included:
	



	
	Reference to the deceased as “Andrew”.
	
	
	Reference to it being “the same fellow I bashed and put in hospital”.
	
	
	The fact that the incident took place in June of 2009.
	
	
	Reference to his “co-ey” being Kieran Moore.
	
	
	“We were coming back from Sydney … and we seen him. I said to me mate, I said, Oh, blow … this cunt and we’re on the bridge …. And I told him to pull over. And he stopped. I said, Oh,l somthin’ come up I said I was talking to him, I was sayin’, Oh come for a drive, and I’m sayin’ to me mate, We should just grab him, eh? He goes, Yeah all right. And I think my mate thought I was just jokin’ to start with too, but anyway, so I ended up grabbing him, draggin’ him and putting’ him in the car.”
	
	
	It happened at about 2 o’clock in the morning. He later said it was at about 1 o’clock.
	
	
	“I said to my mate, let’s just get rid of him, you know what I mean”.
	
	
	They went to Kieran’s mum’s place and then “switched him into the other car and took him out to the, out to Sofala”.
	
	
	He said they took him to the cliff and told him to jump or be pushed and “we both sort of pushed him off, you know what I mean.”
	
	
	He thought somebody might find him and that “we can’t leave him there. Someone will find him and we’re fucked.”
	
	
	They recovered the body which took “like 2 hours to get down there”.
	
	
	He said “I know where a couple of big holes are, mine shafts. There’s heaps of mine shafts out there, [Sofala] is an old gold, gold mining town.”
	
	
	He described the area as Wattle Flat on the Red Hill Road.
	
	
	He said they put the deceased in one of those mine shafts. He said they lost his shoes and then went back and found them and put them in the hole with the deceased.
	
	
	He said they burnt their clothes and shoes – “we got rid of everything”.
	
	
	He said “nothing happened for a while” but then it was on the news describing that Andrew Russell had been reported missing.
	
	
	In answer to direct questions he said “he was dead” and he was “fucked” although he had not checked for a pulse.
	
	
	He said he probably picked him up at 1 o’clock in the morning and it was not finished until 5:30.
	
	
	He claimed that he set the car on fire.
	
	
	He said that he tried to steal from the corpse but “he didn’t have nothing. He was a bum. Not even a watch”.
	
	
	He said it was “freezing” in Bathurst in June.
	
	
	He said it was dark but claimed he had “pretty good eyesight in the dark” and that his eyes adjusted.
	
	
	He said he was 110% sure of the location although he had not been out there since. He knew the area as a kid.
	
	
	He claimed that the car that was used was stolen from Esram Street and identified it as a “brown VT” [Holden] and that he burnt it using petrol that happened to be in the back seat.
	
	
	He claimed to have thrown his own clothes into the fire and walked back to his mother’s house, cutting across a field. He said it was cold but that he had “adrenalin goin’ through my body.”
	
	
	He said he was spoken to by the police who had shown an interest in his “little white Excel” motor car. He had provided the police with an alibi of sorts, saying that he was with his mistress.
	
	
	He provided a history of his relationship with Kieran, saying that they started school together and were pretty close.
	
	
	He said there was no plan to pick him up and that it “started off as a game”.
	
	
	He spoke of rumours that had gone around town.
	
	
	He described the reason for the animosity prior to the first assault as being the fact that the deceased had Hep C and had spat on the accused’s girlfriend
	



	
	At the conclusion of the account, UCO 10 asked if any parts of the story might not have been correct and the accused said “the story’s 100%”.
	


Reliability of the admissions


	
	Senior Counsel for the accused pointed to a number of aspects of these accounts that he says are either fanciful or unable to be reconciled with the known facts. The Crown Prosecutor (in argument) and the officer in charge of the investigation (in cross-examination) acknowledged that there are some difficulties surrounding the versions of events provided by the accused. Sgt Fawkner was not prepared to say that the version is anything more likely than “possible” while the Crown Prosecutor says that the reliability of the admissions is a question for the jury and that the jury would be entitled to act on parts of what the accused said while rejecting other parts.
	
	
	Matters referred to by Mr Young SC as impacting on the reliability of the admissions include:
	



	
	On 15 January 2013 the accused said that he committed the crime on 22 June 2009. The prosecution case is that the deceased went missing on 2 June 2009 and was last seen (at least by a reliable source) on that date. There is some evidence to suggest that he was seen after that date. The prosecution presents an indictment with a spread of dates from the 2 to 20 June 2009. The accused’s admissions as to committing the crime on 22 June 2009 fall outside of those dates and his nomination of 22 June 2009 is inconsistent with apparently reliable evidence of when the alleged victim went missing.
	
	
	While the accused said he was “110%” certain that he took the police to the location where he disposed of the body in a mineshaft, a thorough search of the area provided no evidence that there was a mineshaft - let alone human remains - in the area. This is in stark contrast with the circumstances that prevailed in cases like Cowan and Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952 where the reliability of the admissions obtained by similar means was enhanced by the fact that human remains were discovered at a location nominated by the accused to the undercover investigators.
	
	
	It is difficult to understand, on what is known of the geography and topography of the area, precisely how the accused got to the top of Wallaby Rocks, particularly at night. The police investigation in this regard is rather deficient. The Officer in Charge has never returned to the area to investigate the logistics of what the accused described. The descriptions given in evidence on the voir dire are difficult to understand.
	
	
	Some of the details of the precise content of the admissions made on the 15th and 16th of January 2013 strain credulity. The account of recovering the body, possibly from a water hole and then burying it, in the middle of the night and in the time frame allowed is hard to fathom or accept.
	
	
	Similarly, the image of the two accused retreating to their homes dressed in nothing but their underwear in the dead of winter is more comical than it is convincing.
	
	
	There is no evidence supporting the assertion that the accused stole a car and that he later torched it. On the contrary, there are no relevant reports of a stolen vehicle at the time. Detective Fawkner’s explanation of this (that sometimes people don’t report the theft and burning out of their own cars) was unconvincing. His evidence that the car nominated by the accused was a green VT Commodore and that this matched the description of a car owned by the co-accused made little sense for two reasons. First, the colour of the car nominated was brown, not green. Secondly, there is uncontested evidence that the co-accused disposed of his car some weeks or months later. I consider that the absence of any report of a stolen car at the relevant time and place is unexplained. Of course, it is possible that somebody would not report a stolen vehicle or that the report was not found.
	



	
	Senior Counsel also pointed to the accused’s drug use as bearing upon reliability. He relied on the contents of Ex VD 4 and the evidence of Jodi Biles given at the committal hearing (Ex VD 6). It is submitted that the accused’s need for money to buy drugs made him more likely to “confabulate” and to provide a false account to the members of the group in order to obtain money for drugs.
	
	
	The Crown will present a different case to the jury in relation to the co-accused, Kieran Moore. If the accused’s account is accepted, Kieran Moore is guilty as a principal in the second degree or on the basis of joint criminal enterprise. On Mr Simmons’ admissions, Moore was present and played a role in either inviting the deceased to jump from a cliff or assisted in pushing him. He was actively involved in abducting the deceased and in taking him to the cliff. If the admissions made by Mr Simmons on 15 and 16 January were true, there is no basis upon which Mr Moore is not guilty of murder. Of course the legal explanation for the Crown’s different position may simply be that admissions made by Mr Simmons are not admissible against Mr Moore.
	
	
	Finally, the details of admissions made to other people are not consistent with the version provided in the course of the covert investigation.
	
	
	The Crown did not submit that I should disregard the evidence that suggests that the admissions may be unreliable or that I should focus entirely on the “circumstances in which the admissions were made”. Rather, the Crown’s submission was that the reliability of the confessions was not a matter to be considered under s 90 at all. On the other hand, the Crown submitted that reliability was a matter to be considered under s 137. I have already referred in some detail to the authorities on the question of when, and in what circumstances, it is appropriate to consider the reliability of evidence in exercising the discretions created by ss 90 and 137.
	
	
	As I understand it, the real thrust of the Crown’s submission is two-fold. First, it was submitted that the reliability of the admissions is a question for the jury to determine. Secondly, there are matters that point to the reliability of some parts of the statements made by the accused to the undercover police officers. In particular:
	



	
	The accused’s account of the location where he picked up the victim (the bridge on the Sydney Road outside Bathurst) fits with a statement provided by a witness (Michael O’Neill). Mr O’Neill noticed a man in that area in the middle of the Highway on the night of 2 June 2009 near the intersection with Littlebourne Street, Kelso. He thought it was dangerous and stopped and spoke to the man. He was later shown a photograph of Andrew Russell and was sure that it was the same person. Detective Maclean gave evidence (T 265-266) that suggests that the intersection referred to by Mr O’Neill is 1 km from the bridge described by the accused.
	
	
	The accused referred to his co-accused and the missing man by name.
	
	
	The accused nominated the month and year that Mr Russell went missing.
	
	
	The accused’s description of the police investigation and what he told the police accorded in certain respects to what actually happened in the weeks and months following Mr Russell’s disappearance.
	
	
	The accused accurately told the UCOs the nature of the dispute with Mr Russell, details of the earlier assault and the fact that his girlfriend took primary responsibility for that assault.
	
	
	There are also a number of witnesses who will assert that the accused made statements to them that are consistent with him having some role in the disappearance and murder of Mr Russell. While these are not consistent with the method of killing described by the accused, they may support the Crown case that the accused is responsible for the disappearance and death of Mr Russell.
	


Unlawfulness – the warrants


	
	The senior police who were running this operation were plainly conscious of the need to obtain warrants pursuant to Part 3 of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW). A failure to do so would result in the commission of a crime. Section 7 of the Surveillance Devices Act provides:
	


“7. Prohibition on installation, use and maintenance of listening devices

(1) A person must not knowingly install, use or cause to be used or maintain a listening device:

(a) to overhear, record, monitor or listen to a private conversation to which the person is not a party, or

(b) to record a private conversation to which the person is a party.

Maximum penalty: 500 penalty units (in the case of a corporation) or 100 penalty units or 5 years imprisonment, or both (in any other case).”


	
	Volume 5 of the brief of evidence (Ex VD 1, Tab 154) contains a number of warrants issued by judges of this Court pursuant to ss 16-19 of the Act. These included a warrant (SD 12/0663) authorising the use of listening devices “on or about the person” of UCO 1 and UCO 3. It also included a warrant (SD 12/0829) authorising the installation and use of a listening device “on or in” the motor car used by UCO 1 on 9 and 15 January 2013.
	
	
	However, the warrant relating to the motor car did not authorise the recording of conversations that took place away from the car unless that conversation was picked up by the device installed on or in the car. Further, the warrant relating to devices worn by UCO 1 and UCO 3 expired on 7 January 2013.
	
	
	This means that listening devices worn by UCO 1 and UCO 3 on 9 and 15 January 2013 were not authorised by warrant. From his statements (Ex VD 1, Tabs 263 and 268) it appears that UCO 1 recorded conversations by listening devices on each of those days. Accordingly, it seems that offences carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment were committed on each of those days.
	
	
	It does not appear to be disputed that most, if not all, of the conversation on 15 January 2013 was recorded on two devices; one worn by UCO 1 and one installed in the car. The latter recording is lawful; the former is not. I was informed (and accept) that the major transcript before me (Ex VD 1, Tab 272, 278 pages) was lawfully recorded using the device installed in the car. A second transcript behind Tab 272 (51 pages) was recorded unlawfully on the device worn by UCO 1. As I understand it, the Crown does not (or need not) press for the admissibility of the recording made by UCO 1.
	
	
	The situation is more complicated in relation to the conversation recorded on 9 January 2013. The transcript before me (Ex VD 1, Tab 267, 91 pages) was recorded by the device worn by UCO 1. This evidence was obtained unlawfully. I am told (and I accept) that there is a second recording made by the in-car device. However a significant, although not lengthy, portion of the transcript (T pp 55-76) occurred away from the car. That portion of the recording was obtained unlawfully. It includes reference to the torching of the car and the location and circumstances in which the victim was picked up.
	
	
	In terms of the application of s 138 of the Evidence Act, the only evidence caught by the section is evidence that was “obtained improperly or in contravention [of the law]”. This means that the direct application of s 138 applies to that part of the conversation recorded on 9 January 2013 outside of the car. The balance of the evidence (recorded under the warrant pertaining to the device in the car) was not obtained unlawfully even though UCO 1 may have been committing an offence under s 7 of the Surveillance Devices Act at the time. (I say “may” because he could have an arguable defence of honest and reasonable mistake. I accept that he believed that the warrant was valid and remained in force. Whether that provides him with a defence is a difficult question: see Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; 218 CLR 493).
	


Feeding the accused’s drug habit


	
	The evidence in Ex VD 4 is unsatisfactory. It provides minute snippets or summaries of conversations upon which the accused mounts a submission that at the relevant time he had a significant drug habit. The material appears to have been produced in response to a subpoena issued on the scheduled third day of the trial. Why the material had not been sought earlier and why it is not in any adequate form is not a matter with which I need concern myself.
	
	
	The committal evidence of Jodi Biles (Ex VD 6) however provides solid grounds for the submission that the accused was using ice (methylamphetamine) around the time that he made the impugned admission.
	
	
	It is common ground that that the accused was receiving money from the UCOs as payment for his time and efforts during the period of the operation. The following payments were made:
	



	
	25 September    $100
	
	
	3 October 2012    $100
	
	
	9 October 2012    $200
	
	
	15 October 2012    $200
	
	
	17 October 2012    $300
	
	
	22 October 2012    $50
	
	
	1 November 2012    $300
	
	
	8 November 2012    $80 and $200
	
	
	15 November 2012    $400
	
	
	20 November 2012    $350; $360 (for clothing)
	
	
	28 November 2012    $50
	
	
	29 November 2012    $2000
	
	
	4 December 2012    $300
	
	
	6 December 2012    $300
	
	
	12 December 2012    $200
	
	
	13 December 2012    $110
	
	
	18 December 2012    $400
	
	
	24 December 2012    $1000
	
	
	3 January 2013    $400
	
	
	8 January 2013    $50
	
	
	9 January 2013    $400; $20 [REDACTED]
	



	
	Ex VD 7 (part of the log of intercepted calls) shows that on 29 November the accused called Jodi and told her he had received $2,000 and asked her to organise 1 gram for him. He also called his mother and said he would put $400-$500 into her bank account.
	
	
	Each of the UCOs denied in cross-examination that they observed any conduct on the part of the accused consistent with drug abuse or addiction. Nothing in the transcripts of the conversations with the UCOs suggests that the accused was unable to function or was withdrawing from drugs and I have not been asked to listen to any of the conversation with an eye to that issue. Mr Young SC acknowledges that he cannot rely on a submission that the accused was under the influence of drugs at the time of the conversations.
	
	
	I accept that the contents of Ex VD 4 and VD 7 read as a whole, and the evidence given by Ms Biles at the committal, support a finding that the accused was using drugs frequently throughout the period of the covert operation. I find that it is more likely than not that he used at least some of the money provided by the police to buy the drugs he was using. Whether the UCOs knew of his drug use is difficult to determine but given that his telephone was being intercepted at the relevant time, I am prepared to accept that they ought to have known and been alive to the risk that the money they were providing him may have been used to purchase drugs.
	


Crimes committed in the course of the operation


	
	The Crown contends that no crime was actually committed in the course of the operation. Rather, all of the crimes were staged. Senior Counsel for the accused concedes that no actual crimes were committed.
	
	
	I have some doubts about the correctness of that concession. For example, it seems to me that the accused may have committed a number of inchoate crimes although interesting issues of impossibility may arise: see, for instance, R v Barbouttis (1995) 37 NSWLR 256; R v McCoy [2001] NSWCCA 255. Further, it is difficult to see how the accused did not commit offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) [REDACTED].
	
	
	However, in view of the stance taken by the accused and the fact that Senior Counsel has made no submission that the accused was incited to commit any actual criminal offences, it is unnecessary to consider this matter further.
	
	
	I would only observe that where police are proposing to sail this close to the wind, consideration might be given to having the operation sanctioned pursuant to the provisions of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW). I express no final view as to the matter and note that it is an observation contrary to the stated position of the very experienced Crown Prosecutor who appears in the trial.
	


Application of section 90


	
	The question at the heart of the accused’s application under s 90 is whether it would be unfair to use the evidence having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made: s 90(b) Evidence Act. I have set out those circumstances in some detail and will not repeat them.
	
	
	Mr Young SC contends that the critical issue is whether the police “elicited” the admissions. He relied on the judgment in Pavitt v The Queen and the matters set out by McColl JA and Latham J at [70]. I have set these out above. As I have said, I am not completely convinced of the legal analogy between a case where an alleged victim approaches the suspect and one where police officers perpetrate a ruse in order to obtain a confession by trickery and subterfuge. In the former case, a live question is whether the complainant has become, or is acting as, an agent of the state. In a case such as the present, there is no doubt that the UCOs were acting as agents of the state.
	
	
	On one level, an operation of this kind is calculated and designed quite specifically to “elicit” a confession. However, the form that the elicitation might take will vary from one case to the next. As the Crown pointed out, this is not a case involving one confession but a number. The form that the elicitation takes is different in each instance and must be considered separately.
	
	
	I have listened to the recording of the conversation on 6 December 2012 (Ex VD 5) when the accused referred to the mineshafts in his area that might be used to “drop anything down”. He made no admission but his statement forms a significant part of the narrative. I have no doubt that the UCO brought up the topic of hiding bodies under the highway construction work for the particular purpose of prompting the accused to say something unguarded about where he might have disposed of the body of Mr Russell. However, to do so does not make it unfair to use what Mr Simmons said in response. He was free to speak or to remain silent. The statements he made were not elicited in the relevant sense.
	
	
	The conversation on 9 January 2013 (Ex VD 1, Tab 267) arose in the light of [REDACTED]. Again, the introduction of that scenario was plainly designed to prompt the accused to say something about the disappearance of Mr Russell. But the statements he made on that day were not unfairly elicited or prompted by anything that the UCO said to him. Further, the transition from comments about what the police believed to the actual assertion that he gave Mr Russell a “permanent vacation” was done freely and with very little input from the UCO. He was not encouraged to say anything. My reading of the transcript is that the UCO was surprised that the accused started talking when he did. The moment was unscripted and unplanned. This is confirmed by the fact that the conversation was then interrupted by the arrival of UCO 9. It is true that UCO 1 immediately, and not very subtly, returned to the topic once UCO 9 left, but he did so in non-leading way (“what were you sayin’ bro, before”?). These admissions were not elicited in an unfair or improper way.
	
	
	I am of the same opinion of the conversation on 15 January 2013. The accused was put in a location that was likely to prompt him to say something but nothing in the conduct of the officers importuned him to say anything.
	
	
	I have more difficulty in relation to the conversation on 16 January 2013 with UCO 10. That conversation, to adopt the terms of Pavitt v The Queen, was the “the functional equivalent of an interrogation”. However, at no stage in this conversation, or any earlier conversation, did the police officers importune the accused to tell a particular story or to change his account. This was not a case where the accused denied involvement but was encouraged to “tell the truth” in circumstances where that implied changing his version of events. No special characteristics of the accused were used against him and he was free to speak or to be silent. Again, to adopt the words of Pavitt at [70] and Swaffield v the Queen at [86], the accused chose to run the risk that UCO 10 might report the conversation to police. While the conversation on 16 January 2013 was elicited in one relevant sense (that is, it was the functional equivalent of an interrogation), neither that determination nor the check-list in Pavitt, can be permitted to supplant the terms of s 90. The true question remains whether it would be unfair to use the evidence given in those circumstances.
	
	
	One of the criteria referred to by McColl JA and Latham J was whether the accused had previously exercised his right to silence when spoken to by the police. An attempt was made to sidestep this issue by indicating that while the accused had made a statement, he had not made any admissions. In my view, that is a different thing. Senior Counsel could point to no occasion when the accused had told police that he did not want to speak to them. On 24 July 2009, the accused signed a statement (Ex VD 1, vol 3, Tab 142) in which he provided a reasonably detailed account of his relationship with Mr Russell, the reasons for the earlier fight, the “fact” that he had only struck him once and when he returned Mr Russell had suffered further injury. He said that he had last seen Mr Russell on 25 May 2009 at Court. He said that he could “not really say” where he was on and around 2 June 2009 but observed that it was just before his birthday. On 16 March 2012, Detective Maclean spoke to the accused at the Wellington Gaol. He answered questions about another matter and “indicated that he would be prepared to be interviewed again about the disappearance of Andrew Russell upon his release from custody” (Ex VD 1, Tab 109). He said he was reluctant to speak about the matter while he was in custody. That statement was not challenged on the voir dire. There is no evidence that the accused ever asserted his right to silence at any time prior to his arrest at the conclusion of the police operation.
	
	
	The final matter is the reliability of the admissions. Contrary to the Crown submissions, I am of the view that if the evidence clearly establishes that the police provoked or elicited a false confession, the circumstances may be such that it is unfair to use the material in the trial. I have considered carefully the matters raised by Mr Young SC concerning the reliability of the admissions. I have concluded that, while some parts of the admissions may well be unreliable, a properly instructed jury might discriminate and accept parts of the admissions made by the accused. It seems to me to be a case where the reliability of the confessions is ultimately a question for the tribunal of fact rather than a matter that compels the exclusion of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence establishes that the police elicited a false confession.
	
	
	I have also considered, under s 90, the persistence and deception of the police in pursuing this course and the fact that the accused received payments, part of which may have been used to fund a drug habit.
	
	
	In the final analysis, the onus is on the accused and I am unable to conclude that the circumstances in which the admissions were made make it unfair for the admissions to be used against the accused at his trial.
	


Section 138


	
	I have detailed above the various matters that might give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence that is obtained improperly or in contravention of the law. At least part of the recorded conversation on 9 January 2015 was obtained unlawfully because it was not the subject of any valid warrant. I also consider the failure of the police to consider whether the accused may have been funding his drug habit with the money they were giving him to be conduct properly categorised as improper.
	
	
	Finally, I take into account the fact that the accused was incited to participate in activities that were represented as criminal and, in some cases, that he may have actually committed inchoate offences. However, the accused has not taken that latter point and, whatever be the true legal position, it is undoubtedly true that the police were careful in trying to ensure that no crime was completed. The case is far removed from the circumstances that prevailed in cases such as Dowe v R [2009] NSWCCA 23 and Gedeon v R [2013] NSWCCA 257.
	
	
	Once it is accepted that there was some illegality or impropriety, the onus shifts to the prosecution to establish that “the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that was obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.” Guiding that inquiry is the non-exhaustive list of factors referred to in sub-s (2) and (3) of s 138.
	
	
	The evidence, if accepted, has substantial probative value: s 138(3)(a). In view of the weaknesses in other parts of the Crown case, the evidence is important: s 138(3)(b). The serious nature of the offence militates in favour of its admission: s 138(3)(c) and see R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284 per Spigelman CJ at [5]-[7] with whom Blanch J agreed, contra Simpson J at [97]; R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 364 at [54].
	
	
	Contrary to the submission of the Crown, I find that the impropriety is quite grave: s 138(3)(d). The rights to silence and to privacy are important parts of a functioning democracy and free and civilised society. Where safeguards such as the Surveillance Devices Act are enacted, law enforcement officers must be fastidious in ensuring that they are complied with. The failure of the officers to consider whether the money they were providing was being used to purchase drugs was a significant and grave oversight.
	
	
	As to whether the contravention was reckless or intentional, I am firmly of the view that the failure to seek an extension of the warrant or to obtain a fresh warrant was an oversight. This is better described as negligent rather than reckless. The history of applications to the Court shows that the operation was generally covered by valid warrant. I accept the evidence given by UCO 1 that he would not have used the device had he known that the warrant was not valid or had expired.
	
	
	On the other hand, the failure of the officers to consider the accused’s drug use and the possibility that the money that they were giving him was being spent on drugs was a reckless impropriety. At the same time as the operation was taking place in Sydney, police were intercepting the accused’s telephone calls. Communication between the officers would, or ought to have, disclosed the risk that the undercover police were unwittingly feeding the accused’s use of illegal drugs.
	
	
	Neither counsel made any submission as to the terms of the International Covenant or the remaining matters to be considered under s 138.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, I have concluded that the Crown has established that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence in view of the way it was obtained. I am particularly persuaded by the importance of the evidence, its probative value and the fact that this is an unsolved homicide case.
	


Prejudicial material and s 137


	
	The material tendered on the voir dire contains a vast amount of material which, if admitted before a jury, would give rise to enormous prejudice to the accused’s right and capacity to receive a fair trial. That material comes in a variety of forms. First, there is the participation by the accused in the various scenarios played out in the course of the covert police operation. Secondly, in the course of the conversations with the undercover officers, the accused made many admissions (or boasts) about his past involvement in a variety of criminal offences. Third, the tenor of much of the conversation is offensive and suggestive of a person of bad character.
	
	
	I note that the accused have indicated (“formally” yesterday) that they intend to seek leave under s 132A Criminal Procedure Act to make an application for Judge alone trial under s 132. The Crown is yet to indicate its position on the application and the question of leave is a live one. The application is yet to be dealt with and it is appropriate to deal with the s 137 submission on the basis that the trial will be by jury.
	
	
	As my summary of the scenario evidence shows, the police enticed the accused into the commission of a wide variety of pretend criminal offences. His willingness to involve himself in these crimes does him no credit and is likely to cause a jury to consider him to be a person of bad character with a propensity towards the commission of a vast array of offences. Without being exhaustive, the malfeasance and criminal behaviour in which the accused was prepared to participate included:–
	



	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].

	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	
	
	[REDACTED].
	



	
	At no stage did the accused show any reluctance to engage himself in this or any other criminal activity that the UCOs might suggest. At one stage he said to UCO 10 “I'm always keen, you know what I mean, like. And, yeah, I'll do anything, pretty much”. His actions in the course of the covert operation show this to be an accurate reflection of his attitude towards the criminal law.
	
	
	The second area of prejudicial material arises from his admissions to his involvement in other criminal offences. These included: –
	



	
	The possession of firearms.
	
	
	Offences of violence, including offences of significant cruelty.
	
	
	Drug distribution and trafficking.
	
	
	Drug use.
	
	
	Successful perversion of the course of justice (having Jodi Biles take responsibility for the earlier assault).
	



	
	The conversations are also riddled with references to the fact that the accused had served time in prison and was currently on parole.
	
	
	On 8 November 2012 he said of himself:
	


“I was a real criminal like, not a crim just fucken’ I was just a bad cunt”.


	
	In addition to references about his criminal past, the conversations also suggest that the accused is a person of bad character with offensive, sexist and racist attitudes. I need not go to specific examples of this but they are plentiful. Any vaguely sensitive person listening to the material is likely to be left with the distinct impression that Mr Simmons was a person of bad character.
	
	
	In his notice of motion seeking exclusion of the evidence, one of the bases of the accused’s objection is that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value (s 137 Evidence Act). Whatever the probative value of the admissions ultimately obtained, my tentative view was that the overall flavour of the material and the prejudice that flowed from it was incapable of being cured by direction.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the accused suggested in submissions that the evidence could not be severed. However, on the final day of the voir dire, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he did not “need” all of the recorded conversations. He indicated that he had discussed the matter with Mr Young SC and that if some or all of the evidence of admissions was ruled to be admissible, counsel would probably be able to reach agreement as to the remaining parts of the conversations that could go before the jury. In doing so, they would take into account the preliminary views I have expressed as to the prejudicial nature of much of that material.
	
	
	I would certainly not have allowed vast amounts of the surveillance device recordings to go before the jury. In my opinion no direction would be capable of curing the prejudice that would be occasioned by the jury hearing these recordings. This approach is consistent with the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Donai v R [2011] NSWCCA 173 where he referred to “the collateral prejudice” and concluded at [64]:
	


“64.   Whether or not the jury believed everything the appellant said to the police to be true the evidence irretrievably prejudiced the appellant when the jury came to assess his denial of any involvement in the killings or disposition of the bodies as against the evidence that he was involved. Weightman's evidence in relation to the appellant made his conviction likely. The picture of the appellant reflected in his conversations with police made his conviction inevitable.”


	
	I can indicate my preliminary opinion that most of the evidence of previous criminal activities (admitted [REDACTED]) should not be led. [REDACTED].
	
	
	However, if the admissions (or some of them) are admitted, it will still be necessary for the jury to be aware that that the underlying theme of the covert operation [REDACTED]. In addition to that, the conversations containing the admissions are riddled with comments that suggest that the accused is callous and uncaring. By way of example, the comment about robbing the victim after he was dead and that he was a “bum”. [REDACTED].
	
	
	This means that, in spite of the concession by the Crown to extract large portions of the material, there will remain a real danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	Further, if the admissions go before the jury, the accused will need to make difficult forensic choices in relation to what parts of the evidence he requires to ensure that the jury understands his defence. I expect that the defence will be that the things he said to the police were unreliable, untrue and the result of him big noting himself in front of the members of the group. To establish this he will have to cross-examine his way through a minefield of potentially prejudicial material. Again, this creates a danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	Of course, against that, the accused is represented by highly experienced and talented Senior Counsel and the jury will receive careful directions on the issue.
	
	
	In undertaking the balancing exercise under s 137 I find myself bound to disregard matters going to the reliability of the admissions: R v Burton (supra). On that basis, the probative value of the evidence is very high. In my judgment the probative value assessed in that way is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	


Conclusion


	
	For those reasons, my ruling is that the relevant parts of the conversation recorded on 6 December 2012 and the admissions made by the accused on 9, 15 and 16 January 2013 are admissible.
	
	
	I direct the parties to liaise with one another in an effort to reach agreement as to the form and content of the remaining parts of the evidence recorded by surveillance device. That direction will apply whether the trial is to be by jury or by Judge sitting alone.
	
	
	The un-redacted version of this judgment is to be available to judicial officers, their staff and legal practitioners as a restricted judgment on the Judicial Information Research System (JIRS) in accordance with the protocols established by the Judicial Commission.

2703857,Sakr v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (No. 2) [2015] NSWDC 34,"Judgment


	
	The defendant has asked for reasons for my refusal to strike out the word “willingly” in imputation 4(a), on the basis of objections as to capacity and form. Imputation 4(a) is currently pleaded as follows:
	


“She willingly backs a brutal regime in Syria, which is led by a war criminal and has committed gross violations of human rights.”


	
	As to capacity, Mr Molomby SC submits that the whole tenor of the matter complained of is to the effect that the plaintiff was an active, indeed ardent, supporter of the regime, rather than doing so reluctantly or out of concern for the safety of family members. She was “a leading light” in Hands Off Syria, “one of the loudest voices” at one rally and the organiser of another, posting clips on YouTube and taking part in delegations. The sting of the libel was that she was supporting the regime willingly, not because she had to do so in order to see her father again.
	
	
	Mr Lewis submitted, as to capacity, that the imputation could not be conveyed because it was strained and unreasonable.
	
	
	Words such as “willingly” perform an important function in encapsulating the defamatory sting. “Willingly” in fact has a long history of use in imputations: Jackson v TCN Channel 9 Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1229 at [1]; Jackson v TCN Channel 9 Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 108; Kenny v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2014] NSWSC 190 at [23], citing Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1995] 2 AC 65. In Hynde v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 633 at [23] – [33] McCallum J held, in relation to a contextual imputation the plaintiff “was willing” to lend money to persons whom he believed were drug dealers was capable of arising (the imputation was struck out because it was not capable of arising at the same time as the plaintiff’s imputations). No submission was made that it was defective in form.
	
	
	Capacity determination is “an exercise in generosity not parsimony” (Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[138]). On that test, given the portions of the matter complained of referred to by Mr Molomby SC, the plaintiff has no difficulty in establishing that the matter complained of conveys an imputation of her willing support for the Assad regime.
	
	
	Mr Lewis also submitted that the word “willingly” was defective in form as it was ambiguous.
	
	
	As to form, Simpson J in Griffith v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2002] NSWSC 86 at [104] declined to strike out an imputation that the plaintiff “willingly” allowed himself to be used as the face for an organisation he knew to be dangerous, although the form objection appears to have been principally aimed at the word “dangerous” (see also Packer v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 940 at [28], where “willing to” is referred to with apparent approval).
	
	
	Mr Lewis did not identify the ambiguity beyond indicating that the defendant did not know the case to meet if justification was pleaded. The truth of the portions of the publication identified by Mr Molomby SC as supporting capacity would be matters which, if appropriately particularised, be of relevance. The defendant is not, of course, limited to the matter complained of in this regard.
	
	
	I note the well-known maxim in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 137 that practical justice rather than philology should prevail in relation to the form of imputations. However, the practice of asserting words long accepted by the courts as having a clear English meaning are, for some unspecified reason, ambiguous in meaning and therefore not permissible in an imputation, has no basis in philology.
	


ORDERS


	
	Pursuant to rr 14.28 and 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), strike out imputation 4(a) but grant leave to replead “the brutal Assad regime in Syria” in lieu of “a brutal regime in Syria”.
	
	
	Strike out the word “deliberately” from imputation 4(d).
	
	
	Grant leave to the plaintiff to file a Third Amended Statement of Claim in 7 days incorporating these amendments and the amendments agreed to by the plaintiff as set out in the draft “Second Amended Statement of Claim” handed up in court today.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs.
	
	
	Note – Plaintiff does not require reasons for this ruling, but Mr Lewis requires reasons for the word “willingly” in imputation 4(a), pursuant to rr 14.28 and 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The defendant to file Defence in 28 days thereafter.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions to Thursday 16 April 2015 at 9:30am.

		16 April 2015",2015-02-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703859,R v Colin Maxwell FARROW (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 109,"JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: Colin Maxwell Farrow (the accused) is charged that on 11 April 2013 he murdered Linda Stevens. The accused applied for a trial by judge alone, which, despite the non-agreement of the prosecutor, was ordered: see R v Farrow [2014] NSWSC 1781.
	
	
	It is necessary to deliver a verdict, being a finding that could have been made by a jury, and including in it the principles of law I have applied and the findings of fact that form the basis for the verdict.
	
	
	Apart from the duty of the Crown to prove guilt of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, the accused also raises insanity as a defence and, as a consequence, the accused is required to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he is not guilty by reason of mental illness.
	


Procedural Issues


	
	While the consequences of a special or other verdict should not and do not affect the outcome or result, it is necessary to explain those consequences. If the Court were to find the accused guilty (of either murder or manslaughter) it is almost certain that the Court would impose a sentence of imprisonment. If the Court were to find the accused not guilty, he would be released. If the Court were to reach a verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, the Court would need to determine whether neither his safety nor that of the community would be seriously put at risk by his release and, if such a determination were made in his favour, the Court would release him either unconditionally or on condition.
	
	
	If, on the other hand, the Court were not satisfied that the accused should be released at this time, the Court would issue orders, the effect of which would be that the accused would be detained in custody until he is released by due process of law, that is, until the Mental Health Review Tribunal orders his release on the ground that it is satisfied that neither the accused nor any other member of the public would be seriously endangered by his release. Release in those circumstances may be unconditional or on conditions.
	
	
	The Mental Health Review Tribunal is comprised of a President or Deputy President, each of whom must be a current or former judicial officer or qualified for appointment as a judicial officer, together with two other members, a psychiatrist or psychologist, and another member with suitable qualifications or expertise. The regime and its consequences are well-known and require no further explanation.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the lack of controversy in relation to most of the evidence, it is necessary that I remind myself that there is a presumption of innocence and a right to silence. Other than on the issue of mental illness, the accused bears no onus. He is presumed innocent and it is for the Crown, and the Crown alone, to prove the elements of the offence of murder and to do so beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Further, the failure of the accused to give or call evidence (beyond that which is contained in the ERISP) is not, and cannot be, used to make up for any lack of evidence that would or might satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt.
	
	
	Lastly, in terms of preliminary comments, I refer to the relevance of drugs in this case. The fact that the accused is a drug user is, of itself, irrelevant. So also is the fact that the deceased was a user of drugs and dealer in drugs. The relevance of those facts to the accused and deceased is that it explains, at least in part, their relationship and is relevant to a possible motive suggested by the Crown.
	
	
	Otherwise, the drug evidence of use and supply are irrelevant except that some of the witnesses are, or were at the relevant time, drug users, which may affect witnesses’ perception of events and time and I warn myself that, as a consequence, their testimony may be unreliable. The drugs sold by the deceased and used by her and by the accused was “ice” or crystal methamphetamines. Cannabis (or pot) was also consumed.
	
	
	Further to the foregoing, the fact that the accused was a drug user is not used and cannot be used to reason that he, on that account, was more likely to commit the crime with which he is charged. The mere fact that the accused was involved in drugs, of itself and without more, does not lead and is not probative of the proposition that the accused may have committed a murder.
	


I add, lest it be thought otherwise, the Crown does not suggest any such use for that fact.


	
	Moreover, the accused’s addiction to drugs cannot be used to reason that the accused has a bad character and is therefore more likely to have committed a crime and, as a consequence, more likely to have committed this alleged crime, namely, murder. Such reasoning is unfair and impermissible. The same prohibition applies to the use of the accused’s history as a thief.
	


Events Prior to 11 April 2013


	
	Between July and October 2012, the accused was introduced to the deceased by Victoria Cade, who initially would attend at the deceased’s premises with the accused to buy and to use drugs. Later, the accused attended either unaccompanied, or in the company of others.
	
	
	In or about February 2013, the accused attended the deceased’s premises with Wayne Rogers. The deceased sold drugs to Mr Rogers on credit, but refused to sell drugs to the accused on credit.
	
	
	At or about the same time, the accused moved into his premises at Wentworth Street, Port Kembla.
	
	
	The accused had what he perceived to be a “falling out” with Victoria Cade, who remained a good friend of the deceased.
	
	
	On 2 April 2013, the deceased sent a text message to the accused in or to the effect that if he, were to continue “to be like that, don’t come back”.
	
	
	On 6 or 9 April 2013, the accused met Katrina Cade, Victoria’s mother, while she was having morning coffee. He expressed the view to Katrina Cade that he was upset at his “falling out with Victoria”.
	
	
	On 9 April 2013, the accused purchased a number of items:
	



	
	At 11.19am, the accused bought rope, pliers, superglue and a sharpening stone from VNH Dollar Shop on Crown Street, Wollongong;
	
	
	At 12.18pm, the accused bought gaffe tape and electrical tape from the Reject Shop at Westfield in Warrawong;
	
	
	At 12.30pm, the accused attempted to withdraw money from an ATM in Cowper Street, Warrawong.
	



	
	On or about 5.45pm on 9 April 2013, Victoria Cade sent a text message to the accused asking him not to contact her anymore.
	
	
	At around lunchtime on 10 April 2013, Victoria Cade went to the deceased’s premises and bought drugs. When she attended at the premises, the deceased and Kerry Iles were there. Victoria Cade told the deceased and Kerry Iles of her “falling out” with the accused and that Victoria Cade had requested the accused to delete her contact details from his mobile.
	
	
	In response to the above information, the deceased informed Victoria Cade that the accused had been at her premises earlier in the morning, when the deceased was not home. The deceased remarked that the accused “should have waited”. Apparently, the accused did not obtain drugs on 10 April 2013, at least not from the deceased.
	
	
	On or about 5.15pm on 10 April 2013, in Cowper Street, Warrawong, the accused again attempted to withdraw money from an ATM. At 10pm that night, at Crown Street, Wollongong, the accused attempted for a third time to withdraw money from an ATM.
	


11 April 2013


	
	On 11 April 2013 between 8.45am and 8.50am, the deceased was driving her child to school. A witness, Melissa-Anne Cruickshank, saw her. There is no evidence of what other tasks, if any, the deceased performed that morning or whether she stayed at school for a long or short time.
	
	
	On the morning of 11 April 2013, at approximately 9.30am, the accused left the railway station at Wollongong, walked along Crown Street turning north along Dennison Street in the direction of Throsby Drive and towards the deceased’s unit. It takes about 10-15 minutes to walk from the station to the deceased’s unit.
	
	
	At 10.43am, the accused was seen by a witness, Hannah Bereyne, in the vicinity of the deceased’s unit. The accused was in Bligh Street, with a “backpack over his left shoulder” and “looked like he had no emotion in his face…walking quite fast and…very determined to get somewhere”.
	
	
	Sometime shortly before 11.43am on 11 April 2013, Kachina Bereyne knocked on the door of the deceased’s unit but there was no response. She heard what she considered was movement inside the premises, including what she thought was someone searching through the tool box. At the time, the deceased’s car was in her garage and the garage door was open. Kachina Bereyne returned home (her unit is upstairs from the deceased’s premises) and sent the deceased a text message. The message was sent at 11.43am. Ms Bereyne received no reply.
	
	
	Shortly after Ms Bereyne sent the above text, Victoria Cade arrived at Ms Bereyne’s premises. Ms Cade had sought to visit the deceased, had also heard noises from inside the premises, received no response to her knocking and came upstairs to see what was happening. Ms Cade had also tried to contact the deceased by phone, but there was no response.
	
	
	Victoria Cade’s evidence was that these events occurred between 10.30am and 11.00am on 11 April. There is a minor inconsistency in timing. The only reliable independent evidence is the telephone record of the message sent at 11.43am. For some reason, no record of Victoria Cade’s attempt at telephone contact was adduced. It may be that Ms Bereyne’s recollection of the relative timing may be inaccurate. On the other hand, Ms Cade’s timing may be wrong. The difference, ultimately, is not of great significance.
	
	
	At 2.22pm on 11 April 2013, the accused purchased a pick and shovel at Bunnings. The CCTV footage shows the accused in seemingly different clothes to those worn by him in the morning.
	
	
	At 2.40pm on 11 April 2013, the accused was driving the deceased’s car. Witnesses observed him driving in a most erratic manner. The front tyre had blown, the tyre had disintegrated and the wheel rim was gouging the road. Further, the accused drove the car, “sideswiping” or colliding with parked cars and did not stop.
	
	
	At 2.45pm, a witness observed the accused driving in a north direction along Foothill Road, Corrimal when the car mounted the kerb, proceeded down a grass hill and came to a halt just before a creek. The accused alighted the car and walked up the hill, carrying a backpack and wheeling a purple and black suitcase.
	
	
	Between 3.00pm and 3.30pm, the accused went to Darren Leatham’s home and borrowed his bicycle in exchange for drugs. The accused then had possession of more drugs than he could have used in the short term.
	
	
	The accused’s erratic driving had caused a number of otherwise independent people to call the police, who located the car, identified the address of the registered owner and attended at her premises.
	
	
	In the meantime, at about 4pm on 11 April 2013, Kerry Iles went to the deceased’s apartment and did not receive a response to her knocking. Ms Iles left a note under the deceased’s door. Ms Iles noticed blood on the floor of the stairs. The deceased had not collected her child from school.
	
	
	When police attended the deceased’s premises, they too noticed blood on the stairs and were told that the deceased had not collected her child from school. The police gained entry to the premises and observed what looked like blood inside and outside the unit.
	
	
	The police returned to the deceased’s car and discovered her body in the boot of the car with what seemed like, and were later identified as, stab wounds. The police thereupon established a crime scene around the car and at the deceased’s premises. The accused’s mobile telephone was found in the deceased’s car, as was the pick and shovel purchased by him earlier that day.
	
	
	The accused’s body was bound with duct tape and rope identical to that purchased by the accused on 9 April. An “Aldi” bag was found behind the driver’s seat. The bag had the accused’s palm print, in blood, on it. The accused’s palm print was also on the shovel (as one would expect if it were the same shovel purchased earlier).
	
	
	The accused’s finger prints or palm prints were located in the car, at and around the steering wheel and elsewhere, including the console, on the rear passenger window (driver’s side) and the internal rear vision mirror.
	
	
	The accused’s palm print was found on the outside of the door to the deceased’s premises and a partial match of the accused’s shoe print was also found nearby. The palm print cannot be used to add to the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown as there would have been many occasions, unrelated to the deceased’s death, when a print may have been deposited. One must also be careful in using the shoe print in support of the Crown case. It too may have a reasonable explanation consistent with events other than a murder. It has some weight if taken with other circumstantial evidence, but given its lack of probative value and its potential prejudice to the accused, I propose to ignore the shoe print in either reasoning to guilt or to explain the conduct of the accused.
	
	
	The medical and scientific evidence establishes that the deceased died from multiple knife wounds and was killed on her bed in her premises. She suffered a number of blunt force injuries, at least some of which were defensive, to the back of the hands, and to the arms and legs. There was also a blunt force injury to the back of her head.
	
	
	The most significant wounds were three of the knife wounds: one to the chest and one to each side of the neck. Any one of those three wounds could have caused death. The combination certainly caused death. The force of the wound to the chest was substantial, piercing the sternum (the breastbone), the heart and entering the lung cavity. It seems that the force of the blow caused the bruising around the wound.
	
	
	The wound to the left side of the neck, just below the ear, severed the internal jugular vein and the wound to the other side of the neck, severely damaged the larynx, the right jugular vein and the common carotid artery. The wounds caused severe bleeding.
	
	
	There was a pool of blood on the bed and some minor smearing of blood or spots of blood in a few other locations in the deceased’s premises.
	
	
	Despite his apparent lack of memory of any real events occurring after arrival at the deceased’s premises, the accused claimed to have had visions of looking in a mirror and seeing blood stains being sprayed on him and “side-swiping” a car. After the death occurred, the accused had in his possession an abundance of drugs beyond his immediate personal needs, money and the deceased’s jewellery.
	
	
	The evidence leaves me in no doubt that the accused killed the deceased between approximately 10.45am and 2.22pm on 11 April 2013, with a knife inflicting numerous wounds that caused death and also inflicting one or more blunt force injuries.
	
	
	I am also certain that the accused cleaned most of the deceased’s premises, bundled the deceased’s body into bed linen and placed her body in the boot of the car.
	
	
	The severity of the wounds and their number establishes that he inflicted them with an intention to kill or, at least, an intention to cause really serious injury. The accused, according to each of the psychiatric experts who gave evidence, understood the nature and quality of his acts and he understood that he was inflicting the injuries and that they would cause death. I will return to the psychiatric evidence in dealing with the mental illness defence raised by him, although separation of the issues can be somewhat artificial.
	
	
	As can be seen from the foregoing, I have concluded that the Crown has proved, leaving aside the defence of mental illness for the time being, the elements of this murder. The Crown has satisfied me, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused stabbed the deceased on 11 April 2013 and that the act of the accused was deliberate, caused the death of the accused, and was inflicted with an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	For those unfamiliar with the foregoing phraseology, I recite that that the term ‘deliberate’ is not synonymous with ‘planned’ or ‘intended’. An involuntary act, such as a reflex action, is not deliberate because it is a spontaneous and unintended reflex action, and therefore not willed by the accused. It is the act that must be voluntary and willed, not the consequences.
	
	
	Further, ‘intention’ in the phrase ‘intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm’ must be the subjective intention of the accused (in this case inferred, at least in part, from the conduct) and is to be differentiated from the notion of a deliberate act, or premeditation, or lack of regret at the eventual result.
	
	
	As can be seen from the evidence I have referred to, in concluding that all of the elements of murder to be proved by the Crown have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, I have had no regard to the accused’s handwritten notes, found by police on his premises. Nor have I, thus far, had regard to the conduct of the accused after 11 April 2013 (except for his explanation in the Electronically Recorded Interview (ERISP)). Further, I have accepted the explanation or version of events given by the accused as to his state of mind and lack of memory as not disproved by the Crown. Nevertheless, the explanation does not exculpate the accused or, in other words, the accused’s version of events, even if accurate, is not inconsistent with proof of the elements of murder to the actual standard.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the handwritten notes and the conduct of the accused after 11 April 2013 are relevant to the defence of mental illness and I will now set out my findings on those matters.
	


The Handwritten Notes


	
	Police found a series of handwritten notes in the accused’s premises. I shall not recite the full contents, but will refer to some. The notes are found in the evidence in a number of exhibits. In original form, they are Exhibits GG, HH, JJ, KK, LL, MM and NN. Photographs (or copies) of some of these notes form part of other exhibits. The police showed the accused photographs of some of the pages during his interview (See ERISP, Exhibit G, and Photographs, Exhibit H).
	
	
	Photographs 28 and 29 of Exhibit H contain a list of equipment and the advantages and disadvantages seemingly related to three different persons. The list of items (Photograph 28) includes bumbag, mask, “gaffer” tape, pliers, knife, gloves, garbage bags, hacksaw and blades, 5lb hammer, “spade/entrenching tool”, bottle of ammonia. The list also includes other items that seem to have been added later, being, batons, “mini blow torch”, scarification tools and claw hammer. It is not clear whether the reference to scarification tools was a reference to tools for gardening or maintenance or to something else. (The better location of a legible copy of the note is in Exhibit QQ Tab 86, Photograph 141 of 224).
	
	
	Importantly, the note ends with the following comment: “Be THOROUGH; Be METHODICAL; And most of all BE CAREFUL”. It is a reasonable inference that the list was for equipment to be used in a criminal venture, particularly when taken with other notes. However, it is as consistent with a robbery as it is with a murder.
	
	
	The qualification to the foregoing is the reference to the knife and the bottle of ammonia, but it is reasonably possible that the list (and those two items) were wholly innocent. Of interest in the notes is that the accused distinguishes between “Equipment” and “Tools”. The contents of the note recited above is under a heading “Travel Pack”.
	
	
	Under the heading “Equipment” in other notes, the accused refers to similar goods and also includes axe, sledgehammer, parachute cord, rope, rucksack or large back pack and fishing line (Exhibit QQ, Tab 86, Photograph 151 of 224). The notebook containing the page, the contents of which are recited at [55] and [56], is a notebook entitled “Plans” (the Plans Notebook).
	
	
	The accused also draws a distinction between “toiletries”, “equipment”, “tools” and “things for home” (see Exhibit QQ, Tab 86, Photographs 147 of 224 and following).
	
	
	The Plans Notebook also contains another relevant page (Exhibit QQ, Tab 86, Photograph 140 of 224). It is divided by two hand drawn lines horizontally across the page. The bottom of the page contains the notation “K? Le? Ly?”. Each of the three sections of the page above that notation deals respectively with “K”, “Le” and “Ly”. It is, in part, in the following terms:
	


“If Ly has drugs, has car, but there are time constraints.”


	
	Each of the three sections of the notebook page deals plainly with a different person’s premises. The premises of “K” has alcohol, allows time and is secluded. The premises of “Le” is near the police station, hard “to get in”, but allows time to be taken.
	
	
	The notebooks are in the accused’s handwriting. An expert so testified. The accused accepted these notes were his during the ERISP (at least in relation to the Plans Notebook) and I accept it as his handwriting.
	
	
	The Crown sought to use the notebooks as proof of planning of the murder or, at least, of a robbery of the deceased. In order to do that, the Crown would need to prove, in my view, beyond reasonable doubt, that “Ly” referred to the deceased. In his ERISP, the accused rejected that proposition by referring to the correct spelling of the deceased’s first name as “Linda”, not “Lynda”.
	
	
	There is a reasonable hypothesis open inconsistent with “Ly” in the Plans Notebook being a reference to the deceased and I do not accept the Crown’s use of the evidence for that purpose. On the other hand, the accused must prove his mental illness of the balance of probabilities. I will return to that issue later in this judgment. It should be noted that the “K”, “Le” and “Ly” note is the last page of the notebook and the list is on the back of that page. It looks as if the accused has commenced writing from the back of the book. It follows that it is likely the “K”, “Le” and “Ly” note were written first and the list was written for that purpose.
	
	
	Exhibit GG is relevant to the accused’s explanation as to why “Ly” is not a reference to the deceased. Exhibit GG is another notebook. There are many. Each of the notebooks were found in the accused’s premises. He has only lived there for about 10 weeks. While the accused could have written the notebooks before he commenced living in those premises, he would then have been required to bring them with him, rendering the notes of continuing relevance to him. Some of those notes are necessarily of recent origin. Exhibit GG is in that category. It consists of two pages of writing.
	
	
	The first page of Exhibit GG refers to “Thursday night” and in a later entry on that page refers to the falling out with Victoria to which reference has already been made in these reasons. The evidence discloses only one such falling out, which, given the reaction of Victoria Cade and the accused to each other before, after and during her evidence, has been resolved (She blew the accused a kiss and wished him well.)
	
	
	The next (and only other) page of Exhibit GG is a list of payments or budget items. The list contains a series of entries with corresponding amounts, all of which seem to be subtracted from a total of $540. None of it is particularly relevant except that there is a reference to the name “Lynda” with an amount of $10.00 and to the name “Linda” with an amount of $100.00. There is also an amount seemingly for “Pot” of $50.00. The total of the specified amounts is $385.00 and there is a reference to a need to account for $120, not allocated to a name or an item, and “Tickets” for $5.00, totalling $510.00 (i.e. within budget).
	
	
	There is no evidence that the accused knew more than one person with a first name pronounced Lynda. The deceased’s first name was spelt with an ‘i', as Linda. Further, the list seems to bear the hallmarks of an attempt (or an original but altered intention) to add $100 to the $10 originally allocated for “Lynda”, which is the amount noted alongside the name “Linda”, spelt as the deceased spelt her first name, immediately under the entry “Lynda”. Alternatively, the altered intention to add $100 to the amount alongside “Lynda” may be a notation associated with the process of manual addition, namely, “carrying over” a “100” from the “10s” second column in the decimal system.
	


Events after 11 April 2013


	
	I can be relatively brief in dealing with the events after 11 April 2013. The Crown relies on some of it as evidence of guilt in proof of the elements of the murder. I reject that use. It is akin to consciousness of guilt evidence in circumstances where there is another reasonable hypothesis available inconsistent with the conduct being for the purpose of avoiding detection or detention for this particular offence: Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 211, per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, relying on Tripod v R (1961) 104 CLR 1 at 10 and Broadhurst v R [1964] AC 441 at 457; and see also FTZK v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] HCA 26; (2014) 88 ALJR 754 at [39] per Hayne J and at [93], [95]-[97] per Crennan and Bell JJ.
	
	
	Nevertheless, it is also used legitimately by the Crown to undermine the defence of mental illness for which the accused bears the onus. I will discuss that issue later in these reasons. It is necessary to recite some of the facts.
	
	
	After borrowing Darren Leatham’s bike, supra, it seems that the accused “lived rough” and did not return home. On 12 April 2013, the accused visited Thomas Robertson at about 7:00pm or 8:00pm for two to three hours. They both injected “ice” and “hung out together”.
	
	
	On 13 April 2013, the police searched the accused’s premises, the results of which are recited elsewhere in these reasons. The accused visited Thomas Robertson again, about the same time as the day before and they again consumed “ice”. Mr Robertson, who claims his consumption of drugs did not affect his perception (a claim I regard with incredulity), described the accused as dirtier and more agitated. In each case, it is the accused who supplied the drugs. I accept Mr Robertson’s evidence, notwithstanding the caution I have expressed in relation to accepting all his evidence.
	
	
	The accused requested Mr Robertson to turn the television off when the news began.
	
	
	On 14 April 2013, police issued a media release in relation to the death of the deceased, identifying the accused as a suspect (or the only suspect).
	
	
	On 17 April 2013, police saw the accused on the bicycle borrowed from Darren Leatham. They followed him to a set of stables, where he was arrested. There was a struggle during which the accused wielded a knife. On initial questioning at the scene, the accused denied that he was Colin Farrow and said his name was Peter. He suggested that he believed he was being stopped for not wearing a helmet.
	
	
	The police escorted the accused to the police station and he participated in an ERISP. There was also a less formal interview before the ERISP that was sound recorded.
	


The ERISP


	
	Some minor aspects of the ERISP have already been the subject of mention in these reasons. The ERISP commenced on 17 April 2013 at 8.15pm and concluded on 18 April 2013 at 1.34am. The electronic recording was played in Court and is therefore known to those members of the public who were in attendance. The recording and the transcript thereof is Exhibit G in the proceedings and it is unnecessary to reproduce lengthy sections of it.
	
	
	There are a number of matters however that do require comment. Notwithstanding its length and the time at which it ended, the accused did not seem to be under any disadvantages as a consequence. The accused was accompanied at all times by a support person and, ultimately, was capable (and did) indicate when he wanted to end the interview.
	
	
	As to the events on 11 April 2013, the accused maintained that he had no recollection of being in the deceased’s unit or what occurred in the unit. Nevertheless he recalled (Q. 60-66) that he went to the deceased’s premises six days earlier (i.e. on 11 April) and volunteered that he had been “feeling a bit paranoid about her” (Q. 64).
	
	
	His feeling of what he says was paranoia related to his falling out with her, described earlier in these reasons, and the suggestion made to him that “they might give me a hotshot and…I’ve been a bit wary about going to Linda’s”. When asked, upon giving that answer, what happened, the accused replied in the following terms:
	


“Honestly, honestly, this is what I’m gunna say. I think I did it. I really do. I think I did it, eh. I’m not, I don’t know for sure but I really do think I did it. I had um, I had cuts on places that I couldn’t explain. I’ve had, I’ve had stuff that I shouldn’t have had and some of it was stupid stuff that I threw away the other day, stuff that I know Linda would never give me willingly, never. I know she wouldn’t…Um, I remember going to um, see I remember, I remember getting a pushbike off someone, borrowing a pushbike off someone and I remember riding to…my mate’s in town and that’s it. I’m pretty sure I did it. I’m sure I did it.”


	
	The foregoing is not an admission of the fact that the accused had committed the murder. Rather, it is an acknowledgment or conclusion based upon what the accused knew. I have so treated it in relation to the murder. As will be seen from the discussion later in these reasons, I consider the answer of some significance, albeit not conclusive, that the alleged feelings of paranoia and the conclusions reached are volunteered at the very outset of the ERISP.
	
	
	Further, on 17 to 18 April, during the ERISP, the accused displays a demeanour which is wholly rational and not the least delusional. Notwithstanding his lack of memory as to the whereabouts of the clothing that he was wearing earlier in the day on 11 April, he has a distinct recollection that he took no weapons to Linda’s house (Q. 136, 137).
	



	
	During the course of the ERISP, the accused complains about his shoulder, which is eventually treated. I am satisfied that his shoulder was hurting, although I am not convinced that he was in quite as much pain as he sought to indicate. At Q. 209 and 212, the accused answers a question asking for more detail about what he was saying with the following words:
	


“I don’t know O.K…Like the flashbacks or nightmares or whatever they were coupled with being arrested for her murder today means that that stuff was real. That stuff that I was dreaming and all of that stuff and thinking that I wasn’t sure if it was real, it was real. I did it. It was real. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t real…I have what I thought were nightmares and flashbacks of being covered in blood. I have…recollections…of sideswiping a car in somebody’s car and nobody lends me their car to drive. I have in my bum bag full of jewellery that Linda I know owned and would not give me, would not sell to me and would not swap for me and the only way I could either take it would be to steal it which I would not have an opportunity to do so because I’m always in her presence from the moment I walk into her house so there’s only one way I could logically have gotten hold of that jewellery. That is by killing her and taking it.”


	
	As earlier stated, apart from the apparent loss of memory, the accused was totally rational during the course of the whole of the interview, so much so that at Q. 234, having admitted that he went and bought pot he volunteered that he was not going to tell the police where from. He had a keen appreciation of what he could and could not say.
	
	
	The accused informed the police that he would have gone to the deceased’s house to buy drugs and that he knows two crystal dealers (a reference to sellers of crystal methylamphetamine or ice). The other dealer sells bad quality ice. Nevertheless, he continued to deny ever having thoughts about harming the deceased but accepts that the note shown to him (and recited earlier in these reasons) “sounds like a list of murder tools” (Q, 798). He also admits to having more money than he ordinarily possesses with which he bought a greater amount of drugs, not necessarily “ice”, than ordinarily he would be able to buy. The accused uses that fact to assert that he did not consider the possession of that money “real” and if he had thought that he had that much money he would have gone to Western Australia and not stayed around Wollongong smoking pot with others (Q. 308-309).
	
	
	When asked about the cleaning up of the deceased’s premises, he dismisses that as not being done properly or being “a very bad job” (Q. 835-836). The accused denies having any knowledge of attending Bunnings or buying the pick and shovel or how it was his clothing changed (Q. 840 and following). Nor does he have, according to his answers, any recollection of the driving of the car and it being dumped in Corrimal. Nevertheless, he can remember the bum bag and describes its size with his hands, indicating about 20cm or 8 inches.
	
	
	At Q. 828, 829 and 830, he denied going to the deceased’s premises with the intention of killing her. He denied any knowledge of binding her with the rope and gaffe tape and denied any memory of the stabbing but remembered, somewhat vaguely, “seeing blood on my face and everywhere”. At Q. 843 and following, he is clear as to the rights he wishes to assert and assertive of them.
	
	
	I am not satisfied, even on the balance of probabilities, that the accused has a memory loss to the extent that he maintains. Nevertheless, for the purpose of the reasons that follow I will accept, without deciding that such memory that he has lost is genuine. During his interview, recorded in the ERISP, the accused is clear and articulate. At times, he gives the impression that he is deliberately dissembling, seeking to give the impression of honesty in answering and lack of memory. He is certain as to his lack of intention to harm the deceased but does not remember harming the deceased and he is certain that he did not take a weapon to the premises.
	


Psychiatric Evidence


	
	The defence case on mental illness relies upon Psychiatric Reports from Dr Bruce Westmore of 16 September 2013, 29 March 2014, 23 August 2014 and 15 November 2014. Those Reports are Exhibit 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the proceedings. Dr Westmore was qualified by the accused. The Crown relies upon the evidence of Professor Greenberg of 26 April 2014 (Exhibit X in the proceedings). Professor Greenberg is qualified by the Crown. Each of Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg are well-known and well-respected forensic psychiatrists who have given evidence in accordance with the expert code of conduct and both explain the basis upon which their opinion has been derived. Each of the experts was cross-examined.
	
	
	There are a number of fundamental issues on which the experts differ and some matters upon which they agree. To the extent that the accused has a memory loss, each of the experts suggests that it may be attributable to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder he suffered from the murder itself and that, as a consequence, an absence of memory of committing the murder or parts of it may be a result of the very trauma of the murder itself.
	
	
	Otherwise, it is fair to say that the fundamental difference between them relates to their assessment of the genuineness of the accused. Dr Westmore has seen the accused more often than Professor Greenberg. However, Dr Westmore cannot recall seeing the recording of the ERISP, as distinct from reading the transcript. Ordinarily, Dr Westmore’s practice would be to view the ERISP and there seems to be no reason why he did not on this occasion, but he was not questioned in that respect.
	
	
	Each of the experts, Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg, accepts that the accused understood the nature and quality of the act in which he was engaged, when he was stabbing the victim. The difference in their diagnosis relates to the existence of a particular psychosis and the basis for that diagnosis.
	
	
	On examination by Dr Westmore, the accused’s understanding of his “paranoia” was more definite than it was during the course of the ERISP. During the ERISP, as earlier recited, he suggested that he was “a bit paranoid” and “a bit wary” and that he lapsed in and out of paranoia. To Dr Westmore, the accused indicated that he had a belief that the deceased was going to give him “a hot shot” and that he would be left “a vegetable or dead in the park” and that his “thoughts had changed from ‘the victim being a friend’ and the ‘victim giving me a hot’”. These thoughts and expressions are far more definite than anything expressed on 17 April 2013.
	
	
	Dr Westmore sets out the accused’s medical history including past treatment including psychiatric care. He was discharged from a hospital in Orange and was advised to stay off drugs and continue medication. Instead, the accused discontinued his medication and recommenced drug use.
	
	
	Dr Westmore reviewed the transcript of the ERISP, noting certain questions and answers and noted the referral by the RAI Team on 21 April 2013 (that is after the accused’s arrest), that he required an urgent referral to a psychiatrist, who subsequently examined the accused and recorded that the accused was “extremely paranoid” (a more intense view than he indicated during the ERISP he had been experiencing over the previous one or two months). The psychiatrist did not come to a definite view as to a prognosis but, nevertheless, treated him with medication and albeit on an interim basis indicated that there may be intoxication or substance induced psychosis. Dr Westmore indicates in his Report (Exhibit 1) that he did not look at all of the documents with which he was provided and the recording of the ERISP may be in that category.
	
	
	Dr Westmore diagnoses a paranoid psychosis as the accused Axis I in the following terms:
	


“AXIS I    – Paranoid psychosis – The differential diagnosis would include a primary process illness such as schizophrenia with that condition being aggravated and/or exacerbated by his use of illicit drugs, particularly the substance, Crystal Meth. The differential diagnosis would include a drug induced psychosis.

-Acute Stress Disorder secondary to the act of violence.

AXIS II    I note the nature and extent of his Criminal Antecedence. He suffers from an Antisocial Personality Disorder, although some of his offending behaviour is likely to have occurred in the context of his substance abuse problems.

AXIS III    I note a history of head injuries but that is not, in my view, relevant to the matters now before the court.

AXIS IV    He faces multiple stressors associated with his incarceration.

AXIS V    It is probable this man has functioned well below his potential due to his substance abuse and mental illness problems.”


	
	Dr Westmore’s Report concludes with the following paragraphs:
	


“I believe Mr Farrow could raise the defence of mental illness in relation to the charge of murder. He was, at the relevant time, suffering from a disease of the mind (either a paranoid schizophrenic illness or a severe drug induced psychosis). Both of these conditions would represent a disease of the mind and he would have been totally deprived of his capacity to know that he ought not to do the act. Based on his history, he was delusionally driven in relation to the deceased, believing that she, and possibly others were conspiring to give him a ‘hot shot’, which would result either in his death or which would make him a ‘vegetable’.

Since receiving appropriate medical care, his acute symptoms have started to resolve and he has achieved some increased insight into his previous paranoid and psychotic state. The illness is however not in remission.”


	
	The subsequent Reports support the foregoing opinion and refer to a review by the Psychiatric Registrar in Justice Health on 2 July 2013 in which a differential diagnosis including paranoid schizophrenia and drug induced psychosis was identified. That same doctor took the view that the accused’s psychosis had resolved on 7 August 2013.
	
	
	A further history was obtained in relation to a report by a psychiatrist on 5 November 2013 who formed the conclusion that the accused suffered “likely chronic paranoid schizophrenia complicated by substance use”.
	
	
	I turn then to the opinion of Professor Greenberg. At pg. 3 of the Report, Professor Greenberg recites a part of the history given to him by the accused in the following terms:
	


“Mr Farrow reports each day blended with the other days because he was using illicit substances. He states that the last few days prior to the alleged offence his paranoia got ‘over the edge’.

I asked Mr Farrow about the day of the alleged offence, namely 11 April 2013. He states he has no recall of that specific day but thinks he caught a train as per usual to his drug dealer, Linda Stevens. He reports all he can remember is standing in front of a sink and in the mirror he had blood all of his face and chest. He stated that his only recall is a flashback of seeing himself in a mirror soaked with blood. This flashback occurred a few days prior to his arrest. He claims he does not know when the memory actually occurred.

Mr Farrow also reports he also has a memory of side swiping a car but only recalled that when the police confronted him with his reported erratic driving on that day.”


	
	There are other recollections in the history given to Professor Greenberg which it is unnecessary to recite. I have recited the foregoing because it is, as a matter of substance, inconsistent with the answers given in the ERISP. The answer in the ERISP at Q. 60 to 66 were, to the extent that they were a recollection of what occurred on 11 April 2013, said with confidence and answered quickly. First, there is the statement that he remembers some bits of it although he said to Professor Greenberg that he remembered none of it. Secondly, his answer at Q. 63 reads as if there were some hesitation but, in the recording, there is little or no hesitation and the first part of the answer that the accused “went to see Linda” does not, in the recording, seem to depend upon the proposition that he sees Linda most days. In fact, he did not see Linda the day earlier on the Wednesday.
	
	
	Further, the answer is expressly inconsistent with his stated recollection that he did not have an intention to kill when he arrived at Linda’s on 11 April 2013 and did not have a weapon with him.
	
	
	Under the heading “DIAGNOSIS”, Professor Greenberg states:
	


“1. History of Chronic Poly-substance Dependence.

2. History of chronic periods of Substance Induced Intoxication.

3. History of Psychotic symptoms (query Chronic Drug Induced Psychosis; query underlying Schizophrenic Disorder).

4. Query symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

5. Query symptoms of Gambling Disorder.”


	
	Professor Greenberg suggests that the accused would qualify for a diagnosis of cannabis and/or amphetamine intoxication at various times while using these substances and also for a diagnosis of Substance Induced Psychotic Disorder, which ordinarily means that a sufferer can represent with delusions and hallucinations where there is a loss of reality testing. The Professor explains that delusions are fixed, unshakeable, false beliefs whilst hallucinations are false perceptions which are not a distortion or misinterpretation but something experienced as real.
	
	
	Further Professor Greenberg suggests that the accused, “on balance probably has an element of psychogenic amnesia for the time of these offences and possibly an element malingering for the period of writing the notebook. His chronic use of crystal methylamphetamines and cannabis would also impair memory but not to the extent of such a selective period of amnesia related specifically to the alleged offences” (pg. 13, Exhibit X).
	
	
	The Professor comments on the accused’s retrospective amnesia for the time period prior to the trauma which extends further back some days or weeks prior to the alleged offences.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg goes on to explain his view as to the genuineness of the paranoia suffered by the accused in the following terms:
	


“In true psychosis the individual loses touch with reality and cannot distinguish between psychotic (false) symptoms such as paranoia and true reality. In other words they perceive the hallucinations and delusions as real and these experiences are real (only to them). In my opinion, Mr Farrow [the accused] likely had a degree of insight into his perceptual disturbances and this level of insight waxed and waned depending on his use of illicit substances.

Mr Farrow documented or reported he had some insight into his psychotic symptoms. [The Professor cites examples from the notebook.] These statements imply that he had some insight into the effects of the illicit substances at the time he wrote these words and that he was experiencing ‘hallucinations’ rather than his perception that the ‘voices’ were real.

…

Mr Farrow’s mental state at the time of the alleged offence probably was a combination of substance intoxication and substance induced perceptual symptoms with his history of chronic and persistent use of substances over several years. It is possible that he may have had a disease of the mind, namely an acute or chronic substance induced psychosis (and/or substance intoxication disorder) but the degree or intensity of his perceptual belief system may have not been a constant variable and there may have been fluctuations in his level of understanding of his paranoid ideation or paranoid systems at that time period.

The mental illness defence of whether Mr Farrow has a defect of reason caused by a disease of the mind is to my mind thrown into doubt. Mr Farrow cannot recall his mental state, and/or behaviour at the time of the alleged offences. He can give no account of himself during the time period of the deceased death, but claims he is sure he is responsible. The view of any forensic psychiatrists is therefore ‘a hypothesis’ which is based on his historical history and current psychiatric status as well as the available information from the police brief.”


	
	Professor Greenberg then refers to the ERISP and in particular questions and answers relating to whether the notebook reads like a list of murder tools (reference to which has been made earlier) evidencing a suggestion of planning, forethought and some prior reasoning.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg also refers to the theft of the jewellery and other items at the time of or after the killing of the deceased. Professor Greenberg reasons that the accused’s reasoning is therefore the stealing of the victim’s jewellery rather than protecting himself from a threat brought about by his apparent paranoid delusions. The Professor also refers to the accused’s purchase of the pick and shovel with the apparent intention of burying the body and the changing of his clothes and the cleaning of premises as being evidence of the accused’s perception of wrongdoing.
	
	
	Fundamentally, Professor Greenberg is prepared to accept that the accused suffered a degree of paranoia but not of such intensity that he lost all touch with reality and concludes that his actions were more likely related to his severe drug addiction and the need to obtain further drug supplies but concedes that his likely drug induced paranoid thoughts and level of intoxication may have played a limited role in the alleged offence.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing there are significant differences between two expert witnesses, each of whom is a renowned specialist in forensic psychology and/or psychiatry and has specialised knowledge based upon their training, study and experience. Unlike non-expert witnesses, such experts are entitled to express opinions in the particular areas of their expertise. The value of their opinion very much depends upon the material that they have seen or read; the accuracy of the material; and the opinion of the Court as to whether to accept the evidence which the expert has accepted and relied upon providing their opinion.
	
	
	It would be difficult to differentiate between Professor Greenberg, on the one hand, and Dr Westmore, on the other, based upon the level and degree of their experience, training and study. These are each experts who are, as earlier stated, extremely experienced in forensic psychiatry. Nevertheless, the expert evidence is admitted to provide me with the medical and psychiatric information and opinions within the witnesses’ expertise and beyond the expertise of the Court.
	
	
	After giving each opinion careful consideration, it is for me to accept the evidence or not accept it, provided it is given careful consideration, and the non-acceptance of any aspect of the opinion evidence is rationally based. Fundamental in that approach may be whether the party with the onus of proof has satisfied the Court to the standard necessary and upon which that party relies as part of their case.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg regards as significant that there was evidence of planning before the killing and the conduct of the accused after the killing as well as the “selective” nature of the memory loss associated with the killing. Further, Professor Greenberg takes the view that a person who understands or appreciates that he was being “paranoid” is not usually truly “paranoid”, because paranoia involves a belief in the reality of that which is feared as the threat.
	
	
	As a consequence, in relation to the last mentioned matter, Professor Greenberg sees the accused’s capacity to differentiate between that which is real and that which is not as significant and his insight into the fact that he is or was, in relation to some beliefs, being paranoid.
	
	
	In relation to the last mentioned aspect, Dr Westmore expresses the view that many paranoid schizophrenics will have, after the event, a degree of insight into the lack of reality of the threats that they have perceived and, therefore, the issue raised by Professor Greenberg is not in his view as significant as Professor Greenberg suggests.
	
	
	I take the view, there is considerable force in the opinion of both Professor Greenberg and Dr Westmore. The difference between them is not quite as wide as the foregoing summary suggests. Professor Greenberg makes it clear that the insight which he attributes to the theft and other matters makes it less likely that the accused was truly paranoid. Dr Westmore takes the view that such insight can be held by someone suffering from delusional psychosis. I do not understand Professor Greenberg to suggest that it is impossible for a person with insight to be suffering such a psychosis. Professor Greenberg is simply remarking that the existence of such insight makes that diagnosis less likely. In that regard, the experts are in agreement that the suggested insight is not conclusive, but they differ on the effect of insight on the likelihood of the accused suffering a psychosis of the requisite kind.
	
	
	Similarly, Dr Westmore looks at the planning prior to the event as not necessarily inconsistent with the existence of paranoid delusions. Professor Greenberg, again, treats these as factors to be weighed in determining the likely operating factors on the accused. The same is true of the conduct of the accused after the death of the deceased.
	


Consideration of Mental Illness Defence


	
	As earlier indicated, a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness has been sought by the accused. Mental illness is a true defence and the onus of proof is on the accused to satisfy the Court of the factors, on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The question that must be considered in determining whether a mental illness defence has been established is whether, at the time of the stabbing, the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law. As earlier indicated, the onus, once raised, is borne by the accused to prove the defence on the balance of probabilities. In other words, the accused must establish to the Court that it is more probable than not that the accused was mentally ill at the time of the stabbing. If that onus is satisfied then the accused is entitled to a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness and one or other of the orders previously mentioned.
	
	
	In that determination, one considers the mind of the accused at the time of the stabbing, not at the time of the ERISP or indeed when the accused is before the Court or any other time. In order to establish mental illness, the accused must establish that he has a disease of the mind which has affected his reason in a way that the accused did not appreciate the nature and quality of the physical act in which he was engaged or that the act he was performing was not wrong.
	
	
	A disease of the mind certainly includes a psychosis. Having said that, one can have a temporary disease of the mind. In these proceedings the issue is whether the psychosis from which the accused suffered, assuming, for present purposes, that he suffered such a psychosis, produced the kind of defect of reasoning necessary to give rise to the defence.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept, on the balance of probabilities, that the accused has an ongoing psychosis. Certainly, now, he suffers, to some extent from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I am also of a view that he has satisfied the lower burden associated with the balance of probabilities, that he has or had, at the time of the stabbing, a psychosis of some kind. I will return to the nature of the psychosis.
	
	
	Nevertheless, it is not the existence of the psychosis which ultimately satisfies the Court that the defence has been made out. The Court must be satisfied, albeit on the lower standard of balance of probabilities, that there was a defect of reason such that he did not understand the nature and quality of the act or understand that it was wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people.
	
	
	Each of the experts agrees with the other that the accused understood the nature and quality of the act of stabbing the deceased. The accused understood he was stabbing the deceased; he understood that the stabbing was likely to kill her or to cause her grievous bodily harm (a really serious injury) and that he intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The ultimate and remaining question is whether the accused satisfied me, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not understand that the act he was engaged in was wrong by the ordinary standards of reasonable people.
	
	
	I have earlier in these reasons made clear that the notepad and the conduct of the accused after the stabbing could not be used by the Crown to prove either planning of a murder or a consciousness of guilt. However, we are not now dealing with the elements of the murder charge, proof of which lies on the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt. We are now dealing with the accused’s case that he was mentally ill, delusional and paranoid.
	
	
	In my view, the notes to which reference has been made in these reasons significantly undermine the case that the accused puts that his conduct was irrational and spontaneous. While the notes are consistent with the planning of a robbery, when one adds to the rational decision to rob the deceased, the understanding of the accused that to come to a view rationally that he was going to rob the accused involved the necessary consequence that he would “have to kill her”, the lack of planning and premeditation and irrationality suggested by the accused is significantly undermined. The reference to the view that he would have “to kill her and take it” is a reference to question and answer 212 in the ERISP.
	
	
	Further, after the accused stabbed the deceased he cleaned the house of all but the pool of the deceased’s blood on her bed and one or two smears of her blood. He cleaned the house so thoroughly that there was no DNA or other material associating him with the murder. He destroyed the deceased’s clothes. He destroyed his own clothes. He hid the knife such that it cannot now be found. The accused then bundled the deceased into the boot of the car and drove her to a location, having bought a shovel and pick, with the likely intention to bury her.
	
	
	The accused then went into hiding. He did not return to his own home but lived on the street. When he was at a friend’s place, he did not want the friend watching the news in his presence; he sought to escape from the police when chased and to resist arrest when caught. The foregoing are all the hallmarks of a person who understands he has done wrong. Dr Westmore seeks to differentiate legal wrong from moral wrong. Dr Westmore is theoretically accurate. However there is no evidence or indication in any material surrounding these events that the accused differentiated legal and moral wrong, or that he did not see his conduct as morally wrong.
	
	
	Ultimately, the issue between the experts and the question of mental illness is determined, in my view, on the burden of proof. The accused has not satisfied the Court, even on the balance of probabilities, that at the time he committed this offence his disease of mind, assuming for that purpose that there was a psychosis, so affected his reasoning that he did not understand that what he was doing was wrong by the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.
	
	
	If I were required to decide which of the experts I prefer, I make it clear that I prefer the opinion of Professor Greenberg. I do so because he has examined more of the material; he remembers viewing the recording of the ERISP; and, like him, I do not accept the veracity of the accused in the answers he gave during the ERISP. In my view, the answers in the ERISP, as earlier stated, disclose a measure of deliberate dissembling seeking to give the impression of honesty in answering and a lack of memory of the incidents in question. I am not, by that, suggesting that the accused does not suffer a psychosis. I have little doubt that the long term effect of the drugs he was taking had that affect. I do not accept, however, that he was so delusional at the time of the stabbing that it affected his reasoning in the way necessary to establish a defence of mental illness, namely, that it was more probable than not that he did not understand that which he was doing was wrong.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the mental illness defence raised by the accused has not been established.
	
	
	There is a difference between mental illness and substantial impairment. The accused does not seek to raise substantial impairment by abnormality of mind as a partial defence to the murder. I do not therefore deal with it at length.
	
	
	In my opinion, the decision of defence counsel not to raise substantial impairment was the correct one. The accused has not shown an inability to resist impulse and the other acts of diminished responsibility have been dealt with by me by dealing with the factors relating to the mental illness defence.
	
	
	For all of the foregoing reasons, the accused has not shown that it is more probable than not that he did not know or understand the physical nature or quality of the act of stabbing the deceased. Nor has the accused shown that he did not know according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community that the act was wrong. As a consequence, the defence of mental illness fails. Otherwise I have concluded that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt each of the elements of the crime of murder.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing, on the charge that on 11 April 2013 Colin Maxwell Farrow murdered Linda Stevens, I find the accused guilty.

		27 February 2015",2015-02-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703860,R v Lane (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 118,"Judgment


	
	The offender, Paul Ian Lane is to be sentenced for the manslaughter of Peter Morris. The offender had been arraigned on an indictment for murder on 7th October 2014. On Monday 27th October 2014, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.
	
	
	Manslaughter had been left to the jury on two alternative bases: first, manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act; and secondly, manslaughter by way of excessive self-defence.
	
	
	The principles of law governing the sentencing of an offender who has been found guilty by the verdict of a jury are well known and require no exposition by me (see for example Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; 209 CLR 1). Because it is my responsibility as trial judge to determine the appropriate sentence, it is for me to make a decision about the degree of culpability involved in the offending, as well as about all other facts relevant to sentencing. The jury’s verdict decided that the offender was guilty. Determining culpability for sentencing purposes requires me to identify why the offender is guilty.
	
	
	Both the learned Crown Prosecutor and Mr P. Young SC for the offender submit that of the two alternatives, I should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the evidence I heard at the trial that the jury’s verdict is consistent with the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. I am persuaded that I should accept this submission for the reasons I will give.
	


The accused admits guilt for further offences


	
	It is appropriate at this point to record that the Crown have filed what is known as a Form 1 specifying two further offences for which the offender admits his guilt and which he has indicated he wants me to take into account when dealing with him for the manslaughter of Mr Morris. These offences are assaulting Chris Schwager, occasioning actual bodily harm, and assaulting Cody Roberts, also occasioning actual bodily harm. The assault of Mr Schwager formed part and parcel of the circumstances giving rise to the manslaughter of Mr Morris. The assault on Mr Roberts occurred later the same night.
	
	
	I record that the Form 1 has been signed by the offender, and appropriately on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (s 32(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act)). At the commencement of the proceedings on sentence, the offender, in open court, admitted his guilt to the further offences and indicated that he wanted me to take the further offences into account in dealing with him for the manslaughter of Peter Morris. The circumstances of the further offending are the subject of agreed facts. In all the circumstances, I consider it appropriate to so take the further offences into account.
	


Factual overview


	
	Very regrettably, the circumstances of this case show that the scourge of alcohol fuelled violence in public places is not restricted to the entertainment hubs of our major cities. Nor are relatively young men its only exponents. The offending at hand occurred in Barker Street, Casino, a relatively small town in north-eastern New South Wales, not far from licensed premises, the Commercial Hotel. The offending occurred on 15th September 2012, when the offender was nearly 53 years of age. His victim, Mr Morris was a grandfather of a similar vintage. Both men, who were previously unknown to each other, had been drinking before and during their attendance at the Commercial Hotel to listen to an AC/DC tribute band.
	
	
	It will be necessary for me to go into the facts in greater detail, but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both men, in common with most of the people who gave evidence about what happened, were quite drunk at the time they engaged in an altercation, for which there was no substantial provocation. The offender got the better of both Mr Morris and his companion, Mr Schwager. On the basis of evidence I will recount, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a punch delivered by the offender knocked Mr Morris to the ground. On impact he struck his head very heavily fracturing his skull and sustaining a traumatic brain injury from the effects of which he died some 12 days later on 24th September 2012.
	


Facts relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending


	
	The Crown argues that I should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was an aggressor looking for trouble. The circumstances put forward to support this submission extend beyond what was proved to have occurred in Barker Street to what was said to be the offender’s pattern of aggressive conduct in the hotel culminating in his ejection.
	
	
	A number of witnesses gave evidence about the offender’s behaviour at the hotel. Moreover, investigating police painstakingly compiled a record of the offender’s movements in the hotel from the various CCTV cameras located throughout the hotel. I do not propose to detail the evidence of the witnesses about these matters. A number of witnesses give accounts of the offender barging through the crowded dance floor area dropping his shoulder to get past. There was evidence of him making a gun-like gesture with his hand, pointing it towards a female patron. Two witnesses gave evidence of a specific act of confrontation with another patron. I am not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that these events occurred. First, many of the patrons had had far too much to drink which adversely affected their perception; and their accounts seemed affected by hindsight with knowledge of what happened later in Barker Street. But more importantly, some of the incidents inside the hotel were said to have happened in places covered by the CCTV footage played at the trial and none of them were recorded on that footage. It seems most unlikely that all of these allegedly spontaneous bouts of aggression co-incidentally would have occurred “off-camera”.
	
	
	Not all witnesses however were intoxicated. For instance, Mr Anthony Watkins who was in charge of security on the night gave evidence of an incident which occurred out of the view of the CCTV cameras where the offender “dropped his shoulder into him”. He also said he saw the offender engaged in what I understood to be an aggressive stand-off with another security officer, Mr Lampard. This latter episode happened across the dance floor and should have been “on-camera” but was not. I found Mr Watkins’ evidence generally “acceptable”, except it too was infected by hindsight. I thought it significant that neither of the matters he gave evidence of led him to insist that the offender leave the hotel, which he could have done by complaint to the licencee. As Mr Young argued, in a crowded dance floor area populated by intoxicated people a degree of barging may occur unintentionally and without aggression.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender was later asked to leave by the licensee, Ms Pemberton, for drunkenness not aggression. This had nothing to do with the matters spoken of in evidence by Mr Watkins. In her statement (she was too ill to give evidence) Ms Pemberton described the offender as “moderately affected” by alcohol. I suppose a person in her line of work is used to dealing with people affected by alcohol. Her appreciation of the range of affectation may be broader than that of the ordinary person. From what can be seen on the CCTV footage, the offender was exhibiting signs of intoxication such as unsteadiness on his feet and a lack of co-ordination.
	
	
	At the point of his ejection from the premises, the offender is seen to “shirt-front” the bar manager, Alexander Demaine. I would not have so made much of this from what is shown on the CCTV footage but Ms Pemberton who was also present at the time thought there was something in it. What can be seen on the footage is the offender drawing himself up to his full height and puffing his chest out towards Mr Demaine who is standing close to him. However, as the Crown accepts, Ms Pemberton was able to quickly diffuse any incipient incident. She deftly guided the offender through the door and onto the street. He did not resist.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was ejected from the hotel for aggressive behaviour. Doubtless however his drunkenness affected his self-control.
	
	
	He was ejected at about 11 pm. He had attended the hotel with his son, Ryan, who remained inside listening to the band. The offender seems to have remained in the vicinity of Barker Street, or thereabouts, waiting until closing time to go home with his son. There is another hotel nearby, but there is no evidence that he went there, or drank more alcohol anywhere-else.
	


Manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act


	
	The commission of the offence was captured by a CCTV security camera protecting a bank’s ATM further west along Barker Street. A number of eyewitnesses also gave evidence. None of the witnesses saw everything that is depicted on the CCTV footage because they were going about their own business and the events were unexpected by them. But their evidence does assist in deciding critical questions.
	
	
	Barker Street runs east-west through Casino. The Commercial Hotel is on the corner of Barker and Walker Streets, east of where the offence was committed. The offence was committed outside a dental surgery a few shopfronts to the west of the hotel. The bank security camera is two shopfronts further west from the dental surgery. Needless to say it looks east. Police photographs (Exhibit E) show that the view of eyewitnesses milling closer to the hotel, waiting for cabs and the like, would have been obscured to some extent by cars parked along the kerb and shrubbery planted in a garden area encroaching onto the carriageway of Barker Street. The attention of witnesses was only attracted after the trouble started.
	
	
	I am satisfied that at about closing time, just before midnight, Mr Morris and Mr Schwager left the hotel. They were then probably, on the evidence, moderately affected by alcohol. Mr Morris was carrying the leftovers from his takeaway dinner in a plastic container inside a plastic bag. Doing the best I can from the CCTV footage they seem to be evincing signs of intoxication in their gait. They may have passed the offender where he was waiting for his son as they left the hotel. Mr Morris and Mr Schwager stopped near a telegraph pole outside the dental surgery. They appear to be looking for a cab.
	
	
	The offender and his son also headed west along Barker Street, a few seconds behind Mr Morris and Mr Schwager. A Mr Cupitt who was standing on the footpath a couple of shopfronts east of the dental surgery noticed the offender as he passed, walking with his “arms stretched … as though he was putting his jacket on” [277.10T]. He seemed to veer, or perhaps lurch, towards Mr Cupitt as he walked past. When the offender appears on the CCTV footage he is seen to be walking in the same manner, although his coat is on.
	
	
	The offender walked between Mr Morris and Mr Schwager and his son between Mr Morris and the shopfront. Something must have been said by someone because having walked past, the offender stopped in his tracks, turned back and headed for Mr Morris. The offender’s son gave evidence that when they were passing Mr Morris the son made an offensive remark to his father, which Mr Morris mistakenly took as directed at him because he responded in a manner suggesting he had taken offence. Despite some unsatisfactory aspects of the testimony of the offender’s son, I am satisfied that he is correct on this score.
	
	
	As I have said, it seems apparent that Mr Morris said something and that the offender took it as “fighting words” because he retraced his steps and confronted Mr Morris. I interpolate that neither the offender nor Mr Schwager have any recollection of these events, and the offender’s son kept walking west, not getting involved. It may seem odd that neither the offender nor Mr Schwager can remember anything. However, it is possible that this is explained by the consideration that both were intoxicated and each received concussive head injuries, Mr Schwager at the hands of the offender and the offender later the same night in another incident about which nothing is known.
	
	
	Returning to the narrative, the offender confronted Mr Morris. It is not known what was said. There is much chest-puffing and waving of arms discernible on the CCTV footage. The two men began to grapple with one another. Mr Morris seems to have initially gained the upper hand because he was able to turn the offender around, forcing him against the shopfront of the dental surgery, before extricating himself from the offender’s grasp and beating a retreat towards the roadway. The offender gave chase. When Mr Morris got to the kerb, moving more or less backwards away from the nearby offender, he is seen to collapse onto the roadway striking his head. The Crown submits I should find some act of the offender caused him to fall. Mr Young submits I should find he lost his footing. As will be apparent Mr Morris fell twice suffering separate head injuries in each fall. Both were causes of his death.
	
	
	The evidence of Dr Dianne Little, a forensic pathologist, was not seriously challenged. It was to the effect that Mr Morris died of the effects of what were, broadly speaking, two separate brain injuries each associated with separate skull fractures. Dr Little explained that the constellation of head injuries suffered by Mr Morris could not be explained by a single impact of his head on the roadway. There were two quite distinct areas of injury best explained by two separate impacts to his head. The significant areas of skull fracture were at the base of the back of the skull and on the left side of the skull in what she described as “an approximately sagittal plane” [523.35T]. Each gave rise to brain injury by way of subdural haematoma to separate parts of the brain. For reasons I will explain in a moment, I find that the fracture to the left side of the skull in the sagittal plane and its associated brain injury occurred at the time of the first fall.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this first fall was occasioned by a blow delivered by the offender. I consider it possible that in attempting to evade the offender, Mr Morris lost his footing on the kerb and fell.
	
	
	After Mr Morris fell there was interaction between the offender and Mr Schwager, which is the subject of agreed facts which I will deal with separately.
	
	
	Evidently the first head injury did not cause the deceased to lose consciousness for he rose to his feet and faced the offender, still holding the plastic bag in his right hand. The offender moved towards Mr Morris and the CCTV footage then appears to show an exchange of blows between them for the head of each man is seen to jerk backwards. Mr Morris fell again, this time striking the back of his head on the roadway fracturing the base of his skull and suffering a contrecoup brain injury involving the frontal lobe.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Morris fell the second time as a consequence of the offender punching him on the right side of the jaw with sufficient force to knock him down from his unsteady feet. Dr Little found bruising to the right side of the jaw, which she considered consistent with the application of blunt force to that region. This is supported by the eyewitness accounts.
	
	
	As I have said, all eyewitnesses admitted to being well affected by alcohol. Moreover, none saw the start of the trouble; probably the attention of each was drawn by the noise of the fracas or, perhaps, the sound of Mr Morris falling the first time. Mr Cupitt heard some yelling and looked up in time to see the offender hit Mr Schwager. By this time, of course, Mr Morris had already fallen for the first time and was picking himself up from the roadway. He then saw the offender move towards a person now standing on the road. This was Mr Morris. He saw the offender punch Mr Morris and “he went backwards onto the road and his head hit the bitumen” [283.15T]. There was a rather loud crack.
	
	
	Mr David Marsh was with Mr Cupitt. The first thing he saw was also the first interaction with Mr Schwager. He then saw the offender swing a punch at Mr Morris, he did not see it connect, but he did see Mr Morris fall backwards and hit his head on the bitumen. In cross-examination he accepted that he “wasn’t standing that close” [342.5T]. He did not see everything that occurred but he was unshakeable in his account that he saw the offender throw a punch and Mr Morris fall backwards.
	
	
	Ms Alicia Livingstone was standing under the western extremity of the awning, or balcony, of the hotel. She knew both Mr Lane and Mr Morris. She said she saw “Paul Lane hit Pete Morris” [382.45T]. Mr Morris fell and “hit the gutter” (she was wrong in this detail). She said she saw the offender punch Mr Morris on the left side of his face. Again, she may have been wrong about this detail. She explained that she “only caught the end of it” [393.15T] and saw the offender leaving the scene. Although some of her evidence is inconsistent with that of other witnesses, I accept that she saw the offender punch Mr Morris. This was the punch that knocked him down leading to the second head injury.
	
	
	Mr Jeremy Armstrong was standing outside a shop called “The Magic Noodle”, nextdoor to the hotel. This puts him closer than Ms Livingstone, but further away than Mr Cupitt and Mr Marsh. He recognised Mr Morris as he walked past moments earlier. He also saw the offender walk past. Mr Armstrong was unsure of the details and admitted that his view was obstructed. He said he saw Mr Morris receive a punch, but he was uncertain whether he fell. He then saw the offender punch Mr Schwager. Then, he said, “Pete got the third punch, that’s when I heard a noise, but my view was obstructed, what he hit” (sic) (465.20T). He was unable to describe the punch because his view was obstructed. He saw Mr Morris commence to fall; he was unable to see the impact of Mr Morris with the roadway but he heard a loud noise.
	
	
	Mr Armstrong, as I have said, accepted his view was obstructed, that his opportunity to observe was limited because the events happened quickly, and his memory had deteriorated because of the effluxion of time, but he was sure that it was a punch from Mr Lane that initiated Mr Morris’ fall. The fall initiated by the punch witnessed by Mr Armstrong was certainly the second fall because Mr Morris did not regain his feet.
	
	
	Mr Armstrong’s friend, Jai Perkins also gave evidence. However, I am satisfied that he was engrossed in conversation with some girls and his attention was not drawn to the events happening west of him along Barker Street until he heard the sound of Mr Morris’ head hitting the road, for the second time.
	
	
	Dr Little said it was impossible from a medical point of view for her to express an opinion as to the sequence in which the head injuries were received. She was shown the CCTV footage but it was too indistinct for her to draw any conclusions from it about what part of Mr Morris’ head hit the ground when. However, from the eyewitness accounts of Mr Morris falling backwards, I am satisfied, as I have said, that the fractures to the left side of the skull and associated injuries to the left and right sides of the brain were suffered in the first fall and the injuries to the back of the skull and the back and front of the brain were suffered in the second fall. The doctor considered that both brain injuries contributed to Mr Morris’ death. In fact, each was a possible cause of death.
	
	
	I have no doubt that the offender punched Mr Morris to the right side of his jaw causing him to fall backwards, hitting the back of his head on the bitumen. This punch was delivered as an aggressive act and not in self-defence. The impact of the back of Mr Morris’ head with the roadway fractured his skull, causing a traumatic brain injury which substantially contributed to his death. The blow was delivered with sufficient force to knock Mr Morris off his feet, although I think it more likely that it was the blow to the back of the head and consequent subdural haemorrhaging which caused the loss of consciousness from which Mr Morris never revived.
	
	
	The offender did not suffer any material injury in his exchange with Mr Morris. He did not evince any remorse at the time. He left Mr Morris to his fate and resumed his journey west along Barker Street where he later met up with his son.
	


Finding as to objective seriousness


	
	It is well recognised in our criminal law that the crime of manslaughter covers a very wide range of criminality and culpability. In its most serious form the circumstances may fall just short of murder. In other cases, the circumstances may be only a little more serious than an unfortunate accident. This being so it is pointless to attempt to categorise cases of manslaughter by reference to superficial factual similarities; there are no pre-conceived categories of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. It is necessary to consider the facts and circumstances of each case individually and in detail.
	
	
	The features of the present case which lead me to conclude it is an objectively serious one include that the crime was committed in a public place when the offender was very intoxicated. While there was some initial willingness on the part of Mr Morris to engage in an altercation with him, and indeed grapple with him, the offender escalated the aggression even after Mr Morris sought to disengage himself from the fracas. The punch that felled Mr Lane for the second time was deliberate. I am satisfied that it was delivered with intent to inflict some appreciable harm but given the jury’s verdict not really serious injury. The force involved was sufficient to knock Mr Morris off his feet. However I find that the brain injury suffered occurred when Mr Morris’s head hit the ground; the force of the punch was not sufficient of itself to cause that injury. The offender did not attempt to render any assistance, even if it would have been pointless because of the seriousness of the brain injury. He did not show any remorse for what had occurred, but simply walked away.
	


Family victim impact statement


	
	During the proceedings on sentence I had the great advantage of receiving a statement from Mr Morris’ daughter, Anita, describing the adverse effect his death has had upon his extended family. Under s 28(4) Sentencing Act I am entitled to consider this evidence and take it into account in connection with the determination of the sentence I will pass on the offender because the harmful impact of Mr Morris’ death on the members of his immediate family is an aspect of the harm done to the broader community, the recognition of which is an important purpose of sentencing under s 3A of the Act.
	
	
	Ms Morris very eloquently wrote of her father’s involvement with her, her siblings and with his grandchildren. I have taken into account the emotional strain his hospitalisation and subsequent death have had upon them. I accept that the family’s sense of loss will continue as the significant milestones in the life of each of them will be marked with a degree of sadness because of the premature absence of Mr Morris due to this offending.
	
	
	I extend my sincere personal condolences to each member of Mr Morris’ immediate family.
	


Form 1 offences


	
	The further offences which I will take into account have been the subject of agreed facts which I will now recount. Mr Schwager, it will be recalled, was Mr Morris’ companion on the night of 15th September 2012. He was with him in Barker Street and came to Mr Morris’ aid during the struggle with the offender.
	
	
	After Mr Morris’ first fall, Mr Schwager moved towards the offender, I infer to render assistance to his friend. The offender punched Mr Schwager and he fell back striking his head against the telegraph pole outside the dental surgery. After Mr Morris’ second fall caused by the offender’s punch, the offender again approached Mr Schwager who was groggy and still sitting near the telegraph pole. The offender bent down and punched him again. Mr Schwager was taken to Casino Hospital, but did not wait to see a doctor. He suffered injuries to his right cheek and forehead as well as swelling to the left side of his head. As I have said, the events surrounding this further offending are depicted on the CCTV footage. Mr Schwager was called to give evidence, but had no memory of what had happened.
	
	
	The second assault was on Cody Roberts. Later the same night, the offender drove to a friend’s home in the residential area of Casino. At about the time of his arrival a taxi pulled up with a number of passengers including his friend, and other persons, some of whom were known to the offender. They had all been at the Commercial Hotel to see the band.
	
	
	One passenger, Cody Roberts was not known to the offender. As he alighted from the taxi, the offender grabbed him and threw him to the ground. The offender got on top of Mr Roberts, grabbed his ears and bit the top of his forehead. Mr Roberts struggled to free himself and the offender bit him a second time on the neck. Mr Roberts managed to free himself and leave the area in the taxi which had dropped him off. The assault on him was unprovoked and unexplained; indeed it is inexplicable. No motive for the attack has emerged.
	
	
	Shortly after this second further offence, the offender himself was found unconscious on the side of the road outside the same premises. He had suffered significant facial injuries including a fractured nose. It is unknown how he came by those injuries, but it seems likely he was assaulted by a person or persons unknown. He was taken to Lismore Base Hospital by ambulance.
	


The offender’s personal circumstances


	
	As at the date of the offending, the offender was a divorced person aged 52 years and 9 months. Now he is 55 years and 2 months.
	
	
	He did not give evidence on the proceedings on sentence, but without objection I received a report of Ms Anna Robilliard, a forensic psychologist dated 22nd January 2015. I have used this report as a source of personal information about the offender. I appreciate that courts are sometimes reluctant to accept the history given by offenders to psychologists for the purpose of proceedings on sentence at face value when the offender does not himself give sworn testimony about those matters, exposing himself in the process to cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor on behalf of the community. At the same time there is an obvious utilitarian value in evidence being presented in this way, especially as, generally speaking, the ordinary rules of evidence do not apply to proceedings on sentence. Moreover, in this case, the Crown did not submit that I should look askance at material introduced in this way. Also, the matters of history upon which I propose to rely are borne out by the testimonials tendered on behalf of the offender, especially that of his younger sister, Deborah Lane.
	
	
	The offender was born into a stable family of ordinary working folk in Sydney’s Penrith area. He is third, and the only male, in a sibship of five. His parents are still alive and they along with most of his siblings, like the offender, now live on the north coast. He was not good scholar and left school, it is said, at age 13. After leaving school he worked for his father’s employer until he turned 17 when he went into used car sales. He seems to have had a real talent for this work and he was continuously employed in it until about the age of 40 when his marriage broke down. At that time he was running his own business in Mudgee and Gulgong. These details are all confirmed by his younger sister.
	
	
	His life seems to have changed dramatically after the breakdown of his marriage. He left Mudgee, taking his two sons, of whom he had custody, to live in Ballina. Not long after this he was involved in a serious accident when his motorbike collided with a four wheel drive vehicle. He seems to have suffered relatively serious orthopaedic injuries, and an ongoing post-traumatic stress disorder. This combination of events seems to have derailed his life. He eventually returned to the motor trade, this time involved with motorbike spare parts, but not with the success he had enjoyed in his earlier years.
	
	
	After the accident his sister assumed responsibility for rearing his sons and the offender seems to have descended into alcohol and substance abuse in early middle age. He acquired tattoos and became socially withdrawn. At the time of the offence he was drinking heavily, and smoking cannabis, on a daily basis. This substance misuse is said to have been a form of self-medication to relieve his symptoms of PTSD.
	
	
	It is not said these symptoms should be taken as reducing his culpability for the present offending. Doubtless, his anxiety and depression which are symptoms of his post-traumatic stress disorder may make his time in prison somewhat more onerous.
	
	
	The offender had no criminal record until the age of 40 when he committed a fairly serious crime of dishonesty. No doubt his prior clean record until that time justified the leniency he then received. It is likely that that offending was emblematic of the unexpected changes his life was then undergoing. There was no further offending until 2012, the year of the offending at hand. In August 2012, he pleaded guilty to the offence of driving with the mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol in July of that year for which he received a bond under s 10 Sentencing Act.
	
	
	In August 2012 he was arrested on a charge of enhanced indoor cultivation of cannabis for commercial purposes with his business partner. The sentencing judge, her Honour Judge Wells who dealt with him for that offence accepted that the business partners embarked upon this enterprise when their original plans to restore the building where the cannabis was grown for the purpose of a motorcycle repair workshop struck financial difficulties. The sentencing judge accepted the offender’s motivation was to resolve his precarious financial situation rather than pure greed. Their efforts were not necessarily competent as the cannabis leaf recovered by police was of poor quality and in mouldy condition. The judge took into account a deemed supply charge arising out of the same facts in sentencing the offender to an intensive correction order of 20 months duration running from the date on which sentence was passed, namely 24th October 2013. That he is currently in custody on remand for this offence probably puts him in breach of that order. That is not a matter for me but for the parole authorities.
	
	
	As the Crown accept, this criminal record does not disentitle the offender to some degree of leniency in the present matter. There is no previous crime of violence. It may be said there are two matters of significance of a disparate type but neither was considered by the respective sentencing court to warrant stern punishment.
	
	
	On the other hand, at the time of the commission of the offence of manslaughter the offender was at conditional liberty serving his s 10 bond and on bail for the drug offences. I will treat this consideration as an aggravating factor of significance as the law requires when determining the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	It can be seen that the three offences in 2012 all related to misuse of drugs and alcohol and occurred within the space of two months between July and September 2012.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard considered that there was a relationship between his post-traumatic stress disorder and his substance misuse. Since his arrest he has received treatment for this condition but the treatment has not cured it as the results of the tests administered by Ms Robilliard show. But it has stabilised and he seems much better now than before the offending.
	
	
	From character references tendered on behalf of the offender and from his previous criminal record, I am satisfied that this crime of violence is entirely out of character for the offender, who had a past history of being a hardworking member of the community before his various misfortunes. The various referees write of the offender being a previously loving, kind and caring person who contributed to the community prior to losing his way after the breakdown of his marriage.
	
	
	Apparently since his arrest, he has complied with his medical treatment, and has remained abstinent of drugs and alcohol. He has not committed any offences or breaches of prison discipline whilst he has been in custody on remand, a total period of about 1 year and 5 months. Moreover, there is no suggestion that he in any way breached the intensive correction order he was serving in the community between 24th October 2013 and his remand after the jury’s verdict on 27th October 2014.
	
	
	The offender told Ms Robilliard that he frequently thinks of the victim’s family and hopes they can find it in their heart to forgive him. He feels “that the remorse is going to kill him”. His referees all speak in various ways of him being remorseful for taking Mr Morris’ life. For instance, the partner of his youngest sister wrote the following:
	


He was able to acknowledge and articulate the consequences of his actions. He genuinely displayed a sense of sadness for the individuals and families whose lives he had altered, both that of the victims and his own family. I felt I was witnessing positive and sincere change in a man who I now had reason to respect.

This referee had not known the offender in his previous productive years.


	
	I find that he is now remorseful for his crime and I regard him as unlikely to reoffend in this way again.
	
	
	As I have recorded, the offender has no recollection of his offending, but has seen the CCTV footage recorded by the bank security camera. After an enhanced version of that footage was provided to his lawyers in late August 2014, the offender, on 24th September 2014, offered to plead guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Morris. This offer was rejected by the prosecution. The Crown accept that I should allow some discount on the sentence I would otherwise have passed for the utilitarian value of the offer. As the offer was made somewhat in advance of the Trial, I think the proper discount is 15 per cent, rather than 10 per cent contended for by the Crown.
	


Relevant principles


	
	The nature of the sentencing task is to fix the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender, having regard to all relevant facts, matters and circumstances. A sentence must fit the offending having regard to its objective seriousness; that is the offender must be adequately punished for his offending. At the same time, a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the crime.
	
	
	I bear in mind that the maximum penalty for manslaughter under s 24 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is imprisonment for 25 years. This not a case to which s 25A of that Act applies as the offending precedes its enactment.
	
	
	It goes without saying, I think, that no penalty other than a period of fulltime imprisonment is appropriate in this case.
	
	
	The starting point of assessing the objective seriousness of any case of manslaughter is the consideration that the offender by his violent conduct took a human life (Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600 [53] - [55]). The general rule is that it is necessary that violent offending be justly punished to vindicate the human dignity of the victim, to protect the community and to deter the offender and others. Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, but they must not be allowed to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	The Court must eschew any attempt to put cases of manslaughter into preconceived categories. Such categories do not exist. Each offending must be assessed by reference to all of its circumstances.
	
	
	In R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 (at [216] - [217]) the Court of Criminal Appeal said:
	


… the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place is of great concern to the community, and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence…..

General deterrence and retribution are elements that must assume greater importance when the crime in question is a serious one, has been committed in a particularly grave form and its contemporary prevalence is the cause of considerable community disquiet: R v Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 299.


	
	In R v MD [2005] NSWCCA 342; 156 A CrimR 372 at 387 [65], the Court of Criminal Appeal said:
	


In many cases where an offender is convicted of manslaughter there will be exculpatory matters and personal circumstances that can lead the court to significantly ameliorate the sentence which might otherwise be imposed. However, as this Court pointed out in R v Troja (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 606394, 16 July 1991) it is important for the court to ensure that the subjective circumstances of an individual offender do not divert the court from imposing a sentence which adequately reflects the part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and in punishing those who take it.


	
	In passing sentence on the offender for this offence, I am taking into account the further offences contained in the Form 1. It is important to bear in mind that I am sentencing the offender only for the principal offence. It is not part of my task to determine appropriate sentences for the further offences or to determine the overall sentence that would have been appropriate for all the offences and then apply a discount. I also bear in mind that in taking the further offences into account, I do so with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the principal offence. This is because the existence of the further offences for which guilt is admitted, but no conviction recorded, increases the relevance of personal deterrence. The community’s entitlement to retribution for serious offences is enlarged by the existence of further offences, with which the offender has been charged and which he has admitted. However, retribution is extracted only for the principal offence, for that is the only offence for which the offender will be sentenced: Abbas v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [257]. Conversely in taking the further offences into account, I must have regard to the criminality involved in them. The further offences are matters which necessarily bear upon the judgment to be reached about the appropriate sentence for the principal offence. No sensible bearing can be taken from the further offences unless some assessment is made of the criminality involved in the further offences.
	
	
	The additional criminality involved is relevant to the application of the principal of totality because it involves consideration of whether the sentence imposed represents a proper period of incarceration for the total criminality involved. (Abbas at [258] – [259]).
	
	
	An important consideration may be that the principal offence is not an isolated instance but part of a course of offending conduct: Dionys v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 272 at [64] – [66]. At the same time, bearing in mind that the procedure is beneficial, the penalty imposed is likely to be “significantly less” than the total which would have been imposed had each offence been prosecuted separately: R v Harris (2001) 125 A Crim R 27 at [27].
	
	
	Finally, it is necessary for me to take into account the period of pre-sentence custody served by the offender whilst on remand: s 24(a) and s 47(2) Sentencing Act. The offender was arrested on 17th September 2012 and held on remand until 23rd October 2013 when he was granted bail in respect of the present offence. As I have already said on the 24th October 2013 the District Court imposed an intensive correction order for the drug offences which is served in the community. I remanded him in custody before sentence following the jury’s verdict on 27th October 2014. It is clear to me that in imposing an intensive correction order, her Honour Judge Wells did not take into account the pre-sentence custody from 17th September 2012. I infer that she treated that time in custody as having been served on remand for the present offence. Accordingly, the offender has never received his entitlement to have that period of custody taken into account. Given this, I am obliged by law to take the whole of the pre-sentence custody into account. This amounts to a period of about 1 year and 5 months.
	
	
	Pre-sentence custody can be taken into account either by backdating the commencement of the sentence or by discounting it. There is a firm rule of practice in New South Wales in favour of backdating rather than discounting (Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30). This should be applied even where as here, the pre-sentence custody has been discontinuous. Accordingly, I will take that approach in this case. This will lead to some artificiality in that the sentence will cover the time the offender was at liberty conditionally serving his intensive correction order.
	
	
	For these reasons I will backdate the commencement of the sentence I impose to 27th September 2013 to take into account the discontinuous periods of pre-sentence custody served by the offender in accordance with law.
	
	
	In legal theory, the principle of totality suggests that in fixing this sentence some account should be taken of the intensive correction order for the drug offences. However, I understood both counsel to accept that there was no practical means of addressing this given the detailed provisions made in respect of breach and revocation of intensive correction orders by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW). That legislation confers functions on the Commissioner of Corrective Services and the State Parole Authority rather than the Court. As these detailed legislative provisions are within the power of the executive branch of government, I consider it appropriate to leave the ramifications of the sentence I impose for the intensive correction order to those proper authorities.
	


Comparable sentences


	
	Mr Young provided me with a number of recent decisions concerning sentencing in cases involving manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. I have read these cases for the purposes of distilling some of the principles I have set out above. I have not found it helpful to tabulate the individual sentences passed in those cases because of their diverse circumstances and by reference to the consideration that it may be misleading to attempt to categorise cases of manslaughter according to preconceived superficial factual similarities.
	


Decision


	
	I have set out my views as to the objective seriousness of the present offending at [37] – [38] above. This case is different from some other cases of drunken, public violence. The offender did not single out an unsuspecting innocent bystander for the infliction of gratuitous violence. Without in any way blaming Mr Morris for what happened there does seem to have been an angry exchange of words between two intoxicated, middle-aged men, each of whom should have known better. Moreover, Mr Morris was willing to grapple with the offender and initially seems to have obtained the upper hand. The offender’s culpability consists of escalating the violence after Mr Morris attempted to disengage from him.
	
	
	In fixing the appropriate sentence for this offence and this offender I bear firmly in mind the considerations of denunciation, punishment and general deterrence which call for the emphatic sentencing response discussed in Loveridge. As I have tried to demonstrate, the subjective circumstances of the offender are in some respects compelling. However, it is important that I am not diverted by them from imposing a sentence “which adequately reflects the part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and punishing those who take it” (R v MD at [65]).
	
	
	It is also necessary for me to reflect in the sentence I impose for the principal offence the further offending admitted by the offender. The additional criminality involved in those further offences bears upon the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	A compelling feature of this case is the spate of diverse relatively significant offending over a short period of time between July and September 2012. Manifestly, this includes the three offences committed on 15th – 16th September 2012. I accept this offending is related to, and partly explained by, his misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs. I accept that that in turn was a misguided form of self-medication in relation to his chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. This consideration however does not mitigate the offending. I accept that he is now abstinent and that his psychiatric illness is being treated appropriately, although its symptoms continue. If the offender can maintain his resolve to remain abstinent during the term of imprisonment I will impose and beyond, his abstinence bodes well for his rehabilitation, an important object or purpose of sentencing law. Moreover, I accept he is now remorseful for what he has done. His previous good record also suggests he is unlikely to offend again.
	
	
	I also bear in mind that because of his age, related general health issues and particularly the ongoing symptoms of anxiety and depression related to his PTSD, imprisonment is likely to be harder for him than for others.
	
	
	As I have said I propose to allow a 15 per cent discount on the sentence, which would otherwise have been imposed to reflect the utilitarian value of the offender’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter. But for this I would have imposed a term of imprisonment of 10 years. The discount reduces the sentence to one of 8 years and 6 months.
	
	
	I am required to fix a non-parole period reflecting the minimum term justice requires the offender to serve before release into the community. It should not be thought that release at the expiration of the minimum is a foregone conclusion. It will depend upon many things, including the offender’s continued good conduct whilst in prison. The question of whether the offender will be released is not for this Court; that is a decision that will be made according to law by the appropriate branch of the executive government in due course.
	
	
	There is a statutory relationship between the head sentence and non-parole period which may only be varied if a finding of special circumstances is made. In deciding whether there are special circumstances, it is important that there be no double counting in respect of the subjective features I have already taken into account in fixing the appropriate sentence. Bearing this consideration in mind, I am not satisfied that a finding of special circumstances is warranted in the present case. The statutory ratio will be maintained subject to the need to avoid the artificial appearance of precision involved in calculations expressed in days rather months. I fix a non-parole period of 6 years and 4 months.
	
	
	As I have already said, it is appropriate to backdate the commencement of the sentence to take account of the period of about 1 year and 5 months the offender has served in custody on remand. He received no credit for that in the sentence imposed upon him in respect of the drug charges. Taking this factor into account, I propose to commence the sentence on 27th September 2013.
	
	
	Paul Lane, by its verdict the Jury convicted you of the manslaughter of Peter Morris. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 6 years and 4 months commencing 27th September 2013 and expiring on 26th January 2020 with an additional term of 2 years and 2 months commencing on 27th January 2020 and expiring on 26th March 2022. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 27th January 2020.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Nature of application

A Release Application was heard in the Supreme Court on 2 February 2015 in relation to the respondent. Davies J granted conditional bail on that occasion.


	
	The bail conditions imposed were:
	



	
	That the accused enter into an agreement to observe the following specified requirements as to conduct while at liberty on bail:
	



	
	To be of good behaviour.
	
	
	To report to the Blacktown Police Station once daily between 8am and 6pm on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday.
	
	
	Not to apply for any new passport or travel document.
	
	
	To live at xxxxx with Aboulgasim Yagoub.
	
	
	Not to associate or communicate by any means with the victim of the offences charged.
	
	
	Not to travel to Liverpool, except for the purpose of attending court or seeing his lawyers.
	
	
	Not to have any contact in any way (including via a third party) with his brother, Hussein Kugor, TE and FA.
	
	
	To appear at Campbelltown Local Court on 11 February 2015 and thereafter as required.
	
	
	To comply with a curfew: The applicant is not to be absent from the address at which he is required to live between the hours of 8pm and 6am.
	
	
	That one acceptable person deposit the sum of $5,000 in total in cash and enter into a bail security agreement or agreements to forfeit the amount if that person fails to comply with the bail acknowledgment. An acceptable person is the applicant’s father, Abdel Rahman Kurtikaila.
	



	
	The Crown brought a Detention Application (the application) pursuant to s50 of the Bail Act 2013 (the Act). That application was opposed by the respondent and was heard by the Court on 18 February 2015. The Court refused the Detention Application and advised that it would provide reasons in due course. These are the reasons.
	
	
	It was common ground that the application before the Court was to be heard de novo.
	


The Crown case


	
	The Crown case as presented on this application was as follows. While there are some aspects which could be regarded as beyond argument, it will be appreciated that there are others which are liable to be contentious.
	
	
	On 21 June 2014 the complainant, who was then aged 16, was sitting outside the Liverpool Library when approached by four men of African appearance. This was confirmed by CCTV film. The respondent and his identical twin brother sought to persuade the complainant to go with them to a nearby car-park but she initially refused. After some further conversation, it was established that the complainant and the young men had a mutual friend called Jason and the complainant agreed to accompany the four men to the car-park from where they would drive to visit Jason.
	
	
	The respondent and his brother walked with the complainant to the car-park while the other two men went away. The CCTV film showed that these other two men continued to wait in the vicinity outside the stairwell where the complainant said the offences took place. These two men were juveniles.
	
	
	When the complainant entered the stairwell to the car-park, the respondent grabbed her and forced her to engage in fellatio. This lasted about 10 minutes. The respondent then pushed the complainant to the floor of the stairwell and engaged in vaginal intercourse which she described as “aggressive and forceful”. The complainant did not scream because she was afraid. The respondent held her by the front of the neck as he had intercourse with her. He did not use a condom and the complainant did not believe that he had ejaculated.
	
	
	The respondent’s brother then approached the complainant and forcefully lifted her from the ground by taking her wrist. He walked her out of the stairwell to the ground level of the car-park where he pushed her to the ground and forced her to engage in fellatio for about 15 minutes. The complainant said that he was “extremely forceful” and was holding her head throughout. The respondent’s brother then pushed her to the ground, pulled her skirt up and engaged in vaginal intercourse. The complainant did not believe that he had ejaculated. He did not use a condom. She did not see the respondent while this was happening.
	
	
	The respondent and his brother then left. When the complainant went to her handbag, she noticed that her mobile phone had been taken.
	
	
	A witness “A” had observed the four young men accompany the complainant into the car-park. Sometime later, he saw three of the young men running with their heads down. A short time after that, he saw the complainant walking towards him. She was shaking and said “They took my purse and my phone. I want my phone back. I got raped.”
	
	
	The witness called triple 0 and the complainant spoke to the operator. She said:
	


“Some guys tried to rape me … well … but one of them did it with me.”

The operator asked if she was “raped by one of them” and she said “Not really, well it was but it wasn’t”. When asked how many males there were she said “Six but only two of them did it”. The complainant told the operator that they were African. The operator asked whether they had sexually assaulted her and she said “Well they kind of …”.


	
	The police interviewed the respondent on 22 July 2014. He agreed to the following matters:
	



	
	On the evening of 21 June 2014 he had been with two friends and his identical twin brother.
	
	
	He had spoken to the complainant that night.
	
	
	He and his brother had gone to the stairwell with the complainant but they had come out of the stairwell together.
	
	
	The complainant’s phone was taken from her handbag but he did not know who took it.
	
	
	He and his companions had run away because they had just stolen a phone.
	
	
	He identified his companions from the CCTV film.
	
	
	He denied that anything of a sexual nature had occurred. He could not explain how there would be a male DNA profile inside the complainant.
	



	
	The respondent’s identical twin brother refused to participate in an interview with the police.
	
	
	The complainant identified all four accused young men from photos which she was shown.
	
	
	DNA evidence was obtained. The effect of the DNA evidence was that it matched the DNA of both the respondent and his identical twin brother. This DNA profile was taken from locations on the complainant, including her vagina and mouth. Semen was detected in some of those locations.
	
	
	Because the respondent and his brother were identical twins, the DNA evidence was consistent with:
	



	
	DNA originating from the respondent only.
	
	
	DNA originating from his twin brother only.
	
	
	DNA originating from both the respondent and his brother.
	


The chance of the DNA coming from someone else was one in one hundred million.


	
	The respondent was in custody from 22 July 2014 until his release to bail on 3 February 2015, i.e., approximately six and a half months. While in custody, the respondent was attacked by a group of prisoners causing him to be admitted to St Vincents Hospital. He was transferred to another prison. While in custody he was “in protection” which meant that he was locked in his cell from 3pm to 7am daily. Since his release, he has been able to obtain employment and is currently working as a labourer. He has no drug or alcohol problems.
	
	
	The respondent is aged 20. He came to Australia in 2004 with his parents, two sisters and twin brother. He has another brother, who was born in Australia, who is 8 years old. The respondent was born in the Sudan but is now an Australian citizen. The respondent’s mother lives in Townsville with his younger brother and two sisters. His father was living with them but came to Sydney for his bail application and intends to remain in Sydney until the legal proceedings involving the respondent and his brother are finalised.
	
	
	The respondent has a partner and an eight month old daughter. They do not reside with him but he sees his daughter three – four times per week.
	
	
	The complainant was a stranger and he had had no contact with her before 21 June 2014 and has had no contact since. He says that he has no knowledge of where she lives and has no reason to attend the Liverpool area. He currently has no passport.
	
	
	The respondent has a minor criminal record. He was convicted of an offence of common assault, which occurred at 11pm on 23 February 2014. The background to that offence was an altercation which arose between the respondent’s brother, another friend and the victim at Fairfield railway station. This led to an attack by the respondent’s brother and the friend on the victim in which the respondent joined. The respondent does not appear to have played any part in the events leading up to the physical assault. He was convicted at Fairfield Local Court on 31 March 2014 and received a bond under s10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be of good behaviour for 2 years.
	
	
	Arising out of the events of 21 June 2014 the respondent has been charged with the following offences. Two counts of aggravated sexual assault in company; one count of robbery in company; two further counts of aggravated sexual assault in company. Those latter two offences are based on the Crown’s contention that he was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with his brother to enable his brother to commit the two sexual assaults attributed to him.
	
	
	The Court was advised by the Crown that the prosecution brief had been provided to the respondent’s legal advisors. No response had been received. No committal proceedings have yet taken place. It was common ground that the earliest date on which the matter could proceed to trial would be October 2015 and that the trial date might well be later.
	


The Detention Application


	
	It was common ground that the offences with which the respondent has been charged do not come under s16B of the Act which means that the respondent does not have to show cause why his detention is not justified. Accordingly, the question of whether or not the respondent should be detained in custody depends upon whether the Court is satisfied that the respondent constitutes an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	The relevant sections of the Act provide:
	


“17(1)    A bail authority must, before making a bail decision, assess any bail concerns.

(2)    For the purposes of this Act, a bail concern is a concern that an accused person, if released from custody, will:

(a)    fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence, or

(b)    commit a serious offence, or

(c)    endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or

(d)    interfere with witnesses or evidence.

(3)    If the accused person is not in custody, the assessment is to be made as if the person were in custody and could be released as a result of the bail decision.

…

19(1)   A bail authority must refuse bail if the bail authority is satisfied, on the basis of an assessment of bail concerns under this Division, that there is an unacceptable risk.

(2)    For the purposes of this Act, an unacceptable risk is an unacceptable risk that the accused person, if released from custody, will:

(a)    fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence, or

(b)    commit a serious offence, or

(c)    endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or

(d)    interfere with witnesses or evidence.

…”


	
	The bail concerns to be considered as part of the assessment are set out in s18 of the Act. It was agreed between the parties that the following paragraphs of s18(1) were relevant to this application:
	


“18(1)   A bail authority is to consider the following matters, and only the following matters, in an assessment of bail concerns under this Division:

(a)    the accused person’s background, including criminal history,

circumstances and community ties,

(b)    the nature and seriousness of the offence,

(c)    the strength of the prosecution case,

…

(f)    whether the accused person has a history of compliance or non-compliance with bail acknowledgments, bail conditions, apprehended violence orders, parole orders or good behaviour bonds,

(g)    whether the accused person has any criminal associations,

(h)    the length of time the accused person is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused,

(i)    the likelihood of a custodial sentence being imposed if the accused person is convicted of the offence,

…

(l)    the need for the accused person to be free to prepare for his or her appearance in court or to obtain legal advice,

…

(p)    the bail conditions that could reasonably be imposed to address any bail concerns in accordance with section 20A.

…”


	
	The Crown has not established that the respondent will fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence. He is living with his father and a family friend. He has strong family ties to Australia in that all of his family reside here and he is an Australian citizen. He does not have a passport and has undertaken not to apply for one while these proceedings are pending. He has a partner and an eight month old child. Most importantly, his father has made a deposit of $5000 which will be forfeited if he fails to attend any proceedings for the offences with which he has been charged. Nothing was put to the contrary except that the offences are serious and provide an incentive for leaving the jurisdiction.
	
	
	I accept that the offences are serious. It is also clear that if the respondent is found guilty of any of the offences, he will certainly receive a custodial sentence.
	
	
	I have concluded that the prosecution case is reasonably strong. It does, however, have its difficulties. The robbery offence cannot be made out on the facts alleged. At most, the facts support an offence of “stealing from a person”, although it is not clear what part if any the respondent played in the taking of the phone.
	
	
	What the complainant said in her triple 0 phone call does create some difficulties for the Crown. This is particularly so when an identical twin is involved and the DNA evidence is not able to distinguish between the respondent and his identical twin brother. These difficulties are not insurmountable for the Crown but they do exist. A difficulty for the respondent is the fact that he told the police no sexual activity took place, which is clearly contradicted by the DNA results. Taking all those matters into account, I have concluded that the Crown case is reasonably strong.
	
	
	The respondent has a relatively minor criminal record, with only one serious matter on it, being the “common assault” which occurred in February 2014. While the facts relating to that offence show others initiated the altercation, the respondent did participate in it for which he received a 2 year good behaviour bond. These offences, if proved, occurred within 3 months of the good behaviour bond being imposed. This gave rise to a concern as to whether the Court could be satisfied that the respondent would observe his bail conditions and not engage in further offending.
	
	
	There is a possibility that he will commit further offences and the evidence that he committed the subject offences while on conditional liberty argues against him. However, those concerns can be adequately met by the imposition of strict bail conditions.
	
	
	My reasons for reaching that conclusion are these: His criminal record to date is relatively minor. He has now spent over 6 months in custody during the course of which he was bashed by other inmates. The respondent would now be well aware that any breach of bail conditions, and most particularly any offending at all, will result in him returning to custody until these offences have been finalised. He is subject to a curfew condition which will be further strengthened by an enforcement condition which will enable the police to check whether the curfew is being complied with. It is well recognised that offending during daylight hours (particularly offending of a sexual kind) is much less prevalent than at night.
	
	
	A matter of concern to the Court is the delay likely to be experienced by the respondent before these matters are finalised in court. He has already spent 6½ months in custody and if the Crown’s application were granted, on the most optimistic estimate he would spend a further 9 months in custody before this matter could come to trial in the Campbelltown District Court. As was fairly conceded by the Crown, the time in pre-trial custody might well be longer. It is a very serious matter to deprive a citizen of liberty for such a long period of time when he has not been convicted of any offence. This is particularly so when such custody will be served under conditions of “protection” which are more onerous than those experienced by the normal prison population.
	
	
	When all those bail concerns are taken into consideration, the only real concern is whether the respondent is likely to commit further offences while on bail. For the reasons indicated, that possibility derives some but only limited support from his criminal history. To the extent that it remains a continuing concern, it can be met by the curfew and enforcement conditions which have been imposed. On the other hand, there are a number of compelling reasons why the detention application should be refused. These include the likelihood of lengthy pre-trial custody and the absence of any previous serious criminal offences.
	
	
	It follows that I am not satisfied that the granting of bail to the respondent will create an unacceptable risk.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	The Crown’s application for a Detention Order is refused. The respondent’s bail should be continued under the conditions imposed by Davies J on 2 February 2015. At the request of the Crown, the Court has imposed the following additional Enforcement of Curfew condition to the bail conditions already imposed:
	


“Enforcement of Curfew Condition:

The Respondent is to present himself at the front door of his residential address at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the curfew condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy.”

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

After a trial before Maiden SC DCJ and a jury, the applicant was found guilty on 30 September 2013 of the following offences:


	
	Break enter and commit a serious indictable offence, indecent assault, in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Intentionally inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, contrary to s61K(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s112(2) is imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. The maximum sentence for an offence contrary to s61K(a) is imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced by his Honour to an aggregate term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years to commence 7 March 2013 and to expire 6 March 2019 and an additional term of 3 years to expire on 6 March 2022.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the offending and finding that it was “near what is described as the highest level of offending behaviour”.

Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offending.

Ground 3 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	On 7 July 2012 the applicant was on bail, a condition of which required him to attend a residential rehabilitation facility conducted by “We Help Ourselves” in respect of an alcohol addiction. The rehabilitation program required attendance for four months. The applicant was discharged on 6 July after one month due to his aggressive and non-compliant behaviour.
	
	
	Following his discharge from the rehabilitation facility, the applicant consumed a number of alcoholic beverages with a friend before purchasing further alcohol at a bottle shop. At approximately 3pm on 7 July he entered a gated retirement community in Port Macquarie and approached an elderly couple and their three grandchildren, asking directions to a certain address in the village. He was directed to a house owned by the victim and walked towards that house. Shortly afterwards screams were heard coming from the house and the applicant was seen by a neighbour running from the victim’s house. The neighbour tried unsuccessfully to apprehend him.
	
	
	The victim, who was aged 71, opened her front door leaving the screen door closed and locked when the applicant rang her doorbell. The applicant asked whether there was a “Julie” there, to which she replied that there was not. When the victim unlocked the screen door and went to step out to speak to the applicant, he pushed her back inside.
	
	
	The applicant pushed onto the front of her chest with both hands, causing her to fall onto the floor just inside the front door. The applicant closed the front door and started shouting at the victim to take her pants off. The applicant put his hand over the victim’s mouth and pulled at her pants and partly removed them from her waist. He put his hands into her underpants and felt the outside of her vagina.
	
	
	When the victim resisted and started to scream, the applicant pushed his hand over her mouth. He was kneeling over the victim, who was still lying on the floor. When she continued to scream, the applicant shoved both his hands onto her mouth to quieten her. The victim described herself as lying on the floor with her face being pushed into the ground. The applicant moved away when the doorbell rang. The victim had bruising and lacerations to most of the front part of her face, cuts to her lips, hands and significant bruising to her arms and hands.
	
	
	The applicant was identified as a result of information obtained from the victim and from persons in the retirement village to whom he had spoken. When interviewed by the police, the applicant denied any involvement in the offences.
	


Proceedings in the District Court


	
	When his Honour was reciting the facts relating to the offences he said:
	


“[The applicant] appears to have hit her with his fist to the face on a number of occasions and to other parts of her body.”

It was common ground that this misstated the facts in that there was no evidence that the applicant had hit the victim with his fist on any occasion.


	
	His Honour reviewed the applicant’s subjective case. He was born in 1986 and was 25 when the offences occurred. He was raised in a loving and caring household. At an early age he was diagnosed with ADHD and had difficulties at school. His literacy and numeracy skills were limited and he left high school at an early age because of behavioural problems.
	
	
	The applicant became involved in drugs of various sorts in his teenage years which led to criminal behaviour. From 2005 he engaged in offensive behaviours which developed into a series of assaults and assault police matters. His criminal record included call ups for breaches of bonds and other matters. The Court had regard to three criminal matters which had occurred before this offending: an assault incident in a hotel on 22 December 2011, an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 14 March 2012 and damage to property which occurred on 31 May 2012. On each occasion, the applicant was affected by alcohol.
	
	
	His Honour noted that it was against that background while on conditional liberty that the applicant had attended the fulltime residential rehabilitation centre for one month before the offences.
	
	
	His Honour summarised his conclusions as to the applicant’s subjective case as follows. He was a young man with learning disabilities which adversely affected his ability to gain meaningful work. He had had significant behavioural problems from an early age which had not been successfully addressed. He was an alcoholic who was also using illicit substances. His Honour found that when consuming alcohol, the applicant was unable to control his behaviours. The applicant had never previously come under notice for any sexual matter.
	
	
	His Honour summarised the effect of the offences on the victim as follows:
	


“Critically, what it has left is a woman of senior years living as a widow who, for a period of time, has had to deal with the fears arising from her being alone, that is, of walking alone in parts of her environment where she had previously walked without fear. She was of the view that a trial in this matter would not be necessary and she identifies the trauma that she faced in having to undergo and revisit these traumatic events and injuries inflicted upon her. She is also a woman who has suffered cancer and has had years of dialysis in respect of renal difficulties, and in respect of her appearance before this Court was a woman who showed great dignity and presence of mind in the way that she gave her evidence and responded to what was, as I have already indicated, a traumatic event for her.” (ROS 4.6)


	
	His Honour reviewed a pre-sentence report which had been prepared by Ms Cox, a Senior Community Corrections Officer. Ms Cox was surprised that there had been no previous sexual incidents before these offences. The only link which she could find between his past behaviour and these offences was his inability to control his actions when under the influence of alcohol.
	
	
	His Honour also reviewed a report of Dr Christopher Bench, psychiatrist. Dr Bench concluded that the abuse of alcohol had played a significant part in the offending, particularly because the applicant had been substantially abstaining from alcohol for about a month while in rehabilitation. Dr Bench did not diagnose any mental health condition but attributed the applicant’s anti-social behaviour to his poly-substance abuse, in particular his abuse of alcohol. Dr Bench attributed the cause of this offending to be the applicant’s abuse of alcohol.
	
	
	His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending as follows:
	


“In respect of the seriousness of the offending, this Court finds that it is near what is described as the highest level of offending behaviour and in respect of the two matters the Court proposes to deal with them concurrently because effectively they were all part of the same actions that gave rise to the injuries to the victim.” (ROS 7.4)


	
	His Honour took into account general deterrence and concluded that the sentence must be such as would deter persons from not only committing such offences but even contemplating such an offence against a woman of advanced age and dignity who was isolated and vulnerable. His Honour took into account specific deterrence given the applicant’s lack of insight and his lack of remorse.
	
	
	His Honour set out the aggravating features of the offences as follows:
	


“In respect of the other matters that I do need to consider in respect of the degree of severity of the matter, this was a matter where (1) he effectively misled the victim into a position in which she found herself; (2) that it was at her home; (3) that she was a vulnerable person; and (4) it was at a time when he had been released on parole and having been released from his rehabilitation he must have known that if he offended in any way that he would be back in custody straight away. As I have already stated, this man at this point of time lacks insight into his offending ways.” (ROS 8.9)


	
	His Honour was prepared to find special circumstances. His Honour then imposed a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 3 years in respect of both offences. The sentence imposed by his Honour was clearly intended to be an aggregate sentence, even though his Honour did not in terms comply with the provisions of s53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This, of course, does not invalidate the sentence and no point was taken in relation to s53A in the appeal.
	


Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the offending and finding that it was “near what is described as the highest level of offending behaviour”.


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s approach to the objective seriousness of the offences was erroneous. He submitted that the offences could not be said to be “near the highest level of offending behaviour”. While conceding that the offending was abhorrent, he submitted that in order to assess their objective seriousness, it was necessary to compare the offences with other offences of that type.
	
	
	The applicant placed before the Court a number of cases, which characterised the particular offending under consideration, as being either the “worst case” or being in the “worst category” of case. The applicant noted that while there was no definitive statement of what a “worst case” means, some guidance could be obtained from Regina v Twala (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 November 1994) where it was said:
	


“In order to characterise any case as being in the worst category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed).”

He submitted that the facts of these offences did not reach that standard.


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s factual error in finding that the applicant had punched the victim, led to an incorrect assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. He submitted that for a case to be in the “worst category” what was required was a degree of heinousness that extended beyond what is ordinarily present in offences of that type. In that regard, the applicant submitted that the offence committed on the premises was at the lower end of the scale of what could constitute a “serious indictable offence” being an indecent assault of moderate seriousness.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that to categorise an offence as approaching the worst case, more was required than that the case be regarded as a very serious one (R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297 at [54]). He submitted that while the case was serious, it was demonstrably below the worst category of offending so that there was error in the approach of the sentencing judge when he assessed the objective seriousness of the offence.
	


Consideration


	
	As was properly conceded by the Crown, his Honour’s finding that the applicant punched the victim in the course of the assault was not correct. That error, however, had little effect on the assessment of objective seriousness of the offences. This is particularly so when an elderly woman was forced to the floor in her own home, was sexually assaulted and where her assailant forced his hands onto her mouth to stop her screaming. This occurred in circumstances where the elderly victim was left with bruising and lacerations to her face and mouth. Accordingly, while factual error has been identified, it was of little consequence.
	
	
	It should be noted that in the course of submissions, the applicant moved from relying upon what his Honour actually said as to the objective seriousness of the offending to a discussion of what actions would constitute the “worst category” or “worst case” for offences of this kind. That is to misunderstand what his Honour said. His Honour at no time characterised the offences as being in the worst category or worst case. The effect of what his Honour said was that the offending was near to the worst category or worst case (see [19] hereof). That is an important distinction.
	
	
	Another difficulty for the applicant is that his submissions somewhat artificially compartmentalised the elements of the offences as the only indicia of seriousness. In particular, the applicant made no mention of major aggravating features such as the vulnerability of the victim and the effect of the offences on her. The effects of the offences upon the victim in terms of physical injury and consequent impairment, disability and emotional and psychological consequences are important considerations (Little v R [2010] NSWCCA 210 at [31] per Hall J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Simpson J agreed). Moreover, an assessment of a case as being near the worst category of offence will not be regarded as erroneous merely because even worse cases can be envisaged than the case under consideration.
	
	
	The difficulty confronting the applicant in these submissions was identified by Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) in Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] where his Honour said:
	


“37    Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.”


	
	The applicant has also ignored the fact that this was an aggregate sentence imposed for two serious offences, each of which carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. This was an important guidepost which supported the assessment by his Honour of the objective seriousness. When one adds to that the circumstances of the offending, the vulnerability of the victim and the effect on her, together with the other aggravating features - that the offence occurred in her home while the applicant was on conditional liberty, his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending was well open to him.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offending.


	
	It was common ground that at the time of the offending the applicant was not on parole, but on bail. The applicant submitted that this factual error led to his Honour not properly considering the issue of totality. What seems to be suggested, albeit faintly, is that his Honour should have backdated the commencement date of the sentence to have regard to the fact that the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 months, commencing 8 July 2012, for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The submission went no further than that.
	


Consideration


	
	There are two difficulties with the submission. The first is that being on parole or being on bail in the circumstances of this case is a distinction without a difference. The important matter is that s21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 identifies the aggravating factor as being “the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty”. Both parole and bail constitute conditional liberty.
	
	
	The other difficulty insofar as the commencement date of the sentence is concerned arises from the sentence proceedings themselves where the following occurred:
	


“CROWN: Whilst Mr Kendall has been in custody since the day of his arrest being 13 July 2012 your Honour will note from the criminal history that he has served concurrent sentences for unrelated matters during that time, the longest of which is a non-parole period of 8 months which expired on 7 March 2013. The Crown’s submission would be any sentences that your Honour imposed should date from 8 March 2013.

SENIOR COUNSEL FOR THE APPLICANT: We agree with that your Honour.” (T 22.11.2013 .1)


	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.


	
	The applicant submitted that the individual sentences were manifestly excessive as was the overall sentence imposed. While accepting that no specific error was identified, the applicant submitted that the sentence was unreasonable and unjust and that his Honour’s sentencing discretion had accordingly miscarried.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the following cases to establish that the sentence was manifestly excessive: R v Shillingsworth [2003] NSWCCA 272; YS v R [2010] NSWCCA 98; R v Andrews [2011] NSWCCA 24 and Thompson-Davies v R [2013] NSWCCA 75.
	
	
	In R v Shillingsworth the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years imposed after trial for an offence against s112(2). In that case the serious indictable offence was sexual intercourse without consent.
	
	
	In YS v R the sentence imposed at first instance was imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, the applicant being aged 16 at the time of the offending. The offence involved a series of sexual assaults on the complainant in her bed and involved the deprivation of liberty. Subjectively the applicant had mental health issues.
	
	
	In R v Andrews the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The aggravating circumstances of this offence were that it occurred in the victim’s home, the applicant knew she was there and he was subject to a good behaviour bond at the time. There was a degree of planning and deception involved in the offence. The Court of Criminal Appeal refused to increase the sentence, although it noted that it was very lenient.
	
	
	In Thompson-Davies v R the applicant had confronted the victim in the kitchen, pushed her against a bench and sexually assaulted her by touching her breasts. At first instance he received a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 7 months. The Court of Criminal Appeal found that the sentence was manifestly excessive and it was reduced to imprisonment for 6 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the sentences imposed in those cases were all substantially lower than that imposed in this case and that in at least two of those cases, the offending was significantly more serious. The applicant submitted that these cases provided a basis for a conclusion that the sentences imposed here were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In the alternative, the applicant submitted that these were the first offences which involved offending of a sexual nature. He submitted that he had desisted when someone rang the doorbell. He submitted that the sexual assault while serious was towards the lower level of seriousness. He submitted that if those matters were taken into account, the sentence imposed was crushing for an applicant, who apart from an earlier sentence of two months in custody, was in effect serving a custodial sentence for the first time. This was so if one took into account that this sentence was being served immediately after the 8 months of imprisonment received for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in those circumstances, the Court should re-assess the sentence for itself pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	


Consideration


	
	The utility of referring to four decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal involving s112(2) offences and the reference to sentencing statistics in relation to such offences is problematic. This is because s112(2) offences cover such a wide range of offending and factual circumstances. Observations to that effect were made in Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24 per Howie J at [33], Thompson-Davies v R (supra) at [55] – [56]. Such a small sample of cases as was referred to by the applicant does not establish any sentencing range, particularly for an offence as broad as s112(2).
	
	
	As has been often stated by this Court “to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge.” (Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33].)
	
	
	Similarly in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25] the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said:
	


“25   As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King, itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender's appeal, as ""manifest excess"", or in a prosecution appeal, as ""manifest inadequacy"".

…

27   Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.”


	
	It follows from that statement of principle, that a sentence is not wrong because it is not the same as the sentence imposed in what are said to be comparable cases, particularly when the facts of such cases are significantly different and where one is looking at a sentencing range.
	
	
	As McHugh J said in Markarian:
	


“65   Unfortunately, discretionary sentencing is not capable of mathematical precision or, for that matter, approximation. At best, experienced judges will agree on a range of sentences that reasonably fit all the circumstances of the case. There is no magic number for any particular crime when a discretionary sentence has to be imposed.

…

66   This passage is not a testament of despair but a perceptive understanding of the reality of the sentencing process by one of the greatest judges that the common law system of justice has produced. It recognises that the judge must weigh all the circumstances and make a judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence. In R v Williscroft, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria referred to this value judgment as an ""instinctive synthesis of all the various aspects involved in the punitive process."" This was a candid recognition of the fact that in the end sentencing depends on the judge's assessment of what is the correct sentence. There is no objectively correct sentence, only a range of sentences that the majority of experienced judges would agree applied to the case. …”


	
	Applying those principles to the facts of this case, it cannot be said that the sentence itself is reflective of error. The sentencing judge correctly identified the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending and found that general deterrence and specific deterrence were important elements in determining an appropriate sentence. He accurately recorded the aggravating features associated with these offences. The subjective features of the applicant were modest and did not significantly mitigate the objective seriousness of the offences. Although the applicant was intoxicated, this is not a mitigating feature. On the contrary, it demonstrated a propensity for violent behaviour when under the influence of alcohol and was indicative of a need for protection of the community and for specific deterrence.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

Judgment 1 – Objection to Dr Coulton’s fourth report


	
	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiffs tender a fourth report of Dr Coulton dated 24 February 2015, that is to say today, and served belatedly today on the first day of the hearing, contrary to directions previously made in the case as to the service of evidence, including expert evidence. In part, the report responds to an equally belated third report of the defendant’s expert, Mr Gower, dated 23 February 2015, which was served yesterday. The first 11 paragraphs of Dr Coulton’s report are, it is not disputed, legitimately in response to Mr Gower’s belated report, to which the plaintiff has not taken objection on the basis that they are not unable to meet it and that Dr Coulton’s fourth report addresses it.
	
	
	The defendants, however, object to the balance of Dr Coulton’s fourth report –being the second paragraph 10 through 14 of that report. In that part of his report, Dr Coulton substitutes, for the adjustments to the HIH accounts which he assumed in his earlier reports (which were based on those found to be appropriate by Owen J in the HIH Royal Commission), a single adjustment for the year ended 1999 and another single adjustment for the year ended June 2000, both on account of the “Hanover Reinsurance overstatement” (as I shall call it for present convenience) – in the first case of $92.4 million, and in the second case of $108 million as to operating profit and $192 million as to assets. This is to be contrasted with the adjustments assumed in Dr Coulton’s earlier reports which, for present purposes, can conveniently be identified from paragraph 84 of his report in the Baldock proceedings, identifying a total of $577 million of adjustments for the year ended 30 June 1999, of which $92 million was attributable to Hanover, and $1,175.3 million for the year ended 30 June 2000, of which $192 million was attributable to Hanover.
	
	
	In other words, it will be seen that the adjustments to the published HIH accounts upon which Dr Coulton’s earlier reports were based included, but went far beyond, the adjustments in respect of the Hanover Reinsurance contracts. In the fourth report he provides for an adjustment only in respect of the Hanover Reinsurance contracts, and exclude the other adjustments which he had earlier assumed. This is evidently in response to the defendants’ notified objections to Dr Coulton’s earlier reports. Although formalised in the notice of objection served before the hearing, those objections had been foreshadowed at least six months ago.
	
	
	The defendant’s response to Dr Coulton’s earlier reports involved two main approaches. The first was to object to their admissibility, in whole or in very substantial part, essentially on the basis that the main assumptions upon which they rely were not properly proven. There are three limbs to that submission. The first relates to reliance on data from the Morningstar DatAnalysis Premium database, the authenticity, provenance, reliability, professional acceptability or other admissibility of which is said not to be established. The fourth report does not address that objection, which remains to be considered. The second limb to the argument concerns the reliance of the earlier Coulton reports on agreed or admitted facts recorded in the sentencing remarks in two related criminal proceedings. That also is not directly addressed by the present report, although it is conceivable that the report, if admitted, would result in the plaintiffs no longer relying on those matters. What this fourth report does directly address is the third limb of the objection, which is the reliance of Dr Coulton in his earlier reports on adjustments to the HIH published accounts found to be appropriate by Owen J in the report of the HIH Royal Commission.
	
	
	Objection was taken to the admissibility of the Royal Commission report in these proceedings, and thus to the reliance by Dr Coulton on conclusions reached or evidence given in those proceedings, for assumptions which it seemed were not otherwise able to be proved in this case. If, as now seems likely, Dr Coulton’s evidence is to be limited to the impact of the adjustment in respect of the Hanover reinsurance contract, then the likely rejection of reliance on the HIH report would not affect that, as the amounts of the overstatements in the published accounts referable to the Hanover reinsurance contracts are now the subject of a statement of agreed facts in these proceedings: see PXO1, paragraphs 6 and 10.
	
	
	The defendants legitimately ask why it has taken until now for this to be done when the objection was foreshadowed, as I have said, six months ago, and that is a perfectly reasonable complaint. On the other hand, the defendants have not submitted that they are unable to deal with this evidence, or are otherwise prejudiced by its reception into evidence.
	
	
	As it seems to me, the so-called new evidence is well within the scope of the dispute already defined by the experts. It is commonplace in litigation, simple or complex, for some of the assumptions upon which an expert relies to be the subject of successful objection, or to be demonstrated to be wrong in the course of the evidence. In such a case, it is equally common for the expert to be asked for the consequences for her or his opinion if that particular assumption be rejected or not available. Sometimes the expert will say that the removal of certain assumptions makes no difference whatsoever. On other occasions, the expert will say that it completely undermines the opinion. In yet other cases, the expert will say that it requires some modification to the opinion. That is exactly what is happening in this case. The expert is effectively being asked to assume that not all the adjustments which he formerly assumed should be made are to be made, but only one of them, and to express his opinion based on that single adjustment instead of the multiple adjustments.
	
	
	For that reason, I can well understand why no complaint of inability to deal with this has been made.
	
	
	In addition, a substantial attack on Dr Coulton’s evidence is directed not to the assumptions that he made, but to his methodology, and in particular the model he uses for deducing value. That attack is, it seems to me, quite unaffected by this evidence, and if correct, would demonstrate that Dr Coulton's approach, which has not changed save for the assumptions on which it relies, is an unacceptable one.
	
	
	For those reasons, it seems to me that, first, the evidence, though belated, is well within the scope of the disputed territory between the experts as already defined; secondly, it has not been shown that its reception will cause any prejudice to the defendants; and thirdly, it is tendered to cure potential defects that would be occasioned by the probable rejection of many, or at least some, of the assumptions on which Dr Coulton has hitherto made.
	
	
	I therefore decline to reject paragraphs 10 through 14 of the report. I will deal with the report generally, and any specific objections to it, once I have dealt with the others of Dr Coulton's reports.
	


Judgment 2 – Objection to Morningstar Data


	
	HIS HONOUR: As I foreshadowed in the last evidentiary judgment delivered, one of the objections to Mr Coulton’s first, second and third reports is that it relies on data extracted from the Morningstar DatAnalysis Premium database, which appears to be a website that records data from the financial statements of listed companies, but as Mr Lockhart SC correctly points out, goes beyond just replicating that data, because it includes ratios and multiples that one would not normally expect to see in a company’s published financial statements. Relevantly for present purposes, in that category it includes the “ROE” or “return on equity” ratio, and the “price to book value” (“PBV”) valuation multiple, along with many others. It seems likely that that involves the application of some analysis, although it could be purely mathematical, to the published financial statements of the companies in question.
	
	
	The plaintiff tenders, at tab 74 of the tender bundle, the material extracted from Morningstar in respect of a number of insurance companies that are, for valuation purposes, said by the plaintiff to be comparable to HIH. In his first three reports, Mr Coulton used in particular the ROE ratio and PBV multiple of those comparable companies, for the purpose of a regression analysis to enable him to deduce a formula for attributing a value to shares in HIH.
	
	
	The defendants object to the tender on the basis that there is no evidence as to the way in which any such analysis of the financial statements was undertaken by Morningstar, or as to whether ROE was calculated in the way in which Mr Coulton defines it in Appendix C, in which he says:
	


We next define Return on Equity (ROE) as income divided by beginning-of-period shareholders’ equity (i.e. ROEt = Incomet/BVEt-1), and GROWTHt-1 as cumulative growth in shareholders’ equity through the beginning of future year t (i.e., GROWTHt-1 = BVE t-1/BVE0).


	
	Although it was submitted that this indicated that return on equity, as defined by Mr Coulton, involved a growth component, as well as dividing income by beginning of period shareholders’ equity, I do not think that is at all what Mr Coulton says. He proffers a definition of return on equity, and then in the same paragraph a definition of growth, separated by the conjunction “and”. That this is so is clearly illustrated by the two separate equations set out in parentheses in that passage.
	
	
	The experts were required, pursuant to (NSW) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, r 31.24, to confer generally and endeavour to reach agreement on matters in issue and to prepare a joint report specifying matters agreed and matters not agreed and reasons for any disagreement. They have done so.
	
	
	In Mr Gower’s first report, he identified (at paragraph 37) the 36 observations relied on by Dr Coulton for his return of equity calculation, and (at paragraph 38) the 31 observations that he was able to identify, and another five which were said not to be set out in the Coulton report, for price to book value. In Dr Gower’s second report, the same material appears at paragraphs 158, 159 and 160. In paragraph 39 of the first report, he said that in the absence of data for the abovementioned five observations for price to book value, Dr Coulton’s linear regression model was unable to be replicated from the data provided. At paragraph 160 of the second report, he said that the linear regression model was based on adding a further eight observations, and then at paragraph 161, that in the absence of data for the abovementioned five observations, his linear regression model was unable to be replicated.
	
	
	In the experts’ joint report following the directed conference, the agreed matters include (at 4(g)):
	


Dr Coulton’s regression calculations and model in the Second Coulton Report and the Third Coulton Report are agreed (ie. the mechanics of the model) as providing an accurate assessment of the data inputs and summary output. Similarly, Mr Gower’s “theoretical value” calculations of comparator companies in the Second Gower Report at paragraph 123 is agreed.


	
	I interpose that I do not suggest that that involves any express agreement to the accuracy of the data inputs, but then (in 4(h)):
	


In respect of the First Coulton Report, five of the price book value figures used in the calculations have not been disclosed, as summarised in the First Gower Report at Table 2 and the Second Gower Report at Table 9. These data points can be determined by reference to the Second Coulton Report and the Third Coulton Report.


	
	Amongst the disagreed matters (at 2(f)) are:
	


The comparator entities’ results are for 1993 to 2000 and therefore do not reflect the financial results and position of these entities at the valuation dates.”


	
	Mr Gower’s comment on that issue is:
	


The price earnings ratios which Dr Coulton adopts reflect historic prices and earnings which variously range over the period FY 1993 to FY 2000. These ratios therefore do not necessarily reflect the position of these comparator companies at the relevant valuation dates causing reliance on these ratios (to the extent that they have any relevance) for valuations of HIH at the valuation dates to be inappropriate.


	
	As it seems to me, Mr Gower disputes the relevance and suitability of the data as appropriate comparables, but I can find nothing in the joint report, nor in his own reports, to indicate any suggestion that, insofar as it goes, the data is otherwise than reliable, or taken from a reliable and reputable source. In short, I do not see that there is any dispute between the experts as to the reliability of the data that Dr Coulton has extracted from Morningstar. That data has been in the possession of the defendants for quite some time, and had they wished to dispute it, they have had ample opportunity to investigate its source and origin and ascertain whether there is in truth anything to be disputed about it. The best that could be said on that question today, when asked whether the material was genuinely in dispute, was that “it may be”, essentially depending on what was established about its provenance.
	
	
	(NSW) Civil Procedure Act 2005, s 70(1)(a) and (b), provide as follows:
	


(1) At any stage of the proceedings, the court:

(a) may, by order, dispense with the rules of evidence for proving any matter that is not bona fide in dispute, also with such rules of evidence as may give rise to expense or delay, and

(b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), may, by order, dispense with the proof of handwriting, documents, the identity of parties or parcels of land, or of authority,…


	
	In Williamson v Mig Aero Pty Ltd (unreported, NSWSC, McLelland J, 27 June 1990), his Honour employed the predecessor section, namely (NSW) Supreme Court Act 1970, s 82, to dispense with the rules of evidence to the extent that they would require strict proof that a microfiche of a telephone record was a business record of Telecom Australia. His Honour said:
	


I do not consider that there is any implied limitation on the power expressly conferred on the Court by s 82 other than that ordinarily applicable to discretionary powers of a procedural nature, namely that the Court should act in the manner which it considers best calculated to advance the interest of justice in the particular circumstances.

In my opinion, expense and delay would be incurred if the defendants were required to formally prove the status of the document in accordance with the strict rules of evidence to an extent not justified by the requirements of justice as between the parties and I am of the view that the interests of justice would be promoted by the making of an appropriate order under s 82 enabling proof of the document as a business record of Telecom through the evidence of whoever it was that procured it from Telecom.


	
	In Ishac v David Securities Pty Ltd (unreported, NSWSC, Young J, 13 December 1991), his Honour considered the tender of a transcript of evidence given in other proceedings. His Honour said:
	


A further question arises as to the scope of s 82 itself. As is truly said by the editor of the Supreme Court Practice, it is significant that although in other States the comparable provision has been read restrictively, in New South Wales the provision occurs in the Act rather than in the rules and the approach of New South Wales Courts from the section’s inception was to read it purposefully and expansively. The purpose of the section is to avoid a waste of time at trials.


	
	These cases were summarised by Sperling J in Roach v Page (No 26) [2003] NSWSC 1045 (at [10]) where, though rejecting the tender of a document under the section, his Honour said:
	


The section reposes a wide discretion in the Court. It is not a discretion hedged in by conditions express or implied: Ishac v David Securities. The Court should act in the manner it considers best calculated to advance the interests of justice in the particular circumstances: Williamson v Mig Aero.


	
	The matters that I consider relevant here are, first, that on the face of the documents tendered, they appear to be produced regularly from an independent source and extracted in the course of the operations of a business providing information to the investment community from the published records of listed corporations; secondly, that the material has been the subject of deployment in Mr Coulton’s expert report and available for consideration by Mr Gower, who has taken issue with many aspects of Mr Coulton’s report, but not the reliability of the data on which he relies; thirdly, that the material is apparently available from a public source and could easily have been investigated, examined, and considered by the defendants if they genuinely wished to dispute its reliability; and fourthly, there has been no indication of any actual dispute as to the reliability of the material.
	
	
	Accordingly, both because I do not consider that the matter is bona fide in dispute, and also because requiring strict proof of the material would give rise to expense and delay, pursuant to Civil Procedure Act, s 70, I order that so much of the rules of evidence be dispensed with as would preclude the reception into evidence of the material at tab 74, which is therefore admitted.
	


Judgment 3 – Objection to Arthur Andersen Letter


	
	The document at tab 51 is objected to. It is a letter of 16 May 2000 from Arthur Andersen to an officer of HIH, and is tendered to prove the knowledge of the recipient, and potentially others, of the incorrect treatment of the Hannover reinsurance contracts in the HIH accounts. The defendants object that it cannot do so.
	
	
	The allegation of misrepresentation is admitted on the pleadings. The amount of the misrepresentation is the subject of the statement of agreed facts. Proof of knowledge on the part of the misrepresentor is not a material fact in a claim for misleading and deceptive conduct such as that pleaded in this case against HIH. Knowledge would be relevant only to the accessorial liability case against C&G and FAI. The plaintiffs submit that, as the reinsurance arrangements were arrangements of those companies and were reflected in their accounts, it may be possible to infer that officers of those companies were aware of the Arthur Andersen letter.
	
	
	If that were the only issue in respect of the letter, I would be inclined to admit it on the basis that, with other evidence, it might just arguably be able to support such an inference. However, the document is plainly addressed not to the accounting treatment of the reinsurance contracts, but to their taxation treatment. When one reads the advice, it is clear that it is reliant on ""the current tax law and Australian Taxation Office practice"", and is directed to the classification of the contracts for income tax purposes. It refers to income tax rulings and the Commissioner's approach to such matters. It addresses the consequences that would apply under the Income Tax Assessment Act. It does not refer to accounting standards or ASX requirements in respect of financial statements. It expressly distinguishes, in the summary of the advice, the accounting classification and APRA treatment of the arrangement from its taxation treatment.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the possibility that this would support an inference that the controlled entities knew of the misclassification seems to me so remote as not to justify its admissibility. I reject the document at tab 51.
	


Judgment 4 – Admissibility of prior convictions


	
	The plaintiffs tender, behind tabs 84 and 85 of the tender bundle, the remarks on sentence of Wood CJ at CL in R v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315; (2005) 216 ALR 113, and of Bell J, as her Honour then was, in R v Fodera [2007] NSWSC 1194; (2007) 65 ACSR 109, in each case by tendering a copy of the reported judgment in the law report series to which I have referred.
	
	
	In each of these proceedings, the plaintiffs allege in the current version of their pleading that HIH Insurance Ltd engaged in certain misleading and deceptive conduct in connection with the published accounts for 1999 and 2000 by treating, in its consolidated accounts, the Hanover reinsurance contracts as true reinsurance rather than financial reinsurance contracts, and thereby overstating those accounts – in the first case by $92 million, and in the second case by $192 million. On that allegation, of course, the knowledge of HIH is not a material fact. However, the plaintiffs also allege that FAI General Insurance Company Ltd, which for convenience I refer to as FAI, and HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd, which for convenience I refer to as C&G, each of which were subsidiaries and controlled entities of HIH at the relevant time, are liable as accessories on the basis that they were knowingly concerned in HIH’s contravening conduct.
	
	
	As is well established [see, for example, Yorke v Lucas (1985) 158 CLR 661 and Giorgianni v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 473], an allegation that a party is liable as an accessory by way of being “knowingly concerned” in a contravention requires proof that the alleged accessory knew of the contravening conduct and participated in it. Here, it is alleged that the requisite participation was by including similar treatment of the Hanover reinsurance contracts in the accounts of the controlled entities, which were subsequently consolidated into HIH’s accounts. The knowledge that this was misleading is sought to be proved against the subsidiaries through relevant officers of C&G and FAI, and in particular Mr Williams and Mr Fodera.
	
	
	For present purposes, the argument has been limited to the remarks on sentence in R v Williams, and this judgment formally deals only with that tender, although it may well be that what I say will have the effect of resolving the questions that arise on the tender of the remarks in R v Fodera also.
	
	
	The judgment of Wood CJ in CL in R v Williams records that Mr Williams pleaded guilty to three counts in an indictment, the terms of which are then set out and which include, in at least the second count, that he made or authorised a statement which to his knowledge was misleading by overstating the operating profit for the 1999 year by $92.4 million. His Honour’s reasons also set out the terms of the indictment, including the particulars, and the agreed statement of facts which was tendered in the criminal proceedings and which set out the facts upon which it was agreed he was to be sentenced. The judgment also records that Mr Williams was convicted of the counts on which he was indicted. On its face, therefore, the judgment in question has the potential to prove that Mr Williams was convicted on at least one count which included, as an element of the offence, knowledge that a statement in the accounts for 1999 was misleading and, insofar as the agreed statement of facts might be admissible, further detail of his knowledge.
	
	
	However, Mr Williams is not a party in the present proceedings before me. Nor, at least so far as presently appears, is he to be a witness in these proceedings. It is sought to use his conviction, and perhaps also the statement of facts in the criminal proceedings, as proof in these proceedings against the companies of which he was a director of the requisite knowledge on their part of the false or misleading character of the accounts.
	
	
	In 1698, in R v Warden of the Fleet (1698) 12 Mod Rep 337, 339; 88 ER 1363, 1364, it was said:
	


Conviction at the suit of the King for battery et cetera cannot be given in evidence in an action for trespass for the same battery or vice versa.


	
	A little more recently, in Castrique v The Imrie (1870) LR 4 HL 414, 434, it was said:
	


A judgment in an English Court is not conclusive as to anything but the point decided and therefore a judgment of conviction on an indictment for forging a bill of exchange, though conclusive as to the prisoner being a convicted felon, is not only not conclusive but is not even admissible evidence of the forgery in an action on the bill, though the conviction must have proceeded on the ground that the bill was forged.


	
	Although there was some authority in the opposite direction [see, for example, In re Crippen (deceased) [1911] P 108, 113-114, in which it was suggested that evidence of a conviction might be at least prima facie, though not conclusive, evidence of the facts for which it stood], the question was resolved at common law by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd [1943] KB 587; [1943] 2 All ER 35, 41. That was a case in which one of the defendants in proceedings for damages for negligence had been convicted for careless driving in criminal proceedings. The other defendant in the civil proceedings was his employer, whose car the first defendant had been driving. It was held that the conviction for careless driving was inadmissible as evidence of negligence in the civil proceedings, essentially on the ground that the conviction merely proved that another Court, acting on evidence that was unknown to the Court trying the civil proceedings, was of the opinion that the defendant was guilty of careless driving. The judgment was explained relatively recently in this court by Campbell J, as his Honour then was, in Gonzales v Claridades [2003] NSWSC 508; (2003) 58 NSWLR 188, where his Honour said (at [66]) that it was the hearsay rule, possibly in conjunction with the opinion rule, that underlay Hollington v Hewthorn:
	


That the accused was guilty of whatever crime he had been held to have committed was a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the civil proceedings in which the evidence of the conviction was sought to be adduced and in which the appropriate participants in the criminal trial (judge and/or jury) intended to assert by that representation and hence were it not for s 92(2)(c), the hearsay rule as defined in s 59 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and as expanded by the definition of, ‘Previous representation,’ in the dictionary to that Act would apply to it. Further, that the person was guilty of the crime of which he had been convicted is at least arguably an opinion of the relevant participants in the criminal trial and so, were it not for s 92(2)(c), might possibly fall within the opinion rule as defined by s 76 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).


	
	However, the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn did not apply to admissions made in the course of the criminal proceeding, as distinct from evidence of the conviction itself, and this exception extended to a plea of guilty. In Hollington v Hewthorn itself, Goddard LJ, as the later Lord Chief Justice then was, said (at All ER 42E):
	


It may frequently happen that where bigamy or any other crime has to be proved in a civil proceeding the prisoner on his trial had pleaded guilty. Proof by a witness present at the trial of the confession is admissible because an admission can always be given in evidence against the party who made it. In the present case, had the defendant before the magistrates pleaded guilty or made some admission in giving evidence that would have supported the plaintiff’s case, this could have been proved, but not the result of the trial.


	
	That has been followed in this State by McClemens J, as the later Chief Judge at Common Law then was, in Rakay v MacFarlane (1961) 78 WN (NSW) 488, admitting in civil proceedings for ejectment a plea of guilty by the lessee in criminal proceedings to a charge of illegal use of the premises. His Honour said (at 492):
	


In this case the plea of guilty … is admissible as some evidence of a breach on the premises of the statutes relating to the sale of liquor.


	
	His Honour then referred to the passage from Hollington v Hewthorn which I have cited above.
	
	
	The defendant submitted that admissions are made only for the purpose of the proceedings in which they are made. That will often be the case in respect of formal admissions made pursuant to a notice to admit facts or announced by counsel in the course of proceedings. That was the case in the leading authority, referred to by the defendants, of Dawson v Great Central Railway (1919) 88 LJKB 1177 (in particular at 1181-1182) where counsel had admitted in the course of proceedings the manner in which the deceased had been killed and that the accident in question happened. After a new trial was ordered, the Court was asked to say that those who would conduct the case at the new trial would be at liberty to withdraw the admission or to make it again, and Swinfen Eady MR said:
	


The admission was only for the purpose of that trial. They may make another admission. It is not a question of withdrawal … they are not bound on the second trial by an admission made on the first trial for the purpose of that trial.


	
	I do not think that that establishes that all admissions made in the course of proceedings are made only for the purpose of those proceedings, although that will often be the case. It does not, in my view, extend to a plea of guilty which proceeds to found a conviction. A plea of guilty is not made for the purposes of the proceedings only, but involves, as it seems to me, an admission of the offence for all purposes. The conviction that it founds is, of course, conclusive.
	
	
	A statement of agreed facts, however, is in a different position and, in my view, the approach referred to in Dawson v Great Central Railway is applicable to a statement of agreed facts. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301, Goldberg J was asked to make orders pursuant to (Cth) Trade Practices Act, s 83, so that they could found subsequent civil proceedings. His Honour said (at [116]-[118]):
	


Where parties submit an agreed statement of facts, it may not be appropriate to regard formal admissions as findings of fact for the purposes of s 83. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2), above, Finkelstein J stated (at 183–4):

‘The general rule is that formal admissions are only binding for the purpose of the particular case in which they are made: Dawson v Great Central Railway (1919) 88 LJKB 1177 at 1181–2. It is not clear whether a judge who acts on formal admissions is making findings of fact. I rather think he is not, because the purpose of an admission, such as may be made in a pleading, is to dispense with the need to prove the admitted fact. That is quite different from a case where the judge hears evidence and makes findings based on that evidence.

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Monza Imports Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-843; [2001] FCA 1455, Carr J did not make findings of fact for the purpose of s 83 on the basis that the facts had not been established and tested before the court. At 43,440 he stated:

‘I am inclined to the view that the Parliament intended “… a finding of any fact by a court …” to mean a finding made after a hearing. The apparent purpose of the provision is to save inconvenience and expense in requiring a matter to be proved more than once, but at the same time protecting the interests of a respondent by conferring on such a finding only the status of prima facie evidence in subsequent proceedings.’

Carr J made similar comments in related proceedings, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Apollo Optical (Aust) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1456.

Even if these statements were not correct, it would seem, as a matter of principle, that where evidence has not been tendered, but the parties rely upon statements of agreed facts which have not been the subject of critical analysis by the court, it is inappropriate to make orders that would allow for an extended use of findings of fact, particularly use of those facts as prima facie evidence in related proceedings as envisaged by s 83…


	
	His Honour therefore declined to make any orders under s 83.
	
	
	I am not concerned with questions that arise under s 83 or its current equivalent. However, it seems to me that, generally speaking, statements of agreed facts in the context of criminal proceedings are to be taken to be agreed for the purpose of those proceedings only. They will often involve elements of give and take, both by the Crown and by the accused, in order to reach an agreed position that can be put before the Court in those proceedings. In principle, it seems to me, just as it seemed to Goldberg J in the passage I have mentioned, that where evidence has not been tendered and statements of agreed facts are put before the Court involving elements of compromise, it is inappropriate that they be treated as made for any purpose other than the proceedings in which they were made.
	
	
	That leaves the exception to which I have referred for a plea of guilty, or admissions made in the course of criminal proceedings that are not limited as being for the purpose only of those proceedings. For example, admissions made by the defendant in the witness box in the course of criminal proceedings would not be taken to be made for the purposes of those proceedings only.
	
	
	Such admissions and pleas of guilty are, on the authority of Hollington v Hewthorn, admissible against the same defendant in civil proceedings as admissions by that defendant, but it seems clear that in principle their admissibility is limited to proceedings in which the person who made those admissions is a party, as they are admissions by that party. It is not possible to treat a statement by a person who is not a party as an admission by a party, and the exception to the hearsay rule that makes admissions against interest admissible in evidence is founded on the fact that it is an admission by a party to the proceedings in which the admission is tendered. An “admission” by a stranger to proceedings is mere hearsay. A plea of guilty in criminal proceedings or an admission made in the course of criminal proceedings, if tendered in civil proceedings to which that person is not a party, is a mere out of court statement or previous representation and thus mere inadmissible hearsay, subject to a possible exception, to which I shall in due course come, for statements made by a person as to that person's state of mind.
	
	
	Before I come to that, however, one returns to the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn. That rule was the subject of considerable criticism, essentially on the basis that at least so far as a conviction (as distinct from an acquittal) was concerned, that conviction had to be proved to a high standard – a higher standard than the same matters would have to be proved in civil proceedings – and thus was valuable evidence of the facts of which it spoke. As a result of that criticism, the rule has been reformed by legislation in the United Kingdom, Queensland, South Australia, and ultimately in the Uniform Evidence Acts of 1995. In the United Kingdom, it was amended by the (UK) Civil Evidence Act 1968. In Queensland, (Qld) Evidence Act 1977 provided by s 79:
	


…

(2) In any civil proceeding the fact that a person has been convicted by a court of an offence is admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where to do so is relevant to any issue in that proceeding, that he committed that offence.

(3) In any civil proceeding in which by virtue of this section a person is proved to have been convicted by a court of an offence, that person shall, unless the contrary is proved, be taken to have committed the acts and to have possessed the state of mind (if any) which at law constitute that offence.

(4) This section applies-

(a) whether or not a person was convicted upon a plea of guilty; and

(b) whether or not the person convicted is a party to the civil proceeding.""


	
	Under that provision, Mr Williams' conviction would be admissible, because it is not a requirement that the person convicted be a party to the civil proceeding in which it is tendered. In South Australia, however, (SA) Evidence Act 1929 was amended so as to provide (by s 34A):
	


Where a person has been convicted of an offence or found by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction to have committed an offence and the commission of the offence is in issue or relevant to an issue in a civil proceeding, the conviction or finding is evidence of the commission of the offence and admissible in the proceeding against the person or a party claiming through or under the person.


	
	(NT) Evidence Act 1939 was amended to like effect. As will be seen, in distinction to the Queensland provision, the admissibility of the conviction is limited to a proceeding against the person in question or a party claiming through that person. Under that provision, Mr Williams' conviction would be admissible only if he were a party to these proceedings, or if it could be said that the defendants claim through him – a question to which, as will become apparent, I shall have to return.
	
	
	These issues were addressed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its “Interim Report: Evidence” (ALRC 26), which culminated in the Evidence Acts of 1995. A part of that report was directed specifically to the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn. The report deals with convictions, acquittals and civil judgments. The result is the regime now to be found in ss 91, 92 and 93 of the (NSW) Evidence Act 1995. Essentially, the Law Reform Commission recommended that convictions should be admissible, but only in proceedings to which the person convicted, or that person's privy, was a party. That recommendation was based on what was thought to be the relatively high probative value of a conviction, but recognised that it was merely evidence and neither conclusive nor gave rise to any presumption of correctness.
	
	
	As to acquittals, the Commission proposed that they not be admissible, since all they established was that the defendant had raised a reasonable doubt as to the allegation. As to civil judgments, it was recommended that they too not be admissible, because they did not involve the same high degree of proof as a criminal conviction. In that respect, the Commission said, in a passage that was cited by the Full Court of the Federal Court in National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd v Grosvenor Hill (Qld) (2001) 183 ALR 700, [47]:
	


Evidence of Civil Judgments

782. Proposal. It is recommended that a civil judgment not be admissible to prove the facts on which it is based. Its probative weight is considerably less than that of a conviction. It is founded upon the evidence chosen by the parties, who are not obliged to make available all known relevant evidence, as is a Crown Prosecutor. Further, the standard of proof is merely upon balance of probabilities and so there may be little to distinguish a successful or unsuccessful action by a plaintiff. The disadvantages of admitting evidence of a civil judgment (the potential for waste of time and costs in investigating the judgment, and the greater likelihood of challenge to the evidence) outweigh the minimal probative value of the evidence. An exception is made, however, in respect of grants of probate and letters of administration — as is the case in most jurisdictions.


	
	That exception is reflected in Evidence Act, s 92(1).
	
	
	I am of course not concerned in this case with the admissibility of a civil judgment, but I have referred to that passage because, in the context in which it appears in the Law Reform Commission’s report, it makes clear that the intent of s 91 was to address not what are sometimes conventionally, but not entirely accurately, described as judgments – being reasons for judgment or remarks on sentence – but the formal record of a judgment of the Court in a civil proceeding, analogous to the formal conviction or acquittal in a criminal proceeding. Thus what s 91 is addressing is the formal record of conviction, the formal record of acquittal or the formal judgment or order disposing of a case in a civil case. It is not addressing the reasons for judgment, the findings of fact made by a judge in the course of coming to the final conclusion, nor the remarks on sentence, all of which remain no more than the opinion of the judge.
	
	
	As Hunt AJA explained in the Court of Appeal in Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWCA 174, there may be some cases in which, quite apart from establishing the facts found in it, reasons for judgment might be admissible. But s 91 is an exclusionary provision, not a facultative provision. It does not make admissible anything that was not formerly admissible at common law. At least so far as they deal with matters of fact, reasons for judgment and remarks on sentence are inadmissible hearsay or opinion, excluded by the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn and not made admissible by s 91. For that reason, I must respectfully disagree with the views of Button J in R v Jacobs (No 5) [2013] NSWSC 946, [23], where his Honour appears to have held that remarks on sentence are findings of fact admissible to prove facts that were not in issue in the criminal proceedings. The view that reasons for judgment or remarks on sentence are not admissible to prove the facts that they find is supported by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Livanes [2012] NSWSC 325, [9]-[10].
	
	
	That then brings me to one of the crucial questions, which is whether Mr Williams’ conviction is now made admissible by Evidence Act, s 92(2), which provides as follows:
	


(2) In a civil proceeding, section 91 (1) does not prevent the admission or use of evidence that a party, or a person through or under whom a party claims, has been convicted of an offence, not being a conviction:

(a) in respect of which a review or appeal (however described) has been instituted but not finally determined, or

(b) that has been quashed or set aside, or

(c) in respect of which a pardon has been given.


	
	As Campbell J explained in Gonzales v Claridades, to which I have referred, s 92(2) thus removes the basis for continuing to apply Hollington v Hewthorn in this State in civil proceedings where the person convicted is a party (or a person through or under whom a party claims) and where none of the exceptions in subparagraphs (a) through (c) apply. In enacting s 92(2), Parliament adopted the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, which in turn deliberately chose to follow the South Australian, rather than the Queensland, model of limiting the admissibility of evidence of a conviction to a proceeding in which the person convicted was a party or a privy of a party. The words used in the section “through or under whom a party claims” directly import the strict concept of privity that applies in the law of res judicata and issue estoppel. In the leading High Court authority on that question, Ramsay v Pigram (1968) 118 CLR 271, Barwick CJ identified the necessary relationship of privity in the context of issue estoppel in these terms:
	


The basic requirement of a privy interest is that the privy must claim under or through the person of whom he is said to be a privy.


	
	The correspondence of the words in that dictum with the terms of the section make very clear that what was intended to be captured was exactly the same concept. I dealt with this concept of privity in an earlier judgment in In the matter of HIH Insurance Limited (in liquidation); De Bortoli Wines (Superannuation) Pty Ltd v McGrath [2014] NSWSC 774, and described it –again by reference to the judgment of Barwick CJ in Ramsay v Pigram – in the following terms at [32]:
	


Privity of interest involves a mutual or successive relationship to the same right. The privy must claim ""under or through"" the person whose privy he or she is said to be. The concept is illustrated, albeit in the negative, by the judgment of Barwick CJ in Ramsay v Pigram [1968] HCA 34; (1968) 118 CLR 271 (at 279):

Here it is quite clear that the Government had no interest in the action between the respondent and the police officer: nor can it be said that the action brought by the police officer was brought by him in any sense on behalf of the Government or that in relation to the defence of contributory negligence the respondent could have been treating the Government as the real 'defendant' to that claim. In every respect the action between the respondent and the police officer was personal to each of them, neither being, in any sense in relation to the action or any of the issues involved in it, representative of another. Nor can it be said that the Government in any sense claims under or in virtue of the police officer or of any right of his, or that it derives any relevant interest through him.


	
	It is frankly difficult to conceive of circumstances in which a party to a criminal proceeding will have privies for the purpose of s 92(2). In any event, in this case it cannot be said that in the proceedings against Mr Williams in which he was personally the defendant, he was in any way representing the companies of which he was a director. They had no stake in that proceeding. In the words of Barwick CJ, it cannot be said that the companies of which he was a director were the true defendants to the criminal proceeding. In every respect, the action was between the Crown and Mr Williams personally and was personal to each of them. Mr Williams was not representing the companies. It was in respect of his personal discharge of his duties that he was charged and convicted.
	
	
	It occurs to me that there are some provisions in the (Cth) Corporations Act 2001 that make a company “and its relevant officer” guilty of certain offences upon certain matters being proved. It may be that in such cases it could be said that there is privity; but even if that is right, which I do not need to decide, this case is not one of them. It cannot be said that the companies of which Mr Williams was a director claim, in any sense relevant to the law of privity, under or in virtue of Mr Williams or of any right of his, or derive any relevant interest through him.
	
	
	As has been pointed out, to establish privity, the relationship must be such that the supposed privy obtains a benefit or incurs an obligation from the preceding action [see Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 3) [1970] Ch 506, 541; [1969] 3 All ER 897, 912]. The company obtained no benefit and incurred no obligation from the criminal proceedings against Mr Williams. It is not sufficient that the alleged privy is merely concerned – even commercially concerned – in the earlier proceeding, or provided financial backing to the party in them. The privity relationship must be such as to operate to bind the supposed privy to the earlier judgment, whether it has been in favour of or adverse to that party [see Carl Zeiss Stiftung, 541 & 912].
	
	
	Those requirements are plainly not satisfied in this case. In my view, it cannot be said for the purposes of s 92(2) that Mr Williams is a person through or under whom the defendants (or any of them) claim. Accordingly, s 92(2) does not operate in this case to make Mr Williams’ conviction admissible.
	
	
	I return then to the final potential exception. There is a long and well established exception to the hearsay rule in respect of statements made by a person as to that person’s state of mind. On that basis, it might be suggested that a statement by Mr Williams as to his state of mind – namely, his knowledge that the representation in question was misleading – might be admissible.
	
	
	In Thomas v Connell (1838) 4 M&W 267; [1838] 150 ER 1429, Parke B said:
	


…if a fact be proved aliunde it is clear that a particular person’s knowledge of that fact may be proved by his declaration.


	
	In that case, a bankrupt’s statement that he knew he was insolvent was held admissible to prove his knowledge of that fact at the time when he made a payment to the defendant. Although the statement was no evidence of the insolvency, it was evidence of his state of mind or his knowledge of the insolvency, if it be otherwise proved.
	
	
	However, the statements of the bankrupt held admissible in that case were contemporaneous, in the sense that they were made at or about the time of the insolvent transaction. In the report of R v Kay (1887) 16 Cox CC 292, a footnote records that, while in cross-examination, the mother of a woman who had gone through a form of marriage with the accused stated that her daughter had told her since the marriage that she was aware of the misdescription of her name in the bans, in which case the marriage would have been void. That statement was rejected on the ground that it was not evidence. It may have been different, it seems to me, had the statement to her mother been made before the marriage took place, because that would have demonstrated her state of knowledge contemporaneously or at the relevant time, but what was held in that case, in effect, was that a subsequent statement as to a former state of knowledge was not admissible.
	
	
	It is true that in the celebrated case of Sugden v Lord St Leonards (1876) 1 PD 154, Mellish LJ said (at 251):
	


I think there is a most material distinction, as was pointed out by Lord Campbell in Doe v. Palmer, between declarations made before a will is executed, and declarations made subsequently. The declarations which are made before the will are not, I apprehend, to be taken as evidence of the contents of the will which is subsequently made — they obviously do not prove it; and wherever it is material to prove the state of a person's mind, or what was passing in it, and what were his intentions, there you may prove what he said, because that is the only means by which you can find out what his intentions were.


	
	Again, what his Lordship was there saying was that where the intention of a testator is in issue, evidence of what the testator said before making the will was evidence of his contemporaneous intentions.
	
	
	It has always been considered that such statements are admissible only if they relate to the maker’s contemporaneous state of mind or emotion, so that the statement must be made at or about the time when the relevant event occurred [see, for example, The Queen v Hissey (1973) 6 SASR 280, 294 and Mobil Oil Corporation v Registrar of Trade Marks [1984] VR 25, 27]. Thus, though taken on their own, some of the dicta to which I have referred might suggest that statements by a person as to his knowledge are admissible in exception to the hearsay rule, once it is appreciated that the requirement of contemporaneity applies to them I do not see how that would permit the admission of a statement made some years after the event, in the course of a criminal trial, as evidence in other proceedings that the person in question had that state of mind at the relevant time.
	
	
	There are very good reasons for the requirement of contemporaneity. Essentially, the basis upon which such statements are admissible in exception of the hearsay rule is that they are spontaneous statements as to what a person has in mind at the time that the statement was made, not as admissions against the interests of a non-party.
	
	
	In any event, whatever might have been the position at common law, the Evidence Act, by s 66A, makes clear the requirement of contemporaneity.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it does not seem to me that Mr Williams’ plea of guilty can be received in these proceedings as evidence of his state of mind at the much earlier time that is relevant for present purposes.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, no basis for the admissibility of Mr Williams’ plea of guilty, nor of the statement of agreed facts, is established, and I would therefore reject the tender of the judgment in R v Williams.
	


Judgment 5 – Objection to Expansion of Particulars


	
	Counsel for the defendants has raised an apprehension that the plaintiffs may seek to enlarge their case, at least as to damages, outside the case as pleaded and particularised, and outside the evidence that has so far been served. Counsel for the defendants has not entirely disavowed some proposal to do so, but seeks to minimise it. There is before me at this stage no application or tender that calls for any ruling of the Court, and it is generally undesirable to make such rulings prospectively in terms of generality, rather than specifically when a particular application is put before the Court that enables the issues to be crystallised.
	
	
	Accordingly, I do not think it is appropriate at this stage simply to say that the plaintiff will or will not be permitted to do what it is apprehended the plaintiff might seek to do, unless and until the plaintiff seeks to do it. In that case, of course, the plaintiff would have to explain why it was doing so at so late a stage, and it may well be constrained in doing so if it were to occasion any irremediable prejudice to the defendant.
	


Judgment 6 – Objection to Dr Coulton’s Report


	
	Paragraph 49 of Dr Coulton's report is as follows:
	


The creation of the Converting Notes Prospectus document as part of the HIH takeover of FAI Limited is dealt with extensively in Volume II Section 14 of the HIHRC report. One of the primary issues was the fact that:

a significant collateral transaction was entered into between HIH and SGA the effect of which was not fully understood by the HIH board and was not disclosed in the prospectus (HIHRC, Volume II, page 230).

The relevant accounting issue here is that the liabilities of HIH were understated by $35million and shareholders’ equity overstated by the same amount.


	
	No one seriously suggests that the first two sentences are admissible, having regard to the approach that the Court has taken to the HIH Royal Commission report and its general inadmissibility in these proceedings. However, the plaintiff presses the third sentence of the paragraph.
	
	
	In the statement of claim in each proceeding, the following appears:
	


22.   On 26th November 1998 HIH and HIH Holdings (N.Z.) Limited (“HIH NZ”) issued a prospectus to raise up to $155million by unsecured converting notes (“the Prospectus”).

23.   The Prospectus stated that Societe Generale Australia Ltd (“SGAL”), a co-underwriter to the converting note issue, would take up as a priority allocation the lesser of 30 per cent of the amount to be raised or A$35 million.

24.   The Prospectus was misleading in that it did not disclose at that time that HIH and SGAL had entered into a transaction in October 1998 known as the “Total Return Swap” (“TRS”) the effect of which was that:

22.1.   SGAL’s subscription under its priority allocation of converting notes under the Prospectus was fully secured and risk free in that:

   i. HIH would deposit with SGA a sum equivalent to SGAL’s subscription; and

   ii. SGAL’s Subscription would be secured against any loss on re-sale of the converting notes by recourse to this deposit;

22.2.   The net amount available to the HIH group of companies pursuant to the Converting Notes issue would not include SGAL’s subscription as it was subject to a requirement that HIH deposit a sum equivalent to SGAL’s subscription with SGAL;

22.3.   It was never intended that SGAL would take up priority allocation the lesser of 30 per cent of the amount to be raised or A$35 million;

22.4.   SGAL never did take up a priority allocation the lesser of 30 per cent of the amount to be raised or A$35 million.

23.   The statement in the prospectus identified in paragraph 22 above was misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead and deceive in contravention of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1972 (Cth) and/or s. 995 and/or s. 999 of the Corporations Law.


	
	The defence denies that HIH issued the prospectus referred to, but otherwise admits paragraph 22; admits paragraph 23; in relation to paragraph 24, including its subparagraphs, admits that HIH entered into the “total return swap” identified in paragraph 24, admits that the prospectus was misleading in that it did not disclose that HIH had done so, and otherwise does not admit that paragraph; and in relation to the second numbered paragraph 23, repeats the response to paragraph 24 and otherwise does not admit the allegations.
	
	
	The essential question is whether Dr Coulton's statement – that the relevant accounting issue is that the liabilities of HIH were understated by $35 million and the equity overstated by the same amount – can be admitted on the footing that the matter is not in issue because of the pleadings.
	
	
	In my view, the pleadings establish by admission that the prospectus was misleading in the relevant respect, but the pleading says nothing about the financial statements and the accounting treatment of the $35 million in question. Dr Coulton's report proceeds to make adjustments to the financial statements based on reducing shareholders’ equity by $35 million on that account but, as it seems to me, there is no factual basis for that exercise on the evidence as it stands at this stage. The pleadings do not establish that the financial statements (as distinct from the prospectus) failed to make appropriate provision in respect of the $35 million which, as it seems to me, would be a necessary precursor to the calculations undertaken pursuant to the assumption or opinion expressed in paragraph 49.
	
	
	Accordingly, I reject paragraph 49 of Dr Coulton’s report.
	
	
	Although I had previously indicated that I would admit them – because the objection to them, I thought, was based only on the Morningstar data point – it would seem to follow that paragraphs 51, 52, 54 and 55 should also be rejected. Paragraph 53 goes with them. Paragraph 56 is admitted. Paragraph 57 is rejected. Paragraph 58 is rejected. I am inclined to admit paragraphs 59 through 61; although the summarised balance sheet is adjusted using the Royal Commission adjustments, the summarised balance sheet is of utility and it is easy enough to segregate those adjustments which are not founded on established facts or assumptions.
	
	
	Paragraph 62, the third sentence to the end is rejected. Paragraphs 63 through 66 are admitted. Paragraph 67 is admitted.
	
	
	Paragraphs 73 through 76, I am inclined to admit, as it seems to me that they are addressed primarily to the Hanover Reinsurance transactions. To the extent that the evidence does not support what is attributed to the HIH Royal Commission report, it will be of no value, but to the extent that the evidence in this case corresponds with what is extracted from that report, it may be. Essentially, I am treating what is attributed to the Royal Commission report as assumptions which do not prove themselves but will have to be otherwise proved.
	
	
	In paragraph 73, I would reject the sentence, “Owen J noted ... s 16.3.8.” In paragraph 75, I will attribute no significance to the fact that the matter is attributed to Owen J, but the sentence seems to express the author’s own opinion by the words “as noted”, and I will treat it simply as the author’s opinion. Subject to those qualifications, I would admit paragraphs 72 through 76.
	


Judgment 7 – Objections to Mr Gower’s Report


	
	Objection is taken to paragraphs 9 through 17 of Mr Gower’s report of 26 February 2015, the subject matter of which is a contention that, for the purposes of calculating return on equity, the operating result for the 12 months to 31 December 1999 has been understated (and that the loss has been overstated) by Dr Coulton, on account of the failure to exclude abnormal items said to total about $100 million.
	
	
	The abnormal items in question, although I have not at this stage resorted to the accounts to check this, prima facie appear to justify that description, although that will ultimately be a matter for exploration and further evidence if necessary.
	
	
	The plaintiffs objects to the tender on the basis that, coming when it does, they are deprived of a fair opportunity to respond to it. It is true that this material comes very late in the piece, and involves an adjustment of some potential significance, although as it impacts only on the calculation of ROE, I am not sure that its significance is as great as the plaintiff is presently asserting. The plaintiff submits that it would have affected the negotiation of the statement of agreed facts, but I cannot see how that is so: the statement of agreed facts deals with an amount by which operating profits are said to be overstated, and it makes absolutely no difference to what was agreed, whether that overstatement was before or after extraordinary items.
	
	
	The plaintiff complains that the matter has not earlier been adverted to, and it is true that the precise items in question have not earlier been pointed to, but the joint experts’ report states in paragraph 2(a) – the subject matter of which is Dr Coulton’s calculation of ROE as the ratio of reported net profit after tax to market price as stated on the ASX – under Mr Gower’s views, “This calculation has no regard for future earnings, expectations or abnormal/non-recurring items included in reported profits”. While it is true that that does not identify the two particular abnormal items now raised, there is a plain contention in that document that Dr Coulton's calculation failed to have regard to abnormal items included in the reported calculation of profits.
	
	
	Finally, the expert evidence has proceeded in this case, as it not uncommonly does, by a progressive refinement of the views of the experts as the reports have been exchanged, the conclave held, and further reports tendered, and further discussions or correspondence had between them or between the solicitors so as to reduce and/or refine the issues. It is regrettable that some of these matters have emerged only at the very last minute, but it seems to me that this is part of the typical ongoing process of refinement by discourse in which the experts more closely look at certain aspects as the issues become somewhat clearer. The plaintiff's objection to the lateness of this issue emerging may have been on firmer grounds had not Dr Coulton's last report been served about two days ago.
	
	
	I should say that it seems to me hardly controversial that it is usual practice to exclude abnormal and extraordinary items when valuing equity based on the return it generates, and I have already commented that prima facie the two items that have been identified do seem fairly clearly to fall within that territory. It may be that those views can be disturbed by the course of evidence, but it seems to me that least injustice is risked by admitting rather than rejecting this material.
	
	
	Accordingly, I admit paragraphs 9 through 17 of the report.

		15 August 2016",2015-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703891,R v Aller [2015] NSWSC 178,"REASONS FOR VERDICT


	
	The accused, Michael John Aller, was committed to this court for trial upon a charge that he murdered Amy Aiton at Narara on 31 July 2012. Because of mental illness he is unfit to stand his trial. A special hearing, pursuant to s 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, has been conducted before me, sitting without a jury. My task is to determine whether, on the limited evidence available, it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that he committed the offence charged or, alternatively, the offence of manslaughter.
	
	
	About 2 months before Ms Aiton met her death, she and the accused commenced an intimate relationship and he moved into her townhouse in Narara, near Gosford. It is not in dispute that in the afternoon of 31 July 2012 he killed her by stabbing her repeatedly with a kitchen knife during an argument. He placed the bloodstained knife into a knife block in the kitchen, changed his clothes, and drove to Gosford in Ms Aiton's car. He travelled by train to Sydney, where he spent the night drinking at a hotel in the CBD.
	
	
	At about 9.45am on 1 August, he rang his mother, who lived in Orange, on a payphone and asked her to call the police and direct them to the townhouse as he had ""just stabbed Amy to death."" His mother did so. Towards the middle of the day he made another call to his mother's home, which was answered by his step-brother. He repeated to his step-brother that he had killed Ms Aiton, asking whether he should give himself up. His step-brother said that he should. At about 2pm he approached a uniformed police officer at Central Railway Station, saying that he needed to speak with someone and that he was wanted for the murder of his girlfriend. He was arrested and conveyed to Surry Hills Police Station.
	
	
	At about 10am the same day police attended Ms Aiton's townhouse, where they found her lying on her bed facedown, covered with a blanket. They located the bloodstained knife in the knife block and saw a jumper and a pair of jeans, both bloodstained, which the accused had been wearing the previous day.
	
	
	Post-mortem examination of Ms Aiton's body disclosed numerous stab wounds, mainly to the upper left area of her chest and her upper back. There were numerous injuries to the heart and lungs. The pathologist who conducted the examination concluded that the attack was of a very violent nature, possibly occurring over several minutes, and that severe force would have been required to inflict some of the injuries, particularly where a number of ribs had been penetrated. Defence injuries were located on Ms Aiton's arms and hands, leading the pathologist to conclude that she was conscious during the attack and had tried to defend herself.
	
	
	It is also not in dispute that the accused stabbed Ms Aiton with the intent at least of causing her really serious bodily injury. On the material before me I am, in any event, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he stabbed Ms Aiton with that intent, causing her death. Accordingly, the elements of the crime of murder are established. The only issue I must determine is whether he has established the partial defence of substantial impairment, pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900, so as to characterise the killing as manslaughter rather than murder.
	
	
	On that issue I received psychiatric evidence in the Crown case and the defence case. The other evidence in the Crown case, which is undisputed, was presented in documentary form. It is helpfully summarised in the Crown case statement, which was read onto the record as the Crown prosecutor's opening address. The hearing focused upon the accused's account to police in a lengthy recorded interview, together with the psychiatric evidence.
	
	
	I received in evidence reports of two respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Richard Furst and Dr Olav Nielssen. Dr Furst, engaged by the accused's legal representatives, interviewed him on six occasions, for forensic purposes and also in his capacity as a consultant psychiatrist with Justice Health. His forensic task was to assess him for considering the defences of mental illness and substantial impairment, and his fitness to stand trial. He provided two reports relevant to the issue at hand, the first of 30 October 2012 (exhibit 1) and the second of 15 June 2013 (exhibit 2).
	
	
	Dr Nielssen, engaged by the Crown, saw the accused twice, in April and again in August 2013. He prepared a report of 4 September 2013 (exhibit C). Both experts gave oral evidence.
	
	
	It is necessary to sketch relevant aspects of the accused's background, disclosed in the reports and, to a limited extent, in the recorded interview. He was 46 years old at the time of the killing of Ms Aiton, and is now 48. He described a disturbed upbringing. He was an only child. His father was a violent man, given to alcohol abuse. His parents divorced when he was 11 and he never saw his father again. His mother formed a relationship with a man who had a daughter and son of his own. His step-father was violent towards him and towards his mother.
	
	
	He had a relationship with a woman for a period of 13 years, for the last 8 of which they were married. The marriage broke down in 2008. It seems that he was violent towards his wife during that relationship. He was controlling and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave him. He subsequently formed a relationship with another woman, who described him as jealous and threatening. In the recorded interview he admitted having assaulted her on an occasion in 2011. I should note that Dr Furst's first report refers briefly to statements by both those women. However, the tender of their statements was objected to and was not pressed.
	
	
	Important for present purposes is his long history of alcohol dependence. He had been a heavy drinker since his mid-teens. He drank mainly spirits, but also beer. He told Dr Furst that throughout his twenties, thirties and forties his daily consumption was either a case of beer or a bottle or more of bourbon whiskey. He experienced episodes of delirium tremens, with confusion and hallucinations. He had an early history of the abuse of cannabis and amphetamine, but abandoned those drugs in his twenties. His drinking was sometimes associated with violence. He acknowledged as much in the recorded interview (Q 461 ff), as he did his drinking problem generally. He said, ""I just can't stop when I start, and I black out."" He added that he normally drank Jim Beam and coke. As well as affecting his relationships, his drinking also compromised his employment.
	
	
	Over the years, his abuse of alcohol led on occasions to admissions to hospital and to rehabilitation programs. The two psychiatrists had access to records of his admission to hospital in the Orange area in 2008, following the breakdown of his marriage. He described feelings of distress at the end of the relationship, symptoms of amotivation, increased drinking, suicidal thoughts and thoughts of harming his wife and a person described as his ex-girlfriend. (Who that person was is not clear). He was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, alcohol abuse and dependent personality traits. He was prescribed anti-depressant medication. He was re-admitted a month later after allegedly throwing a brick through his ex-wife's house, in breach of an AVO. He had been acting in a threatening manner prior to that incident, mainly when intoxicated, and had ceased using his medication. There were no indications of psychosis and he was referred to a rehabilitation centre.
	
	
	In 2011 he was admitted to hospital in the Hunter area. He described feeling ""betrayed"" by the woman with whom he had formed the later relationship, who had taken out an AVO against him. He appeared to be thought disordered, describing auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions, symptoms which Dr Furst considered to be consistent with his being depressed and psychotic at that time. Diagnoses of schizophrenia and alcoholic hallucinosis, but also of malingering, were considered but apparently not confirmed. Again he was discharged with the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood and alcohol dependence, and prescribed anti-depressant medication.
	
	
	In October 2011, he was admitted to the Miracle Haven Rehabilitation Centre at Morisset, where he remained until June 2012. He was depressed at the time, describing recent thoughts of harming himself and his then ex-partner when he was heavily intoxicated. While at the Centre he engaged in therapy, acknowledged being an alcoholic, sometimes struggled to concentrate, and expressed a lack of self-esteem. No hallucinations or other signs of a major mental illness were recorded. Yet again, he was prescribed anti-depressant medication.
	
	
	It was shortly after he left Miracle Haven that he met Ms Aiton and commenced his relationship with her. She had suffered serious injuries in a car accident in 2004. She also suffered depression, and after her discharge from hospital she developed a serious dependence on cannabis.
	


The police interview


	
	The accused told police in the recorded interview that in the weeks leading up to Ms Aiton's death they had arguments about her cannabis use, its effect on her and the amount of money spent on it. (Qs 111-116) For his part, he acknowledged having begun to drink again on the very day he left Miracle Haven and for the few days thereafter. He stopped drinking for about a month, but began again a couple of days before 31 July. He said that he agreed with Ms Aiton that he could have a drink and she could have a smoke. (Qs 143-152) He did not take his anti-depressant medication on 31 July or the previous day. Asked how it affected him when he did not take his medication, he answered, ""Anti-depressants, you run rough if you don't."" (Qs 525-8)
	
	
	Turning then to the fateful day, his account in the interview of his movements during the morning is supported by other evidence. Put shortly, he left the townhouse to buy milk and cigarettes, obtain some cash from an ATM, and buy some cannabis for Ms Aiton. He bought a six pack of Jim Beam and coke at a liquor store. (Qs 154-172) At around midday he had two schooners of beer at a hotel, and at some stage he also drank two cans of bourbon and coke at a toilet in an arcade. These were not from the six pack which he had bought at the liquor store. He said that he bought them from a different liquor outlet, sat on the toilet and drank them as quickly as he could. Asked if he was affected by alcohol when he arrived back at the townhouse, he said, ""Starting to, maybe."" (Qs 486-504)
	
	
	The argument and the stabbing which ensued occurred in the bedroom. It was there, he told police, that he started drinking the six pack of bourbon and coke. Asked how many, he said that he was not sure. He added, ""I was drinking them very quickly … . Bang, bang, bang."" He drank them straight from the can. He was asked how he would normally be affected if he had drunk all six of them, noting that he was a seasoned drinker. He replied:
	


""I haven't been drinking lately at all. Yesterday was my first drink in quite a while, quite a few weeks, and it was just bang, bang, bang. I smashed them."" (Qs 188-192)


	
	He went on to say that an argument started and that bad things were said. He could not recall all that was said, but remembered that Ms Aiton called him a ""fuckin' dumb cunt"" to which he responded, ""You fuckin' bitch, don't speak to me like that."" He said that the argument developed, ""got way out of control."" (Qs 193-197)
	
	
	Earlier in the interview he said that, after he got back to the townhouse, he was drinking and Ms Aiton was smoking bongs for ""a good part of the next few hours."" Then an argument started ""just out of the blue."" He continued:
	


""This argument just started out of nowhere, and Amy pushed it and pushed it. I told her to stop. I'd had a few drinks. She pushed it. The words that were coming out of her mouth, the insults to me, then the insults towards my mother. Like, what is your mother, a fuckin' … compulsive lying old so-and-so. Again, Amy, don't push it. There was a little knife on the table next to her bed that she'd use … to clean … the cone of the bong. I glanced at it and she saw me glance at it, and she said, Go on, fuckin' do it, I want you to do it. You either do it, or I'm going to fuckin' do it to you. A few more things were said. I snapped, I grabbed it, and I repeatedly stabbed Amy. I don't remember … doing it, I don't remember terribly well."" (Qs 21-22)


	
	Asked how long the argument went for, he said, ""I guess it was fairly lengthy. Maybe half an hour or so?"" (Q290) Asked what was going through his mind while he was stabbing Ms Aiton, he said that he did not remember a thing. He said that his mind was ""blank, completely blank … not completely blank, but nothing up here."" (Qs 449-51) He was questioned closely about the detail of the event, including the manner in which he stabbed Ms Aiton, but the answers to which I have referred sufficiently encapsulate his account.
	
	
	After the stabbing he covered Ms Aiton with a blanket in the position on the bed where she lay, and took the various steps leading to his arrival in Sydney which I have outlined at [2] above. Asked whether he had checked whether she was ok, he said that he moved her head and looked in her eyes. They were open but ""she was gone."" He knew that she was dead. (Qs 280-2) Asked whether he thought about ringing anyone at that time, he said that he did not. He was asked whether there was a reason why. After a long pause, he replied, ""It was just like I wanted it to happen."" He added, ""I didn't feel anything. I certainly wasn't showing a heck of a lot of remorse at that stage."" (Qs 301-3)
	
	
	That said, he did express remorse during the interview. At the outset (Q 22) he said:
	


""Amy's gone. She, pretty high price for an argument. She's lost her life. I'll probably spend the rest of mine behind bars, and that's just the way it, I still can't believe any of this happened.""

Later (Q 285), he said, ""… I tell you what … I've taken this girl's life, but don't you worry, mate, what goes around comes around, and I'll … get what's coming to me big time.""

Towards the end of the interview (Q 607), he said:

""…I'm a dead man, and you know what, I don't have, right now, I honestly have no fear whatsoever about, I don't want to be around either anymore. Amy's gone. I'm … going to go as well. One way or the other, I'll do it.""

Generally, throughout the interview he displayed an appropriate measure of distress. He spoke quietly and appeared to be doing his best to be responsive to questions asked of him.

The psychiatric evidence


	
	The accused maintained this account when describing the incident to the psychiatrists, but he also described psychotic symptoms at the time. He told Dr Furst that he remembered ""bits and pieces"" of what occurred, and ""absolute anger."" He described a build up inside himself and hearing voices saying, ""It's time to do it … do it!"" This, he said, was ""coming from inside my head. It seemed real.""
	
	
	He told Dr Nielssen that on the morning of 31 July he was hearing voices and needed a drink straight away. He again said that he could recall only bits and pieces of the fatal incident. Asked about his state of mind, he said that he heard voices ""putting me down and saying nasty things about Amy."" When Dr Nielssen took him to his answers in the recorded interview, he said that he had given an honest account of what had taken place but added, ""I don't think I delved too much into my psychotic episodes … I just tried to be as accurate as I could be … I probably wasn't in a good frame of mind to give an interview on that day.""
	
	
	Indeed, he gave a history of enduring psychotic symptoms commencing in his late teens. To Dr Furst he described paranoid thinking, believing that people were talking about him and ""coming to get him."" He said that intermittently he had been hearing voices. These were unfamiliar voices in his head saying ""dirty things to do to myself and other people…dirty stupid stuff and to kill myself."" He felt embarrassed by these experiences and had to ""cover it up."" He described a pattern of persistent low mood, with a ""premonition that something bad is coming."" He also described intermittent suicidal ideation, including two occasions on which he took steps towards killing himself.
	
	
	To Dr Nielssen he said, ""When I look back now I can say I was psychotic and in another world."" He described the experience of voices telling him to do bad things to himself and others and saying things that were ""quite horrible."" He added that sometimes alcohol helped and sometimes it did not.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the accused has been psychotic while in custody. In their reports both psychiatrists reviewed Justice Health records, the more detailed review being that of Dr Furst. An early note in August 2012 described him as experiencing alcohol withdrawal and having suicidal thoughts. He was placed on safe cell conditions with daily reviews. On 8 August, he told a doctor that when he stabbed Ms Aiton he heard voices telling him that he was doing the right thing. He was considered to be an unreliable historian. On 17 August he told a psychiatrist, Dr Elliott, that he was hearing voices, including that of Ms Aiton, and that he had been ""hearing voices in my head for years."" He said that he wanted to die. Dr Elliott noted that he was ""emotionally labile"" but was not convinced that he was psychotic. Other entries recorded his complaint of hearing voices.
	
	
	In September 2012 he was assessed by Dr Samson Roberts, to whom he described a voice he did not recognise telling him to kill himself. He said that at the time of the offence he had been having thoughts of killing someone ""from something in me"". He described these thoughts as emanating from a voice which he did not recognise. He described being distressed that Ms Aiton was suspicious that he was drinking, he was angry that she could see ""the real me"", and that she was laughing at him, seeing ""how I really am."" Dr Roberts noted him to be ""extremely paranoid about everyone and everything people say."" The doctor observed him to be profoundly depressed, and noted a family history of schizophrenia. He believed him to be experiencing auditory hallucinations and paranoia. He diagnosed schizophrenia and saw him as a high risk of self-harm.
	
	
	In February 2013 Dr Furst himself assessed the accused. He described him as severely depressed in mood with evidence of auditory hallucinations. He was ""internally preoccupied and appeared acutely psychotic."" Dr Furst noted that his diagnosis was ""unclear"", but issued a certificate under Schedule 2 of the Mental Health Act 2007. Dr Roberts saw him again in that same month. He noted ""clear presence of first rank symptoms of psychosis"". He added, ""I am not of the view that these symptoms could be feigned so proficiently."" The accused had been on an anti-psychotic medication, and he increased the prescribed dose.
	
	
	In February 2013 he was noted to have a serious mood disorder associated with severe behavioural disturbance, including banging his head against the walls of his cell and smearing the walls with his faeces. He was described as both ""pacing and agitated."" He stated that he wanted to kill himself and reported being ""tormented by his voices.""
	
	
	In August 2012, he had tried to hang himself with a bed sheet in his cell. He was admitted to an acute care unit, and it was then that he was commenced on the medication. On 3 March 2013, while in that unit, he made a much more serious suicide attempt when he managed to hang himself. He was unconscious and had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale. He was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital, where he had a 2 minute generalised tonic seizure. There he was stabilised, and on 7 March he was admitted to Long Bay Hospital as an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	Thereafter he remained depressed, expressing guilt about the death of Ms Aiton and upset that he was still alive. He continued to exhibit paranoid beliefs and to report hearing voices. As Dr Furst put it in his second report, he ""was not coping."" His condition had noticeably improved when he was assessed in June 2013. Dr Furst saw this as the result of ongoing psychiatric treatment, albeit involuntary, and his anti-psychotic medication. Nevertheless, even at that time he reported voices telling him to kill himself.
	
	
	In his first report Dr Furst diagnosed the accused as suffering from major depression with psychotic features, together with alcohol dependence. He added that a review of the available medical records, including his admission to the hospitals in the Orange area and the Hunter area to which I have referred and his period of rehabilitation at Miracle Haven, was consistent with his ""suffering from a primary mood disorder, with a tendency towards depression, when under stress."" Dr Furst continued:
	


""He appears to cope poorly in his close personal relationships, with previous marital problems, likely domestic violence and various forms of threatening behaviour towards his former partners. Alcohol is likely to have been a significant factor in his past behaviour.""


	
	Dr Furst noted that this review did not support his reported history of hearing voices and of paranoid ideation throughout the majority of his adult life. He added that there was no indication that the accused was psychotic at the time of the police interview, noting that he said nothing about voices or paranoid thoughts at the time of the offence.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen in his report diagnosed alcohol use disorder and psychotic illness, both in remission. He continued:
	


""The diagnosis of alcohol use disorder is based on Mr Aller's account of regular heavy drinking, the salience of drinking over other activities, the experience of severe withdrawal symptoms, including withdrawal delirium and seizures, and the numerous complications of alcohol use, including its effect on his physical and mental health, the effect on relationships and employment, and the role of alcohol in this offence. The condition is described as being in remission on the basis of Mr Aller's detention in an alcohol free setting.

The diagnosis of psychotic illness is based on the history of distressing auditory hallucinations that were first noted in the period immediately after his reception to prison and became more intense and distressing over the next six months, culminating in a serious suicide attempt by hanging.

Factors contributing to the onset of psychotic illness include an inherited vulnerability to psychotic illness, past exposure to drugs known to trigger psychosis and brain damage from heavy drinking, which is evident in the history of episodes of withdrawal delirium and seizure. The diagnosis is probably one of chronic alcoholic hallucinosis, rather than an illness such as schizophrenia, because it seems Mr Aller was always aware that the experiences were hallucinations rather than providing a delusional explanation, and there were no other symptoms of schizophrenia or objective features of that disorder.""

Substantial impairment


	
	The defence of substantial impairment is articulated in s 23A(1) of the Crimes Act, as follows:
	


""(1)    A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:

(a)   at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and

(b)    the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.""

By subs (8), an underlying condition means a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind. The accused bears the burden of establishing this defence on the balance of probabilities. His case is that a mental condition substantially impaired his capacity to control himself.


	
	Important for the purpose of this case is subs (3), which provides:
	


""(3)   If a person was intoxicated at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, and the intoxication was self-induced intoxication (within the meaning of section 428A), the effects of that self-induced intoxication are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.""

The meaning of ""self-induced intoxication"" is clear enough, and it is unnecessary to refer to s 428A of the Act.


	
	Dr Furst, in his first report, noted the accused's account that he had relapsed into drinking after leaving Miracle Haven and had stopped taking his anti-depressant medication. He also noted the answers in the recorded interview in which the accused had described drinking a six pack of bourbon and coke fairly rapidly and becoming angry, and his account that after ""a few things were said"" he ""snapped"" and repeatedly stabbed Ms Aiton.
	
	
	Dr Furst concluded as follows:
	


""The issue in question appears to relate to Mr Aller's capacity to control himself. He presents as a man who has suffered from depression for a number of years, struggles to cope under stress, and has a tendency towards violent or threatening behaviour when his close personal relationships are strained. It is possible that he lost control at the time in question and ""snapped,"" as a consequence of his underlying mental disorder. Given his presentation in custody over recent months, his depression has been relatively severe.

The question as to whether his impairment was so substantial as to warrant the charge of murder being reduced to manslaughter is a matter for the trier to fact to establish; however, he may have the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind available to him.""


	
	Dr Nielssen questioned the availability of the defence in the light of s 23A(3), because of the accused's consumption of alcohol on the occasion in question. He expressed his conclusion in this way:
	


""Mr Aller's psychotic illness is…an underlying condition within the meaning of Section 23A of the Crimes Act. The condition produced an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence in the form of distressing auditory hallucinations. However, it is unlikely that the effect of Mr Aller's psychiatric disorder alone would have led to the attack on Ms Aiton, without the disinhibiting effects of a quantity of alcohol.


	
	Dr Furst's second report was prepared in response to Dr Nielssen's report. In that report he had regard to the observations of the accused's mental illness in custody, noting a dramatic deterioration between September 2012 and March 2013, with ""evidence of a severe depressed mood and persistent auditory hallucinations."" He thought that he probably had ""a psychotic depression, with both melancholic and psychotic features."" He expressed a differential diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Again, he had regard to the evidence of auditory hallucinations when the accused was admitted to the hospital in the Hunter area in 2011, and the fact that he had stopped taking the medication prescribed for him at Miracle Haven before the offence.
	
	
	Dr Furst expressed his opinion in this report upon the assumption that the accused had consumed up to eight alcoholic drinks and was intoxicated at the time of the killing of Ms Aiton. Upon the assumption, which I am prepared to make, that he drank all six cans of bourbon and coke which he had brought back to the townhouse, and having regard to his account to police that before returning to the townhouse he had drunk two other cans of that product and two schooners of beer, it would appear that he had consumed ten alcoholic drinks. However, I do not believe that anything turns on the difference.
	
	
	Dr Furst concluded:
	


""In my opinion, Mr Aller now presents with more evidence of major mental illness, with signs of severe depression and probably a prodromal presentation at the time of the offence in question before the Court.

Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic depression are all substantial mental disorders, not mere transient disorders. His mental illness progressed in custody to the point that he nearly killed himself on two occasions by hanging and remains a mentally ill person.

Although there is still some doubt about his self-report of 'hearing voices' at the time of the offence in question, numerous psychiatric assessments over the last 10-months make it highly likely he has a serious mental illness, which had its onset prior to the offence.

I am now of the opinion that Mr Aller's impairment at the time of the acts causing the death of Ms Aiton was substantial, even if one disregards the effects of his self-induced intoxication at that time.""


	
	In oral evidence, Dr Furst explained the expression ""prodromal presentation"" in that passage of his report. He said that a person suffering from schizophrenia may for a time exhibit symptoms which could appear to be no more than depression, but that period may be a ""prodrome or a pre-emtive phase before the more florid symptoms of schizophrenia.""
	
	
	Asked about his doubt about the accused's self-report of hearing voices at the time of the offence, he said that that did not concern him. Even if the accused had not been hearing voices, there was still ""evidence of depression, treatment for depression at Miracle Haven, previous psychiatric admissions and then these ongoing more florid symptoms after his arrest."" Yet again, he noted the report of some psychotic symptoms before the offence, in the hospital admission of 2011.
	
	
	Asked in evidence-in-chief whether the accused's alcohol intake changed his view in any way, he gave this evidence:
	


""A.   It doesn't change my view. I'm allowing for the fact that he was probably intoxicated to a degree from the alcohol that he consumed, on the background of his alcoholism and tolerance. I still think he has a underlying impairment by way of either a severe depression or the prodrome phase of schizophrenia at that point in time.

Q.   And that was substantial, affecting his ability to control himself?

A.   Yes.""


	
	In cross-examination Dr Furst agreed that the accused did not appear psychotic, or show any signs of his underlying condition being active, during the police interview.
	
	
	He gave this evidence:
	


""Q.   If there are no voices, or voices commanding him to do the acts he did, what was there about his underlying condition which either would create an abnormality of mind, or, if having an abnormality of mind, would affect a capacity to control what he was doing?

A.   Well, I think the words he used in the police interview were that he 'snapped', he used the term 'snapped' and what one sees in cases of first onset schizophrenia or where people are developing psychotic illnesses per se is a higher risk of violent and aggressive behaviour, or capacity in a global sense, to manage themselves and control themselves. And I don't think there was ever any indication that he was driven by voices to act in that way, as I understood his police interview and there (sic) version he gave to me. But because of the severe depression and the underlying mental illness, I thought that his capacity for self-control was impaired.""


	
	He agreed that alcohol could well have been a significant factor in the incident, and that a person who has developed a tolerance for alcohol may still have ""heightened emotions, such as anger, or quick to anger"" as a result of consuming alcohol.
	
	
	As to the hearing of voices, he expressed the view that the accused's initial account to police was likely to be more reliable that his subsequent accounts to medical professionals. He said that, in any event, he did not think that the accused was driven by voices and that, for that reason, he did not consider the defence of mental illness to be available. It was put to him that, accepting that there was an underlying condition, the accused was not affected by it and that this was a case ""more consistent with him having consumed some alcohol, there being an argument, got angry and determined to take that anger out on Amy."" Dr Furst maintained his opinion that the underlying condition affected his capacity to control himself.
	
	
	In answer to a question by me whether, discounting the effect of alcohol, the accused's behaviour was still attributable to loss of self-control as a result of his underlying condition, he said, ""In my opinion, yes … .""
	
	
	In his oral evidence, Dr Nielssen noted that the ""distressing auditory hallucinations"", which he saw as an abnormality of mind, emanated from the history given by the accused. He said that there was some question about the reliability of that history, because it changed over the period he had been in custody and he made no mention of it in the police interview. However, he said that a person who had experienced auditory hallucinations might not disclose them to police because they did not appear relevant. He added that chronic heavy drinkers do experience alcoholic hallucinosis. This is how he characterised the experience of voices which the accused described. He did not see features of schizophrenia at the relevant time, as the accused did not report delusional ideas arising from hallucinations. He appeared to recognise that they were hallucinations.
	
	
	Asked in cross-examination whether, putting the alcohol to one side, he accepted that the accused was substantially impaired in the control of his actions, he said, ""No, I don't think so. I think without alcohol he would have been able to control his actions."" He was asked to consider how affected the accused might have been by the pattern of drinking he described to the police, given the tolerance he would have developed as an alcoholic. Dr Nielssen said that the determining factor would be the degree of his impairment, not his blood alcohol level. He added that, as a chronic drinker, he may have had some underlying brain injury over that time, ""especially if he has had repeated withdrawal deliriums, seizures, the effect of very heavy drinking on his brain.""
	
	
	It was suggested to him that alcohol played no part in driving the accused's conduct, given the extent of his memory of the fatal incident when questioned by police, even though prior to the interview he had had a long drinking session at the hotel in Sydney. As to that his evidence was:
	


""A.   He certainly wasn't severely intoxicated to the point of having a black out. I could do a rough calculation of his blood alcohol level, but it probably was somewhere in the mid-range for drinking is my guess, you know, at the time. So he was not severely intoxicated.

Q.   But really the blood alcohol level is really not relevant, is it, in relation to an alcoholic?

A.   No, probably not given perhaps the tolerance to the effects of alcohol.""


	
	It was again put to Dr Nielssen that the accused's conduct was driven by an underlying psychotic illness and that the alcohol played no part at all. He replied, ""I think the alcohol had an uninhibiting effect over and above his underlying personality and any symptoms he might have had at that time.""
	
	
	Plainly enough, the evidence on this issue points in different directions. I have conflicting opinions of two experienced forensic psychiatrists, both well versed in the relevant law.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor's primary submission was that the evidence does not establish an abnormality of mind in the accused at the relevant time. He did not suggest that the accused's account to the various health professionals that he was hearing voices was a fabrication, but he did argue that that assertion is unreliable. He noted that the accused made no such claim in the course of a lengthy police interview, during which he had ample opportunity to recount his state of mind. Indeed, there was nothing in what he said or in his demeanour to suggest psychosis of any kind. In truth, the Crown prosecutor submitted, this was not a case of substantial impairment: this was a killing in a drunken rage by a man with a longstanding dependence on alcohol and a history of domestic violence.
	
	
	Alternatively, he argued that Dr Nielssen's evidence should be accepted. The only abnormality of mind the doctor propounded was the hearing of voices, which he saw as the product of alcoholic hallucinosis rather than severe depression or a nascent schizophrenic illness. In any event, Dr Nielssen was firm in his opinion that the accused's undoubted lack of self-control would not have occurred but for his intoxication at the time, so that the defence of substantial impairment failed by virtue of s 23A(3).
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor's final submission was that even if the elements of the defence, that is substantial impairment by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, were made out, I would not be satisfied that that impairment was so substantial as to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter: s 23A(1)(b). That, of course, is a matter for my assessment, applying community values.
	
	
	I have given these arguments careful consideration, but I am persuaded by the submissions of Mr Bruce SC, for the accused, that the defence is made out. On balance, I accept the evidence of Dr Furst. He had the benefit of considerably more contact with the accused than Dr Nielssen, contact for therapeutic as well as forensic purposes. He observed the development in the accused of serious mental illness from his admission to custody and over the period thereafter. It is apparent that he arrived at the conclusion expressed in his second report only after a careful examination of all the material, including the history provided by the accused and the records of his treatment prior to the offence and of his psychiatric intervention in custody. As Mr Bruce put it, his evidence was ""very considered.""
	
	
	I find it unnecessary to decide whether the accused did hear voices at the time of the killing. What is apparent is that he mounted a ferocious attack upon the unfortunate Ms Aiton, clearly the product of a loss of self-control. While the evidence before me of his alcohol fuelled domestic violence in the past is scant, there is nothing in it to suggest violence of the extreme order exhibited on this occasion. It was entirely disproportionate to the heat which his exchange with Ms Aiton might reasonably have generated. It bespeaks an abnormal state of mind, one which is satisfactorily explained by the underlying condition identified by Dr Furst. Putting aside the hearing of voices, it is consistent with this condition that he neither described nor exhibited overt psychotic symptoms during the police interview.
	
	
	I am also persuaded by the evidence of Dr Furst that the accused's psychiatric illness was the operative factor in his loss of self-control, putting aside the effect of the alcohol he had consumed that day. In any event, there is force in Mr Bruce's submission that he might not have been markedly impaired by that consumption, which appears to have begun in the late morning and then resumed during the afternoon. While drinking of that order would stop most of us in our tracks, its effect may have been limited on a chronic alcoholic with the tolerance engendered by long term excessive drinking.
	
	
	For these reasons I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused killed Ms Aiton while he was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. I am also satisfied that that impairment was so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter, given the marked effect of his condition upon his capacity for self-control and its significant bearing upon his culpability. A helpful reference to authority on this question is to be found in the judgment of Johnson J in Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229, 227 A Crim R 217, at [33].
	
	
	Accordingly, I find that the accused is not guilty of murder but that, on the limited material available, he committed the offence of manslaughter.

		09 March 2015",2015-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703894,R v El-Zeyat; R v Aouad [2015] NSWSC 63,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: This is an application for costs pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicants were tried before Bell J and a jury in 2006 and found guilty of the murder of Ahmed Fahda. They appealed against their convictions which were quashed and a new trial was ordered: Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61; 207 A Crim R 411. (There is some inconsistency in published judgments in the way El-Zeyat’s name is spelt. I have opted to adopt the spelling used on the indictment.)
	
	
	The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal was handed down on 8 April 2011. In October-November 2011 the applicants were arraigned and pleaded not guilty. The matter was stood over for trial but on 30 May 2012 the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that no further proceedings be taken. When the decision of the Director was announced at an arraignment list hearing on 1 June 2012 the applicants indicated that they wished to make an application for costs.
	
	
	The hearing and determination of the application for costs has been substantially delayed, partly because of an issue about whether the reasons of the Director for determining that no further proceedings be taken was privileged. Ultimately the Director’s privilege was upheld: El-Zayet v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWCCA 298.
	
	
	At the commencement of the hearing before me on 6 February 2015, counsel for Mr El-Zeyat applied for the hearing of the application to be adjourned. The basis of the application was that the Legal Aid NSW had been requested to fund the provision of advice from senior counsel as to whether there was merit to pursue an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court in respect of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal last December. Mr McLachlan of counsel was unable to indicate whether any particular error was suspected to be found in the judgment but simply indicated that the advice of senior counsel was being sought. It seemed to me that with the lengthy delay already experienced in the determination of this application for costs, to adjourn and thereby delay it any further on such a speculative basis was not warranted. Accordingly the adjournment was refused.
	


Nature of the application


	
	The Costs in Criminal Cases Act provides in s 2 that a certificate may be granted under the Act where, inter alia, a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken in a criminal case. It is necessary for such a certificate to specify that in the opinion of the court it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all of the relevant facts, and that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances: s 3
	
	
	In this case the focus was on the first of those two matters, in s 3(1)(a), there being no suggestion that any act or omission of either of the applicants had anything to do with the institution or continuation of the proceedings.
	
	
	In the event that the conditions in s 3 are established, it is then a matter for the court’s discretion as to whether to grant a certificate.
	
	
	The phrase, “before the proceedings were instituted” has been held to be a reference to the time when the criminal justice system was put into motion, not the time when a trial is commence: Allerton v DPP (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 at 557B-558C.
	


Overview of the case


	
	The applicants’ convictions were for the murder of Ahmed Fahda at Punchbowl on 30 October 2003. They were tried together with Adnan Darwiche, who was charged with being both an accessory before the fact and an accessory after the fact to the murder, but was acquitted.
	
	
	James J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreed, provided the following overview of the case:
	


[3] At the trial the Crown case, very broadly stated, was that shortly after two o'clock in the afternoon of 30 October 2003 the deceased had been a passenger in a Pajero 4-wheel drive vehicle (""the Pajero"") driven by a man named Bassam Said, which was travelling in Punchbowl Road, Punchbowl. The Pajero ran out of petrol and Ahmed Fahda and Bassam Said pushed the Pajero into a service station on Punchbowl Road near the intersection with Dudley Street. Both men got out of the Pajero.

[4] Another vehicle, a Commodore, stopped near the service station. Two men armed with pistols (""the shooters"" or ""the gunmen"") got out of the Commodore. They walked past the deceased, who was looking into the bonnet of the Pajero and, from close range, fired a large number of shots into the deceased's body, killing him. The gunmen then ran from the service station and boarded the Commodore which had been driven into Dudley Street. The Commodore then drove off.

[5] The issue at the trial, so far as the appellants were concerned, was whether the Crown could prove that the two appellants were the gunmen. The Crown case at the trial depended heavily on the evidence of the witnesses Bassam Said, Wahib Hannouf, Haissam Hannouf and Tony Haddad. Apart from the evidence of these witnesses, there was evidence from a number of witnesses who had witnessed the shooting but who could not identify either of the gunmen, some limited formal admissions by the appellants and some pieces of circumstantial evidence.

The reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	There were multiple grounds of appeal relied upon by each of the applicants but their only success was in relation to a conversation had between Bassam Said and Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali on about 8 July 2004, some 8 months after the murder. It was a conversation at a gaol in the presence of a police officer. Its occurrence did not become known to the applicants and the prosecuting authority until after judgment had been reserved in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Evidence of and relating to it was admitted on the appeal.
	
	
	The effect of the conversation was that Bassam Said said that he was unable to identify either of the two shooters, contrary to both a statement he signed shortly afterwards and to his evidence at the trial that they were the applicants.
	
	
	The Crown endeavoured to persuade the Court of Criminal Appeal that there was so much evidence about the bad character of Bassam Said and so much material reflecting adversely upon his credibility that this further evidence would not have made any material difference. However, James J whilst acknowledging the force of the Crown’s submission, took a different view as to the potential impact the fresh evidence might have had at the trial. He said in part:
	


[351] I have nevertheless concluded that, if evidence about the conversation on 8 July 2004 had been before the jury, the jury would have been likely to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or, alternatively, there is a significant possibility that the jury might have acquitted the appellants.

…

[354] In my opinion, if the fresh evidence had been available at the trial and had been used in the cross-examination of Bassam Said, a further serious blow would have been dealt to Bassam Said's credibility.

…

[367] Although Bassam Said's credibility was challenged on a number of grounds at the trial, the further evidence, if it had been available at the trial, would have dealt a serious blow to his credibility. Bassam Said's evidence was important for the reasons given by counsel for the appellants. In my opinion, it cannot be said, if the test in Wilde and Grey is applied, that the appellants did not lose a chance of acquittal as a result of the investigator's note not having been disclosed. Alternatively I consider that the failure to disclose the note involved a significant denial of procedural fairness.


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal was required, of course, to look at the potential impact the fresh evidence might have had if it had been available at the trial.
	
	
	The fresh evidence adduced at the appeal amounts to further material that must be considered, along with all of the evidence adduced at the trial, in considering the key question in this application: whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings.
	


Submissions


	
	Mr Aouad only seeks a certificate in respect of costs arising after the quashing of his conviction whereas Mr El-Zeyat seeks a certificate in respect of the entire proceedings.
	
	
	Mr McLachlan, on behalf of the applicant El-Zeyat, submitted that in light of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s finding in relation to the impact of the fresh evidence upon the credibility of the evidence of Bassam Said, it followed that if the Crown had been aware of that further evidence, it would have been unreasonable to have instituted the proceedings.
	
	
	Ms Carroll, on behalf of the applicant Aouad, submitted that the fact that the proceedings were terminated by the Director in itself was sufficient to satisfy the matter in s 3(1)(a). In other words, terminating the proceedings indicated that they were not reasonably instituted in the first place. But the latter does not necessarily follow the former. This submission must be rejected. Such a decision may be based upon a wide variety of reasons and not necessarily upon a consideration of the accuracy, reliability, credibility or sufficiency of the evidence in the case. It was also suggested that if the termination decision was based upon reasons not concerned with the sufficiency and reliability of the evidence then counsel for the respondent would be able to inform the Court. That submission must also be rejected once regard is had to the applicant bearing the onus of proof.
	
	
	Ms Carroll relied upon the submissions that were made by Mr McLachlan in relation to the unreliability of the evidence of Bassam Said. She alluded to a question about the reliability of the evidence of the other witnesses who identified the applicants as being the shooters, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf. Mention was also made of a draft witness list, provided by the Crown prior to what was going to be the retrial, in which one of the witnesses it had called in the first trial, Tony Haddad, was omitted. There was no elaboration of the significance of this but I assume it had something to do with what was said during the subsequent submissions by Mr Pickering SC on behalf of the Crown concerning Mr Haddad.
	
	
	Mr Pickering first pointed out that the Crown opened its case to the jury without any mention of the evidence of Bassam Said at all. In other words, the Crown was, in effect, contending at trial that it had a viable case without it. It was explained that this was because there was a very real doubt about his availability. He had refused to continue giving evidence at the committal hearing because, he complained, his house had been shot at. There was evidence that at around the commencement of the trial he had been the victim of a kidnapping. He only came to be called after he had been shot and presented at a hospital some three weeks into the trial. Bell J issued a warrant for his arrest and he was remanded in custody until he had completed giving evidence.
	
	
	Mr Pickering also pointed out that Bassam Said’s claim that he did not know who the shooters were was not solely made in a conversation with Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali. He had said so in his first statement, in evidence before the Crime Commission and in evidence at a Basha inquiry after he was brought before Bell J.
	
	
	In the light of these matters there was a question as to why the Crown called Bassam Said at all. Mr Pickering explained that it would have been impractical for the Crown not to have called him, given he was the most obvious material witness, having been directly in the company of Ahmed Fahda when he was shot.
	
	
	It was submitted, in effect, that the most practical way of assessing the merits of the present application was to look at the other evidence that was available to the Crown. It was unnecessary to determine whether the evidence of Bassam Said had any credibility; it could be assumed for present purposes that it did not and that it was worthless. That in itself does not mean that it was unreasonable for the Crown to have instituted the proceedings if there was otherwise a viable case.
	
	
	The Crown tendered a printout of email communications between the applicant El-Zeyat’s solicitor and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 16 January 2012. This was, of course, whilst the retrial was pending. The applicant’s solicitor indicated that he had instructions from his client as to his preparedness to plead guilty to a charge of accessory before and/or after the fact to murder. Mr Pickering submitted that such an offer was inconsistent with the current claim that it was unreasonable for proceedings to have been instituted against El-Zeyat.
	
	
	Mr Pickering identified these email communications as being “without prejudice”. In these circumstances I am doubtful it is appropriate for them to be taken into account; and in any event, do not believe that it is necessary to do so in the light of my ultimate determination of the matter.
	


The evidence available to the Crown aside from that of Bassam Said


	
	Admissions pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) were made at the trial by each of the applicants (and by the co-accused, Adnan Darwiche). Mr Pickering indicated that this obviated the need for evidence to go to the jury about the accused having been under physical and electronic surveillance in the period preceding the murder in relation to other suspected criminal activity.
	
	
	It was admitted that the two applicants as well as Adnan Darwiche were acquainted with, and associated with, each other, including frequently telephoning each other.
	
	
	It was the Crown case, based upon eye-witness accounts, that the shooters were driven to and from the scene of the shooting in a particular Holden Commodore. There was an admission that Adnan Darwiche was involved in arranging the sale of that car on 15-16 October 2003 by its owner to Mohammed Touma (the person the Crown alleged was the getaway car driver). Other evidence revealed that it was registered with a false name and address. On 17 October 2003, Adnan Darwiche arranged with the applicant Aouad and Mohammed Touma for the windows of the Commodore to be tinted.
	
	
	There were admissions that Adnan Darwiche and Ramzi Aouad were occupants as either driver or passenger of the Commodore on various occasions on each of 16, 17, 18 and 19 October 2003. These included an occasion on 17 October when Adnan Darwiche drove it to and from the home of Naseam El-Zeyat. On 29 October 2003 the Commodore was parked outside the home of Ahmad Awad. Darwiche and Aouad visited Mr Awad whilst it was there.
	
	
	There was evidence that someone set fire to the Commodore in Sellers Lane, Greenacre at about 8.00pm on the evening of the murder.
	
	
	The murder occurred at about 2.12pm on 30 October 2003 just after Bassam Said and the deceased had pushed the car they were in into a service station. There was evidence of numerous telephone contacts on that day between the applicants and Darwiche (and El-Zeyat was also in telephone contact with Bassam Said). The applicant El-Zeyat called Said at 2.00pm (a 20 second call from the Bankstown South area) and at 2.10pm (a 57 second call from the Punchbowl area placing him in the area where the murder occurred). Darwiche called Aouad at 2.15pm (a 10 second call).
	
	
	Another admission made was that at 6.37pm on the evening of 30 October 2003, Darwiche met El-Zeyat, Bassam Said, Tony Haddad and another man (Jalal Alameddine) in the car park of a fast food restaurant at Menai.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the evidence of two brothers, Wahib and Haissam Hannouf, to identify the applicants as the shooters. They were in a car driving past the service station at the time of the shooting. Wahib said he was driving slowly but slowed down even more when passing the service station because he saw the deceased. There had been prior conflict between the deceased and the Hannouf family and Wahib Hannouf had recently heard that the deceased had been released from gaol recently. He saw a Commodore stopped near to the service station and saw the applicants near to it.
	
	
	Wahib Hannouf said that he saw the applicants walk quickly towards the service station and the deceased. They put the hoods of their jackets over their heads and took out guns as they approached. The shooting then occurred.
	
	
	Haissam Hannouf gave evidence to similar effect. He knew El-Zeyat by his nickname (“Erdt”). He did not know Aouad; his brother told him it was “Fidel” (Aouad’s nickname). He also recognised the driver of the Commodore as Mohammed Touma.
	
	
	Suggestions put in cross-examination to the Hannouf brothers to the effect that they were in fact complicit in the murder were denied. (No evidence seems to have been adduced in an endeavour to affirmatively establish the proposition.)
	
	
	The evidence of the Hannouf brothers, in particular that they were witnesses to and not involved in the killing, was supported by that of Safa Milani who worked at the service station. He assisted the deceased and Bassam Said to push their vehicle into the service station before returning to another task. He said he then saw a vehicle with two male occupants driving slowly past the service station at around the time of the shooting. He saw the driver was looking into the service station.
	
	
	Another item of evidence relied upon by the Crown was that of “Michael Rahman” (a pseudonym assigned by the trial judge). Mr Rahman was a customer getting petrol at the service station and witnessed the killing and the flight of the two shooters to the waiting Commodore. He got a better look at one of the shooters (“the first gunman”) than the other. His description of the first gunman included a hooded jacket that was consistent with one that Aouad admitted owning. Mr Rahman subsequently participated in the compilation of a computer-generated image which he was satisfied was 80 per cent similar to the first gunman. Mr Pickering submitted that this image was “remarkably similar in appearance to Ramzi Aouad”. Counsel for the applicants made no attempt to criticise that submission.
	
	
	The Crown also relied upon the evidence of Tony Haddad at the trial but did not seem to place much reliance upon him in relation to the present application. In a subsequent trial, Haddad refused to give evidence and so there must be real issues about his credibility. I will adopt what I understood to be the Crown’s approach and put his evidence to one side.
	


Determination


	
	In summary, the Crown case, aside from the evidence of Bassam Said and ignoring that of Tony Haddad, included the evidence of the following:
	


Wahib Hannouf identifying both applicants as being the shooters.

Haissam Hannouf identifying El-Zeyat as being one of the shooters and confirming that Wahib Hannouf had contemporaneously nominated the other shooter as Aouad.

The applicants being associated with the car used to convey the shooters to and from the scene of the crime.

Mobile telephone contact between the applicants and other relevant persons at around the time of the shooting, particularly placing El-Zeyat in the same general area.

One of the shooters bearing a close similarity to the appearance of Aouad.


	
	Crucial to a case based upon this body of evidence was the first and second items, the Hannouf identification evidence. They were witnesses with issues about their credibility – see the summaries of their evidence which includes such matters in the judgment of James J in Aouad v R; El-Zeyat v R at [82]-[107] and [108]-[127] respectively.
	
	
	There were grounds of appeal raised by each applicant that were critical of a direction given by the trial judge to the effect that “the jury could look for independent support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of another witness”. These grounds were rejected. However, when dealing with the fresh evidence grounds based upon the conversation between Bassam Said and Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali, James J was concerned about the possible effect of that direction. He said the following in that context:
	


[355] Earlier in this judgment I summarised the evidence in the Crown case. As was submitted by the Crown on this appeal, there was much evidence in the Crown case other than Bassam Said's evidence.

[356] However, the only witnesses who actually identified the shooters were Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf.

[357] An advantage to the Crown in Bassam Said's evidence was that Bassam Said was indisputably at the service station at the time of the shooting, within a few metres of the victim and the shooters, and would have had a good opportunity of observing the shooters.

[358] On the other hand, the evidence of the Hannouf brothers was open to the criticism that it could seem a remarkable coincidence that they happened to be travelling past the service station at the very time the shooting occurred. In accordance with the trial judge's directions in her summing up that the jury could look for independent support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of another witness, the jury could have looked at Bassam Said's evidence for independent support for the evidence of the Hannouf brothers.


	
	Mr McLachlan referred to this passage of the judgment in his submissions in reply. But this aspect of the determination of the fresh evidence ground by James J must be understood in its context: appellate review of the likely effect the evidence might have had if it had been before the jury. It is a significantly different context to an application under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.
	
	
	The credibility of the Hannouf brothers was not addressed in the submissions for either applicant beyond Mr McLachlan’s references to the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment and Ms Carroll referring in general terms in her submissions in reply to “their indemnification and the inconsistencies within the evidence”.
	
	
	It was agreed that the matters to which Ms Carroll briefly alluded were adequately summarised in the Part A document (part of Exhibit A on the application). I have had regard to the matters there set out. They do not lead me to think that their evidence was incapable of belief; and no submission was made that I should. The Hannouf evidence was, in my assessment, capable, although not commanding, of belief. If a jury did accept it, conviction was almost assured.
	
	
	It is worthy of note, but of only minor significance, that there was no ground of appeal contending that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable, or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence. And it does not appear that any submission was made that the appropriate order for the Court of Criminal Appeal to make in the event of quashing convictions was other than for a retrial.
	
	
	This was a case involving a most serious criminal offence alleged to have been committed by men entrenched in serious criminal activity generally (both applicants are currently serving life sentences for a double murder committed a fortnight earlier on 14 October 2003: see Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424). Cases such as these are often difficult for investigators and prosecutors. They necessitate reliance upon witnesses who themselves are part of the criminal milieu and so it is inevitable that there will be credibility issues ventilated at trial. I do not suggest that the bar to prosecuting such cases should be lowered for this reason but mention this simply to recognise a practical reality. I am satisfied that the prosecution case, putting aside the evidence of Messrs Said and Haddad, was a viable one. Even if the evidence of those two witnesses is taken into account, it does not seem to me that it detracted from the viability of the rest of the case (and it was not submitted to the contrary).
	
	
	I am not persuaded that if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. If I am wrong about that, I am not persuaded that I should exercise the discretion to grant a certificate in any event.
	


Order


	
	I make the following order:
	


The applications by Ramzi Aouad and Naseam El-Zeyat for a certificate pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act are dismissed.

		13 February 2015",2015-02-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703895,R v Gourlay [2015] NSWSC 67,"Judgment


	
	On 10 February 2015, I ordered (pursuant to s 132(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)) that the pending trial of Daniel Michael Gourlay (the accused) be heard without a jury and by judge alone. I made the order because a document had been filed setting out an election of the accused to that effect, along with the consent of the Crown. In those circumstances, the statute called upon me to make that order.
	
	
	Immediately thereafter, the accused was arraigned on an indictment. It contained a single count averring that, on 24 October 2013 at Emu Plains in the State of New South Wales, the accused murdered Ian Gourlay. The accused, who at all stages of the trial was represented by a solicitor and barrister very experienced in criminal law, pleaded not guilty on the ground of mental illness.
	
	
	The Crown proceeded to tender a deal of documentary evidence, none of which was the subject of objection by defence counsel.
	
	
	The first documentary exhibit was a comprehensive Crown case statement in orthodox form.
	
	
	The second was a set of formal admissions by the accused, made in accordance with s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Their effect was that the accused formally admitted that he had caused the death of the deceased, his father, by stabbing him with a knife. He also formally accepted the correctness of the entirety of the Crown case statement.
	
	
	The remainder of the documents were two medical reports of Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, who had been qualified by the solicitor for the accused, and one medical report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, who had been qualified by the Crown. Each of those three medical reports expressed a firm opinion about the psychiatric condition of the accused on 24 October 2013, and the opinions of the two experts were unanimous.
	
	
	In order to ensure that the trial was intelligible to any interested person, not least the accused, those close to him, and those close to the deceased, the Crown Prosecutor read the entirety of the Crown case statement onto the record. To the same end, I confirmed with defence counsel the effect of the formal admissions. The Crown Prosecutor orally summarised the report of Dr Allnutt, and defence counsel adopted the same procedure with regard to the reports of Dr Furst.
	
	
	No evidence was tendered by defence counsel above and beyond the Crown case.
	
	
	At the close of the evidence, I received very helpful written and oral submissions from both counsel. Neither of them submitted that, in my reasons for verdict, I needed to take into account any warnings pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act, or any other noteworthy matter, above and beyond the elements of the offence of murder and the onus with regard to that offence, and the elements of the defence of mental illness and the onus with regard to that defence.
	
	
	Each counsel contended that the relevant elements of the offence of murder had been proven by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. Each counsel also contended, however, that the affirmative defence of mental illness had been made out on the balance of probabilities by the accused. As a result, each counsel contended that the appropriate verdict for me to return on the evidence would be the special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness.
	


Summary of the evidence


	
	The following chronological overview is derived from the Crown case statement that was the subject of formal admission by the accused, and the three reports prepared by Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst. Neither the history provided by the accused to those experts, nor the contents of the documents (including but not limited to medical records relating to the accused) to which the doctors referred in their reports, was placed in dispute during the addresses of counsel.
	
	
	The accused was born in April 1979, and accordingly on 24 October 2013 he was aged 34 years. For many years before that date he had worked as a sander. He enjoyed an uneventful childhood and adolescence in the Nepean area, leaving school in Year 10. He commenced smoking cannabis at the age of 13 or 14 years. He also commenced to drink quite heavily from the age of 15 or 16 years. During his early twenties, he used amphetamines. On two separate occasions at around that time, he was admitted to the psychiatric unit of Nepean Hospital. On the latter admission he showed symptoms of psychosis. At that stage the accused gave a history of receiving messages from the television and radio.
	
	
	By 2005, the accused, (then aged 26 years) began to exhibit symptoms of a chronic psychotic illness. Those symptoms included paranoid delusions, delusions of reference (for example, that a television or radio was communicating with him personally), and thought disorder.
	
	
	In 2006, the accused expressed the view to a doctor that his parents were conspiring against him.
	
	
	In 2007, the accused was diagnosed with schizophrenia, a serious mental illness often characterised by the symptoms that the accused had previously exhibited.
	
	
	From 2010, the accused lived with his parents in the family home in Emu Plains in the Western suburbs of Sydney. Over a period of years the accused was violent and threatening to his parents, especially when he was intoxicated by alcohol.
	
	
	In 2011, the accused spent a short time in a psychiatric unit. On discharge, he remained psychotic and had no insight into his mental condition.
	
	
	His illness worsened in 2013, and in March of that year he was involuntarily detained in a psychiatric unit for four days. After discharge, he remained psychotic.
	
	
	Throughout 2013, the accused developed a belief that his neighbour was trying to kill him. He also believed that aerials were sending him messages. He would not reliably take his medication, and had no insight into his mental condition. He was also abusing alcohol heavily.
	
	
	In June 2013, the deceased reported to the mental health case manager of the accused that his son believed that members of his family were trying to poison him.
	
	
	In the weeks before 24 October 2013, the abuse by the accused of his parents became worse, and it appeared that his mental condition was deteriorating. He stopped working in the week before 24 October 2013.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 24 October 2013, the deceased had some drinks at a local Leagues Club. He came home some time before 4 pm. At about 4:30 pm, Mrs Gourlay returned to her home. At about 5 pm, the accused arrived. He appeared intoxicated by alcohol. The accused obtained some cans of alcohol from the garage and threw them onto the floor of the lounge room of the family home. The deceased remonstrated with the accused, and told him that he would have to find another place to live. The accused o a knife that he was in the habit of using whilst fishing. He said “I don’t care if I spend the rest of my life in gaol”, and stabbed the deceased two times to the left side of his trunk. Mrs Gourlay pushed her son away from the deceased, and disarmed him of the knife. She immediately provided first aid to her husband and telephoned emergency services. Meanwhile the deceased left the family home through the front door.
	
	
	At about 5:10 pm two uniformed police officers arrived at the home. They saw the accused sitting on the driveway of the home. He said to them “I’m the one that stabbed my Dad, he’s inside.” The accused was immediately arrested. On arrest, the accused said to a police officer “So he is the victim after everything I get.”
	
	
	Tragically, the deceased passed away shortly after he was stabbed by his son.
	
	
	Some time later, the accused engaged in a recorded interview with police. Amongst other things, he freely admitted that he had stabbed his father twice, once in the stomach and once in the chest. By way of explanation, he referred to the fact that, a couple of weeks before, the accused had been up on the roof of some premises. He also said “all the weird shit’s been going on” and “…next thing you know shit’s been all fucked up.” During the interview, his manner of speech was odd, including staring blankly on occasions, and grimacing at times.
	
	
	At the time of the alleged offence, the accused was not taking any psychotropic medications. He had stopped taking antipsychotic medications about two years previously, because he believed that he was not suffering from any mental problem.
	
	
	A post-mortem examination of the deceased was conducted on 25 October 2013. It showed that the deceased had suffered two very deep stab wounds, the most severe of which was 17 cm in depth. That wound injured the vital organs of the deceased, and caused severe internal bleeding. The forensic pathologist expressed the opinion that the direct cause of death was multiple stab wounds.
	
	
	After his arrest and incarceration, the accused showed signs of mental illness. On 26 October 2013, he reported that he was hearing voices of a commanding nature. On 14 November 2013, the accused remarked “everything I do is on TV”. He also expressed the view that his food was being poisoned in custody. He was diagnosed with an acute relapse of chronic schizophrenia.
	
	
	On 16 December 2013, the accused was asked about the stabbing. He remarked “everything just changed. Everything went real strange. I wasn’t myself. I’d move and the TV would change.” He said that he “did what he did because he had to do it.” 
	
	
	On 16 January 2014, the accused told a doctor that voices had said that he was to do it (that is, stabbing his father) in order to save others and himself.
	
	
	The accused saw Dr Furst in March 2014. When asked to describe the circumstances of the offence, the accused told the doctor that he was “all mixed up” and “upset and confused.” He also accused his father of doing things to “make it worse”, including “the clothes he wore”. The accused told Dr Furst that “I thought mum would call them [the police] after what I did.”
	
	
	By the time he spoke to Dr Furst, the accused said that he felt “extremely bad” about his actions and that “it’s all sinking in.”
	
	
	Dr Furst expressed the view that, when he saw the accused, the accused showed signs consistent with schizophrenia, including a blunted affect, impoverished thinking, and being malodorous.
	
	
	Dr Furst provided two diagnoses: schizophrenia and alcohol dependence. He expressed the opinion that the accused was fit to stand trial.
	
	
	Dr Furst expressed the following opinion:
	


“Mr Gourlay was labouring under a defect of reason in the form of paranoid and persecutory delusions and the effects of auditory hallucinations that impaired his grasp on reality, made him misinterpret things about himself and his family, and prevented him from thinking about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. He probably felt morally justified in killing his father in response to the paranoid delusions he was experiencing and auditory hallucinations that were apparently telling him to kill his father in order to save others and himself. He has a disease of the mind in the form of a chronic schizophrenic illness. In my opinion, Mr Gourlay has a mental illness defence available to him.”


	
	Dr Allnutt saw the accused on 18 July 2014. He received a history from the accused that was consistent with the history provided to Dr Furst. That history included receiving messages from the television, the feeling that the television was talking about him in code, and that the radio was also sending him messages. The accused described himself at around the time of the stabbing as being “in a mess.”
	
	
	The accused told Dr Allnutt that he felt “sick to my stomach” when he thought about his father.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt noted the medical history, the events of 24 October 2013, and the things said subsequently by the accused about what had happened, both in a formal interview and informally. The summary provided by Dr Allnutt is consistent with that provided by Dr Furst, and does not require elaboration by me.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt noted that, on 16 December 2013 (that is, whilst he was in custody), the accused stated that the television was telling him to hurt others, and that he was frightened that he might do so.
	
	
	By the time the accused saw Dr Allnutt, the accused appeared reasonably well groomed, and could speak in a clear and coherent manner. The accused denied any active symptoms of psychosis. By that stage, of course, one can safely assume that the accused was being appropriately medicated by the custodial medical service.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt diagnosed the accused as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. The psychiatrist expressed the view that the condition has been complicated by a lack of insight into it on the part of the accused, poor compliance with medication, and the use of alcohol.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt explicitly considered whether the stabbing was nothing more than an angry, drunken, infliction of violence in a domestic setting by a person who was aggrieved because he had been told that his behaviour meant that he must live elsewhere. On reflection, Dr Allnutt came to the view that that was by no means the complete picture. Dr Allnutt considered that, at the time, the accused was experiencing psychotic symptoms. That opinion was founded upon the medical history over many years before 24 October 2013; the behaviour of the accused immediately after the stabbing; and the mental condition of the accused whilst in custody.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt was satisfied that the accused was fit to stand trial.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that, at the time of the stabbing, the accused was suffering from a defect of reason founded upon a disease of the mind. The psychiatrist considered that the accused understood the nature and quality of his actions. He also expressed the view that the accused appreciated the legal wrongfulness of his actions. In contrast, Dr Allnutt ultimately expressed the opinion that, as at 24 October 2013, the accused did not appreciate the wrongfulness of stabbing his father to death in any deeper, moral sense.
	
	
	Finally, Dr Furst was asked to express a supplementary opinion commenting upon the opinion of Dr Allnutt. To that end, Dr Furst saw the accused again on 23 January 2015.
	
	
	Dr Furst recorded that the accused had come to realise the enormity of his actions. The accused referred to “the guilt. The whole thing. What I put my family through.”
	
	
	Dr Furst noted that the opinion of Dr Allnutt was consistent with his own. Dr Furst did not change his opinion with regard to the defence of mental illness.
	


Applicable Legal Principles


	
	Pursuant to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), in order for the tribunal of fact in a criminal trial to return a verdict of guilty of murder, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that, within the state of New South Wales, an accused person voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased, and, at the time of the act, the accused possessed one of three states of mind, or that the doctrine of constructive murder applied.
	
	
	However, as the decision of the High Court of Australia in Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500 and the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales in R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226 make clear, when the defence of mental illness is relied upon by an accused person, special considerations apply to the elements that must be proven beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown. In particular, the question of voluntariness is first to be determined without reference to any evidence of mental illness. Furthermore, it is not incumbent upon the Crown to prove one of the mental elements of murder unless it be the case that the affirmative defence is not made out. That short précis of legal principle is consistent with the analysis I undertook in R v Newbury [2012] NSWSC 136. Each counsel in this matter submitted that my earlier analysis was correct.
	
	
	If the Crown were to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused voluntarily (without reference to any mental illness) did an act that caused the death of the deceased, I would then turn to the defence of mental illness. Although the defence is referred to in s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act), it is not defined by statute. Its elements were set out well over 150 years ago in McNaghten's Case (1843) 8 ER 718 at [722]. The defence is established if it is more probable than not that:
	


“at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.”


	
	In a well-known and oft-quoted summing up in The King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182, Dixon J (as his Honour then was) said with regard to the latter portion of the defence:
	


“If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.”

Submissions


	
	In written and oral submissions, each counsel submitted that I would be well satisfied that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind, and that that disease led to a defect of reason. Neither counsel submitted that I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not know the nature and quality of his act. Each counsel also accepted that, in some sense, the accused appreciated the legal or theoretical wrongfulness of stabbing his father to death. The particular leg of that part of the defence to which each counsel pointed, and which each submitted had been made out to the requisite degree, was the proposition that, because of his severe mental illness, on 24 October 2013 the accused did not appreciate in any deep or moral sense the wrongfulness of his fatal conduct.
	


Determination


	
	Turning first to consider the Crown case, to my mind it is soundly established that the accused did an act that caused the death of the deceased. On the material placed before me, there can be no question but that the accused stabbed his father twice to his left side whilst his mother was closely nearby. It is incontrovertible that those serious wounds caused a severe haemorrhage and led to the death of Ian Gourlay. I am satisfied of those facts beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	As for the question of voluntariness, it is true that it was not explicitly adverted to in the document setting out the formal admissions of the accused. But in oral submissions, defence counsel made it clear that there is not the slightest dispute about that element of the Crown case. Nor is there any suggestion in the evidence that the accused was acting in some way involuntarily as the law understands that concept: see Ryan v The Queen (1967) 121 CLR 205, especially when one considers the question without taking into account any mental illness of the accused. I am satisfied to the criminal standard that, when the accused stabbed his father leading to the infliction of two deep wounds to his body, that was as a result of willed movements of his muscles.
	
	
	It follows that, in the circumstances of this case, the necessary elements of murder have been established beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I now turn to consider whether the necessary elements of the affirmative defence of mental illness have been made out by the accused on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	I am amply satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, at the time that he stabbed his father, the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind; namely, paranoid schizophrenia. There is no question of feigning or malingering in this case: the disease was chronic; the accused had suffered from it for years; and it is manifest from his medical history both before and after 24 October 2013.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that that disease led to the accused suffering from a defect of reason; namely, belief in delusions, experiencing hallucinations, being unable to think clearly, and being incapable of differentiating generally between what is real and not real. To give some examples from the many available, the accused believed that televisions, radios and aerials were communicating with him. He believed that his parents were trying to poison him, and that his neighbour was trying to kill him. He believed that his attack on his father was somehow connected to the accused climbing onto a roof some weeks before. He believed that voices were commanding him to do things. And he believed that the clothes worn by his father somehow exacerbated the manifestations of the illness from which the accused was suffering.
	
	
	Turning to the third leg of the defence, as I have indicated, each counsel accepted that the accused understood the nature and quality of his act when he stabbed his father. To my mind, that acceptance is soundly based: it reflects the unanimous opinion of two eminent forensic psychiatrists. As well as that, there is no suggestion in the evidence that the accused was suffering from a delusion as to the true nature or identity of the deceased. He did not believe that he was attacking, for example, a demon, an android, or an alien, as, sadly, some very mentally disturbed people believe when they inflict violence upon others. Furthermore, the things that he said about what he had done afterwards show that the accused appreciated that he had stabbed his father. Indeed, his remark to the police immediately upon their arrival shows that very thing. In the recorded interview with police, the accused expressed his understanding that he had stabbed his father with a knife. I am not satisfied that the accused did not appreciate the nature and quality of his act when he stabbed his father; to the contrary, I am satisfied in that sense that he did indeed understand what he was doing.
	
	
	Turning to the second aspect of the third leg of the defence, as I have said, each counsel accepted that, to some degree, the accused appreciated the legal wrongfulness of his acts. There was evidence to support that proposition. For instance, the accused was reported by his mother, Mrs Gourlay, as having said “I don’t care if I spend the rest of my life in gaol” shortly before he attacked his father. As well, the accused spoke of the fact that he had thought that his mother would call the police “after what I did”. I consider that that joint position of counsel was soundly based as well. I respectfully agree that the accused understood that his act was prohibited by the criminal law and could lead to punishment.
	
	
	Each counsel contended, however, that I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not in any deep or moral sense understand the wrongfulness of his actions. To my mind, there is a great deal of evidence of the actions and words of the accused that powerfully supports that proposition. It is as follows.
	
	
	First, the accused was content to commit the offence in the presence of an eye witness; namely, his own mother.
	
	
	Secondly, the accused announced his implicit intention to a degree before he committed the act.
	
	
	Thirdly, immediately after stabbing his father, the accused did not flee the scene as one who possessed a true consciousness of guilt might have done, but rather simply sat in the front driveway.
	
	
	Fourthly, on arrest, the accused referred to himself as being the victim, rather than his father, who, it must have been obvious, was gravely injured.
	
	
	Fifthly, in the recorded interview, the accused connected the stabbing of his father with the fact that the accused had climbed onto a roof some time before. That wholly irrational connection is suggestive of a lack of comprehension of the moral wrongfulness of his actions on the part of the accused.
	
	
	Sixthly, in custody the accused spoke of voices having commanded him to do what he had done in order to save himself and others.
	
	
	Seventhly and finally, one can draw a stark contrast between the position of the accused on 24 October 2013, when he was unmedicated, and the deep guilt he came to feel about his actions once he had been in custody for some months, and his illness was being treated by medication.
	
	
	To my mind, all of those aspects of the evidence strongly support the proposition that, at the time he inflicted fatal violence upon his father, the accused had no deep or moral appreciation of the wrongfulness of what he was doing.
	
	
	Additionally, and leaving aside my own assessment of all of those factors, I have been provided with the considered and unanimous decision of two psychiatrists. They are each experienced not only in forensic psychiatry generally, but also within the criminal justice system, and indeed with regard to this very question. It is quite true that, sitting as the tribunal of fact without a jury, I am not compelled to accept expert evidence, even if it be unanimous. Having said that, I certainly would not dismiss it capriciously, or without sound reason. To my mind, and speaking of the three reports as a whole, the opinions of the psychiatrists are founded upon the undisputed evidence, apply the correct legal test to that evidence, are cogently explained, and are ultimately compelling.
	
	
	In short, I am well satisfied that the accused did not appreciate that what he was doing was wrong according to the standards of everyday people. To the contrary, I consider that his illness led him to believe that he was justified in attacking his father in that way; indeed, he considered himself to be the wronged party.
	
	
	To summarise my findings, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased. To express those concepts more simply, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, by willed movement of his muscles, stabbed his own father in the presence of his mother, and that his father died as a result of the wounds inflicted upon him by his son.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, at the time he did that act, the accused was suffering from a defect of reason that arose from a disease of the mind. Again, to express that finding more simply, the accused was incapable of distinguishing between the real and the unreal because of his paranoid schizophrenia.
	
	
	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, at the time he did those acts, the accused did not appreciate the nature and quality of them. I consider that the accused well understood that he was stabbing his father, thereby endangering his life.
	
	
	Nor am I satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not appreciate that what he was doing was wrong in a legal sense. I consider that the accused understood that his acts were prohibited by the criminal law, and could well expose him to arrest, incarceration, and punishment.
	
	
	However, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not appreciate in any deeper moral sense that what he was doing was terribly wrong. To the contrary, I consider that his chronic and severe mental illness in the form of paranoid schizophrenia led him to believe that the only aggrieved party was himself.
	
	
	For those reasons, I shall shortly deliver the special verdict that the accused is not guilty of the offence of murder on the ground of mental illness.
	
	
	There was almost complete agreement between counsel with regard to the ancillary orders that I should make after delivery of verdict. Of course, there is not the slightest question of immediate release of the accused pursuant to s 39(1) of the Act. Defence counsel submitted, on the basis of some recommendations of Dr Furst, that I should make an order altering the current placement of the accused, in the interests of his psychiatric treatment, or at the least I should recommend such an alteration. But I consider that both steps would be precipitous: I think that the Mental Health Review Tribunal, with its expertise and resources, is soundly more qualified than me to make a considered decision as to the next step with regard to the detention and treatment of this very ill man.
	
	
	As well as that, I think it appropriate that I briefly explain the practical effect of my verdict to members of the community generally, and to those intimately involved in this tragedy in particular. In a moment, the accused will be found not guilty on the ground of mental illness of murdering his father. That does not mean, of course, that the acts of the accused did not cause his father’s death—they unquestionably did so. It does mean that, due to his profound and long-standing mental illness, the accused is not judged to be criminally responsible for his father’s death, and is not to be branded a murderer. However, it also means that the accused will be detained indefinitely by the determinations of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and he will not be released into the community unless and until the Tribunal is satisfied that he is not a serious danger to anyone, including himself.
	
	
	Finally, I take this opportunity to express my condolences, on behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, to all of those who have suffered, and who will continue to do so, as a result of the actions of the accused on 24 October 2013.
	


Orders


	
	With regard to the count of murder, I return a special verdict that the accused is not guilty on the ground of mental illness.
	
	
	Order that Daniel Michael Gourlay be detained at Long Bay Hospital, or at such other place as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until released by due process of law.
	
	
	Direct the Registrar of the Court, as soon as practicable, to notify the Minister for Health of this judgment and order.
	
	
	Direct the Registrar of the Court, as soon as practicable, to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of this judgment and order and to provide to that Tribunal the following documentation:

		16 February 2015",2015-02-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703902,R v Simmons; R v Moore [2015] NSWSC 73,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	By notice of motion filed in court this morning, the New South Wales Commissioner of Police seeks a number of orders which fall into two categories. First, orders are sought to protect the identity of some 11 witnesses who might generally be described as undercover operatives. Those orders are sought under the Law Enforcement and National Security (Assumed Identities) Act 2010 (NSW) and include orders that the witnesses be permitted to appear in court under their assumed names, various non-publication orders and closure of the Court during the course of their giving evidence. The second series of orders seeks non-publication with respect to details of various aspects of the police operation and the submissions relating to both applications. That application is made under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (“Court Suppression Act”).
	
	
	In support of the affidavit, Mr Bhalla (who represents the Commissioner) reads an open affidavit of Malcolm Arthur Lanyon and a confidential affidavit by the same deponent, along with a number of confidential exhibits. None of the parties who appear in the trial proper makes submissions against the making of the orders or take any particular position on the Commissioner’s application.
	
	
	I have read and considered the affidavit material. I note the content of s 34 of the Law Enforcement and National Security (Assumed Identities) Act 2010 (NSW):
	


“34. Identity of certain persons not to be disclosed in legal proceedings

(1) If, in proceedings before a court, a tribunal or a Royal Commission or other commission of inquiry, the identity of a person in respect of whom an authority is or was in force is in issue or may be disclosed, the court, tribunal, Royal Commission or other commission must, unless it considers that the interests of justice otherwise require:

(a) ensure that such parts of the proceedings as relate to the identity of the person are held in private, and

(b) make such orders as to the suppression of evidence given before it as, in its opinion, will ensure that the identity of the person is not disclosed.

(2) In particular, the court, tribunal, Royal Commission or other commission of inquiry:

(a) may allow a person in respect of whom an authority is or was in force to appear before it under the assumed name or under a code name or code number, and

(b) may make orders prohibiting the publication of any information (including information derived from evidence given before it) that identifies, or might facilitate the identification of, any person who has been or is proposed to be called to give evidence.

(3) A person must not contravene an order in force under this section.

Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.”


	
	It will be seen that the Court must make relevant orders unless it is in the interests of justice to do otherwise. I am not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do anything other than that which is necessary to protect the identity of the various witnesses. Accordingly, I propose to make orders in accordance with orders 14 through to 21 in the notice of motion, although they will be renumbered when I make the final orders.
	
	
	As to the second aspect of the Commissioner's application, the three very experienced counsel who appear for the parties in the trial proper all agree that it is necessary to make a non-publication order over all of the evidence and submissions which are to be heard on the voir dire. That is to protect the integrity of the process and the ultimate trial, which may (or, as I found out this morning, may not) be by jury. I am satisfied pursuant to s 8(1)(a) of the Court Suppression Act that such an order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. Accordingly, it is not necessary at this stage to resolve whether subs-s (a), (c) or (e) of s 8(1) are engaged by virtue of the matters raised on behalf of the Commissioner. That question may need to be revisited at the conclusion of the voir dire, but at this stage the Commissioner's position will be protected by the orders that I propose to make.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
	



	
	The 11 witnesses referred to in orders 3 to 13 of the notice of motion be allowed to appear before the Court at the hearing of these proceedings under their respective assumed names. For clarity, those witnesses are referred to in their statements as UCO 1, UCO 2, UCO 3, UCO 4, UCO 5, UCO 6, UCO 7, UCO 8, UCO 9, UCO 10 and UCO 11.
	
	
	The witnesses be otherwise referred to by their assumed names during the course of the hearing, during the course of any other or further interlocutory proceedings conducted in connection with these proceedings and for all purposes in these proceedings.
	
	
	There is to be no publication or other disclosure of the real identity of the witnesses or of any document, evidence or other disclosure that identifies or might facilitate the identification of the real identities of the witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	There is to be no publication or other disclosure of the assumed identities or assumed names of the witnesses or of any document or evidence that identifies or might facilitate the identification of the assumed names of the witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	Without limiting the generality of orders (3) and (4), there is to be no publication or other disclosure of any visual or other description or depiction of the physical appearances or any other identifying features of the witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	The Court is to be closed for the duration of the evidence given by the witnesses, subject to the following being permitted to be present in court while they give their evidence:
	



	
	the accused and their legal representatives;
	
	
	the legal representatives of the prosecution;
	
	
	officers of the New South Wales Police Force involved in investigating the offences before the Court and officers of the New South Wales Police Force attached to the New South Wales Police Force Undercover Program so long as they are not themselves required to give evidence after any of the witnesses;
	
	
	legal representatives for the Commissioner of Police;
	
	
	staff of the Department of Corrective Services;
	
	
	court staff; and
	
	
	any person sworn or affirmed as a member of a jury in the trial.
	



	
	Pursuant to s 11 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act, orders (3) through to (5) are to apply throughout the Commonwealth of Australia.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act, the orders will apply until any further order of the Court.
	
	
	There is to be no publication of any evidence or submissions given or made in the course of the pre-trial voir dire, such order to remain in effect until any further order of the Court and to apply throughout the Commonwealth.
	
	
	There is to be no publication in relation to submissions heard this morning.
	



	
	The confidential affidavit and the written submissions in support will be placed in a sealed envelope, not to be opened except by order of a judge of this Court or a judge of a higher court.

		09 April 2015",2015-02-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703905,R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I agree with Simpson J.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: This is a Crown appeal against what is asserted to be the manifest inadequacy of a series of sentences imposed upon the respondent in the District Court on 21 November 2013.
	
	
	On 23 and 24 July 2013 the respondent was arraigned on two separate indictments. The first charged:
	



	
	one count of possession of a prohibited firearm (a shortened 12 gauge shotgun, an offence committed on 21 March 2012);
	
	
	one count of possession of an unregistered firearm (a .38 calibre revolver, also committed on 21 March 2012).
	


Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), the maximum penalty applicable to the first of these offences is imprisonment for 14 years. Pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) a standard non-parole period of 3 years is prescribed.

Pursuant to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act the maximum penalty applicable to the second is imprisonment for 10 years. No standard non-parole period is prescribed.


	
	The respondent entered pleas of guilty to each of these charges. Pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, he asked that an additional offence identified on a Form 1 be taken into account on sentencing. This was an offence of possession of prohibited firearm (a shortened 12 gauge shotgun) which was not registered.
	
	
	The second indictment on which the respondent was arraigned (on 24 July 2013) charged:
	



	
	one count of demanding money (from Anthony Cats) with menaces, allegedly committed between 1 December 2011 and 22 March 2012;
	
	
	one count of shooting (at George Katsambas) with intent to murder, allegedly committed on 21 March 2012;
	
	
	one count, alternative to the previous count, of discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (to George Katsambas);
	
	
	three counts of discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (to Anthony Cats) also allegedly committed on 21 March 2012.
	



	
	The respondent entered pleas of not guilty to each charge on this indictment. A jury was empanelled and a trial proceeded. During the course of the trial, the trial judge (Robison DCJ) directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty in respect of the first count (demanding money with menaces). On 7 August 2013 the jury returned verdicts on the remaining counts. It found the respondent not guilty of count 2 (shooting at George Katsambas with intent to murder) and of its alternative (discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to George Katsambas). It found the respondent guilty of each of the three counts of discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Anthony Cats. I will refer to these offences as “the shooting offences”. Pursuant to s 33A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty applicable to each of these offences is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	On 21 November 2013 Robison DCJ sentenced the respondent as follows:
	



	
	for the offence of possession of a 12 gauge shotgun: imprisonment for 2 years and 11 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 21 March 2012;
	
	
	for the offence of possession of an unregistered revolver (taking into account the Form 1 offence): imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year, 1 month and 15 days, also commencing on 21 March 2012;
	
	
	for each of the shooting offences: imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, the first to commence on 21 June 2012, the second on 21 August 2012, and the third on 21 October 2012.
	


There was thus an accumulation by 3 months on the first sentence, and 2 months for each of the subsequent offences. The total term of imprisonment imposed was a head sentence of 8 years and 7 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months. In sentencing as he did, Robison DCJ found that there were special circumstances that justified departure from the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole periods specified in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, and applied this to the individual sentences for the shooting offences and also the overall sentence. The non-parole period of the overall sentence is 56 per cent of the head sentence, a significant reduction on the statutory ratio of 75 per cent.


	
	For the purpose of sentencing in respect of the shooting offences, it was necessary that Robison DCJ make appropriate findings of fact, not inconsistent with the jury verdicts, based on the evidence in the trial. He did this in a somewhat unusual manner. On 12 September 2013 he delivered what he later referred to as “a draft set of remarks”. In these remarks he canvassed the evidence in the trial. No issue was or has been taken with the facts as he then recounted them. On 21 November 2012 he delivered a second set of remarks, essentially explaining the matters relevant to sentence, both as to the objective circumstances of the offences, and the personal circumstances of the respondent. These remarks were sound recorded. Unfortunately, due to a technical fault in the recording equipment, 15 minutes of the second set of remarks was unable to be transcribed. It appears from a note to the transcript that Robison DCJ has “endeavoured to complete the gaps based in part on his memory, notes and practice”. It is not possible, from the transcript provided to this Court, to identify what parts of the transcript in its present state derive from the sound recording and what parts (if any) have been supplemented by his Honour. With those limitations in mind I proceed to deal with the issues raised in the appeal.
	


The relevant facts


	
	There is no difficulty in ascertaining the facts found by Robison DCJ, and no issue is taken as to those findings of fact.
	
	
	Anthony Cats was a self-employed builder. He had undertaken a shop fit out project in the city as a result of which he became indebted to a sub-contractor. Mr Cats was in financial difficulties and was unable to repay the debt. Late in 2011, persons apparently acting on behalf of the sub-contractor began to harass Mr Cats, demanding payment of the debt. The Crown alleged that the respondent was involved in this campaign. (This is given by way of background only, since the conduct alleged by the Crown gave rise to the charge of demanding money with menaces, which was ultimately the subject of a verdict of not guilty by direction.)
	
	
	On 21 March 2012 a meeting was arranged between Mr Cats and the respondent, in the suburb of Miller. The meeting place was in the vicinity of a TAFE college. Mr Cats attended, accompanied by George Katsambas. The respondent was surprised and disconcerted by the presence of Mr Katsambas, and demanded to know why he was present. He then demanded money from Mr Cats. There was some discussion, and the three men began to walk towards a nearby footbridge. The respondent told Mr Cats that he had had enough time to repay the debt, and produced a firearm from his pocket. He shouted “You’ve had enough time”, and “This is for fucking me around”, held the gun to Mr Cats’ arm, and fired. Mr Cats stepped back, the respondent ordered him to get to the ground, and fired again, towards Mr Cats’ legs. (It was the Crown case that the respondent then fired three shots at Mr Katsambas, who was running away, but the jury acquitted the respondent of those charges.) The respondent then fired a third shot at Mr Cats, this time striking him in the right inner thigh.
	
	
	Mr Cats unwisely called the respondent “a big weak piece of shit” and threatened retaliation. This caused the respondent to point the gun again towards Mr Cats, at the upper half of his body. He did not shoot again.
	
	
	It seems that medical evidence as to the injuries to Mr Cats was adduced in the trial. This was not the subject of any explicit findings of fact by his Honour, and the evidence was not placed before this Court. All that his Honour said on this topic was:
	


“Mr Cats was admitted to Liverpool Hospital for a number of days and I note certain medical procedures were undertaken.”


	
	The respondent was arrested on the same day. Robison DCJ noted that the firearm used in the offences was never located. It is not clear on the material before this Court how the firearms the subject of the possession charges came to light. It is to be noted that those offences were committed on the same day as the shooting offences.
	


The respondent’s personal circumstances


	
	It is apparent from the “draft set of remarks” that the respondent gave evidence in the trial, but it is also apparent that his evidence was not accepted by the jury. Whether his evidence went to his personal circumstances or not is not known. There are no findings of fact based on any such evidence, if any was given. There was before his Honour a Pre-Sentence Report, and the respondent’s wife gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	The respondent was born in March 1977 and was 35 at the time of the offences. He has only a relatively modest criminal record; apart from a traffic offence, and three offences of driving on an expired licence, his record contains two offences of obtaining money by deception (in respect of which he was made subject to a good behaviour bond, and ordered to pay compensation, respectively, of $37.50 and $47.26, and fined $300), and a shoplifting offence (in respect of which he was fined $250).
	
	
	Some aspects of the Pre-Sentence Report are difficult to reconcile. However, I will record what was before his Honour. The principal source of information available to its author was the respondent himself. Secondary sources were a statement of police facts, the respondent’s criminal history, and NSW Corrective Services’ records.
	
	
	The author of the Pre-Sentence Report recorded that the respondent was born in New Zealand, the eldest of three children. His father left the family when the respondent was six years of age, and the respondent assumed parental responsibility. He left school in New Zealand at the age of 11 years, without completing primary school. He struggled with the responsibility he had undertaken in the family. By the age of 13 he was exhibiting behavioural problems and was sent by his mother to live with his father in the United States of America. There he attended high school and showed talent as a footballer. He soon ran away from his father’s home and lived on the streets for a time, until rescued by his football coach. He has had limited contact with his father since that time. He remained in the United States for eight years, until his mother died and he returned to New Zealand for her funeral. He then decided to migrate to Australia. He holds both New Zealand and United States citizenship. He claims to have completed a business administration degree.
	
	
	He married in 2005. He and his wife have four children, now aged between four and nine years. The family relationships are sound. His wife and children have been regular visitors since the respondent’s incarceration. The respondent’s wife confirmed that he has a high level of support from herself and the children, as well as his extended family, the Polynesian community and friends.
	
	
	In 2001, in Australia, he began a finance company to educate and assist Polynesian families. He sold this business in 2005. He then took on work as a self-employed truck driver.
	
	
	The respondent maintains his innocence of the shooting offences; he claimed to the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that he was acting in self-defence.
	
	
	Also in evidence were testimonials from Bishop Manumaleuga (of an unidentified Christian church), Shawn Busken, a US attorney, and Monoa To’omata, of the Mission Australia Centre.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	Finally, there was before his Honour a victim impact statement signed by Mr Cats. Mr Cats said that prior to these events, his psychological and emotional wellbeing were “fine”, but that the stress caused by the offences had affected him and his family psychologically, emotionally and financially. He said he was not able to work and was forced to relocate his family. His sleep has been disturbed, he is fearful of a return of the people who pursued him, he has nightmares about being shot in the head and suffers self-motivation and depression problems. His children are also affected because his fear has caused him to restrict their activities. He said that the emotional strain that the offences had placed upon himself and his wife were “indescribable”. He said that he no longer has full use of his hand as the nerves had not mended after surgery. He suffers pain in the knee in cold weather. He said that he was now unable to practise his trade (of building and carpentry) and his ability to earn income was reduced by two-thirds. He is receiving psychological treatment.
	
	
	He finished his statement by saying:
	


“Unless they are subjected to it, no one can ever imagine the toll this has taken on me mentally and physically. I don’t wish this on anyone and I believe that we as a community need to stand up to mindless thugs who victimise innocent people who try to make a living. MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.”


	
	The victim impact statement was tendered as part of the Crown’s bundle of material relevant to sentence. No objection was taken to its admission. However, somewhat unusually, a point concerning the use to which it could be put was taken. In written submissions, counsel who represented the respondent submitted:
	


“… that the Court would take with some scepticism what Mr Cats says in the VIS.”

This was repeated in the oral submissions. Importantly, counsel said:

“One thing Mr Cats fails to mention in particular in that statement and didn’t really like talking about, was his bankruptcy. It’s his bankruptcy which prevents him from earning more than, I think it’s $40,000 a year. In the victim impact statement, he’s claiming that it’s his injuries that prevent him from earning $75,000 a year.”


	
	Counsel also contrasted the content of the victim impact statement concerning permanent physical injuries with the medical evidence in the trial, and urged that “Mr Cats was not a truthful person”, and that, therefore, reliance could not be placed on the content of his victim impact statement.
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	It is in respect of the findings concerning the respondent’s personal circumstances, and the manner in which they were treated, that the transcript of the Remarks on Sentence is (by reason of the technical fault in the recording system) deficient. What can be discerned is the following.
	
	
	Robison DCJ considered the respondent’s criminal record, and treated him as, essentially, a person of good character. He paid careful attention to the testimonial material, and to the evidence of the respondent’s wife.
	
	
	He recognised that the offences were serious. He took into account that the shooting offences took place in a public place, in the vicinity of a TAFE college, but noted that there was no reliable evidence that any member of the public was actually present or close by or put at risk. He agreed with the Crown submission that the evidence disclosed “criminality of a very high order”.
	
	
	In the course of recording the factual matters disclosed by the evidence in the trial, Robison DCJ alluded to certain inconsistencies between the evidence given by Mr Cats, and other evidence, and said:
	


“The jury no doubt considered exhibit A [Exhibit A in the trial appears to have been some sort of diagram illustrating the location of injuries to Mr Cats] and although that document and what it revealed may be somewhat inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Cats, at the end of the day, undoubtedly Mr Cats sustained the injury that he said was sustained and given that these events were undoubtedly traumatic for him I would not be surprised if there were some inaccuracies in the evidence of Mr Cats when it came to the precise location of all of the participants in all of this.” (italics added)

He also noted:

“Mr Cats was admitted to Liverpool Hospital for a number of days and I note certain medical procedures were undertaken.”


	
	Later, in the second set of Remarks (and before the recording equipment failed) he accepted that Mr Cats “did receive some injury”, but further said:
	


“… I accept ultimately by and large he has recovered at least physically from those injuries but I have taken into account his victim impact statement.”


	
	In the second set of Remarks his Honour made extensive reference to the trial evidence of Mr Cats. It is unnecessary to go into detail, but it is clear that Mr Cats’ credibility was significantly in issue, and that attacks on his credibility bore fruit. Robison DCJ said, for example, that Mr Cats “was not an ideal witness” and that, in some respects, “his credibility may have been somewhat impaired when it came to surrounding issues”. These observations have significance with respect to one of the matters that arises in the appeal.
	
	
	It is apparent from some of the spasmodic recording that is available (or supplementation of the recording) that his Honour gave careful attention to the Pre-Sentence Report. Having regard to the testimonials, he accepted that the offences were totally out of character.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act he found special circumstances justifying reduction of the non-parole period and extension of the parole period. In respect of the possession of firearms offences, he allowed, in recognition of the respondent’s (rather late) pleas of guilty, a reduction of 10 per cent on the sentences that otherwise would have been imposed: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the sentences for those (possession) offences should be served concurrently, but that there should be a degree of accumulation in respect of the shooting offences. Accordingly, he ordered that the first shooting offence sentence be accumulated by 3 months upon the possession offences sentences, and the subsequent sentences each by 2 months.
	


The Crown appeal


	
	The grounds (as amended) relied upon by the Crown were:
	


“1. The sentences imposed by his Honour are manifestly inadequate.

2. The non-parole periods set by his Honour are manifestly inadequate.”


	
	In support of these grounds, in written submissions the Crown advanced a number of propositions. These were, essentially:
	


(i)  that each of the shooting offences merited the imposition of a sentence of a substantial period of full-time custody;

(ii)  that each of the firearms possession offences likewise merited the imposition of a sentence of full-time custody;

(iii)  that the discrepancies between the maximum sentences applicable to each offence (and, in the case of the possession of a prohibited firearm offence, the prescribed standard non-parole period) and the sentences imposed are such as to suggest that inadequate weight was given to the statutory maxima (and the standard non-parole period) in the sentence determinations;

(iv)  that the sentences imposed, and the non-parole periods fixed, suggest that inadequate weight was given to the objective gravity of the offences, and in particular to the injuries inflicted on Mr Cats;

(v)  that the Remarks on Sentence, and the sentences imposed, suggest that undue weight was given to the personal circumstances of the respondent, in particular to the fact that he had not previously served a term of imprisonment;

(vi)  that the shooting offences were aggravated, and the respondent was liable to a more severe penalty, because the injuries, emotional harm and loss and damage suffered by Mr Cats were substantial in that he was rendered incapable of future work in his trade and hardship was inflicted on him and his family (in this respect, specific reference was made to the victim impact statement);

(vii)  that the offences were aggravated, and the respondent was rendered liable to a more severe penalty, because the shooting offences were committed in public, in the vicinity of a TAFE college, and near a public bus stop, and therefore without regard for public safety;

(viii)  that, by limiting the accumulation of the sentences as he did, his Honour imposed an overall sentence that failed properly to reflect the totality of the respondent’s criminality; and

(ix)  that the overall non-parole period imposed did not represent an adequate minimum term that the respondent must serve, commensurate with the objective gravity of the offences and the need for specific deterrence to be reflected.


	
	An important plank in the Crown’s argument (although not one on which the Crown case solely depended) concerned the physical and other injuries, and loss and damage, occasioned to Mr Cats as a consequence of the shooting offences. It will be necessary to return to this issue.
	


Consideration


	
	Sentencing for the offences is governed by Pt 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, of which s 21A is an integral and important component. Section 21A(2) sets out the aggravating factors that, where known and applicable, must be taken into account in the sentencing exercise. Section 21A(3) similarly lists mitigating circumstances that, where known and applicable, must be taken into account.
	
	
	By a suffix to s 21A(2), the court is not to have regard to any specified aggravating factor that is, in any event, an element of the offence. Nor is the court to take into account as an aggravating factor a circumstance that is “an inherent characteristic” of the offence: Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43; 2006 45 MVR 402. Before an aggravating factor may be taken into account it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193.
	
	
	Relevantly, for present purposes, s 21A(2)(g) expressly provides that a sentencing court must take into account as an aggravating factor:
	


“… [that] the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial.”

A further aggravating factor, specified in sub-para (i), is:

“… [that] the offence was committed without regard for public safety.”


	
	It was not in issue that each offence, taken individually, called for a period of imprisonment. The Crown’s propositions (i) and (ii) may be accepted.
	
	
	In light of the decision of the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571, propositions (iii), (iv) and (v) must be treated with considerable caution. Each asserts attribution of inadequate or excessive weight to one of the recognised sentencing considerations - inadequate weight assigned to the statutory maximum penalties and standard non-parole period, and to the injuries inflicted on Mr Cats, and excessive weight assigned to the respondent’s personal circumstances. No attempt was made to identify any passage in the sentencing remarks that indicated an overemphasis on personal circumstances, or under-emphasis on the statutory maximum penalties. Rather, the contention was put forward in an attempt to explain what were said to be erroneously light sentences.
	
	
	It is not uncommon, in Crown appeals, where specific error of the kinds mentioned in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 cannot be identified, to seek to infer (or hypothesise) that what is asserted to be an erroneous exercise of sentencing discretion can be laid at the door of an erroneous attribution of weight to one or more of those sentencing considerations. That approach may no longer be legitimate (if it ever was). In Bugmy, the plurality made it plain that the weight to be attributed to particular sentencing considerations is a matter for the sentencing judge: see [24]. The plurality went on to say:
	


“The authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal to substitute a sentence for that imposed by [the sentencing judge] was not enlivened by its view that it would have given greater weight to deterrence and less weight to the appellant’s subjective case. The power could only be engaged if the court was satisfied that [the sentencing judge’s] discretion miscarried because in the result his Honour imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards.” (internal citations omitted)

The question to which this Court must address itself, therefore, is whether it is satisfied that Robison DCJ’s sentencing discretion miscarried, because he imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could justly be imposed for the offences consistently with sentencing standards. It is propositions (viii) and (ix) to which this Court must direct attention. Although the amended ground of appeal challenged the individual sentences, propositions (viii) and (ix) are directed, not to the individual sentences, but to the overall sentence imposed after accumulation. Did the overall head sentence fail adequately to reflect the totality of the respondent’s criminality? Did the overall non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months fail to represent an adequate minimum term to be served in the light of the totality of the offending? In answering these questions, propositions (vi) and (vii) are material.

Section 21A(2)(g): was substantial harm caused by the shooting offence?


	
	The Crown argument in support of proposition (vi) centred heavily upon the extent of the injuries occasioned to Mr Cats, and the emotional harm and loss and damage suffered by him as a consequence of the shooting offences. These, it was the Crown case, established the aggravating factor specified in s 21A(2)(g) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. It may here be noted that the offences of which the respondent was convicted were of shooting with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That grievous (or any other) harm was in fact caused is not an element of the offences and is not for that reason excluded from consideration by the suffix to s 21A(2). However, it might be expected that shooting at a victim with intent to cause grievous bodily harm would cause some degree of anxiety, fear, or other emotional harm. Such harm is intrinsic to the offence and, to the extent that it is, is excluded from consideration.
	
	
	As I have mentioned above, in his Remarks on Sentence, Robison DCJ made only sketchy reference to the physical injuries suffered by Mr Cats, and none to any emotional impact on him, or other loss or damage. He made no reference to financial loss. There is no indication in the second set of Remarks, inadequately transcribed as they are, to suggest that any finding within s 21A(2)(g) was made. Even if it were open to this Court to make its own findings of fact in that regard, none of the trial evidence was put before the Court, and this Court has no basis on which to make such findings of fact.
	
	
	The only material before this Court relevant to the question of “substantial harm” is that contained in Mr Cats’ victim impact statement, upon which the Crown placed considerable reliance. That raises squarely the question of the status of such a document.
	
	
	Division 2 of Pt 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act makes provision for the admission of victim impact statements. Section 28(1) relevantly provides as follows:
	


“(1) If it considers it appropriate to do so, a court may receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after it convicts, but before it sentences, an offender.

…”

At the time of sentencing, s 28(4) relevantly provided as follows:

“Despite sub-sections (1) … a court:

(a)  must not consider a victim impact statement unless it has been given by or on behalf of the victim to whom it relates or by or on behalf of the prosecutor,

(b)  …”

(Sub-section (4) has since been amended, but in a manner that is not material to this appeal.)


	
	Sub-section (1) is sufficient authorisation for the reception by Robison DCJ of Mr Cats’ victim impact statement. However, s 28 does not elucidate what use may be made of a victim impact statement. The absence of guidance as to the use of such statements was described as “unfortunate” by Basten JA in R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 at [37].
	
	
	What must be clearly stated is that, in this case, the Crown seeks to rely upon the content of Mr Cats’ victim impact statement as evidence - the only evidence to which this Court was directed - to establish an aggravating feature of the offences. That is the aggravating factor provided for by s 21A(2)(g), extracted above.
	


What use can be made of a victim impact statement?


	
	Although the question has been raised on a number of occasions, this Court has yet to reach a consensus on the use to which a victim impact statement may be put. It may be that it is not possible to reach such a consensus, and that each case will depend upon its own facts and circumstances. A brief review of how the issue has been dealt with on previous occasions may be useful.
	
	
	In 1992, in R v RKB (NSWCCA, 30 June 1992, unreported) Badgery-Parker J, with whom McInerney and Loveday JJ agreed, said:
	


“… undoubtedly the court is required to take into account the impact of criminal behaviour upon victims of that behaviour and has always done so … But what has to be taken into account is some objective assessment of the effect upon the victim … The sentencing process is necessarily one to be undertaken with objectivity, and one cannot expect that from the victims of criminal behaviour …”


	
	It must be acknowledged that these remarks were made in the context of a consideration of whether an attitude of forgiveness on the part of the victims (of child sexual offences) and other family members could or should be taken into account on sentencing. But the principle stated is of broader application, and extends to the assessment for the purposes of s 21A(2)(g) of the degree of harm caused by the offence.
	
	
	R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 was another case of sexual intercourse with a victim under the age of 16 years. The sentencing judge expressly took into account a victim impact statement, which, she said “eloquently and articulately describes how the commission of the offences has affected” the victim. Having regard to the victim impact statement, her Honour rejected a submission made on behalf of the offender “that there was no trauma associated with the offence”. On application for leave to appeal against sentence, this finding was challenged. Sperling J, with whom Grove J and I agreed, acknowledged that harm to the victim of an offence is a relevant sentencing consideration. He then referred to s 28 of the Sentencing Procedure Act (including sub-s (4)) and said:
	


“60  … The implication is that a victim impact statement may, in the discretion of a court, be received and taken into account as evidence of harm caused by the offence and, in that way, as evidence relevant to the determination of punishment by sentence.

61  Whilst a sentencing hearing is not subject to the rules of evidence unless an order to that effect is made and whilst s 28 also, by implication, allows the court to take a victim impact statement into account in determining the appropriate punishment by sentence, the weight to be given to such a statement is for the court to determine. In RKB … it was acknowledged that a sentencing court is required to take into account the impact of criminal behaviour on the victim or victims of such behaviour but, it was said, what is required is an objective assessment of the crime’s effect.

62  The court is required to be satisfied of the facts in question beyond reasonable doubt. In these circumstances, substantial weight cannot be given to an account of harm in an unsworn statement, not necessarily and almost certainly not in the victim’s own words, untested by cross-examination and, in the nature of things, far from being an objective and impartial account of the effect of the offence on the victim.” (italics added)


	
	The language of para [62] echoes that of Hunt J (as he then was) in R v Muldoon (NSWCCA, 13 December 1990, unreported), another case of child sexual abuse. Hunt J was critical of both a pre-sentence report, and a victim impact statement. It seems that the victim impact statement had been prepared by a social worker. The social worker purported to predict long-term consequences for the victim. This was rejected by the sentencing judge, who considered that the effects of the abuse would “fade in time”. That gave rise to a Crown appeal. Of the victim impact statement, Hunt J (with the concurrence of Enderby and Grove JJ) said:
	


“Indeed, it is difficult to see how anyone can really make a valid assessment of what will happen to a particular young victim in the future without a great deal more material than the judge was given here. What would be of far more assistance to sentencing judges in these cases than the shallow, trite and apparently wholly unqualified observations produced in this case would be the results of studies conducted over a significantly broad base and over a significant period of time into the lasting effects of sexual abuse upon young children. With that type of assistance and, if necessary, with some psychiatric assessment from a qualified source, the judge will be in a far safer position to make his or her own assessment in relation to the particular victim.”


	
	These decisions must be seen in their historical context. In the early 1990s judges had not accumulated the experience of dealing with sexual offences against children that, by 2014, they (regrettably) had. It could scarcely, in 2014, be said that, in order to prove that sexual abuse of children causes substantial damage, the Crown ought to produce “the results of studies conducted over a significantly broad base and over a significant period of time”. In no small measure, this is because those very studies have been conducted and are not only in the public arena but also in the public (and judicial) consciousness. Such damage is now assumed: see R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 per Adamson J.
	
	
	But, while its application to that specific class of offence has been limited by the passage of time, the underlying principle stated by Hunt J and Badgery-Parker J holds good. Where it is asserted that the offences caused injury, loss or damage beyond what would ordinarily be expected of the offence charged, that injury, loss and damage must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The question here is whether that can be proved by an unsworn victim impact statement, not subject to testing by cross-examination.
	
	
	Hidden J had to deal with that very question in R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412. That was a case of armed robbery, in which the victim had spoken of anxiety and nervousness as a result of the offence (in a statement made on the day of the offence). There was no evidence that that state of anxiety was enduring. In these circumstances, Hidden J said:
	


“26  However, before a judge could find ‘substantial emotional harm’ within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g), one would expect evidence specifically directed to that issue. Normally, that would be in the form of a victim impact statement. Whether that evidence established the aggravating factor would be a matter to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case. However, it would need to disclose an emotional response significantly more deleterious than that which any ordinary person would have when subjected to an armed robbery. There was no such evidence here.”


	
	Similarly, in R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300, Wood CJ at CL said:
	


“48  However, I would sound a note of caution in relation to the proper approach to fact-finding concerning the impact of a crime upon other members of the community or, upon the victim. If that is to be achieved by way of victim impact statements, then an injustice may occur in relation to a person standing for sentence, in so far as the maker of the statement would not normally be available for cross-examination.

49  I add that caution in support of the general proposition that extreme care needs to be taken by those who prosecute and defend these cases, and also by trial judges in always ensuring that there is a proper evidentiary basis for any findings of fact which go towards aggravating or mitigating a sentence.”


	
	R v King [2004] NSWCCA 444; 150 A Crim R 409 was a somewhat unusual case. The offender pleaded guilty to a single count of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The victim of the offence was pregnant. The offender sought to persuade the victim to have the pregnancy terminated, but she declined to do so. The offence was constituted by the offender’s punching the victim in the stomach. The punch in the stomach caused a miscarriage. The victim gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings, and was extensively cross-examined on behalf of the offender. The victim impact statement she made was admitted without objection. Cross-examination did not challenge anything in the victim impact statement.
	
	
	On those facts, McColl JA (with whom Howie and Buddin JJ agreed) accepted that the victim impact statement demonstrated that the victim had suffered permanent loss of great significance to her.
	
	
	R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 was another case of malicious wounding and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. A victim impact statement was admitted. I observed that, while it is always open to an offender to challenge the factual basis of the case advanced by the Crown, there was no provision either for or against cross-examination of the author of a victim impact statement. I said:
	


“28  It may be, in an appropriate case, that a sentencing judge would decline to accept a victim impact statement, or attribute to it less weight than otherwise might be the case. This could arise where (as, arguably, happened here) the Crown sought, by way of a victim impact statement, to establish matters seriously going to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence that were either in issue or not conceded.”


	
	However, I went on to hold (with the concurrence of Barr and Latham JJ) that in all of the circumstances of that case, undue weight had not been given to the victim impact statement. The relevant circumstances included:
	



	
	the victim impact statement was admitted without objection;
	
	
	no argument was advanced as to the weight to be accorded to the victim impact statement;
	
	
	no attempt was made (by experienced counsel) on sentencing to limit the use to be made of the contents of the victim impact statement;
	
	
	the contents of the victim impact statement “could hardly be the cause of any surprise” to the offender;
	
	
	the contents of the victim impact statement accorded with conclusions the sentencing judge would in any event have drawn.
	



	
	In R v Bain [2006] NSWCCA 79; 161 A Crim R 36 the offender was convicted of armed robbery after trial. A victim impact statement attested to the significant emotional harm he suffered as a result. Sully J (with Adams J concurring) upheld a submission that it was an error on the part of a sentencing judge to accept a victim impact statement as sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that harm had been suffered by the victim to a greater extent than would ordinarily be expected in a victim of an armed robbery. (In order to qualify as “substantial harm” within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g), the harm needs to be shown to be greater than ordinarily attaches to an offence of the kind in question. That is because the prescribed maximum penalties already take into account harm of the kind expected.)
	
	
	Sully J referred to Youkhana, and said:
	


“10  This exposition of principle requires a sentencing Judge to do two distinct things before finding that the s 21A(2)(g) factor has been established.

11  First, the Judge must consider whether there is in hand evidence capable of establishing at all the incidence of, relevantly, emotional harm of the ‘more deleterious’ kind described by Hidden J [in Youkhana].

12  It seems to me to be plain that [the victim’s] description of a congeries of serious and continuing adverse personal consequences stemming from the applicant’s crime is ample to satisfy Hidden J’s criterion.

13  Secondly, and given an affirmative answer to the first question thus to be asked by the sentencing Judge, the Judge must then consider whether the contents of the victim impact statement have ‘established the aggravating factor [which is] a matter to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case’.

14  What does that actually mean? The applicant submits that it means at least this: that a finding that any of the s 21A(2) aggravating factors has been established must be a finding made beyond reasonable doubt; and that, at least as a general rule, that cannot be done simply by accepting and acting upon a victim’s own description made in a statement that is both unsworn and untested by cross-examination.

15  In the current state of the law I am of the opinion that such submission must be accepted …” (italics in original, bold added)


	
	In R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; 176 A Crim R 1 an offender pleaded guilty to an offence of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. A victim impact statement, attesting to significant consequences, including loss of employment, was tendered. The sentencing judge, applying Slack, was not satisfied that the emotional and financial harm to the victim was substantial. James J (Mason P and Hislop J concurring) held that it was open to the sentencing judge to take that view. He, too, relied upon the observations of Sperling J in Slack.
	
	
	In Thomas (cited above) Basten JA said:
	


“… it will often be appropriate to give weight to a victim impact statement where the conduct of the offender is otherwise established beyond reasonable doubt and the statement is restricted to subsequent effects on the victim.”


	
	The offender in R v Porter [2008] NSWCCA 145 pleaded guilty to two counts of break, enter and steal and five counts of arson. Victim impact statements were tendered without objection. The “victim impact statements” were not victim impact statements within the meaning of s 28 of the Sentencing Procedure Act (because the offences were not offences to which Pt 3 Div 2 of the Sentencing Procedure Act applies). Johnson J held that, because at common law loss or damage suffered by a victim is a factor to be taken into account in the sentencing process (see, for example, Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656) statements to that effect were admissible. No argument appears to have been directed to the court concerning the capacity of evidence in that form to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, an aggravating factor.
	
	
	In Aguirre v R [2010] NSWCCA 155 James J referred to Youkhana, Slack, Thomas and Wilson and adopted the reasoning process in Wilson. On the facts of Aguirre, the victim impact statements were admitted without objection, no submissions were made that the use thereof should be limited or that the evidentiary weight to be given to them should be limited. In those circumstances, James J held, the sentencing judge could properly use the victim impact statements to establish the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(g).
	
	
	In Ollis v R [2011] NSWCCA 155 an argument was put that the sentencing judge should not have accepted “uncritically” the contents of the victim impact statement, given what was said to be concern with respect to the credibility and reliability of the victim’s evidence at trial. It was submitted that the sentencing judge should not have relied upon the victim impact statement without corroborative evidence concerning counselling or psychiatric treatment.
	
	
	Johnson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Garling J agreed) said:
	


“91  The victim impact statement was admitted without objection in the District Court. Further, the submissions made for the Appellant with respect to it did not include arguments of the type advanced to this court. In particular, it was not contended that less weight ought be given to it because of the victim’s evidence given at trial nor the absence of other evidence. In any event, the jury had clearly accepted the evidence of the victim, giving rise to the conviction of the Appellant on all counts.

92  In my view, it was open to the sentencing Judge to reach the conclusion which he did by reference to the victim impact statement.”

This was also the reasoning process of Wilson.


	
	RP v R [2013] NSWCCA 192 was another case of historic indecent assault on an 11 year old victim. On any view, the facts of the offences placed them at a low level on the scale of objective gravity. However, a victim impact statement (admitted without objection) spoke of an ongoing emotional response on the part of the victim, far beyond that which, in the experience of the court, could have been expected in the light of the nature of the offending. Unlike in Ollis, Wilson and Aguirre, submissions were made to the sentencing judge with respect to the weight to be attributed to the victim impact statement.
	
	
	Price J (with the concurrence of R A Hulme J and myself) cited Berg, and concluded that excessive weight had been given to the victim impact statement. The judgment shows, from the citation from Berg, that this was because the victim impact statement, in the circumstances of that case, was insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt the extent of the harm alleged to have been caused to the victim.
	
	
	In Miller v R [2014] NSWCCA 34, the offender was convicted of a series of offences of dishonesty. Johnson J repeated some of the observations he had made in Porter, to the effect that, whether given by way of victim impact statement under s 28 or not, evidence of harm occasioned to a victim by an offence has always been relevant and admissible. He considered that it was open to the sentencing judge to receive material bearing upon the question of the emotional and financial impact of the offences on the victim. However, he added that the victim impact statement did not add a great deal to the sentencing judge’s observations of the victim. It was open to the sentencing judge to have regard to the evidence of the victim in the trial and therefore to take into account the substantial and understandable emotional and financial impact of the offences.
	
	
	Most recently, R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 concerned sexual offending against child victims. The sentencing judge, relying upon Slack, declined to find, on the basis of victim impact statements, that the harm done to the victims was substantial. Adamson J (as mentioned above) acknowledged that, in 2014, damage done to children who are victims of sexual assault and other sexual abuse by adults is well-known and can be assumed. She also noted that the victims’ statements were tendered without objection, that no argument was addressed to what weight ought to be attributed to them, that their contents were closely in accordance with the expected consequences of conduct such as that the subject of the offences. This was another application of the reasoning process in Wilson.
	
	
	Adamson J considered that it was difficult to understand why a sentencing judge was not prepared to draw the inference that the victims suffered substantial emotional harm as a result of the offending.
	


What do these decisions establish?


	
	By s 28 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, victim impact statements are part of the landscape in the sentencing process. That is not in issue. What is here in issue is the extent to which a victim impact statement can be used to prove an aggravating factor of the kind specified in s 21A(2). Almost invariably the aggravating factor in question is that specified in s 21A(2)(g). It is to be remembered that such aggravating factors must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In some of the cases considered above, considerable weight was attached to the manner in which the sentencing process was conducted. Where no objection was taken to the victim impact statement, no question raised as to the weight to be attributed to it, and no attempt made to limit its use, the case for its acceptance as evidence of substantial harm has been considered to be strengthened. (It is, perhaps, a little unfair to take into account that no objection to the admission of the statement was taken, given that such statements are admissible by statute, but that does not preclude argument as to the weight to be attributed to them.)
	
	
	Further, where the statement tends to be confirmatory of other evidence (either in a trial, or in the sentencing proceedings) or where it attests to harm of the kind that might be expected of the offence in question, there is little difficulty with acceptance of its contents.
	
	
	Difficulties can arise, for example, where:
	



	
	the facts to which the victim impact statement attests are in question; or
	
	
	the credibility of the victim is in question; or
	
	
	the harm which the statement asserts goes well beyond that which might ordinarily be expected of that particular offence; or
	
	
	the content of the victim impact statement is the only evidence of harm.
	


RP is an example of the third of these.


	
	In these cases, considerable caution must be exercised before the victim impact statement can be used to establish an aggravating factor to the requisite standard.
	
	
	That brings me back to the facts of this case. It may be accepted that the offences committed against Mr Cats were of the kind that could have caused, and might be expected to have caused, substantial harm, both physical and emotional. But “substantial” is a relative term. To what extent was the harm caused to Mr Cats “substantial”? If, as is at the heart of the Crown contention, it is asserted that the harm caused to Mr Cats was greater than might have been expected as a consequence of his being shot at three times from close quarters, then that had to be established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Other evidence suggested that, while Mr Cats undoubtedly suffered physical injury, he fortunately made a significant recovery. Further, his credibility was, on the assessment of the sentencing judge, subject to considerable doubt. That doubt must attend his assertion of financial loss and ongoing disability.
	
	
	In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, the victim impact statement could not be used to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the injury, loss and damage caused by the offences was more substantial than could ordinarily be expected of such offences. That does not mean that substantial injury, loss and damage were not proved - substantial physical injury was proved by evidence in the trial. As mentioned above, physical injury is not an element of the shooting offences. Robison DCJ expressly took into account the evidence of physical injury (see [30] above). The victim impact statement could not be used to extend the assessment of the degree of emotional harm, or other loss and damage (including financial loss) beyond that that could ordinarily be expected in the circumstances of the offences, or that which was proved by other evidence. The Crown has not established error in a failure to take into account loss and damage, including financial loss and damage, extending beyond what is encompassed in offences of the kind of which the respondent was convicted.
	


Section 21A(2)(i): the offences were committed without regard for public safety


	
	The shooting offences were committed in a public place, in the vicinity of a TAFE college, in daylight. I would therefore accept that they were indeed committed without regard for public safety. The question that arises in respect of the Crown’s proposition (vii) is not whether the offences were aggravated by that circumstance, but whether Robison DCJ failed to take it into account.
	
	
	In that part of the Remarks on Sentence (and before the failure of the recording equipment), in which his Honour was considering aggravating and mitigating circumstances, he made express reference to the fact that the shooting offences were committed in a public place, near a TAFE college, a car park, a public road and a bus stop. He observed that it could be expected that members of the public would use the area. He added, however, that there was no reliable evidence that there was in fact any member of the public in the immediate vicinity, and no direct evidence that any member of the public was in fact put at risk. It is clear, in my view, that in saying this he had in mind s 21A(2)(i).
	
	
	Although the aggravating factor stated in s 21A(2)(i) was established, these remarks show that it was properly assessed and taken into account to an appropriate degree.
	


The statutory maximum penalties


	
	In proposition (iii) the Crown drew attention to the maximum sentences provided for the offences, and the standard non-parole period provided in relation to one of the firearms possession offences, and argued that the “discrepancies” between those sentences and the sentences actually imposed suggests that inadequate attention was given to the statutory maxima.
	
	
	In relation to the firearms possession offences the statutory maxima were imprisonment, respectively, for 14 years (standard non-parole period 3 years), and 10 years. The sentences imposed were imprisonment, respectively, for 2 years and 11 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, and for a fixed term of 1 year, 1 month and 15 days. These sentences include a reduction of 10 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the respondent’s pleas of guilty. It is not clear that his Honour made any express findings about the objective gravity of those offences. To the extent that he may have done so, it appears to have been in that part of the sentencing remarks that are affected by the failure of the sound recording. In one passage he is recorded as saying:
	


“When it comes to the firearm offences certainly there is no evidence [that they were loaded] but they were certainly found.” (square brackets in original, perhaps suggesting subsequent insertion)


	
	There is (on the material before this Court) no evidence of the circumstances in which the firearms were stored, nor for how long or for what purpose the respondent had them in his possession. It is not possible for this Court to make any greater assessment of the objective gravity of those offences. That being so, it is not possible for this Court to hold that inadequate attention was paid to the statutory maxima or the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The shooting offences attract a statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Robison DCJ recorded this. In respect of each, the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months. There is no clear finding by the sentencing judge as to the level of objective gravity of these offences. So far as I can see, the Crown simply asks this Court to infer, from the gap between the statutory maxima and the sentences imposed, that due regard was not paid to the former. I am not prepared to draw that inference. It is frequently the case that, in practice, the upper range of sentences actually imposed for particular offences is somewhat less than the maximum prescribed. That is, in part, because, as is well established, the maximum sentence is reserved for the most serious offences of the relevant kind.
	
	
	Nothing was put before this Court by the Crown to suggest that the sentences imposed lie outside the range of sentences ordinarily imposed in cases of its kind. The range actually imposed is of use to sentencing judges, and to this Court, as representing “the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts” and as “a yardstick against which to examine a proposed [in the case of sentencing judges (or imposed)] sentence”: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520. This Court was not referred to any cases that might stand as a useful precedent. I am not, in these circumstances, prepared to find that the sentences of 8 years were imposed without due regard to the statutory maxima.
	
	
	The final question raised by the appeal is the degree of accumulation. That question encompasses the question of the totality of the offending. Questions of accumulation or concurrence are, like the weight to be given to particular sentencing considerations, within the province of the sentencing judge. However, just as an excessive level of accumulation may produce a sentence that is manifestly excessive, so also may an inadequate level of accumulation produce a sentence that is manifestly inadequate. The salient feature is the totality of the offending. The question is whether the totality of the offending is appropriately represented in the totality of the sentences.
	
	
	This comes back to the question identified in Bugmy: was the overall sentence of imprisonment for 8 years and 7 months below the range of sentences that could justly be imposed for the offences consistently with sentencing standards? The same question must separately be asked of the overall non-parole period.
	
	
	As mentioned above, the Court was not given any information about “sentencing standards” with respect to offences of the kind in question. Counsel for the respondent put before the Court some statistical material provided by the Judicial Commission of NSW. That material is, as always, of limited value, since it does not provide information about the particular offences concerned, or the particular offenders. So far as it gives any information, it does not support the proposition that the overall sentence imposed on the respondent was below the range legitimately available.
	
	
	The same applies to the overall non-parole period.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would dismiss the Crown appeal.
	
	
	Before doing so, however, I repeat what I said in R v DH; R v AH [2014] NSWCCA 326. The High Court has made it plain that Crown appeals are to be brought for the purpose of establishing principle, and has distinguished that from (mere) “correction of error”: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.
	
	
	In this case, as in DH; AH, no principle sought to be established was identified. It is not sufficient, in my opinion, to hypothesise that a sentence about which complaint is made might (or must) have come about as a result of the attribution of excessive weight to one consideration, or the attribution of inadequate weight to another. The Crown must identify error of one of the kinds mentioned in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 and must, further, identify some sentencing principle that arises. That has not here been done.
	
	
	I propose, therefore, that the Crown appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with Simpson J.

		13 February 2015",2015-02-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2703923,State of New South Wales v Veeran [2015] NSWSC 75,"JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: The State of New South Wales (“the State”) has applied for an extended supervision order for a period of five years in respect of Mr Davendran Veeran pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), (“the Act”).
	
	
	The State commenced proceedings by the filing of a summons in this Court on 10 September 2014. A preliminary hearing was held by Hidden J on 8 October 2014. His Honour appointed Dr Andrew Ellis, psychiatrist, and Ms Jenny Howell, psychologist, to conduct examinations of Mr Veeran and furnish reports. His Honour reserved his decision as to the making of an interim supervision order. On 19 November 2014 his Honour gave judgment and made an order pursuant to s 10A of the Act that Mr Veeran be subject to an interim supervision order. Such order has been continued by other judges of the court until now.
	
	
	Mr Veeran does not consent but he does not contest the making of an order. The dispute in the matter is confined to the length of the order and to whether one of the conditions proposed by the State should be included. Notwithstanding the concession, it is necessary for me to be satisfied that all of the statutory pre-conditions for the making of an order are established.
	
	
	A number of affidavits and a substantial volume of documentary evidence was read and tendered without objection and none of the deponents and authors were required for cross-examination.
	


Criminal history


	
	Mr Veeran was born in Fiji in 1964 and is of Fijian-Indian background. He came to Australia in 1990. His mother, two siblings and some extended family members live in Sydney. His skill with the English language is limited. His employment history is varied, including working as a panel beater, welder and forklift driver, but he has also been unemployed for various periods.
	
	
	In 1998 Mr Veeran committed an offence of attempting to have sexual intercourse without consent with a 66 year old woman. The victim was the mother of his neighbour. He entered her home without her consent after having consumed a large amount of alcohol (he later told a parole officer that he had consumed half a bottle of scotch and five litres of wine). He shouted at her, grabbed her hair and dragged her through the property. He endeavoured to force her legs apart but she resisted, screamed and pleaded with him. He licked her in the groin area and then pointed to his own genitals and demanded that she lick him. He persisted in attempting to force open her legs. The victim managed to escape and raise the alarm with neighbours.
	
	
	Mr Veeran was arrested and charged the same day. Ultimately he entered a plea of guilty and on 25 May 2000 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. He was released on parole on 6 December 2002. The sentencing judge observed that the offence involved “a vicious, violent and unprovoked course of conduct perpetrated on an innocent victim of advanced years who was begging him, repeatedly begging him to stop”. The judge also noted a history of problematic abuse of alcohol since Mr Veeran came to Australia.
	
	
	Mr Veeran lodged an appeal against the severity of the sentence (not the conviction) but later abandoned it.
	
	
	Mr Veeran was referred to the CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Therapy Program) Outreach (CORE) Lower Intensity Program while serving his sentence in 2001. He attended 3 out of 40 sessions. He withdrew from the program with the explanation that it “has nothing to offer me”.
	
	
	The index offence was committed between 1 November 2004 and 28 January 2005. Mr Veeran had been in a de-facto relationship with the victim’s mother from about July 2004. In October 2004 the Department of Community Services was contacted and informed that Mr Veeran had been sexually molesting the child. The child was aged 13 and had a serious intellectual disability in the moderate to severe range. Sometime in January 2005 Mr Veeran told the mother that he was in a sexual relationship with the child. In February 2005 the mother questioned the child as to whether she had had a period that month. The child responded in the negative and it was subsequently ascertained that she was about six weeks pregnant. The Department of Community Services were informed and the pregnancy was terminated on 2 February 2005. DNA analysis confirmed that Mr Veeran was responsible.
	
	
	On 21 November 2006 Mr Veeran was arrested and charged and, when interviewed, denied having a sexual relationship with the child. However, on the first day of his trial he pleaded guilty to an offence of having sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the child had a serious intellectual disability. The facts relating to the offence for sentencing purposes were agreed. Mr Veeran was sentenced on 30 May 2008 to imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of six years dating from the day of his arrest.
	
	
	In sentencing Mr Veeran in 2008, English DCJ noted the content of a psychologist’s report and said that she was unable to find that he was remorseful or contrite. She found that he lacked insight into his offending behaviour and the impact upon his victim. She was unable to find that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. Such prospects would only be enhanced by participation in an appropriate sex offenders program, pitched at a level that can be understood by him.
	
	
	Mr Veeran became eligible for release on parole in November 2012. However parole was refused on the basis that he had not participated in CUBIT. He remained in custody until the expiration of the total term on 20 November 2014.
	
	
	Prior to his recent release from custody, Mr Veeran had spent only one significant period of time in the community under supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and that was in 2002 and 2003 whilst on parole in relation to his first sexual offence. It had been recommended by the sentencing judge in 2000 that he undergo intensive therapy and rehabilitation to address his alcohol abuse and anger management. On parole he was said to have complied with the directions he was given which comprised four attendances for individual counselling and weekly AA meetings.
	
	
	Other matters on Mr Veeran’s criminal history include a high-range drink driving offence in 1996 for which he was fined and disqualified. He was acquitted after trial in respect of a matter of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm in 2004. Charges of sexual intercourse without consent, kidnapping and assault occasioning actual bodily harm were dismissed but at the same time he was placed on a good behaviour bond for contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (ADVO) in 2006. Further charges of contravening an ADVO and damaging property were dismissed but he was convicted of assault four months later. He was placed on a good behaviour bond for the latter with conditions that included one relating to drug and alcohol rehabilitation. He went into custody when charged with the index offence two months later.
	
	
	I was invited by counsel for the State to take into account the sexual intercourse without consent and related charges that were dismissed in 2006. They were withdrawn rather than being dismissed after a contested hearing. While these matters, being matters that have not resulted in a finding of guilt or a conviction, are not relevant to Mr Veeran’s criminal history pursuant to s 9(3)(h) of the Act, they may be taken into account under ss 9(3)(a) and 9(3)(i) as held by Davies J in State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 976 at [28]-[39].
	


Expert assessments of risk of re-offending

Ms Julie Bates


	
	A Risk Management Report was prepared by Ms Julie Bates, a unit leader of an extended supervision order team, dated 24 July 2014. It refers to an assessment undertaken by Ms Laura O’Neill (see below) of Mr Veeran being within a medium to high risk category for re-offending. This assessment identified a number of areas of concern and they were:
	


●   alcohol abuse

●   non-compliance with supervision

●   personal relationships (domestic violence)

●   mental health stability

●   non-compliance with medication

●   stress/anxiety

●   lack of constructive and positive social activities


	
	The risk management plan proposed by Ms Bates addresses issues of reporting obligations, electronic monitoring and schedules, accommodation, education/employment, non-association generally, child protection register, alcohol and other drugs, access to weapons and medical intervention and treatment obligations. It was Ms Bates’ view that the risk management strategies as outlined in relation to those various topics would be adequate to address Mr Veeran’s risk in the community. She indicated that those strategies would be subject to ongoing review with a view to reducing the intensity of monitoring subject to Mr Veeran’s compliance.
	
	
	One of the conditions discussed by Ms Bates is the subject of dispute, that is, whether there should be a condition requiring Mr Veeran to wear electronic monitoring equipment. Ms Bates’ assessment was that electronic monitoring in conjunction with the requirement that Mr Veeran provide a schedule of proposed movements in advance would be critical tools in his supervision and management. Electronic monitoring can be used to restrict movement at particular times of the day or night. For example, it can identify breach of a curfew condition. It can also detect entry into any area contrary to the conditions of a supervision order. This, it is said, will enable a greater capacity to monitor compliance outside of face to face interaction and will compliment other risk management strategies which are applicable to Mr Veeran’s individualised risk management plan.
	
	
	I note the evidence in the affidavit of Sunil Nambiar, affirmed 7 January 2015, which describes the nature of the electronic monitoring equipment now used, which is much less intrusive and cumbersome than the equipment that was previously available. At the hearing, Mr Veeran willingly showed me the device he wears on his ankle and it certainly appears to be smaller and probably lighter.
	


Ms Laura O’Neill


	
	Ms Laura O’Neill is a psychologist employed by Corrective Services NSW and has been so since July 2008. In that time she has worked primarily in relation to serious violent and sex offenders. She prepared a psychological risk assessment report in respect of Mr Veeran dated 2 July 2014, for the purpose of assessing his risk of re-offending. She determined that he presented a moderate to high risk of sexual re-offending relative to other adult male sex offenders.
	
	
	Ms O’Neill reported that Mr Veeran had refused to engage in any therapeutic intervention whilst in custody in relation to his sexual offending. It was her opinion that his poor literacy would not prevent him from participating in such programs. She also reported that he minimised his offending behaviour and had limited insight into his offending and future risk. She said his lack of understanding and insight about the factors that contributed to his offending is of concern as he may not have sufficient skills to avoid and/or manage risky situations on his return to the community.
	
	
	In relation to the question of managing Mr Veeran’s risk of re-offending Ms O’Neill gave evidence in an affidavit affirmed 25 September 2014 as follows:
	


“Mr Veeran’s offending pathways in the past have involved his exposure to life stressors which he then appears to ruminate on and have difficulty coping with. In the absence of positive social supports, he sought out the company of inappropriate peers, vulnerable women or children. He appears to have sexualised the behaviour of the victims, possibly engaging in cognitive distortions that justify his offending behaviour such as an entitlement to sex. In regards to his prior offence, it appears that Mr Veeran experienced or perceived rejection and dismissal from the victim, leading to further angry rumination. It is clear in his prior offence that alcohol may have disinhibited his behaviour; however, the role of alcohol in the commission of the index offence is unclear.

However, as Mr Veeran has demonstrated only limited insight into the other potential factors which have triggered his reoffending in the past, it is considered that therapeutic intervention would provide Mr Veeran with the skills to ascertain whether there are factors in his life which increase his risk. Given his limited insight into the various precipitants of his offending to date, such a determination may provide a greater understanding of the best risk management strategies for him to avoid any re-offence in the future.

It is only through a lengthy period of treatment, followed by close monitoring and supervision, where Mr Veeran’s movements, habits, attitudes and so on, are recorded, can effective risk management strategies [be] formulated to address his specific needs. In my view, he would be incapable of developing these strategies without intensive therapeutic intervention.”


	
	Ms O’Neill said that an offender’s acknowledgement of risk and the identification of relevant risk factors can be a protective factor in reducing the risk of re-offending as it allows the individual to reduce the likely occurrence of risk factors in the future. Of concern is that Mr Veeran denied the 1998 offence and he blamed the 2004 offence on the 13 year old victim, stating that she initiated the sexual contact and refused to accept his initial rebuff. He acknowledged that having sexual intercourse with a 13 year old was against the law, although he minimised his behaviour by stating that the victim’s mother had told him that she was 16 years old and that she “acted like a woman”. He also claimed that he was unaware that she had a disability (in fact a severe intellectual disability) until after the offences. In addition he justified the behaviour by claiming that the 13 year old victim was also having sex with 30 to 40 other men. It is something of an understatement for Ms O’Neill to then state that Mr Veeran’s account of the 2004 offence “demonstrated a limited acceptance of responsibility for his behaviour”.
	
	
	Ms O’Neill’s report includes a detailed discussion of “dynamic risk factors”. They are grouped under the headings, “problems in intimate and non-intimate relationships”; “cognitions and attitudes that justify or support sexual offending”; “problems with general self-regulation”; and “superficial engagement with supervision”. Under the second of those headings Ms O’Neill wrote:
	


“The presence of cognitions justifying sex with children and with women who are inferior to him may indicate that Mr Veeran is at immediate risk of offending.”


	
	Ms O’Neill acknowledged that Mr Veeran’s history did not suggest that he would sexually act out on every occasion the risk factors identified are present. She noted that, given his long history of intimacy deficits and poor coping, it could be surmised that he had been exposed to numerous high risk situations where he did not commit a sexual offence. However she continued by saying:
	


“The future risk is chronic in nature in that over time as he was exposed to these risk factors without intervention or interruption, there would be fewer impediments to a sexual offence and eventually he would re-offend.”


	
	Ms O’Neill was also of the view that any future offending by Mr Veeran is likely to be “relatively opportunistic”. It was her opinion that in the event that Mr Veeran became the subject of an extended supervision order, it is likely that he would benefit from intensive supervision and case management. Ms O’Neill discusses the potential conditions of an order and I note that she includes reference to a condition relating to electronic monitoring.
	


Ms Jenny Howell


	
	Ms Jenny Howell, one of the Court-appointed experts, interviewed Mr Veeran on 24 October 2014.
	
	
	Mr Veeran accepted that he had consumed alcohol prior to the sexual offences in 1998 and 2004/5 but asserted that he was not drunk. He had been a regular user of alcohol but completed the Getting Smart program in 2000 or 2001 and attended AA meetings for about two and half years after his first release from custody. His intentions in relation to alcohol consumption in the future are not clear. Ms Howell noted his acknowledgment that it was a factor in relation to both offences and regarded it as an established criminogenic risk for him.
	
	
	Medication currently prescribed for Mr Veeran was identified by Ms Howell as used in the treatment of depression. Mr Veeran related this condition to “long standing issues and his current circumstances”.
	
	
	In the context of saying he had no interest in taking anti-libidinal medication, Mr Veeran asserted that he did not have problems managing his sexual behaviour. He said that he would not engage in sexualised behaviours around women or children in the community and that custody had been a deterrent to re-offending.
	
	
	Mr Veeran did not accept responsibility for either of the sexual offences in his history. Ms Howell reported that “he did not identify that his behaviour was wrong, or potentially caused harm to the identified victims and said that he feels ‘vulnerable’ to future malicious allegations”. She continued:
	


“Mr Veeran did not express genuine and appropriate regret and remorse for the harm to the victims and their families. He demonstrated very little understanding of issues related to consent and sexual boundaries and he did not acknowledge that his offending behaviour was unacceptable. He denied ever having acted inappropriately or engaging in sexually harmful behaviours with a child.”


	
	With the aid of a number of predictive tools, Ms Howell assessed Mr Veeran as having a moderate to high risk for future sexual offending relative to other men who sexually offend. This was supported by clinical assessment. It was her opinion that “he does pose a risk of committing a further serious sexual offence as defined by the Act”.
	
	
	Mr Veeran proposed a risk management plan to Ms Howell that was based on his refraining from entering into any sexual relationship in the future. He said that his time in custody has served as a deterrent to future offending. In her discussion of possible treatment options, Ms Howell stated, “Mr Veeran’s sexual offending risk is chronic; he has not participated in sex offender specific treatment when offered and has no realistic risk management plan”.
	
	
	It was Ms Howell’s assessment that Mr Veeran’s risk of committing a serious sex offence can be managed in the community “if the recommendation[s] of the Risk Management Plan are adhered to”. This is a reference to the plan set out in the Risk Management Report by Ms Bates to which I have earlier referred. Ms Howell considered the issues addressed by the plan were “adequate to address Mr Veeran’s risk in the community” and that “the conditions of supervision sought by the State are appropriate”. She did not mention it specifically, but I take this to include support for the proposal that there be electronic monitoring.
	
	
	As to the duration of an order, it was Ms Howell’s opinion that it should not be less than three years. She explained that “this would allow time for Mr Veeran to complete treatment through the Community Maintenance Program facilitated by Forensic Psychology Services and assess his level of community reintegration”.
	


Dr Andrew Ellis


	
	Dr Andrew Ellis, psychiatrist and the other of the Court appointed experts, reviewed a body of documentary material and interviewed Mr Veeran on 2 November 2014. I note the following matters from his report.
	
	
	The account Mr Veeran gave about his current situation included that “his thoughts revolve around the reasons why he came to prison, largely the sense of injustice he feels at his situation”. (I reiterate that Mr Veeran pleaded guilty and there was no appeal.)
	
	
	Mr Veeran gave an account of his sexual offending that conflicted with what Dr Ellis read in the documents with which he had been provided: “[h]e categorically denied engaging in behaviour described in untested allegations”. In relation to the 1998 offence concerning the 66 year old victim, he maintained that he was innocent and it was only because of “legal events” that he pleaded guilty. In relation to the index offence concerning the 13 year old victim, he claimed that he only had sex with her on one occasion and that he had been prevailed upon by her to do so. What he told Dr Ellis about each incident was broadly consistent with what he had told Ms Howell, although I note that he also at times claimed to Ms Howell that he had been in a relationship with the older of the two victims.
	
	
	Dr Ellis reported that Mr Veeran “states that he will refuse to engage in any rehabilitative programmes, particularly the CUBIT program if he stays in prison. He says he will refuse to engage in any kind of psychological treatment when in the community.”
	
	
	Dr Ellis made the diagnosis of “Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol), currently in remission in a controlled environment”.
	
	
	The report considers a variety of risk factors in relation to Mr Veeran committing a further serious sexual offence. It concludes under that topic:
	


“In considering actuarial, structured professional and clinical parameters in the absence of any treatment or supervision, Mr Veeran would fall into a group of persons with a risk for serious sexual offending that is statistically moderately high in frequency with serious consequence, and greater than a theoretical average offender. Specific treatment and supervision would likely reduce this risk.”


	
	Dr Ellis considered that “the usual provisions of an ESO [extended supervision order] are considered appropriate to manage the risks presented in this case. Specific monitoring and treatment for alcohol use is recommended to be reinforced.”
	
	
	As to the term of an extended supervision order, Dr Ellis opined:
	


“From a psychiatric perspective a period of five years is considered reasonable in order to establish stable function in the community, monitor the chronic nature of the current risk profile and refine the appraisal of risk. His comorbid psychiatric conditions of personality and substance use impact upon likely treatment and supervision response. It is most likely that a period of 24 months will be required to secure stable independent accommodation, maintain a stable mental state and regular meaningful activity both occupational and social in the community, given the restrictions on persons subject to extended supervision orders. A further 36 months of regular review would be necessary to reevaluate risk in light of inconsistent history, poor engagement and adjustment to community settings. This period is estimated based on his current mental state, potential for paraphilia, personality dysfunction and current attitudes to supervision that will be unlikely to change in the short term. At this point a more informed appraisal of future risk in progress could be made.

His psychiatric disorders are chronic and likely to persist beyond any period of supervision, but may be better internally controlled at that point.”

Whether there should be an extended supervision order


	
	Having reviewed all of the material I am satisfied that Mr Veeran is a ""sex offender"" within the meaning of that term in s 4 of the Act: he is over the age of 18 and he has been sentenced to imprisonment following his conviction for a “serious sex offence”, namely aggravated sexual intercourse with person aged 10 or above but under 14, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which is punishable by imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	I am satisfied, that Mr Veeran is also a ""high risk sex offender"" within the meaning of that term in s 5B and that there is a high degree of probability that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a “serious sex offence” (as defined in s 5(1)) if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Having regard to the support for the making of an extended supervision order by the experts, I propose to accede to the application. It remains to determine the following issues.
	


Duration of the order


	
	The State seeks an order for the maximum period of five years. Mr Johnston, counsel for Mr Veeran, argued that it should be for less, perhaps three years.
	
	
	A relevant matter in determining the duration of an order is to recognise that it constitutes a substantial fetter on a person’s liberty. However, it is also necessary to have regard to the objects of the Act set out in s 3. The primary object is to “ensure the safety and protection of the community” whilst another object is to encourage the subject to undertake rehabilitation.
	
	
	Mr Hammond, counsel for the State, drew attention to the evidence that Mr Veeran was an untreated sex offender with an assessed risk of re-offending in the moderate to high range. His denial of responsibility for his offences and lack of insight into risk factors relevant to the possibility of re-offending are enduring.
	
	
	Mr Hammond acknowledged the possibility of the State seeking, in effect, an extension of the period of supervision but submitted that this was not a reason to refrain from making an order for the five year period sought if such a period was considered by the Court to be appropriate.
	
	
	Mr Hammond invited acceptance of the opinion of Dr Ellis that five years was appropriate. He noted that Mr Veeran’s condition is chronic and likely to continue beyond even a five year period of supervision. Further, it was submitted that even though the conditions proposed by the State are quite onerous, there is a built-in facility for them to be relaxed over time, subject to Mr Veeran’s progress and compliance.
	
	
	Mr Johnston argued that Mr Veeran’s risk has been assessed as moderate to high, not high; his criminal history is serious but not as serious as others; and that he has been compliant with the interim supervision order. He referred to two other cases in which extended supervision orders have been made for three years and submitted that such a period, adequate in Ms Howell’s opinion, could be the subject of extension by further application by the State if it was considered necessary.
	
	
	Mr Johnston also highlighted the difficulty of making predictions about how Mr Veeran might respond and progress; he might present an unacceptable risk of re-offending now and in the near future but it is difficult to say whether that would remain the case for the next five years. There were positive signs in terms of Mr Veeran’s response to the interim supervision order in that there is no suggestion of any failure to comply with its very strict conditions; he is progressing in seeking employment; and he has commenced to engage in counselling with Forensic Psychology Services by having recently attended one appointment and with another scheduled in the near future.
	
	
	It was also submitted that a period of five years provides less incentive for both Mr Veeran and his supervisors to proceed with the process of rehabilitation; a shorter period would provide more focus upon achieving as much as can be done in a more efficient and timely fashion.
	
	
	I have had regard to all the submissions that were made. I accept as Mr Johnson submitted that making predictions about what may or may not occur in years to come is difficult. What weighs heavily in my mind is Mr Veeran’s entrenched attitude of denial of responsibility for his offending behaviour and demonstrated resistance to treatment for what he sees as a non-existent problem. I accept that the past offences have been committed against victims who were known to him and in a domestic rather than public setting. However, that does not provide any guarantee that his risk of further offending is confined to such an environment. The differential in the ages of his victims tends to indicate that his offending as been opportunistic and indiscriminate.
	
	
	I note that the Commissioner of Corrective Services is required by s 13 to provide the Attorney General with annual reports so an assessment may be made about whether an application should be made to vary or revoke an order. Such an application may be made by either the State or a defendant. This in itself could provide an incentive for Mr Veeran to comply and progress with a view to receiving an assessment that there is no longer a continued need for supervision. However, for the reasons outlined in the preceding paragraph, I propose to order that the period of supervision be for five years.
	


Whether there should be an electronic monitoring condition


	
	Mr Johnston argued that a requirement that Mr Veeran wear an electronic monitoring device was burdensome and the cause of discomfort. His client is concerned about its negative impact on his ability to obtain employment and upon his mental health condition. It was also submitted that electronic monitoring would provide no protection against further offending, given the nature of the past offending in domestic settings.
	
	
	I have already expressed my view about the latter of those submissions. In short, I do not accept it.
	
	
	I do accept that wearing a monitoring device is intrusive, probably uncomfortable, and perhaps regarded by Mr Veeran as punitive. However, it is only intended to be something required in the early period of the supervision order and may be discontinued once there is confidence in the ability of Mr Veeran to comply with his obligations. I accept the evidence of Ms Bates that there is significant utility in having this monitoring capability available for such time as it is considered necessary.
	
	
	I decline to exclude an electronic monitoring condition from the order.

2703925,R v A (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 79,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE – REVISED)


	
	The trial of the accused is currently in its third week. I have been informed that the Crown case is likely to close today. One of the remaining witnesses to be called by the Crown is the officer in charge of the case, Detective Olivaires, through whom the Crown will seek to lead evidence which is not in dispute.
	
	
	However, the Crown has also sought to tender paragraphs [59] to [67] of a statement of JT dated 29 August 2012. Leaving aside issues of form, those paragraphs constitute evidence of previous instances of alleged neglect on the part of the accused towards the deceased. The admissibility of such evidence has been the subject of a previous ruling in which I concluded that subject to it being led in an admissible form, it was admissible as context evidence: R v A (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 76.
	
	
	In support of the application the Crown tendered a statement of Detective Olivaires dated 16 February 2015 which set out, in general terms, the efforts which have been made to serve a subpoena on the witness in the period leading up to the trial. I am satisfied, having read that statement, that the police have made their best efforts to locate, and serve a subpoena on, the witness. Despite those efforts, they have been unable to do so.
	
	
	In addition to attempting to personally serve the subpoena on the witness, numerous phone calls have been made to try and contact her. Enquiries have also been made through her mother as to her whereabouts. Detective Olivaires has expressed the opinion in his statement that the witness is avoiding service. Whether or not that is the case, it is abundantly clear that she cannot be located despite the best efforts of police.
	
	
	In those circumstances the Crown seeks to tender the evidence by relying on s. 65(2)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”). Mr Terracini SC who appears for the accused does not take issue with the proposition that the witness is ""not available"" for the purposes of s. 65(1), nor does he take issue with the general proposition that the evidence, to the extent that it is expressed in an admissible form, falls within s. 65(2)(b). However, he submits that in all of the circumstances, the evidence ought be excluded, either under s. 135 or s. 137 of the Act. In advancing this submission, Mr Terracini relied upon two principal factors.
	
	
	Firstly, he relied upon the lateness of the notice given by the Crown. He pointed out that the name of this witness was on a list of witnesses whom the Crown indicated would be called to give evidence. I am informed by Mr Terracini, and there appears to be no dispute about it, that it was only today (or perhaps late yesterday afternoon) that the Crown indicated that he would not be in a position to call the witness and that he would be relying on the provisions of s. 65. That is not intended to be a criticism of the Crown. I am satisfied that he notified the defence of the position as soon as it became clear that he would not be able to call the witness. Nevertheless, the notice is very late and was given immediately before the closure of the Crown case.
	
	
	In relying upon the late notice, Mr Terracini acknowledged that I have the power under s. 67(4) to dispense with the requirement imposed by s. 67(1) to give reasonable notice. He nevertheless submitted that in all of the circumstances no reasonable notice had been given.
	
	
	The second matter upon which Mr Terracini relied was the inability to cross-examine the witness if the evidence were admitted. In advancing this submission Mr Terracini informed me from the bar table that he was in possession of instructions which went directly to the credit of the witness, including alleged previous drug dealing activities as well as other matters. There is no obviously formal evidence of such matters before the Court, but I accept unreservedly what has been put to me in that regard from the bar table by senior counsel. Mr Terracini submitted that the loss of the opportunity to cross examine the witness gave rise to prejudice which was cumulative upon that which arose from the late notice.
	
	
	I have already outlined the circumstances in which late notice was given. Whilst no criticism can be levelled personally at the Crown Prosecutor in that regard, it remains the case that notice was not given until immediately before the Crown case was to be closed. In my view, that is a relevant factor to be taken into account in determining whether the evidence ought be excluded. The Crown did not suggest otherwise.
	
	
	The inability of an accused to cross-examine a witness is also a relevant consideration for the purposes of ss. 135 and 137 of the Act (see R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 184; [2002] NSWCCA 509 at [126] per Wood CJ at CL) although the bare fact of that inability is not necessarily decisive of the issues which arise under those sections: Ordukaya v Hicks [2000] NSWCA 180; Bakerland Pty Limited v Coleridge [2002] NSWCA 30; R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494 esp. at [164] per Heydon JA (as he then was). In Suteski, having made reference (at [126]) to those authorities, Wood CJ at CL said at [127]:
	


“The decisions mentioned clearly depend upon their particular facts, that is, upon the character of the evidence involved and upon the nature or strength of the potential prejudice to the defendant. Each case in my view needs to be examined individually by reference to the well-understood balancing exercise.”


	
	Ultimately in Suteski his Honour concluded (at [129]) that on the facts of that case the complaint as to the existence of prejudice arising from the inability to cross-examine the witness in question was somewhat speculative. The relevant ground of appeal was dismissed.
	
	
	In the present circumstances, I am satisfied that the prejudice to the accused by being denied the opportunity to cross-examine the witness is not speculative at all. Senior counsel for the accused has articulated various matters which he wishes to pursue, on instructions, and which go to the credit of the witness. Coupled with the fact notice was only given by the Crown within the last 24 hours, the inability of the accused to cross-examine the witness gives rise to a degree of prejudice which, in my view, justifies the exclusion of the evidence.
	
	
	Section 135 of the Act confers a general discretion on the Court to exclude evidence if, amongst other things, its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to a party. Section 137 mandates the refusal to admit evidence adduced by the Crown if the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused relied upon both provisions. In my view, for the reasons that I have outlined, the probative value of the evidence in the present case is clearly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Accordingly, in those circumstances, I exclude the evidence pursuant to s. 137 of the Act.

		26 February 2015",2015-02-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703941,Regina v RM [2015] NSWCCA 4,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA and WILSON J: This is an appeal by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) from a decision of Charteris DCJ in the District Court on 23 July 2014 imposing sentences on the respondent for seven charges to which the respondent had pleaded guilty.
	
	
	Counts 1 and 3 were charges of aggravated indecent assault on a child under the age of ten years contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (""the Crimes Act""). Counts 2, 4 and 5 were charges of aggravated acts of indecency towards a child under the age of ten years contrary to s 61O(2) of the same Act. Count 6 was a charge of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years in breach of s 66A of the Crimes Act and Count 7 was a charge of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years, in breach of s 66B of the Act. The course of conduct charged escalated from fondling and masturbation to oral sex and then a single count of attempted penile/anal intercourse. The offences in counts 1 and 2 occurred in the course of the same incident (sequences 2 and 17); those in counts 3 and 4 also occurred during a single incident (sequences 3 and 19).
	
	
	The indecent assault and indecency offences (the subject of counts 3-4) and the sexual intercourse offence (count 6) were charged as representative offences, there having been regular occurrences of this type of conduct over the period from 2001-2003 (in the case of counts 3-4) and 2003-2004 (in the case of count 6).
	
	
	The two aggravated indecent assault offences carried a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment; the three aggravated acts of indecency carried a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment and the charges of sexual intercourse and attempted sexual intercourse each carried a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment.
	
	
	Each of the offences occurred when the respondent was a juvenile. They commenced when he was 13 years old. The last offence took place the day after his 17th birthday. Therefore there was no applicable standard non-parole period. The offences in counts 1-5 were committed when the complainant was aged about five or six years old. The more serious offences (counts 6 and 7) took place when the complainant was aged 7 (count 6) and 8 (count 7).
	
	
	The complainant did not disclose the sexual abuse until eight years after it had ceased. When he did, the respondent acknowledged that he had acted wrongly and had taken advantage of the complainant's trust. The respondent pleaded guilty to the charges at the earliest possible opportunity and demonstrated profound remorse for his conduct.
	
	
	His Honour convicted the respondent of each of the charges. For counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, his Honour ordered that the respondent be subject to a single bond for the maximum period of time that the court could impose, being five years. For counts 6 and 7, his Honour assessed the appropriate sentence to be a period of 19 and 13 months' imprisonment, respectively, with a nominated non-parole period of 25%. His Honour addressed the principle of totality and arrived at a two year sentence. His Honour indicated that the applicable non-parole period would have been six months.
	
	
	His Honour purported to exercise the power under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and imposed an aggregate sentence of two years' imprisonment. His Honour then suspended the operation of that sentence pursuant to s 12 of the same Act on the condition that the respondent enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for two years.
	
	
	The Crown contends that his Honour erred in a number of respects in the exercise of the sentencing discretion and maintains that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. For the reasons set out below, those contentions should be accepted.
	


Background


	
	The agreed facts in relation to each of the offences may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The respondent and the complainant lived next door to each other in a cul de sac. They frequently played in the street with other children from the neighbourhood. The age difference between the two boys was eight years and three months.
	
	
	The conduct the subject of the first two counts occurred when the complainant was about five or six years old. He and the respondent walked into the front yard of the complainant's home to an area where there was a fern shrubbery and they were shielded from view. The respondent pulled down his pants and underwear exposing his penis and requested the complainant to do the same. The complainant did so. The respondent then touched and fondled the complainant's penis for about 10 - 15 minutes. While masturbating the respondent's penis, the offender's penis was exposed to the complainant and the complainant observed it to be erect. The respondent told the complainant not to tell anyone and made the complainant promise not to do so.
	
	
	The offences the subject of counts 3 and 4 took place a couple of weeks to a month after the first two offences. The respondent said to the complainant ""let's do that thing again"" and led the complainant to the fern shrubbery; he asked the complainant to remove his pants; the complainant did so and the respondent removed his own pants. The respondent fondled the complainant's penis (count 3). The respondent's penis became erect while he was fondling the complainant's penis. He asked the complainant to masturbate him and explained how to do so (count 4). The complainant had never touched another person's penis. The respondent did not ejaculate. The respondent again masturbated for 10-15 minutes.
	
	
	It was agreed that the incidents described in offences 3 and 4 continued regularly thereafter, occurring once a month and sometimes as frequently as every two weeks, in the same secluded spot of the complainant's front garden.
	
	
	Offence 5 took place during the same period referred to in the first four charges but this time in the main bathroom of the complainant's house. The respondent removed his pants, stood over the toilet and masturbated himself until ejaculation. This was the first time that the complainant had seen the respondent ejaculate. Following that incident, the respondent regularly ejaculated in front of the complainant. He did this outside in the garden and would typically wipe the semen from himself and onto the shrubs. During this period, he also masturbated the complainant, asking the complainant to do the same to him. Although the complainant became physically aroused during this conduct, he did not ever ejaculate. Behaviour of this nature continued for about 1-1½ years after the incident the subject of count 5, until the incident charged by count 6 occurred.
	
	
	The offence the subject of count 6 took place after the complainant turned seven. The respondent was about 15-16 years old. The respondent asked the complainant to perform oral sex upon him. The incident occurred again in the hidden area of the fern shrubbery. The respondent removed his pants, asked the complainant to masturbate him and then explained that the complainant had to suck his penis. The respondent placed his penis in the complainant's mouth and the complainant did as he had been directed. The complainant complained about the ""weird"" taste but the respondent told him to keep going. At some stage the respondent removed his penis from the complainant's mouth and then masturbated until ejaculation. He told the complainant this was 'really good' for him.
	
	
	After this, the respondent regularly asked the complainant to perform oral sex upon him. The acts took place in the fern shrubbery. On most occasions, the respondent would ejaculate by masturbating himself. It was agreed that the complainant could not recall if the respondent ever ejaculated inside his mouth but that the complainant thought he may have done. (The respondent denied this and the sentencing judge did not find beyond reasonable doubt that such an event occurred.)
	
	
	The conduct in offence 7 was attempted sexual intercourse with the complainant. The sentencing judge was satisfied from all the evidence that this occurred when the respondent was 17 years of age. The complainant and the respondent were swimming in a pool at the complainant's house; the respondent swam up to the complainant and asked him to remove his swimming costume. The complainant did so. He then felt the erect penis of the respondent behind him as the respondent attempted to place his penis into the complainant's anus. The respondent continued to thrust towards the complainant's anus for some time but was unable to achieve penetration. After a while the respondent moved away from the complainant and then got out of the pool and went home. At the time, the complainant was eight or nine years of age.
	
	
	That was the last occasion the respondent sexually interfered with the complainant, the respondent voluntarily ceasing his offending conduct at that time. He went overseas for a period of time and then left the neighbourhood when his family later moved house.
	
	
	Due to his infancy, the complainant did not understand the nature of what was happening to him at the respondent's hands. However, by the time of the last offence he realised that the conduct was not normal. The complainant had started to say ""I don't want to"" when the respondent urged ""let's do that thing""; however, the respondent encouraged him to continue and the complainant felt pressured into doing so. During each of the offences the respondent told the complainant that he should not tell anyone. The complainant was not aware that what the respondent was doing was wrong but he felt uncomfortable about it.
	
	
	On 8 May 2013, more than eight years after the last offence, the complainant disclosed the sexual abuse to his mother. In the years leading up to that disclosure, the complainant had experienced symptoms of depression. The complainant had not told his mother before then about what had happened because he did not want to overburden her. The complainant had had an elder sister who was severely disabled and who had required 24 hour care from their mother. That sibling died in July 2009. The complainant's father had a breakdown early in 2010 and the complainant's parents separated and divorced in 2012. The stress of these events was such that the complainant was unwilling to add to them with a disclosure at an earlier time.
	
	
	The complainant made a statement to police on 17 May 2013 detailing the offences. The police subsequently applied for and were granted a surveillance device warrant authorising the use of listening devices to record telephone conversations between the respondent and the complainant. On 7 August 2013, the complainant made a telephone call to the respondent, which was recorded, in which the respondent acknowledged that what he had done was wrong and apologised to the complainant. There was a subsequent recorded telephone conversation on 8 August 2013 during which the respondent made further admissions in relation to the commission of the offences.
	
	
	Three days later, the respondent posted a message to the complainant on Facebook apologising ""with the utmost sincerity and from the bottom of my heart for the utterly foolish and wrong things I did"". In that message, he acknowledged that he had taken advantage of his friendship with the complainant and that it had been wrong to do so. (The sentencing judge accepted that the message, written at a time when the respondent was not aware of any investigation and could not have written it as mitigating conduct, showed profound remorse.)
	
	
	On 13 August 2013, the respondent was arrested. He agreed that he had admitted to the commission of offences during the telephone calls and agreed that the complainant had trusted him, which made it easier for him to undertake the behaviour in which he had engaged.
	
	
	The evidence before the sentencing judge revealed that, in the period between the commission of the offences and his arrest, the respondent had completed a degree course at university and, since 2011 had been employed as a graphic designer. The respondent denies any particular interest in minors and any interest in paedophilia. He describes himself as heterosexual and is in a de facto heterosexual relationship.
	


Sentence hearing


	
	A pre-sentence report dated 2 May 2014 was tendered at the sentencing hearing. That report assessed the respondent at a medium/high risk of re-offending based, it appears, on the pre-sentence psychological assessment tendered as an annexure to the pre-sentence report. That assessment, carried out without the benefit of an interview with the respondent, placed the respondent in a moderate to high risk category relative to other male sex offenders. The author of that assessment noted that it was not a comprehensive risk assessment.
	
	
	Character evidence was tendered, including from: the respondent's de facto partner (who was cross-examined by the Crown); a family friend; a business college lecturer; and the respondent's former housemate.
	
	
	The respondent gave evidence before the sentencing judge. His Honour broadly accepted that evidence although he formed the view that the respondent was engaging in some degree of re-construction when the respondent asserted in evidence that all the children that had played together from the cul de sac had acted as if they were the same age. His Honour accepted that there was a close camaraderie in the street amongst the children that lived there but was not satisfied that when the respondent was 13 years of age he considered the five year old complainant as his equal. His Honour noted that there was no suggestion that any threats were made to the complainant. The sentencing judge accepted that the evidence was overwhelmingly that the complainant was the victim of the offences and bore no responsibility for them. His Honour accepted without qualification the evidence given by the respondent's de facto partner.
	
	
	Also tendered before his Honour was a report from a clinical psychologist, Dr Champion, who said that while the nature of the offences potentially suggested some form of paraphilia (intense sexual arousal to atypical individuals) or sexual deviation, he did not elicit a report from the respondent suggesting the presence of attitudes and values or thought processes that would normally accompany such a form of deviance ([40]).
	
	
	Dr Champion had some difficulty with the respondent's stated explanation of ""sexual exploration"" having regard to the age of the offender towards the end of the offending behaviour and wondered whether the offender might have some underlying issues or personal doubts in relation to his sexuality which he could not then and cannot now readily articulate ([40]). Dr Champion was inclined to the view that the risk of offending was at the lower end of the scale but expressed concern at the age discrepancy between the respondent and the complainant. He recommended that the respondent undertake psychological counselling. Dr Champion also expressed the view that the respondent might struggle to cope with the prison system ([43]).
	
	
	There was also a treatment update report from a clinical psychologist (Ms Wyzenbeek) who concluded that the respondent did not present with a sexual interest in children, and reported that he had engaged well with psychological treatment and would shortly finish a programme of regular psychological sessions with her, and enter a maintenance phase, by way of transition.
	
	
	In relation to the pre-sentence report, the sentencing judge observed that the psychologist's report had noted there were very few people with similar offending circumstances to that of the respondent's conduct. His Honour was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the respondent had good prospects of not re-offending and excellent prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown does not cavil with that assessment.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied that regret and remorse had been clearly established by the respondent's actions both in relation to the telephone calls and the Facebook message, in which he clearly admitted engaging in improper behaviour and expressed his sorrow for it.
	
	
	His Honour was also satisfied that the respondent knew what he was doing was very wrong but was not satisfied that the respondent knew at his age that what he was doing in counts 1-5 amounted to criminal behaviour. The respondent said that his conduct was initially exploration but became gratification. His Honour accepted that the early offences may well have reflected the offender engaging in some early adolescent sexual discovery as he was going through puberty but was not satisfied that such a characterisation could be attached to the two major offences.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the respondent's rehabilitation to a law abiding citizen was impressive; that he is highly regarded by those who know him and is considered a person of great capacity.
	
	
	His Honour made it clear that he had found this a difficult sentencing exercise to carry out. His Honour accepted that the facts disclosed serious criminal conduct, noted the Crown's acknowledgement that the first five offences could have been dealt with summarily; and noted that each of charges 6 and 7 was a serious children's indictable offence within the meaning of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), and, even if charged at a time when the respondent was able to be prosecuted as a child, such offences were dealt with at law.
	
	
	As to the approach to the sentencing of offenders for conduct occurring when they were juveniles, his Honour had express regard to the principles set out in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571.
	
	
	His Honour took into account various matters: that the complainant had suffered an emotional reaction or psychological reaction to what had occurred to him (although not such as to go beyond the harm that might ordinarily be expected in such a case), that the course of the conduct was over a number of years, and that the complainant was genuinely a victim.
	
	
	His Honour noted the Crown's acceptance that the respondent was very remorseful and that his remorse was not influenced by a belief that it could mitigate his sentence; and that he was of good character. His Honour considered there was force to the respondent's submission that the voluntary cessation of the conduct was a positive factor in the determination of the index sentences. His Honour noted that the main effect of delay in the reporting of the offences was the exceptional rehabilitation of the respondent in that time.
	
	
	An important matter that his Honour took into account was the lack of violence, threats, aggression or intimidation during the commission of the offences.
	
	
	As to the objective seriousness of the offences, his Honour accepted that the first five matters could have been dealt with summarily and that they did not demand a period of imprisonment. His Honour accepted that there was an element of adolescent sexual discovery motivating the respondent (in the earlier counts) but said that this could not explain all of the offending behaviour in the sixth and seventh charges, which did require a period of imprisonment.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the criminality of the sixth charge (fellatio) was ""at the lower end of the range taking into account all of the circumstances"". His Honour accepted that it was not an isolated offence. His Honour had regard to the infancy of the complainant and the youth of the respondent and noted that the section covered a wide range of sexual misconduct with children. His Honour then said ""this offence finds itself in the lower end of the range"". (The respondent places some weight on the differing expressions used by the sentencing judge to emphasise that there was no finding that this offence was at the bottom of the range.)
	
	
	As to the seventh charge (attempted penile/anal intercourse), his Honour noted that it was an isolated incident but that it constituted serious criminal conduct. His Honour concluded that this offence fell in the lower end of the range of offences encompassed by the relevant section.
	
	
	His Honour had already indicated his intention to allow a 35% discount to reflect the very early guilty pleas and the exceptional remorse. Taking into account the mitigating matters, including the plea of guilty and the genuine remorse, his Honour concluded that sentences of 19 months' and 13 months' imprisonment, respectively, were appropriate for the sixth and seventh counts; and that a single five year good behaviour bond should be imposed for counts 1-5, having regard to the fact that those matters could have been dealt with in the Local Court, and the criminality in the circumstances of those offences.
	
	
	As to the non-parole period for the sixth and seventh charges, his Honour considered that the minimum period having regard to the rehabilitation to date should be 25% of the head sentence in relation to each of those periods of 19 months and 13 months.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that counts 6 and 7 were discrete events and that it was not appropriate to make sentences for them concurrent but, rather, some period of accumulation was required. His Honour assessed the total effective sentence as two years' imprisonment in relation to the sixth and seventh charges and, if required, would have fixed a non-parole period of six months.
	
	
	His Honour indicated a concern that to imprison the respondent could fracture the rehabilitation process. His Honour ultimately reached the view, not without doubt, that his discretion should be exercised to suspend the sentence. His Honour took into account that the respondent's behaviour since being confronted with his conduct had been all that he could do. His Honour was persuaded that the risk of fracturing rehabilitation at this stage was such that the community would be advantaged if the respondent were given the opportunity to serve his sentence in the community, its implementation being suspended. His Honour said that he had given great weight to the fact that the respondent had himself voluntarily brought his offending behaviour to an end.
	


Appeal grounds


	
	The Crown's amended notice of appeal raises ten grounds of appeal. Error on the part of the sentencing judge is conceded by the respondent as to grounds 1, 7 and 8 so that those can be dealt with briefly at the outset. The respondent nevertheless submits that if the Court intervenes in relation to grounds relating to procedural irregularity such intervention should be limited to the extent necessary to cure the irregularity, while preserving the effect of the sentence as intended by the sentencing judge.
	


Ground 1 - Discount for remorse


	
	His Honour, having earlier indicated that a 25% discount would be allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, concluded that there would be a discount of 35% for the pleas of guilty and remorse. The Crown contends that his Honour erred in this regard by identifying a combined discount of 35% for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and for the remorse of the respondent.
	
	
	The respondent accepts that the sentencing judge should not have identified a separate quantified discount for remorse.
	
	
	His Honour clearly erred in this regard; see for example R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [44]; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]; Oh v R [2010] NSWCCA 148 at [25]; Ngati v R [2013] NSWCCA 203 at [45].
	
	
	Ground 1 is therefore made good.
	


Ground 7 - No power to suspend aggregate sentence


	
	The Crown contends that his Honour erred by suspending the execution of the aggregate sentence that had been imposed on the charges in sequence 20 and sequence 16 (offences 6 and 7). Again, the respondent concedes error on the part of the sentencing judge in this regard.
	
	
	Section 12(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that, subject to s 99(1), which has no application in the present case, Part 4 of the Act does not apply to a sentence of imprisonment the subject of an order under s 12.
	
	
	Section 53A in Part 4 of the Act empowers the court to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. The respondent accepts that there was no power to make an order suspending the execution of the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	In R v Egan [2013] NSWCCA 196 (at [82]-[83]), this Court said:
	


""Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not apply when a sentence of imprisonment is suspended: s 12(3). Part 4 includes s 47, which provides for the commencement of sentences and a power to order that a sentence be served consecutively, or partly concurrently and partly consecutively, with some other sentence of imprisonment. It follows that there is no power to back-date or post-date a sentence of imprisonment that is suspended and, where there are multiple sentences to be imposed, there is no power to order any degree of accumulation.

It follows that where a court is sentencing for multiple offences, it is necessary to have regard to what the overall term of the sentence should be before considering whether an alternative to full-time imprisonment is appropriate: Burnard v R at [111].""


	
	Ground 7 is also made good.
	


Ground 8 - Single bond


	
	Ground 8 contends that his Honour erred by imposing a single bond as the sentence for all five offences in sequences 2, 17, 3, 19 and 5 (i.e., offences 1-5). It is submitted that a sentencing court is obliged, in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary (such as s 53A of the Act), to impose a discrete sentence or penalty for each offence.
	
	
	The respondents do not resist the proposition that his Honour erred in this regard.
	
	
	Whilst his Honour was clearly in error in pronouncing a single sentence in relation to five offences, it is not entirely clear that the sentence actually imposed was erroneous.
	
	
	The orders as entered on Justice Link, that being the ""appropriate computer record"" of the Court as contemplated by Rule 12 of Division 1 of Part 53 of the District Court Rules 1973, records the imposition of a separate bond for each of the individual offences. Despite that, and seemingly in accordance with his Honour's order as announced in court, the respondent entered only one s 9 bond, which referred to each of the five offences.
	
	
	The entry to the Court's computer record, whilst not in accordance with sentence as pronounced by his Honour, could have the practical effect - in the absence of an order signed by the sentencing judge - of correcting the error in the sentence formulated by the sentencing judge. Rule 12 relevantly provides:
	


Any judgment, order, sentence, direction or recommendation given or made by a Judge in any proceedings shall be entered on:

(a) […],

(b) the appropriate court file, or

(c) the appropriate computer record,

and that entry shall, when signed by the Judge or entered on the appropriate computer record, be the record of the judgment, order, sentence, direction or recommendation.


	
	Some useful discussion of the precedence of the official record of sentence may be found in Cullen v R [2014] NSWCCA 162 at [34]-[36].
	
	
	The question here is whether there is in fact a record of the sentence signed by the sentencing judge and, if so, whether it or the computer record is to be regarded as the final order of the court.
	
	
	The physical file of the Court contains a document which records the orders made by the sentencing judge. In that document, an order imposing a conditional bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 upon the respondent with respect to sequences 2, 3, 5, 17 and 19 is recorded. The document additionally notes his Honour's sentencing orders in relation to the remaining two offences, sequences 20 and 16. The document is signed by the sentencing judge, and bears the date 23 July 2014.
	
	
	Thus, the Court's record comprises both an entry on the ""appropriate court file"" and an entry on the ""appropriate computer record"", the terms of which differ.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is our view that the record of the Court is that signed by the sentencing judge, and the sentence pronounced is that which bears his Honour's signature, that being a single s 9 bond for offences 1 to 5.
	
	
	Rule 12 as it is drafted gives precedence to an order or sentence entered on the court file over an entry on the appropriate computer record.
	
	
	Even if the drafting of the rule is not significant to its construction, it is reasonable to conclude that the entry of the sentence outcome into Justice Link was not made until an entry recording the sentences imposed upon the respondent by the sentencing judge was manually recorded on the court's file, with the file thereafter conveyed to those court staff responsible for maintaining Justice Link. The file entry must have been signed by his Honour before the file left his Honour's chambers for that purpose.
	
	
	Accepting that the court's order is as pronounced by the sentencing judge, since a record of his order signed by him is extant, the Crown's complaint is made out. His Honour was clearly in error in purporting to impose a single sentence for a number of separate offences.
	
	
	Ground 8 is made good.
	


Grounds 2 and 3 - Indicative sentences


	
	By grounds 2 and 3, the Crown contends that his Honour erred by indicating sentences of 19 months and 13 months, respectively, on the charges which are the subject of counts 6 and 7 respectively (sexual intercourse and attempted sexual intercourse).
	
	
	In R v Egan, the Court noted (at [84]) that:
	


""Remarks made by a judge prior to the delivery of judgment on sentence are seldom of use in identifying appellable error. It is accepted that in the exchanges with counsel in the course of submissions a judge will often express preliminary or tentative views that might not ultimately reflect the judge's concluded view: see, for example, the cases cited in Ghobrial v R [2012] NSWCCA 221 at [56].""


	
	Nevertheless, the Crown places reliance on the recognition in R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17]; PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44]; and R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [33] that, while sentences indicated pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) are not themselves amenable to appeal, an erroneous approach in the indication of the sentence that would have been imposed for an offence may reveal error in the aggregate sentence ultimately reached.
	
	
	In JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297, the Court noted (at [40]) the following propositions:
	


""… The indicative sentences recorded in accordance with s 53A(2) are not themselves amenable to appeal, although they may be a guide to whether error is established in relation to the aggregate sentence: R v Brown, supra, at [17]; Nykolyn v R, supra, at [58]; PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44]; R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [32]-[33], [42]-[43]; Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen, supra, at [218], [227]; Subramaniam v R, supra, at [28]; SHR v R, supra, at [40]; R v Clarke, supra, at [56]; Martin v R [2014] NSWCCA 124 at [47]; JL v R [2014] NSWCCA 130 at [17]; Stoeski v R, supra, at [43]; CL v R [2014] NSWCCA 196 at [53]-[55].

Even if the indicative sentences are assessed as being excessive, that does not necessarily mean that the aggregate sentence is excessive: PD v R at [44],[82]; BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123 at [252]-[254].""


	
	The sentencing judge correctly noted that each of the count 6 and count 7 offences was a ""serious children's indictable offence"" as defined in s 3 of the Children's (Criminal Proceedings) Act and was required to be dealt with according to law; and that the matters set out in s 6 of that Act were required to be taken into account.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for those offences is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no applicable standard non-parole period because the respondent was under 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence (s 54D(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).
	
	
	The Crown contends that the finding by his Honour that these offences were ""in"" (or ""at"") the lower end of objective seriousness was erroneous having regard to: the nature of the acts involved, the relative ages of the respondent and the complainant, the age of the complainant by reference to the range included in the section (he being seven years at the time of these offences and the section applying to children under ten), and what the Crown contends was the high degree of sexual exploitation of the complainant.
	
	
	As to the last, it is submitted that the respondent knew his conduct was wrong and took (as he conceded) advantage of the complainant's trust and naivety sexually to violate a seven year old child who was unaware of the wrongful and aberrant nature of the misconduct. Reference is made by the Crown to R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [25]; MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93 at [22]; and R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172; (2008) 187 A Crim R 152 at [36]-[37].
	
	
	Having regard to his Honour's indication that a 35% discount should be allowed, the sentence prior to such a discount for count 6 was about two years and six months and for count 7 was about one year and eight months.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the youth and immaturity of the offender will be afforded less relative weight where the offender conducts himself or herself as an adult and commits an offence of significant gravity, having regard to the closeness of the offender to the age of maturity (citing KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [26]; IE v R [2008] NSWCCA 70; (2008) 183 A Crim R 150 at [15]-[16]; MJ v R; CPD v R [2010] NSWCCA 52 at [37]-[38]).
	
	
	It is submitted that since the count 6 and count 7 offences were adult offences committed when the respondent was 15 or 16 years of age and 17 years of age, respectively, the amelioration of the sentence in recognition of the respondent's youth should have been modest.
	
	
	In this regard, the Crown notes that the count 6 offence was not an isolated instance - the respondent had made the complainant perform oral sex on him regularly during the period April 2003 to April 2004 - and it represented a significant escalation of the sexual abuse by the respondent. While the Crown does not submit that this consideration leads to an increase in the indicative sentence for count 6, it does submit that the respondent was not to be sentenced with the lenience that might otherwise be permitted for an isolated instance of such offending.
	
	
	Pausing there, his Honour expressly noted that the count 6 offence was not an isolated offence and there is no indication that his Honour sentenced more leniently due to any misapprehension that this was an isolated offence.
	
	
	As to count 7, the Crown acknowledges that this was an attempt to effect intercourse rather than a completed intercourse offence; therefore questions as to what would have happened had it had been successful did not arise. The Crown did not on appeal seek to agitate an issue raised at [45] in its written submissions (to the effect that the respondent had ceased the offending conduct only after the complainant had begun to resist his requests to acquiesce in the offending conduct). It does, however, submit that, in the circumstances, any moderation of the indicated sentence for count 7 (on the basis that the respondent had voluntarily ceased offending) ought to have been less because of the frequency with which the respondent had sought to persuade the complainant to submit to such conduct between the commission of the sixth and seventh offences.
	
	
	In circumstances where there was no apparent leniency extended relative to offence 6 based on any misapprehension that it was an isolated offence, the suggestion that less weight should have been given to the voluntary cessation of the count 7 offence because of earlier attempts to persuade the complainant to participate in sexual activity is not persuasive. The count 7 offence was an isolated incident and his Honour did not err in giving weight to the fact that the respondent voluntarily desisted from pursuing the attempted anal intercourse when he was unable to achieve penetration. The amount of weight to be given for the voluntary cessation of the conduct at that time, as opposed to the voluntary cessation of all sexual misconduct after that incident, was a matter within his Honour's discretion. No error has been shown on that aspect of the sentencing.
	
	
	As to the adequacy of the indicated sentences for counts 6 and 7 more generally, that will be considered in the context of grounds 4 and 10 below.
	


Ground 4 - Manifestly inadequate aggregate sentences for counts 6 and 7


	
	In ground 4, the Crown contends that his Honour erred by imposing an aggregate sentence for the charges in sequence 20 (count 6) and sequence 16 (count 7) that is manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The Crown repeats the submissions made in relation to grounds 2 and 3 and places emphasis on the fact that offending conduct (which commenced with fondling and escalated to masturbation, oral sex and a single attempt at anal penetration, ceasing the day after the respondent's seventeenth birthday), involved the sexual abuse of a child who was five or six years old at its commencement. Emphasis is also placed on the regularity of the abuse (various forms of indecent assault on an approximately fortnightly to monthly basis between 2001 and 2003; oral sex between April 2003 and April 2004) before the attempted penile/anal intercourse when the complainant was eight or nine years old.
	
	
	It is submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate having regard to the totality of the criminality for which the respondent was to be sentenced in relation to all of the subject offences, the applicable maximum penalties, the appropriate discount of 25% for the pleas of guilty, the remorse and the other subjective circumstances of the respondent.
	
	
	The respondent submits that all the offences were far short of the upper range. He emphasises that none was accompanied by any physical force, threat or coercive pressure. His Honour accepted those propositions. Insofar as the respondent submits that there was not even the more subtle pressure such as friendship or favours possibly to be withheld if there were no compliance, it must also be remembered that the respondent acknowledged having taken advantage of the friendship with the complainant in order to commit the offences and that it was an agreed fact that the respondent had encouraged the complainant and the complainant felt pressured to accede to his requests.
	
	
	While the respondent accepts that he was considerably older than the relatively young complainant, he points out that he was nevertheless not an adult. It is submitted that, in the context of longstanding friendship and ""childish play"" between the two boys, the respondent would not have been perceived by the complainant as an adult. His Honour, however, did not accept the submission that the respondent would have seen the complainant as of equal age. It is further submitted that the ""epiphany"" that the respondent says led to the termination of the sexual conduct was 'the sudden apparition of mature consciousness, showing clearly that what preceded it belonged to the realm of childhood'. That proposition ignores the finding by his Honour that the respondent knew that his conduct was seriously wrong, knowledge the respondent acknowledged by his pleas of guilty. Were the situation otherwise, and the respondent did not know the serious nature of his wrongdoing, the defence provided by the doli incapax presumption was available to him.
	
	
	It is submitted by the respondent that to the extent that the complainant's age affects the position of the offences in the range of seriousness, then as the respondent's age increased the position of the offences in the range would reduce. It is further submitted that all the offences occurred in the context of a pattern of conduct established early ""to which no doubt both parties became to a degree habituated"". With respect, that simply highlights the manipulation and the degree of sexual exploitation of the young complainant by the respondent.
	
	
	The respondent argues that the transient nature and quick desistance in the act which was the subject of count 7 places that offence near the bottom of the range.
	
	
	Reliance is placed on R v Burns [2007] NSWCCA 228 (at [27]) where the voluntary cessation of criminal activity was recognised as a significant factor to be taken into account by a sentencing tribunal. It is also noted that the law places a very high value on the rehabilitation of offenders referring to R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [44].
	
	
	In summary, the respondent submits that there are an unusual number of strong mitigating factors in the case: the mentality and incomplete development of an adolescent child; the spontaneous and voluntary repudiation of the activity; the exemplary rehabilitation achieved; and the profound remorse and concern for the complainant upon being contacted many years later. Taking those matters into account, the respondent argues that it could not be said that any of the sentences imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	In JM v R, the Court noted (at [40]) that a principle focus of determination of a ground alleging manifest inadequacy or excess will be whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved (referring to R v Brown at [37]; R v Rae at [42]-[46], [62], [69]).
	
	
	The Crown put forward submissions on sentence before the sentencing judge, the substance of which it is not necessary to repeat here. Suffice it to note that the Crown submitted that each of the sexual intercourse offences fell around the midpoint of objective seriousness for that offence.
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the offending (involving offences on numerous separate occasions over a period of six years), required some degree of accumulation.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a suspended sentence was not appropriate in circumstances where the offences in counts 6 and 7 were committed when the offender was 15-17 years of age and considerations in relation to the offender's youth diminished in importance.
	
	
	For the reasons set out in relation to ground 10, this ground is made out.
	


Grounds 5-6 - Indicated non-parole periods


	
	Grounds 5 and 6 contend that his Honour erred by indicating the non-parole period for the indicated sentences in relation to counts 6 and 7. His Honour said in each case there would be a non-parole period of 25%.
	
	
	It is accepted, and his Honour noted, that since the respondent was under the age of 18 years at the time of the offences there was no applicable standard non-parole period for those sentences (s 54D(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).
	
	
	The Crown points out that there was no statutory or other requirement that non-parole periods be identified as part of the indicated sentences (referring to s 54B(4A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) and that it was not necessary for a non-parole period to be identified as part of the sentences (s 44(2C) of that Act).
	
	
	In JM v R (at [39]) the Court noted that the non-parole periods need not be specified in relation to indicative sentences except if they relate to an offence for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed (ss 44(2C) and 54B(4)) (see also AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 31 at [9]).
	
	
	While it was not necessary for his Honour to indicate a non-parole period for the count 6 and 7 offences, there was no sentencing error demonstrated by his Honour having done so. These grounds of appeal are not made out.
	


Ground 9 - Manifest inadequacy of individual bonds for counts 1-5


	
	Ground 9 contends that by imposing a sentence equivalent to a 5 year bond in relation to each of the respective offences in counts 1-5, each was manifestly inadequate having regard to the criminality for which the respondent was to be sentenced, the applicable maximum sentences, and the appropriate discounts of 25% for the pleas of guilty and the subjective circumstances of the respondent including his age.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that none of the offences comprising counts 1-5 was a serious children's indictable offence and thus they would not have had to be dealt with according to law, if sentence had been imposed before the respondent turned 21 (s 28(1) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987), and if the respondent had not also faced two serious children's indictable offences as defined by the same Act (s 3).
	
	
	Before the sentencing judge, the Crown submitted that, given the age of the complainant and the fact that these were not isolated incidents, the first chronological act for sentence for aggravated indecent assault in which the respondent masturbated the complainant (it being representative of regular ongoing conduct which was of an identical nature) would fall above the midpoint of objective seriousness for that offence. As to the three other offences under s 61O(2) of the Crimes Act involving exposing his penis to the complainant, inciting the complainant to masturbate him, and masturbating to the point of ejaculation, it was again submitted that those offences fell above the midpoint of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The respondent maintained that these were in the nature of childish exploration of sexual matters, and that the offences fell towards if not at the lowest end of any notional range of objective gravity.
	
	
	That submission, and the sentencing judge's assessment of the gravity of the offences as falling in the low range of seriousness, overlooks the degree of exploitation inherent in these offences.
	
	
	The victim was a particularly vulnerable child. He was among the youngest, or the youngest, of the group of neighbourhood children who played together in the street. He was an isolated child, in that his parents were fully occupied in caring for a seriously disabled daughter. It is reasonable to infer that the victim was not as closely supervised as other children may have been, because of his parents' understandable distraction.
	
	
	That it was this child, vulnerable because of his family circumstances, who was removed from the relative safety of the public street to a secluded area of shrubbery to be sexually assaulted is significant, and heightens the gravity of these offences to some degree.
	
	
	The respondent's contention on appeal (accepted by the sentencing judge in relation to the earliest offences) that his conduct was no more than sexual exploration is contradicted by the deliberation with which the victim was taken by the respondent to a secluded area, away from both the view of others, and from the prospect of others either intervening to stop the assaults, or reporting the conduct. It is further contradicted by the significant age difference between the respondent and his victim - 8 years and 3 months - and by the respondent's repeated insistence to the child that he promise not to tell anyone about what the respondent was doing to him. The offences were not limited to a short period of time, consistent with exploratory behaviour, but continued on, frequently repeated, for a period of years.
	
	
	As noted, the respondent's pleas of guilty acknowledged that he was not able to rely upon the doli incapax presumption, and thus that he was aware that what he was doing to his victim was seriously wrong, and not merely naughty.
	
	
	The nature of the sexual acts were serious, in that they initially involved the exposure of a very young child to the touching of his genitals by the respondent in circumstances where the respondent exposed his own erect penis. The child was soon caused to participate in this sexual conduct, with the respondent instructing the child as to how to fondle the penis of the respondent. The conduct further escalated with the respondent masturbating and ejaculating in front of the child. (Subsequently the respondent involved the child in fellatio, with the final offence being one where the respondent attempted to thrust his penis into his victim's anus in the child's home swimming pool. The gravity of these later two offences is relevant to ground 10.)
	
	
	The repetitive nature of the assaults, the frequency of them, and their steadily escalating seriousness were all matters which should have led the sentencing judge to conclude that these were offences which were considerably more serious than offences which might fall at or towards the lowest end of any notional scale of objective gravity.
	
	
	The complainant was a particularly vulnerable child who was much younger than the respondent. The respondent introduced the child to sexual activity which increased in seriousness over time, habituated the child into a course of ongoing sexual activity, prevailed upon his victim not to tell anyone about the abuse, and relied upon his neighbourly relationship and greater age to ensure the boy's silence.
	
	
	The respondent's submission that the boys regarded each other as contemporaries was rejected by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Whilst it is correct that the earlier offences, being counts 1 to 5, were - if charged at or about the time of the offending conduct - offences amenable to the jurisdiction of the Children's Court, that is so only in a technical sense. The reality of the respondent's situation is that, even had he been charged prior to his 21st birthday, the fact that he faced additional charges which were serious children's indictable offences meant that the jurisdiction of the lower court was simply not available to him. Being dealt with at law was the only realistic outcome for the respondent.
	
	
	This was gravely serious criminal conduct which could not be adequately reflected by the sentence imposed by his Honour, a single s 9 bond, even absent the errors attendant upon the sentencing process that saw five offences penalised by one sentence.
	
	
	The Crown's complaint that the sentence imposed upon the respondent for the first five of the offences charged against him is manifestly inadequate is made out.
	


Ground 10 - Overall manifest inadequacy


	
	Ground 10 asserts overall manifest inadequacy of the sentence disposition.
	
	
	As is well recognised, a claim of manifest inadequacy requires the party advancing that complaint to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust in a sentencing environment where there is no single ""correct"" sentence, and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325 [6]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, (2010) 242 CLR 520 at 538 [59].
	
	
	The Crown relies upon the arguments it advanced in support of ground 9 in support of this ground. Ground 9 has been made out.
	
	
	His Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the offences reflected by counts 1 - 5 as towards the lower end of the range of objective gravity was in error, and failed to give sufficient weight to the degree of exploitation and manipulation involved in these offences.
	
	
	His Honour reached a similar conclusion as to the objective gravity of the s 66A and s 66B offences. That conclusion also failed to give adequate weight to the circumstances surrounding the commission of these offences, including that the respondent's crimes were committed at the child's home, by a trusted neighbour and playmate, and were inherently highly exploitative. Count 6, the s 66A offence, was not isolated and, in the circumstances of this crime, it represented a serious breach of the provision, an offence which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years' imprisonment.
	
	
	It is acknowledged that the sentencing task faced by his Honour was a particularly difficult one. The sentences imposed upon the respondent had to be capable of comprehending the significant criminality of the respondent's conduct, in circumstances where there had been a lengthy delay between the commission of the offences and the prosecution of them.
	
	
	Also because of the delay, the respondent had had the opportunity to pursue his education and career objectives, and to establish himself as a responsible and law abiding member of the community. It could readily be concluded that the respondent had substantially rehabilitated himself in the years that had passed between the commission of the offences and the date of sentencing.
	
	
	Although it could not be said that the respondent had spent those years anxiously fearing the ""knock on the door"" referred to in R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 - to the contrary he had lived a full life without thought of his earlier crimes - the delay had permitted the respondent to demonstrate a capacity for a law abiding lifestyle, and thus to present a strong subjective case to the sentencing court.
	
	
	Those were all features of the matter that his Honour had to take into account.
	
	
	His Honour also had to have regard to sentencing principles, including questions of general deterrence - ordinarily high for offences of child sexual assault, but of lesser relevance where the offender was a child at the time, and of totality.
	
	
	Here, although the respondent was a child when he committed these crimes, the requirement for the sentences to reflect the need for general deterrence was not thereby rendered entirely nugatory (R v Bus unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, Hunt CJ at CL, Grove J, Allen J, 3 November 1995). There had also to be regard to questions of accumulation and concurrency, with a need here for at least some degree of accumulation of the sentences imposed, subject to the principle of totality, to reflect the number of offences, their ongoing nature, and the distinct conduct charged. Questions of accumulation are not irrelevant where an aggregate sentence is imposed (R v Grover; Grover v R [2013] NSWCCA 149).
	
	
	His Honour was plainly concerned that the imposition of a custodial sentence might ""fracture"" the respondent's rehabilitation, and he seems to have sought to structure a sentence which would avoid that outcome.
	
	
	In taking that approach the sentencing judge wrongly allowed the respondent's undoubtedly strong subjective case to so dominate consideration of matters relevant to sentence, that it became determinative of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	As discussed in relation to ground 9, the sentencing judge concluded that the respondent's earlier crimes fell toward the lower end of the range of objective gravity. He reached the same conclusions as to the intercourse and attempt intercourse offences. His Honour referred to the offences more generally as ""serious criminal conduct"". It is difficult to reconcile that latter assessment with the sentences imposed by his Honour on the respondent.
	
	
	The decision to suspend the sentences pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 further reduced the capacity of the sentence to reflect the serious nature of the offending conduct.
	
	
	As was stated by Howie J in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [28]:
	


""… the appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment"" (references omitted).


	
	A suspended sentence necessarily reflects a significant degree of leniency. Whilst such a sentence is a species of custodial sentence, it cannot be ignored that it is served entirely in the community, and represents a much reduced impost on an individual's liberty than does a sentence which is not suspended.
	
	
	The many and, to a degree, antagonistic, purposes of sentencing must be borne firmly in mind. Whilst s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires a sentencing court to promote an offender's rehabilitation (s 3A(d)), and rehabilitation receives particular emphasis in the case of a child offender, that does not obviate the need for the sentence imposed to adequately punish an offender (s 3A(a)), to make the offender accountable for his or her actions (s 3A(e)) and, of particular relevance here, to denounce the offender's conduct (s 3A(f)) and to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and to the community (s 3A(g)).
	
	
	Whilst the suspension of the sentences imposed upon the respondent in relation to the s 66A and s 66B offences was one which could promote the respondent's rehabilitation, it could not serve the purposes of denunciation of the crimes or of recognising the great harm these crimes caused.
	
	
	Both the terms and the suspension of the sentences for the later two offences were inadequate to reflect the gravity of the crimes, and to comply with the broader purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	We have concluded that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were insufficient to mark the gravity of the offences. The sentences were plainly unjust.
	
	
	Ground 10 has been made out.
	


Residual discretion


	
	In Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, the High Court considered the residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal notwithstanding that the sentence appealed against is shown to be erroneously lenient and said (at [24]) that, where an appeal is allowed, the powers to vary the sentence and to impose such sentence as seems proper are engaged; those powers having to be read with the general provisions of the sentencing legislation which constrain and inform their exercise.
	
	
	The High Court noted at [36] that:
	


""A primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion is the purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D which, as observed earlier in these reasons, is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"". That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion"". [Footnotes omitted.]


	
	In the present case, the sentence was imposed on 23 July 2014. The respondent became aware by 10 August 2014 of the Crown appeal. He gave evidence orally at the appeal of the effect on him (and on his family) of the notification of the Crown's appeal. His Counsel nevertheless submitted that the effect of re-sentencing on the progress towards rehabilitation has not changed from the material that was before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The respondent gave oral evidence. He noted that the matter had been ongoing and said that he is having ongoing counselling sessions with a psychologist (now in the maintenance phase to which Ms Wyzenbeek had referred in her treatment update report). The respondent has current employment although his employer is not aware of the proceedings. It is the respondent's belief that he would have to leave his job if he receives a custodial sentence. The respondent lives with his girlfriend in a de facto marriage and he referred in his evidence to his sadness at the effect of the proceedings on his partner. The respondent has counselling once a month at a one hour session; and he sees his probation officer once a fortnight. He indicated that it has been a struggle to operate as a ""normal person"", with the Crown appeal constantly at the back of his mind.
	
	
	The respondent deposed that his reaction to the notice of appeal had been one of devastation. He had broken down and cried and had been inconsolable not simply for himself but for his family. He described his distress on learning of the Crown's appeal as ""gut wrenching"". He referred to it as ""a roller coaster and a gut-wrenching feeling"" when going to the Court. It was something that he could not put out of his mind. The respondent deposed that he believes that if the Court did impose a custodial sentence the ramifications for him and his family would be devastating. He said that the effect of the outstanding Crown appeal on him is something that he thinks about every few hours.
	
	
	While the Crown maintains that this is not a matter where it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its residual discretion not to intervene, consistent with its obligations to assist the Court the Crown noted a number of relevant factors might be taken into account in that regard. Senior Counsel for the Crown pointed to the impact on the respondent of the fact of the Crown appeal; the likelihood of an adverse effect upon the respondent's employment were he to be re-sentenced; the fact that the range of available sentencing options is relevantly confined; the possibility that imprisonment would fracture the respondent's rehabilitation; and that the respondent is on the evidence of an exemplary character.
	
	
	In the present case, there have been errors made in the suspension of aggregate sentences and in the imposition of a single good behaviour bond for the five less serious offences. The sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	That said, the sentencing exercise was a difficult one and the function to be served by the determination of a Crown appeal can be met by the articulation of the errors in sentencing and the manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	It is clear on the basis of the respondent's oral evidence before the Court that he has suffered significant anxiety and distress since receiving notification of the Crown's appeal in August 2014. Because the appeal was heard late in the year, just prior to the commencement of the Christmas - New Year vacation period, and a decision could not be reached prior to the end of term, the respondent has endured further anxiety as he waited to learn of his fate.
	
	
	Additionally, the rehabilitation that the respondent has achieved will inevitably be adversely affected if a custodial sentence is now imposed. His employment is likely to be lost to him, and his relationships with others potentially damaged. Those features of the matter, coupled with the issue of delay and the impact of it upon the respondent, justify the Court in declining to intervene to do other than correct the technical errors made by the sentencing judge, errors which cannot be permitted to stand.
	
	
	Although we have concluded that the sentences imposed by his Honour are manifestly inadequate, the Court's role in providing principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts can be met by these reasons.
	
	
	It is sufficient in all of the circumstances to correct what might be regarded as the more technical errors attaching to the sentences imposed, whilst maintaining the general intention of the sentencing judge to impose supervised bonds, together with suspended sentences for offences 6 and 7 of a total period of 2 years (comprised of sentences of 19 months and 13 months imprisonment respectively).
	
	
	It is noted that the sentencing judge intended to impose some level of accumulation when structuring the sentences for these last two offences, it being impossible for the sentence imposed in relation to one offence to wholly comprehend the criminality of the other offence (Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41, at [27]). His Honour intended there to be an overall effective sentence for those two offences of two years imprisonment. His adoption of an aggregate sentence which he purported to suspend defeated that intention.
	
	
	In re-sentencing the respondent to correct the procedural errors, we have given effect to his Honour's intended sentence, having regard to the time already served, a period of about six months. That has necessitated some adjustment of the periods of imprisonment announced by his Honour, so that the overall period of imprisonment, suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and having regard to the six months served to date, is that of two years.
	
	
	If sentencing the respondent at first instance, and taking into account his significant subjective case, an overall sentence involving imprisonment for something in the order of three years, and without the benefit of suspension, would have been appropriate.
	


Orders


	
	The orders that should be made are as follows.
	



	
	The Crown's appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by Charteris DCJ on 23 July 2014 are quashed and in lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced as follows:

	R A HULME J: This was an unusual case that presented a level of difficulty in exercising the sentencing discretion well beyond that encountered in the vast majority of cases. Indeed, on a number of occasions the learned judge, who has very lengthy experience with the criminal law, remarked that he found this to be so. Whether to suspend the execution of the sentences of imprisonment for the s 66A and s 66B offences he said was ""the most difficult decision in this case"".
	
	
	I agree with Ward JA and Wilson J about the respondent having presented a strong subjective case. Regrettably, I cannot agree that the judge allowed it to dominate consideration of other matters to the point where it became determinative of the sentences imposed. The sentencing remarks, read as a whole, demonstrate that his Honour gave most careful and anxious consideration to all relevant matters. In particular, he mentioned twice that he was mindful of the emotional and psychological impact the offences had upon the complainant.
	
	
	There are some aspects of the description of the objective seriousness of the offences in the joint judgment with which I am unable to agree. The complainant is described as ""particularly vulnerable"" because of his family circumstances. But the offences occurred in the context of him being a young child playing with children in the neighbourhood away from direct adult oversight. He was just as vulnerable in such circumstances as any other child the same age.
	
	
	The fact that the offences occurred in a ""secluded area"", away from the view of others who might intervene or report the conduct, does not render them more serious offences of the child sexual assault genre; it is difficult to envisage such offences occurring in ""the relative safety of [a] public street"".
	
	
	Matters such as this do not contradict the claim (which was accepted by the judge) that the offending had its genesis in sexual exploration. The respondent conceded in his evidence that it progressed to becoming a matter of gratification and he readily conceded he was aware that his conduct was wrong. On the appeal it was not submitted to the contrary and moreover, the Crown accepted that the respondent did not understand that his conduct was criminal.
	
	
	This was a case of repeated offending by one child against another with an age differential of about eight years. Once that is taken into account, as it was, it is in the nature of double counting to regard the objective seriousness of the offences as being aggravated by characterising them as ""highly exploitative"". The written submissions for the Crown included the expression ""high degree of sexual exploitation"" but senior counsel was careful to qualify this at the hearing of the appeal by contrasting the position against similar offences committed by an adult and inviting the Court to have full regard to the subjective circumstances of the respondent (i.e. his age).
	
	
	In my view, the imposition of good behaviour bonds for the three incidents involving indecent assaults and acts of indecency that occurred 11 years prior to sentence and when the complainant was aged 5 or 6 and the respondent 13 to 15 was open to the sentencing judge. If the respondent had been sentenced for such offences soon after they occurred, that is while he was still a child, I think it most unlikely that he would have been incarcerated. After many years of delay, rehabilitation, established good character, and a level of demonstrated remorse rarely encountered, I do not see that the outcome now ought to have been more severe.
	
	
	The offences contrary to s 66A and s 66B were clearly more serious examples of sexual offending against a young child. With great respect to the judge, I am doubtful about the correctness of his characterisation of the objective seriousness of these two offences as ""at"", or ""in"", the lower end of the range. However, whilst the objective seriousness of an offence is normally of central importance, there were other matters of significance amongst the congeries of factors to be taken into account in the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	I am of the view that in this case the general principle that in sentencing a juvenile offender there should be more emphasis upon rehabilitation than general deterrence and retribution is not diluted because the respondent had conducted himself in the way an adult might conduct himself: KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 576 at [25]. When viewed as a whole, it is open to regard the offending here as being markedly characterised by adolescent immaturity. And it is not the case that the offences were committed when the respondent was close to being aged 18: the first five occurred when he was aged 13-15; the next when he was aged 15-16; and the last the day after his 17th birthday.
	
	
	As is apparent from the sentencing remarks, the judge had regard to all relevant matters and considered the question of suspension most anxiously. Sentences of full-time imprisonment could well have been imposed and, subject to the period, would not necessarily have been regarded as excessive. However, having regard to all of the circumstances, I am not of the view that the suspended sentences of imprisonment that were imposed can be characterised as manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Save for the need to intervene in order to correct the technical errors of imposing a single good behaviour bond for multiple offences and in imposing an aggregate suspended sentence I would otherwise have favoured dismissal of the appeal.
	
	
	I agree with the proposed re-sentencing in relation to the first five offences but I take a different view, with respect, as to how the respondent should be re-sentenced to overcome the error in relation to the aggregate suspended sentence. Under their Honours' proposal, a correct application of the totality principle in the event of breach of the suspended sentence bonds would see the respondent being subject to a longer overall sentence than is intended.
	
	
	Sentences should be determined in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610; that is, individual sentences should first be determined before consideration is given to the question of totality. The majority judgment accepts, as I do, that the totality principle would require a measure of accumulation of the two sentences. However, in the context of suspended sentences, totality is something that only arises for consideration in the event there is a breach resulting in the suspension being revoked and the sentences activated.
	
	
	The respondent should be given credit for the 6 months he has been the subject of a suspended sentence good behaviour bond by deducting that amount from the individual sentences. That is, the sentence for the sixth offence should be one of 13 months and for the seventh offence it should be 7 months.

2703947,R v Hastings Fredrickson (No 1) [2015] NSWDC 114,"JUDGMENT


	
	The offender Hastings Fredrickson who was born in 1973 making him 41 years old, has pleaded guilty to three counts contrary to s 474.17 subs (1) of the Criminal Code (Commonwealth). They are that at 2.20am on 6 July 2010 and at 2.02pm on 8 July 2010 and at 12.55am on 26 July 2010, used a carriage service, namely a computer email system, in such a way that reasonable persons would regard that use as being menacing, harassing or offensive. The maximum penalty imposed by the Code is three years imprisonment in respect of each of those counts. It is accepted by both parties that the offender entered his plea of guilty at an early time and accordingly, subject to the strength of the Crown case, has facilitated the course of justice in that regard, that should be taken into account. Furthermore, it is accepted that he has spent no time in custody in relation to each of these matters.
	
	
	The agreed facts of the offences are as follows. In 2010 the offender was employed as a civilian contractor with Thales International, a defence company at HMAS Kuttabul at Garden Island in New South Wales. As part of his employment he was issued with a laptop computer and a company email account. At the same time, he was serving as a member of the Australian Army Reserve, holding the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2 and had been issued with an Australian Defence Force, Defence Restricted Network email account. At the time of the offences, the offender was part of a group of male persons that called themselves the Jedi Council. This was a social group with a rank structure, written orders and a disciplinary system. I interpolate to say that Mr Pappas who appeared for the offender contested that particular latter description, but in my view, not much turns upon it. This group contained at least ten serving members of the Australian Defence Force from the rank of Lance Corporal to Lieutenant Colonel who communicated predominantly via the email accounts which I have specified. The offender emailed a number of emails to the Jedi Council regarding his sexual exploits.
	
	
	On 7 May 2010, the offender was in the Virgin Australia Frequent Flyer lounge located at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne. He had been to Melbourne as part of his employment with his then employer. At the lounge the offender engaged in conversation and exchanged contact details with a female person who he later referred to by the code name “Melbourne Mistress/Melbourne Moll#5”. Over the coming days the offender and this person engaged in conversations via email and the telephone. Over coming months he travelled to Melbourne where he engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with that woman. She was one of the victims of these offences and I will turn to her victim impact statement shortly.
	
	
	During the course of the sexual relationship between himself and the Melbourne woman (I will refer to her as Ms M5, without I hope any disrespect to her,) the offender set up a camera and filmed their sexual acts. She did not know that the acts were being filmed and did not consent to the filming. The offender sent images taken from the filmed footage of the sexual activity to the members of the Jedi Council. Ms M5 did not know and did not consent to the images being emailed as stated. The emails also had references to other females. The facts, particularly pertinent to the first offence were that on 6 July 2010 at 2.20am, the offender sent an email to the members of the Jedi Council, a copy of that email is annexed. The email was entitled “the footage” with an attachment to the email entitled “The Wolf of Woolloomooloo sign off June 2010.doc”. The email was sent to four ADF email addresses and included discussion of the joy of re-watching the footage of a sexual activity with a female person that the offender had met at the Melbourne airport and the fact that he will no longer be able to email as frequently as his wife is about to give birth to their child. The email contained a discussion and description of the offender’s sexual exploits during the period 24 June 2010 until 1 July 2010. It contained a description of a threesome that the offender had with another female whose Christian name is given and a further female as well. The email also attached an image of the lady in Melbourne, the one I referred to as M5, naked together with 15 colour screen shots from a covertly recorded video of the offender engaging in sexual activity with her.
	
	
	The facts pertinent to the second offence were that on 8 July 2010 at 2.02pm the offender sent an email to the members of the Jedi Council, that email is also annexed to the facts. The email was titled “Interesting Menu” and attached two pictures of a senior female officer of the Australian Defence Force obtained from an Australian Defence Force recruiting video, available on the ADF website. The email detailed the offender’s desire to meet the relevant officer and to engage in sexual activity with her. The email also attached seven colour screenshots from a covertly recorded video of the offender engaging in sexual activity with Ms M5.
	
	
	Finally the facts pertinent to the third count are that on 26 July 2010 at 12.55am, the offender responded to an email to members of the Jedi Council. The email was titled “re Robbie’s latest exploits, photos only”. That email has also been annexed to the facts. The email discussed the sexual exploits of various members of the Jedi Council, it also attached seven photographs of colour screenshots from the covertly recorded video of the offender engaging in the sexual activity with Ms M5 and photos of two other women.
	
	
	On Friday 10 September 2010, the offender was subjected to an interview with Thales management and was immediately terminated from his employment. His security clearances were revoked and his laptop secured. In terms of his antecedents, the agreed facts are that he is 41 years of age and resides in Queanbeyan. He is not criminally recorded. He was arrested on 25 November 2013 and released on conditional bail. He has spent no time in custody and he declined to participate in a record of interview with the police.
	
	
	Mr Pappas who appeared for the offender relied upon a quantity of material, the most relevant being evidence given by the offender himself and also a psychological report and oral evidence by Dr Kenneth Byrne a psychologist from Canberra. Dr Byrne’s report is dated 14 November 2014 and in summary is as follows. He conferred with the offender on two occasions for a little under five hours. He concluded:
	


“This man suffered a severely disrupted childhood, the details of which are outlined in appendix 1. This has caused him to have a style that continually tries to make himself look better to others and particularly to make himself look more masculine. He is overconfident at times to the point of being grandiose.”


	
	Before I continue with a summary of Dr Byrne’s report, I should interpolate as follows. Both victims, whose names are suppressed, both composed and read to the court victim’s impact statements. I do not propose at length to go through those victim impact statements but those statements were provided to the court pursuant to the provisions of s 16AAA and following which provisions permit the court to take into account matters in a victim impact statement. The first statement of Ms M5 indicates that she was then 32 years of age, she speaks of the trauma she has experienced as a result of the disclosure of this material, she speaks of wishing to have a normal life and relationship but being devoid of trust of persons, given the breach of trust involved in this offence. She spoke about previously being a normal happy outgoing person but now is struggling in most aspects of her life. She spoke of suffering severe distress, being extremely upset, anxious, stressed and angry. Angry at what the offender did and angry at what has happened to her. She records the fact that she has had nightmares and loss of sleep, she has also had issues with her own security. She became self-critical and questioned her own self-worth. She remains most concerned over what her work colleagues will think if news of what happened reached them, she says she felt stupid because of what happened to her and has almost lost complete trust in men. I do that very much in summary without belittling the significant impact it has had on the first victim.
	
	
	The second victim is a young woman who has two daughters aged 6 and 8. She speaks of various psychological impacts including the need to see a psychologist and psychiatrist. I accept that at face value although I note of course that no medical material was placed before the court and I simply record that that is what she has said. She is undertaking tertiary studies, she again finds herself in a very similar situation both as to her mental wellbeing and her personal circumstances as the first victim. Most importantly she writes as follows and in my view this sums up the extremely serious effect this has had on both victims. She writes:
	


“Most importantly I am a woman. I am entitled to engage in sexual relations without fear that my conduct in the bedroom is shared to a large quantity of strangers and used as a way to demean and degrade me. As a woman, if you share your body with a person, you are putting trust in them that they will not do you harm and although I have not completely undergone any physical trauma as a result of the crime, I have suffered a tremendous amount of emotional trauma. Women are not objects for you to play around with, we are the bearers of your children, we deserve nothing less than respect, honour and value in the world”.


	
	In my view that eloquently sets out what these women have felt and what they have suffered. Their trust has been betrayed, what they thought was an affectionate and consensual private encounter, was made public to a group of Army officers and ultimately made public once these offences became known.
	
	
	In considering those victim impact statements I need to record the following matters which bear upon how they should be taken into account. Firstly, in accordance with New South Wales authority, and I am referring particularly to R v Previtera [1997] 94 A Crim R 76, Hunt J as his Honour then was, indicated that the consequences of the crime upon the victim directly injured by it, are always relevant to sentencing, the offender is part of the objective circumstances of the crime and in appropriate cases, to the aggravation of those offences. In considering the effects upon both victims, I note the following matters. Both victims were adults, both engaged in consensual sexual activity with the offender, neither of them knew or consented to being filmed or photographed and neither of them knew or consented to the dissemination of the photographs. The fact that the situation became public resulted from the material being located on the offender’s work computer. Indeed it was never intended, as I understand the facts, by the offender or the other members of the group, to widely publish that material outside the circle of that group. The significant effect on the victims resulted from the dissemination of that material in a public forum because a private dissemination to the group would, in the ordinary course of events, not have been known to the victims. Accordingly, the significant and prejudicial adverse effect of the offences came about not from the use of the carriage service but the coming to light of the offending. In this sense the impact to the victims came about as an indirect result of the conduct, not as a direct and intended one. In my view it is proper to note those matters in balancing the effects on the victims.
	
	
	Returning to Dr Byrne’s report, he also noted as follows:
	


“Besides a terribly damaged self-image, he the offender compensated for this, that is his over-confidence and grandiosity through 20 years of military service where by all accounts, he performed quite adequately. As a civilian without the badges of masculinity and the structure of the military, he resorted to hyper-sexualised behaviour in the context of an adolescent boys’ club in which he had a leadership role. In a psychological sense, membership in the club of this man served to bolster his self-image and defend against his very considerable anxiety.”

Dr Byrne continued:

“It is also significant that he attended two different mental health professionals before being confronted with his behaviour confirming a degree of internal distress that emerged when even the hyper sexualised behaviour and drug fuelled drug use failed to stem this anxiety.”


	
	I should say that it appears from his own evidence that the offender came into contact self-referred to both mental health professionals to which I will refer as the result of the birth of a son and questions as to his role as a father and indeed, it also appears that he did not specifically mention this offending to those psychologists. Dr Byrne’s report continues in relation to his personal circumstances and I will not go through those.
	
	
	The offender was born in Port Moresby, his parents were separated shortly after he was born, he has had no ongoing relationship with his biological father. His parents adopted two boys and subsequently his mother became pregnant with him. His mother returned to country New South Wales where she married a Mr Don Fredrickson who died in 2011, his mother is described as being mentally unstable having had several nervous breakdowns and periods of psychiatric hospitalisation. It appears that both his 46 year old brother and his 43 year old brother have had significant problems either with drug abuse or being a rebel respectively. The offender also disclosed some confidential material which I do not propose to make public in appendix 1 of the psychological report. It concerns his history and I will say no more except they are matters of a traumatic nature. With the exception of that material, the offender described mostly happy memories saying he got on well with his brothers. He excelled academically at school, left home at 16 to join the Army and ultimately he saw this as a way of furthering his interest in electronics and getting training. He was in the Australian Army from January 1990 to April 2009, there were only two disciplinary matters reported against him of no great significance. He was sent to Afghanistan but did not see combat there, however he did hear the noises of war being mortar fire and the like. He said he never felt in physical danger being there. The offender told Dr Byrne that he agreed with his wife he would leave the Army when his children were born.
	
	
	In May 2007 his son was born, he had at the time been accepted to join the Special Forces but declined to join that force ultimately due to his own circumstances. He then became an employee of Thales where he was working at the time of these offences. He was fired when these offences were discovered. He obtained further employment in October 2010 but with an organisation which also had large defence contracts and ultimately, he could not sustain employment with that group by reason of its defence contract associations and the withdrawal of his security clearance. Subsequent jobs consistent with his professional training, were offered to him from Telstra and the like but were ultimately withdrawn when these charges came to light.
	
	
	He has been unemployed for a considerable period of time. He has attempted to take a number of courses, successfully it appears, in areas of training quite unassociated with his present skills. He intends going into a new business with three colleagues, in a business maintaining residential flats.
	
	
	His account of these offences were as follows: On returning from Afghanistan he met a girl on a plane and commenced a sexual relationship. He said they shared recreational drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy and his last contact with her was in 2011. He said that after the news of his sexual behaviour appeared in the press she contacted him and asked him if he had filmed her. She went to the police and claimed she had been sexually abused, a claim which was dismissed. There was in fact no sexual abuse in that criminal sense. However it is undoubted that his conduct with her was both exploitative and demeaning. In August 2010 he was confronted by the Chief Security Officer of his employer regarding the objectionable material and was fired.
	
	
	In terms of his psychological health in particular, he gave Dr Byrne a significant history of his family, his brothers, his mother and their various psychological and other problems which I will not rehearse.
	
	
	In July 2008 he consulted a psychologist, Ms Bronwyn Tuffy, as he recently disclosed that the matters in appendix 1 to Dr Byrne’s and to his wife and he has had several consultations with Ms Tuffy which continued until June 2009.
	
	
	In May 2010 he consulted psychologist, Mr Patrick McGee, because “he was getting a bit out of control” so that he had to talk to somebody and he was asking himself how many women do I have to have? He saw Mr McGee about 12 to 13 times. He stopped because he had planned to move to Canberra. Again it appears that what precipitated the contact with Mr McGee was not conduct of this particular character involved in these charges, but his own perception about his promiscuity rather than as I say the matters which were the subject to these charges, filming and disseminating information about them.
	
	
	Dr Byrne notes that he is currently seeing a psychologist, Mr Buckmaster, through the Veteran Affairs Counselling Service. The offender said that he felt acutely unattractive as a child. He entered the army and he hit the gym to work on his physical appearance and to make himself more attractive.
	
	
	He met his wife when he was 19 and she was 23. They dated for about two years and they subsequently married about six years later in 2001. They now have two children. His son has a speech delay and has a psychological disorder which I do not consider necessary to disclose. His daughter is three and a half years old and doing well.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Byrne that his wife knows everything and she is obviously very angry with him. He then cast a much brighter description of their relationship which appears to be perhaps somewhat overstated. At the second interview the psychologist, Dr Byrne, learnt that the offender had actually given his wife “an extremely abbreviated version of the charges he faces. On inquiry he said this was because she would leave him if she knew the full story”.
	
	
	He described the offender’s presentation as being extremely preoccupied, pressured speech, difficulty in focussing his thinking, difficulty in listening and interrupting on a number of occasions, rambling, reflecting his preoccupation. He also made apparently extremely odd comments to Dr Byrne.
	
	
	Dr Byrne considered that he was clearly of above average intelligence and there was no indication of a psychotic disorder. He conducted the personality assessment inventory, a widely used test of personality that enjoyed strong validity and research support.
	
	
	Relevantly he found that on administering that test the offender’s response style made a finding which was impossible to interpret. The test was repeated and the results showed almost exactly the same response style, in short compass as Dr Byrne later said. What he said in that inventory test could not be relied upon in assessing his mental state at that stage, as not being candid or not being honest.
	
	
	Dr Byrne indicated that this is extremely unusual. It is strongly suggested that the offender was unwilling to reveal very much about his psychological difficulties. It is pertinent in my mind to have regard to the way he responded to that test in determining whether the other tests administered by Dr Byrne should be given any weight or any great weight.
	
	
	In that second interview Dr Byrne arranged for the offender to undertake the Rorschach Inkblot test, again another widely regarded psychological tool, as well as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Those tests which Dr Byrne considered of great importance and reliability. Dr Byrne said that the offender responded to both of these tests “in a co-operative and candid manner. The results are therefore considered valid and subject to interpretation”.
	
	
	By comparison, Dr Byrne did not explain the inconsistent modes of responses to the Personality Assessment Inventory. In other words no persuasive reasons were offered, why the latter tests should be accepted as valid given the uncooperative responses to the former test by the offender.
	
	
	In any event the net effect of all of those tests were as follows: That he is continually engaged in an effort to boost self-esteem and to strengthen others’ impression of his masculinity. This causes him to have a misplaced confidence in his own judgment. In situations where guidelines for behaviour are clear he is likely to be well-organised and respond well, particularly when there are opportunities to succeed and prove himself. Even then though, his behaviour will have an occasional impulsive appropriateness.
	
	
	However when there is less external structure his judgment particularly regarding people can be markedly poor. Dr Byrne considered that his self- esteem clearly disclosed he was damaged and that he attempted to compensate for this by being ultra-masculine.
	
	
	Dr Byrne also concluded that the finding suggested a poor attachment to both parents which led to “a weak, compromised sense of how to be a man and a pervasively negative view of women”. Looking at that particular conclusion it is difficult in my view to understand why a poor attachment to his parents has led to such an adverse view of women, the aspect of the offender’s conduct which in my view is a significant offensive part of what he did in these offences.
	
	
	I note that Dr Byrne examined the genesis of the Jedi Council, so called. The offender explained to him that when soldiers returned from overseas a big dinner would be organised to celebrate. He was a natural organiser and took charge. “We suggested we call ourselves the Jedi Council”. This was as I would apprehend it a somewhat puerile and unimaginative reference to the popular science fiction movie Star Wars.
	
	
	The soldiers spoke about having casual sex with girls and became, as the offender described it, having notches on the board. In particular he was asked about having anal sex with the women and he said as follows: “If you do it it’s like you’ve stolen her soul” and he agreed that it was like an extra notch of achievement. Again this attitude is highly troubling. In my opinion there is at least a discernible distinction between the triumph of multiple sexual successes. It is more difficult to comprehend that more than success was required, but was necessary to demean and “steal the soul of the conquests”.
	
	
	Dr Byrne does not explore this aspect of the offender’s conduct, nor proffer any view of the significance of this issue in a psychological sense.
	
	
	As for his thoughts about the victim the offender spontaneously said “It was a very bad thing to do, I have a daughter now, if I, someone did that to my daughter I’d be pissed off, I betrayed her confidence”. In my view this is somewhat typical of the various accounts of the offender’s remorse. His reference to his position as father and being pissed off has reference to a betrayal of confidence and omits any reference about the demeaning effect of his conduct and how he held up each of the victims to ridicule in the context of his army group.
	
	
	He was asked what he would say to these victims if he met them and he said “Here’s the axe, here are my balls, there’s the meat grinder”. Again it is my view difficult to treat this as a sincere declaration of remorse. In many respects it has the feel of a macho flippant response to the proposition of having caused significant hurt to the victims. He told Dr Byrne he had well and truly learnt his lesson. Dr Byrne reviewed his army records and it is interesting to note that some of the psychological records revealed him to be inappropriately dogmatic, speaking without consideration for his peers, overly confident, coming across as stilted and contrived and projected as extremely regimental, full of misplaced confidence and approaching tasks he was dealing with in an extremely unbalanced manner.
	
	
	Finally Dr Byrne reviewed the notes of Ms Bronwyn Tuffy and also of Mr McGee, the psychologist consulted in 2007, 2008 and 2010. In relation to his consultations with Dr McGee or Mr McGee, those consultations took place on or around the time that these offences occurred and it appears that any help he was receiving from Mr McGee was not sufficient to curtail committing these offences.
	
	
	In the final analysis Dr Byrne’s evidence was that he considered that the offender was suffering from a “personality disorder-other specified with narcissistic features as indicated in DSM-5”. In this regard I note that Dr Byrne does not set out what the criteria of that syndrome are, nor does he indicate what features in the offender’s history and psychological presentation conform with those criteria.
	
	
	In short it is difficult to understand the basis on which he arrived at his diagnosis and in that respect the expert opinion does not accord with the requirements as set out in the High Court in the case of Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21.
	
	
	Nevertheless I should say this that the prosecution is represented in the present proceedings by an experienced senior counsel. No issue was taken by him as to that particular diagnosis and whilst I have my own doubts about it I consider that it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that Dr Byrne’s diagnosis is operative and stands. Certainly there is much in Dr Byrne’s reports which appears to be borne out by material which is otherwise correct.
	
	
	Dr Byrne also gave evidence in the present proceedings. In terms of the issue of the offender expressing his remorse he in various ways said that the offender expressed his remorse as far as he could go. In my view that is not extremely convincing, notwithstanding the fact that he suffers from this personality disorder. In particular and perhaps one of the more puzzling aspects of Dr Byrne’s evidence was that he relied upon sketches drawn by this offender when asked to draw sketches of persons. The offender drew two stick figure sketches, one of which emphasised that the stick figure had shiny shoes.
	
	
	However Dr Byrne considered particular significant that the hand of one of the stick figures was not attached to the arm. He referred to it as bizarre. I am not aware of what bizarre means in psychological terms or for that matter what the comment was intended to convey, but it is evident in my view, looking at the drawings of a 41-year-old man when asked to draw a person could, no matter what lack of artistic capacity he had had drawn somewhat more sophisticated sketches than that produced by him. One is drawn to the conclusion that he made no serious attempt to comply with the request and furthermore that Dr Byrne’s attribution of significance to anything arising from those sketches is in my opinion somewhat misplaced. When discussing the offender’s remorse as genuine Dr Byrne stated that it was genuine as far as his personality allowed it to be. Again I find this less than convincing.
	
	
	Dr Byrne it should be said, appears to be a well-qualified psychologist, but given his unexplained diagnosis in terms of the Dasreef issues and a number of questionable conclusions, I myself have some reticence in completely accepting his conclusions. In particular it was my firm impression that in the manner he gave his evidence he saw his role as an advocate for the offender rather than a detached professional. For example on a number of occasions or at least one for certain, when asked about parts of his report by the offender’s counsel, Dr Byrne suggested that the question should refer to other parts before answering the question.
	
	
	Therefore I remain unconvinced about the genuineness of the offender’s expression of remorse and that lack of being convinced was indeed confirmed by his own evidence given in the witness box. The expression of remorse was delivered unemotionally without conviction. As I have said however the prosecutor, Mr Neill, Senior Counsel, a very experienced prosecutor, did not take objection to the diagnosis, nor argue against it and in those circumstances I am prepared to act on that basis.
	
	
	I consider, as I will indicate, that the offender in some respects lack frankness in his evidence and was deceptive and/or manipulative. There is reason to believe he was not frank with the psychologist, that he manipulated that situation or relationship and that he withheld information or provided incorrect information from time to time.
	
	
	The offender himself gave evidence and he gave an account of his personal circumstances which I will repeat. He said that he had read the victim impact statements and accepts full responsibility, was very remorseful, regrettable and it was a horrible thing to do. He spoke of seeing the psychologists. In particular he was asked about when or if he made full admissions to his employer or his supervisor when these offences came to light.
	
	
	His evidence is useful to consider because at transcript p 10 line 20 he was asked by Senior Counsel this question:
	


“In relation to circumstances of the offence it is accepted that when your employer raised the matter with you you told them basically what you’d done?

A. Full disclosure.”


	
	At transcript pp 11 and 12 that matter was pursued and it appears that the effect of the offender’s evidence was that he did not know how his employer became aware of the emails or the attachments. In my view the evidence of full disclosure and that particular evidence do not sit well together at all.
	
	
	Going then to the further evidence that he gave, he indicated when he was first arrested he went to the Queanbeyan Police Station, there was immediate interest in camera crews present, he was ultimately splashed, if I can put it colloquially, across the television and newspapers. He was terminated the day this matter came to light.
	
	
	He says that he has not been in full-time employment since about September 2013. He has been doing some fairly menial work. He also indicated that he was served with court documents from the County Court of Victoria in relation to proceedings commenced by one of the two victims and in that context offered an apology through his solicitor which became exhibit 1.
	
	
	He accepted or rather he stated that he was receiving psychological counselling at the time of these offences, but it is patently obvious that he did not tell the psychologist what he was doing in the context of these offences.
	
	
	As I say I am not convinced that he was totally genuine and/or frank about parts of the evidence he gave in sentencing proceedings. His expression of remorse was in my view not particularly convincing. Given that these offences occurred whilst he was seeking professional psychological help it appears he did not disclose these matters to the psychologist as well, nor did that intervention assist or convince him not pursuing these offences. In fact the offender’s evidence was that he merely told the psychologist that he had done “some things I’m ashamed of”.
	
	
	In order to determine what is an appropriate penalty one must have regard to the objective seriousness of the offending. Because there has been not much litigation, nor court analysis of the particular provision that matter is by no means easy.
	
	
	Section 474.17 of the Criminal Code provides that a person is guilty of an offence if that person uses the carriage service and the person does so in a way whether by the method of use or the content of a communication or both that reasonable persons would regard as being in all the circumstances menacing, harassing or offensive.
	
	
	Section 473.4 of the Code indicates that a matter is to be determined as offensive or not by asking whether reasonable persons would regard particular material or the particular use of a carriage service in all the circumstances relevantly, which include the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults, that being the operative part of the section. So one judges the offensive nature of the material by standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults.
	
	
	There were two cases which were brought to the Court’s attention which dealt with this particular section.
	
	
	The first is the High Court authority of Monis v R [2013] 87 ALRF 340, HCA 4. In that case the High Court was considering an offence under 471.12 which was using a postal service to send offensive material. That being shorthand for material that reasonable persons would regard as being in all the circumstances offensive. His Honour Justice French, the Chief Justice referred at paras 15 and 16 to two not quite analogous provisions in the United Kingdom which sought to elicit the purpose of legislation of this kind. In para 15 in the context of The Malicious Communications Act [1988] s 1(1) his Honour noted that that section made it an offence for a person to send any article which is in whole or in part of an indecent or grossly offensive nature. The Law Lords in the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Collins [2006] 1WLR 223, 4 All ER 602 Justice French noted para 16, determined that the object of such legislation was to prohibit the use of a service provided and funded by the public for the benefit of the public for the transmission of communications which contravene the basic standards of our society. Lord Brown in that judgment described the provision as intended to protect the integrity of the public communications system.
	
	
	Justice Hayne at paras 160 and 161 affirmed the Court of Criminal Appeal determination in Monis, that for an offence of offensive conduct within the relevant provision the conduct must be such as was calculated or likely to arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred. Presumably his Honour said, the reaction of the hypothetical, reasonable person intended by these descriptions must be a reaction that is clearly experienced and deeply felt. His Honour continued to elaborate on those matters by saying that for someone to be merely offensive as opposed to being significantly offensive was not sufficient to make out a breach of a particular section.
	
	
	I should note that Justices Crennin, Kiefel and Bell who comprised the majority in that case for reasons which are not relevant for present purposes also set out their view of what was required at paras 310 and 311. Basically the effect of it was that the term “offensive” had a quality at least as serious an effect upon a person as the other words being menacing, harassing, imply. The words menacing, harassing play a serious potential effect upon the addressee, one which causes apprehension if not fear for that person’s safety. Their Honours said that to be offensive a communication must be likely to have a serious effect upon the emotional wellbeing of an addressee. I note that their Honours were dealing with letters sent to the victims there in question, and the present case was not such correspondence.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account then the following conclusions are open and the ones that I will draw about these matters. Firstly s 474.17 appears to indicate a descending order of gravity and conduct, menacing, harassing and then offensive. As the authorities indicate the section requires that the offensive conduct must cause a significant reaction. Sending material of explicit sexual nature per se may be thought to be insufficient given the general availability of such material on the internet. The following factors in my opinion make these transmissions offensive within the terms of the provision and they are as follows. That there were three transmissions between 6 and 20 July, two of them in the early hours of the morning. They were not to the world at large but to members of the so called Jedi Council, that is to say to persons who either expected or at least consented to the receipt of such material. The emails were not and were not intended to be transmitted to the victims. The verbal content of the emails described various forms of sexual activity, contained imputations or direct statements that the women involved were of loose morality or dubious character, (the term “molls” and “sluts” were used) and open to promiscuous sexual activity. They were insulting, degrading and humiliating descriptions of women and not only expressing the triumph of a sexual contest but belittling the object of those conquests. As I said Dr Byrnes’ material does not in any significant terms deal with that latter aspect in my view adequately. The visual content of that which was sent attaches pictures of one of the victims involved in sexual activity with the offender taken without her knowledge and accompanied by tasteless and belittling captions and one of the complainants or victims is identified by a first or Christian name and there are sufficient contextual facts to permit her to recognise that the email concerned her if it came to her knowledge. It must be remembered as Mr Pappas in his written submissions clearly pointed out in my view correctly, that it is not the morally repugnant or reprehensible nature the dealings of the offender with the victims which the section punishes. In a moral sense the reaction to that matter by most reasonable persons would call for condign punishment. It is the use of the carriage service or its manner of use which is to be punished.
	
	
	I should note that the second authority which appears to be relevant is the sentence imposed by Acting Justice Nield as his Honour then was, in the ACT Supreme Court on 23 October 2013 in the case of R v Deblaquiere and McDonald. That was a case where two recruits and/or junior officers in Duntroon, broadcast a consensual sexual encounter between Mr McDonald to Mr Deblaquiere by Skype at the time it was happening in circumstances where the young female recruit who was engaged in the sexual activity had no knowledge or consented to that being done. There was a trial at which those young men were found guilty. Justice Nield considered that the transmission by Mr McDonald and the use by Mr Deblaquiere were above and about the middle range of objective seriousness, this is at para 32 and 33 of the judgment. He noted that there had been a real and substantial violation of that victim’s right to privacy, that the offenders had deliberately acted to abuse and degrade the victim and exposed her to humiliation and ridicule. In the event his Honour imposed a penalty of 300 hours community service on both those young men. I consider this is a more serious case than Deblaquiere, however I take a different view with the greatest respect to my senior colleague, that is Justice Nield’s characterisation. In that case those matters were in the mid or above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In my opinion the present case is more serious than that case which involved one incident, one victim and immature offenders aged 18 to 20 years of age. In those circumstances I consider the only appropriate punishment is one of imprisonment but I do not necessarily consider it follows that it should be full-time custody. I will turn to that issue shortly. Section 16A of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) requires the court have regard to a number of features in every case in determining an appropriate sentence. They are as follows. Firstly s 16A(1) requires the court to pass a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence and I aspire to do so. The Crown in its written submissions and orally submitted that general deterrence is a significant matter to be considered in the present circumstances, I agree with that proposition. In its written submissions reference was made to the dissemination of material by the internet particularly at paras 13 and 17. I consider that is not a correct characterisation of what occurred, this being a dissemination as it were in club, to members of the group and not to the world at large. Section 16A(2) requires the court to have regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence, I have done that already in dealing with the objective seriousness of the matter. I am obliged to have regard to the effect on the victims. I have at some length referred to that matter. In my view the effect is significant but it was neither intended nor was as a direct consequence albeit of the activity but was an indirect consequence of having been found out.
	
	
	The next matter is the degree to which the offender has shown contrition. True it is there is an early plea of guilty and for that that must be recognised but I have serious doubts as to the genuineness of his remorse.
	
	
	The next matter is the deterrent effect of any sentence upon the offender. The Crown argues that specific deterrence is a matter of high order. In my view given the effect of these proceedings on this 41 year old man I consider that it is reasonably unlikely that he will offend in this way. That is not to say that he necessarily has good intentions but I suspect that what has happened to him which has not been insignificant, has had a salutary effect on him.
	
	
	The next matter to be taken into account is the need for adequate punishment. In my view general deterrence is a significant matter for the reasons espoused by the Crown. It is clear that this was a betrayal of trust. It demeaned the women involved, it has affected them with ongoing effects and has done so in an exploitative manner. Again those who consider such crimes in the future should have regard to the real possibility of a prison term which I say I propose to impose but not a full-time prison term. I have had regard to the personal circumstances of the offender including matters on the Form 1, his present circumstances, the fact that he has no criminal history and I accept that he suffers from a personality disorder but have some doubt as to the extent to which that deprived him of any will to participate in these offences. I also note that there has been significant extra curial punishment. He has lost his job or jobs and the opportunity of work. He has been the subject of significant publicity, no doubt the offences warrant that but the court must take into account the fact that those are additional matters over and above other offenders who appear in these courts.
	
	
	Next I must have regard to the prospect of rehabilitation. It is true it appears that the offender is consulting a psychologist in Canberra which I have already noted. Much of that appears to be directed towards his own traumatic history and whether or not it has an effect upon any inclination he has to re-engage in this conduct is questionable. As I say for all those reasons I consider that in the present case there should be a custodial term but I also consider that given each of those matters that this offender should be considered for the imposition of an intensive correction order.
	
	
	Would you stand up please. Accordingly in respect of each of the offences I convict you and sentence you to a term of 15 months imprisonment. I direct that you be assessed for suitability for an intensive correction order and if so suitable I propose to make such orders.

The nature of these proceedings


	
	This is an assessment for damages for personal injury. Thee plaintiffs, a father and two of his daughters, bring proceedings for damages against the defendant for sexual assaults of the daughters. The defendant is the maternal grandfather of the children.
	
	
	The claim brought by Josephine (born 23 June 2003) particularises seven occasions of sexual assault between 13 October and 1 December 2010. Josephine’s injuries are particularised as severe nervous shock and depression, as well as loss of self-esteem. Her continuing disabilities are:
	



	
	Severe depression consequent upon being sexually assaulted on many occasions over a lengthy period of time by her grandfather;
	
	
	Loss of self esteem consequent upon being sexually assaulted by her grandfather;
	
	
	Inability to participate in normal sporting and leisure activities due to severe depression, associated loss of confidence and self esteem;
	
	
	Intrusive thoughts;
	
	
	Interference with sleep consequent upon frequent intrusive recollections of being sexually assaulted by her grandfather;
	
	
	Lack of confidence.
	



	
	The claim brought by Jenny (born 24 July 2001) particularises three occasions of sexual assault between 14 October and 1 November 2010. The same particulars of injuries and disabilities are pleaded.
	
	
	The claim by the children’s father is brought under s 4 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1944 (NSW) and is based upon the severe nervous shock, anxiety and associated sequelae he suffered following the discovery of the defendant’s sexual assault of his daughters. The following continuing disabilities are particularised:
	



	
	Severe nervous shock;
	
	
	Anxiety and associated sequelae;
	
	
	Depression;
	
	
	Inability to concentrate;
	
	
	Gross interference with sleep;
	
	
	Intrusive thoughts associated with the incident;
	
	
	Loss of confidence and capacity to go about normal everyday activities;
	
	
	Loss [of] enjoyment of life consequent upon the plaintiff’s disabilities;
	
	
	Living in a constant state of anxiety and pre-occupation of the impact of the sexual assaults upon his daughters.
	



	
	Claims for domestic assistance and loss of income, referred to in the Statement of Particulars, have not been pursued.
	
	
	The defendant was charged and arraigned on 17 November 2011, when he pleaded guilty to fifteen counts in full discharge of the indictment. On 21 June 2012 he was sentence to seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, being eligible to be released on parole on 24 May 2016. In the defence filed in these proceedings, he has admitted to the conduct but did not make any admissions in relation to damages.
	
	
	The plaintiffs seek general damages and (in the case of the two children) aggravated compensatory damages.
	
	
	Section 3B(1) Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) provides that the Act does not apply to intentional acts of sexual assault; damages are assessed according to common law principles (State of New South Wales v Doherty [2011] NSWCA 225). As the defendant has been convicted of criminal offences arising out of these assaults, the plaintiff has abandoned a claim for exemplary damages: Gray v Motor Accidents Commission (1998) 158 ALR 485.
	
	
	Mr Dupont gave evidence but was not cross-examined. The two minor plaintiffs did not give evidence. The defendant neither attended nor sought to give, or tender, any evidence. Apart from some helpful submissions in relation to the claims for aggravated and exemplary damages, and some corrections to out of pocket expenses, counsel for the defendant made no submissions as to quantum. As a result of the way in which these proceedings have been conducted and defended, it is not necessary for me to set out, other than in general terms, the factual background for the claims brought.
	


The circumstances leading to the disclosure of sexual assault


	
	Mr Dupont grew up in a normal, happy family. He excelled at sport. After completing the Higher School Certificate he ran a café in Manly. He married Irene, one of four siblings, and went to live on the property owned by her father at Singleton. Irene’s sister, Linda was married to Jeremy Lampion, the defendant’s son. Jeremy Lampion was Mr Dupont’s best friend as well as being Linda Lampion’s husband. Both families had seven children, and enjoyed a close and loving relationship with each other, as well as with other family members; at the time of sentencing, the defendant had a total of 22 grandchildren.
	
	
	The defendant and his wife held two properties; one was in the defendant’s sole name and the other in joint names. Most of the family members resided on the same large rural property upon which the male members of the family built the “Faith Walk Church”, at which the defendant was the chief pastor, assisted by his wife.
	
	
	There is little information about the defendant in the medical reports and evidence before me, not only because he has elected not to give evidence, but because Mr Dupont knows little about him. There is considerably more insight into the defendant’s history and conduct from the careful analysis of facts set out in the sentencing judge’s remarks, which are an annexure to the affidavit of Linda Lampion of 19 November 2014 (an exhibit in proceedings 2013/210388, but relied upon, at least in relation to this exhibit, by the plaintiffs in these proceedings). These remarks set out that the defendant, who was 63 at the time of sentencing, had been married for 43 of those 63 years. He, his wife and their four children lived for most of that time on an isolated country property where he ran a sheet metal working business.
	
	
	I note, in relation to this history, that Dr Chris Rikard-Bell (Exhibit B, p. 56 - 7) considers there was “probably sexual abuse throughout the family”, noting that the defendant was “very controlling and aggressive”, while his wife, Mrs Tina Lampion, was “very quiet and meek”. One of the defendant’s other children claimed to have been sexually abused by an uncle, but no charges were laid.
	
	
	Dr Rikard-Bell explains that the defendant was not only the minister of the family’s strict religion, but “the boss” at the workshop; “he was in total control”, Mr Dupont told Dr Rikard-Bell. The defendant and his wife were the only pastors of the church built on their property. The principal worshippers there were the defendant’s extended family living on the property, whose children (including the minor children in these proceedings) were all home schooled. As they lived a strictly religious lifestyle based on the teachings of the defendant and his wife (Exhibit B, p. 21), the children grew up in a limited social circle of family members only; for example, they did not watch television, and Mr Dupont’s own family was largely excluded (Exhibit B, p. 21 – 2).
	
	
	In November 2010 Mr Dupont’s eldest daughter told his wife that the children had decided they did not want to stay at their grandparents’ home any more, as Jenny (then aged 9) had said that the defendant slept naked and had the girls in bed with him. He had had Jenny in bed with him and had put her hand on his penis even while his wife was in the same bed, “on numerous occasions”. Josephine (then aged 7) had been assaulted “more often and in a more serious manner”.
	
	
	Mr Dupont told the court he felt as though he had been “hit by a cannon” by these disclosures. He and his wife went to the defendant’s home and confronted him. Despite his trepidation in the context of his father-in-law’s “overbearing” religious doctrine (Exhibit B, p. 23), he contacted police, although anonymously. Police ascertained that similar assault claims, over the same time period, were also made by Elise Lampion, one of the children of the defendant’s son, Jeremy. The defendant was interviewed, charged and bailed.
	
	
	From that time on, the defendant and his wife put pressure on both Mr Dupont and their son Jeremy, as well as their wives, for the charges to be dropped (Exhibit B, p. 23). According to the Victim Impact Statement of Elise Lampion (attached to the sentencing remarks) her father was under pressure because of this, and this was a factor in his committing suicide in front of his wife and children, by jumping from a moving car.
	
	
	Mr Dupont gave evidence that the suicide of the defendant’s son Jeremy Lampion had a “devastating” impact, not only on himself, but on the whole family. He and his wife went to live in Tasmania, but their marriage broke down. Mr Dupont made a serious suicide attempt. He decided to return to the Central Coast, where he and his wife, although still separated, share custody of their seven children.
	
	
	All of those children were, and remain, deeply affected by these events, as Dr Rikard-Bell notes (Exhibit B, p. 93). The three eldest (including Jenny) engage in self-harm. Josephine, the principal victim of sexual abuse, suffers from the same post-traumatic stress syndrome and anxiety disorder as her sister. The youngest three suffer from other difficulties, including (in the case of Anna) a learning disorder.
	
	
	Mrs Dupont is described by her husband as being very confused about her relationship with her father (Exhibit B, p. 89). All of the psychiatric evidence points to a constellation of future problems, particularly in the future, as the defendant will be released from gaol in 2016.
	
	
	The defendant shows no insight into his wrongdoing. He repeatedly interrupted the sentencing judge to claim that the evidence was “lies”; as the preface to the sentencing remarks show, most of these interjections were not heard by the sentencing judge, but some were, and all his interjections have been recorded on the transcript. This provided some insight into the evidence Mr Dupont gave of the pressure he was under to agree to the charges being reduced or dropped entirely, with his wife threatening to kill herself if he did not agree. Mr Dupont told Dr Roberts (Exhibit B, p. 24) that the defendant blamed the devil for his behaviour, and said that a blood transfusion was the cause for his transgressions. The defendant also told Mr Dupont that the children had lied, which is consistent with his interjected remarks during his sentencing. Additionally, the defendant’s wife is conflicted as to her loyalties; for example, when she sees the children, she has been in telephone contact with the defendant in gaol, and put the children on the phone to speak to him.
	
	
	This is a family where the consequences of the defendant’s wrongdoing have not only driven his son to suicide, but damaged the health and wellbeing of all family members, especially those the subject of these claims for damages. Having regard to the seriousness of the damage suffered by Mr Dupont and his two daughters, I accept the recommendations of Dr Rikard-Bell for four years of psychological therapy (48 sessions) as well as three sessions a year with a psychiatrist, who can advise as to diagnosis and medication for both children (Exhibit B, pp 63 and 93).
	
	
	I also accept his advice as to the appropriate amount of treatment for Mr Dupont, an impressive witness who did not seek to embellish or exaggerate his evidence, or the events in question. Mr Dupont showed insight and sensitivity into the difficult issues of the future family relationships, and would be greatly assisted by professional support and therapy in achieving the peace of mind he so earnestly is seeking.
	


Quantum of damages


	
	The damages sought by each of the plaintiffs is as follows:
	
	
	Insofar as it is appropriate to have regard to comparable awards, I note the award made in M v Nesbitt [2012] NSWDC 152. However, I have principally been guided by the submissions made on the components of the general damages claim by counsel for the plaintiff.
	


Aggravated damages


	
	Each of the minor plaintiffs claim aggravated damages to compensate for the additional harm resulting from the wrongdoing. This is not only the sense of betrayal and trust from a family member who was also the religious head of the family, but the manner in which he brought pressure to bear on family members, including the plaintiffs, to drop the charges, and the fact that more than one child was sexually assaulted by him, which magnified the distress level for each of the plaintiffs by reason of the impact on the family structure.
	
	
	I accept that these are separate harms for which each of the plaintiffs should receive compensation.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiffs initially claimed a single lump sum for double these amounts, representing aggravated and exemplary damages for the two claims brought by the victims of the abuse, and made no claim for interest on this sum.
	
	
	As is noted above, the claim for exemplary damages has been withdrawn. Counsel for the defendant submitted that, in those circumstances, the sums claimed for aggravated compensatory damage should be reduced by half, which counsel for the plaintiff has agreed to.
	
	
	Claims for aggravated and exemplary damages, which are made on different bases, should not be conflated. Additionally, while interest is not available on exemplary damages, it may be claimed in relation to the sum awarded for aggravated damages, although on a different basis, or for a shorter period: Mather v Smith [2014] QCA 65; the defendant in those proceedings appealed unsuccessfully from the award of interest on general damages from the date of commencement of the proceedings and the award of interest on aggravated compensatory damages from the date of the hearing.
	
	
	The entitlement of a plaintiff to interest on general damages at common law is not in doubt. In Kelly v John Fairfax Pty Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 131 the NSW Court of Appeal, although not specifically referring to interest on the aggravated damages component, affirmed the availability of interest to a jury award where aggravated damages had been left for the jury to determine (at 135C). The principles for the award of interest in defamation proceedings generally have also recently been explained in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd  [2014] QCA 33, at [14] and [89]-[102]. For a recent example of an award of interest on aggravated damages, see Hallam v Ross (No 2) [2012] QSC 407 at [48].
	
	
	The approach I propose to take concerning interest on aggravated damages is that taken in Mather v Smith, namely to regard the appropriate starting date as the date of the hearing. As this is an ex tempore judgment, no award of interest need therefore be made.
	
	
	For the reasons propounded by counsel for the plaintiff in his oral submissions, and noting that no submissions were made to the contrary, I am satisfied that the damages awards proposed by counsel for the plaintiffs are appropriate awards in the circumstances.
	
	
	For the above reasons, on 10 February 2015 I entered judgment for each of the plaintiffs as set out in the orders below. The plaintiffs’ application for freezing orders has been adjourned to enable the parties to prepare affidavit evidence. There is no need for interim orders as these orders are already in existence in relation to the judgment entered against the defendant in relation to another grandchild.

		26 March 2015",2015-02-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703955,R v A (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 65,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE – REVISED)


	
	The trial of the accused on a charge of manslaughter is currently in its seventh day, the estimate of the trial being four weeks or perhaps a little more. Today the Crown called the de facto husband of the accused, to whom I shall refer as K. In the course of his evidence in chief (and I refer to this part of his evidence without the benefit of a transcript) the Crown asked K, in effect, whether he was still in a relationship with the accused, who has been refused bail since her arrest. K responded in the affirmative.
	
	
	After that evidence had been given, and in the absence of the jury, Mr Terracini of senior counsel who appears for the accused referred to the fact that this evidence had been given, bearing in mind that the accused is currently in custody. Although not expressly stated, I apprehend that Mr Terracini raised that matter because he did not wish the jury to be inadvertently misled about any relationship which might currently exist between the witness and the accused. He explained that on his instructions, and as one might expect, any association or relationship between the accused and K is virtually non-existent on account of the accused’s custody.
	
	
	When the matter was raised it was left, as I understood it, on the basis that senior counsel would have a discussion with the Crown Prosecutor and the matter would be dealt with in some appropriate fashion by agreement.
	
	
	I was subsequently informed by the Crown, and I accept, that in the course of the adjournment which followed the matter being raised by Mr Terracini, he spoke with K. I am also told by the Crown, and I similarly accept, that in the course of that conversation the Crown impressed upon K the necessity to ensure that he make no reference, when giving evidence, to the fact that the accused is in custody. I simply set out these matters lest it might otherwise be thought that any blame could attach either to the Crown or to Mr Terracini for what has transpired. That is certainly not the case.
	
	
	At the commencement of Mr Terracini's cross-examination of K, the following evidence was given. In this regard I am assisted by an extract of the evidence which has been made available by the court reporting branch. The questions and answers appear at lines 6 to 17 of that extract which in due course I will have marked MFI 10:
	


“Q. You don't live with (the accused) anymore?

A. No sir.

Q. How long has that been?

A. Since she's been in custody.

Q. And so far as your income is concerned, do you share any income?

A. (The accused) and I, no.

Q. You don't share any income?

A. No, (the accused) is incarcerated. We don't share an income at the moment, no. I've been supporting her while she has been in gaol, yes.""


	
	The cross-examination then continued, but at the next adjournment Mr Terracini made an application for the jury to be discharged. In essence the basis of Mr Terracini's application was that a significant degree of prejudice, which in his submission could not be remedied in any way, arose as a consequence of the answers given by the witness to which I have referred. He submitted, in particular, that the answers in which reference was made to the accused’s present custody were capable of being used by the jury as some evidence equating to guilt. He further submitted that such prejudice could not be cured by any direction from me.
	
	
	Mr Terracini accepted, as I understood it, the force of a strong body of authority which establishes that trials of this nature must necessarily proceed upon the fundamental premise that jurors will take into account, and act in accordance with, directions given by a trial judge. He submitted, however, that evidence given by K was of a kind which is traditionally kept from the knowledge of members of a jury, and that the prejudice arising from its disclosure simply could not be cured.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the application that the jury be discharged. Whilst acknowledging that the situation which had arisen was obviously unfortunate, the Crown submitted that no real prejudice had resulted, and that to the extent that it had, it was something which could be properly cured by direction. The Crown further submitted that it was not unusual for circumstances such as this to arise in criminal trials, and that it was equally not unusual for them to be dealt with in the manner that he had submitted was appropriate.
	
	
	The principles which govern a decision to discharge or not to discharge a jury following some type of irregularity were stated by the High Court in Webb v The Queen; Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41 in the following terms:
	


“… whether the incident is such that notwithstanding the proposed or actual warning of the trial judge it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension or suspicion on the part of a fair-minded and informed member of the public that the juror or jury has not discharged, and will not discharge its task impartially"" (per Mason CJ at 53; Brennan J at 57; Deane J at 67; 71 and Toby J at 87).


	
	The facts in Webb were obviously different to those which have arisen in the present case, but the general statement of principle is nevertheless applicable.
	
	
	In Crofts v The Queen (1996) HCA 22; 186 CLR 427, in a different context again, the majority of the High Court (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) made the following observation (at 440):
	


“No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The probabilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends on the seriousness of the occurrence, and the context of the contested issue, the stage at which the mishap occurs, the deliberateness of the conduct, and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact and the like.”


	
	Those principles were recently applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Elomar & Ors v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 303. In that case the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Simpson J) observed (at [311]) that whilst there was no ambiguity in the principles set out above, difficulties can arise in applying them to a given set of circumstances.
	
	
	As I observed in the course of an exchange with counsel when the application was made, the reference made by the witness to the accused being in custody was not a single reference. Depending upon the way in which one views the transcript, there are at least two, and perhaps three, references to the fact that she is in custody. I accept that in the light of some cross-examination which has proceeded before today the accused's prior good character has been squarely raised by counsel. I also accept that the custodial status of an accused is information which, in the normal course, is not shared with a jury, and indeed is information which is deliberately kept from them. However, it does not follow that in each and every case where such information is inadvertently disclosed, the jury must be discharged.
	
	
	As I have already observed, and as has been accepted by senior counsel for the accused, it is a fundamental proposition that a jury will act in accordance with the directions given by a trial judge. There is absolutely no reason to conclude that this will not be the case in the present instance. Whilst the references to the accused’s custody are, as the Crown accepted, unfortunate, they are not, in my view, sufficient to lead to the conclusion that there has been such prejudice occasioned to the accused that the jury ought be discharged.
	
	
	In my view, the matter can be adequately dealt with by a direction being given to the jury to ignore the references made by the witness, and to have regard to the fact that the accused is presumed innocent. The jury should also be told that such matters have no bearing whatsoever upon their deliberations, and are not to be taken into account.
	
	
	I propose to direct the jury, broadly speaking, in those terms. I will hear counsel for the accused, as well as the Crown, on any additional matters which they submit ought be drawn to the jury's attention in giving that direction. Equally of course, if counsel for the accused wishes that I say nothing about the matter, then I will give consideration to that position as well.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I have come to the view that the application for the discharge of the jury should be refused.

		26 February 2015",2015-02-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703958,R v Tomas [2015] NSWDC 204,"judgmENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: Stand up Mr Tomas thanks very much. In respect of count 2 on the indictment, the charge alleging that you on 5 September 2013 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug namely 5.36 grams of 3,4 - methylenedioxyamphetamine I find you not guilty. Take a seat you will remain in the dock because you pleaded guilty to count 1.
	
	
	The accused yesterday was arraigned on two counts in respect of the current indictment. Count 1 alleged on 5 September 2013 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales the accused did supply a prohibited drug namely, 1.46 grams of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, to that charge he pleaded guilty. In respect of count 2, which alleged that he on 5 September 2013 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug namely 5.36 grams of 3,4 - methylenedioxyamphetamine he pleaded not guilty.
	
	
	The trial was a trial by Judge alone, the accused having made an application last week for the trial to be conducted by a Judge without a jury in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. A trial by a Judge, as it is described in the relevant provisions, requires a trial Judge in giving judgment and delivering verdict, not just to state the principles of law which apply in the findings of facts that were made but also to expose what could be described as “the reasoning process,” justifying relevant findings of fact and ultimately the verdict or verdicts returned. All principles of law which are relevant are required to be applied and considered should be identified in the judgment including any necessary warnings that the trial Judge is required to apply in the assessment of the evidence. Where particular warnings are applied a Judge must state where appropriate the appropriate warnings or consequences of them and why a particular verdict has been reached, so it was held by the High Court in Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250.
	
	
	In this matter, a criminal trial, the onus of proof rests with the prosecution in proving the guilt of the accused. The burden or onus rests upon the prosecution throughout the trial in respect of all matters requiring proof by the prosecution. The accused bears no onus of proof unless it is specifically required in the relevant legislation. An accused person is presumed to be innocent of any charge or charges brought against him or her until such time as that presumption is displaced by the prosecution proving his guilt.
	
	
	In relation to establishing guilt the Crown must prove the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The words ‘beyond reasonable doubt’, are to given their ordinary everyday English meaning. The accused bears no onus in relation to matters requiring proof by the prosecution. Thus, if a reasonable doubt exists in relation matters requiring proof by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, then I must acquit the accused in respect of the count.
	
	
	In relation to this matter of supplying a prohibited drug the Crown case is one brought pursuant to the combined operation of ss 25 and 29 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. In this regard the Crown must prove firstly that the substance in question was a prohibited drug. Secondly, the Crown must prove that the accused possessed the relevant substance and thirdly, that the accused possessed that substance for the purposes of supply. I just pause for a moment to point out that in relation to the operation of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, 3,4 - methylenedioxyamphetamine is a relevant prohibited drug.
	
	
	There is no issue in this case in relation to the heart of the Crown case, that is the alleged possession by the accused of a total 18 tablets or pills found in the glove box of the accused’s car after a police search, that the substance located was relevantly a prohibited drug. In that regard I have a certificate from the Division of Analytical Laboratories setting out the analyst’s findings in respect of various items that were found, not just the 18 tablets or pills at the heart of the Crown case, but also in respect of three identical as it is conceded tablets or pills in the possession of the accused at the time of his arrest. There is no need for me to dwell upon the meaning of “prohibited drug” for the purposes of this matter.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of possession, there is no issue arising from any of the submissions about any legal issues in this trial. The prosecution must prove that the accused intentionally had the substance that is prohibited drug in his physical custody or control to the exclusion of any other person.
	
	
	The Crown must prove that the accused intentionally had the substance in some place to which he had access and to which he could go to obtain physical custody or control to the exclusion of any other person. In this case the accused is said to have had custody of the item and control and thus had possession in the legal sense of the item because the item was found in the glove box of a car to which he had exclusive use. The motor vehicle was registered in the name of his mother but it is common ground in the case that the accused drove the motor vehicle on the night in question and obviously had access to that motor vehicle over a period of time before he was arrested.
	
	
	It is of course the accused’s knowledge or belief which must be established, not what some person in the accused’s position may have known or believed however knowledge or belief maybe inferred or concluded from considering all of the surrounding circumstances providing any such inference or conclusion is a rational one and is not based on speculation or suspicion.
	
	
	Because of the requirement that the prosecution must prove this matter beyond reasonable doubt, any inference or conclusion that the jury deciding a matter such as this or I sitting as a Judge alone can draw from the accused’s knowledge or belief must be the only rational, inference or conclusion open in the evidence. In this matter the Crown has referred to, in the context of establishing the issue of possession and possession for the purposes of supply, the third aspect of what the Crown must prove. The Court is required to consider the Crown case as the Crown has identified in its closing submission as being one depended upon circumstantial evidence.
	
	
	I point out of course, as everyone knows, circumstantial evidence is not necessarily any less reliable than direct evidence such as the evidence of an eyewitness. In fact there are many categories of circumstantial evidence that are far more powerful than eyewitness versions, particularly with modern scientific methods of investigation.
	
	
	Before an accused person can be found guilty of a charge or count on the basis of circumstantial evidence the Court must be satisfied that such a finding is not only reasonable but the only reasonable finding that could be made. If there is another finding which is reasonably open that there is another reasonable explanation which is inconsistent with guilt, it is the duty of the tribunal of fact to find the accused not guilty.
	
	
	A reasonable explanation or possibility inconsistent with guilt is in fact a reasonable doubt. Of course when a Court considers or jury considers the circumstantial evidence the Court or jury must do so in the light of all the material in the case, including of course material placed before the Court by the accused. Bearing of course the accused bears no burden of proof in relation to the issue of guilt.
	
	
	In considering any explanations, hypotheses or possibilities inconsistent with guilt they must be reasonable. A Court does not have to be satisfied or infer that a particular hypothesis or possibility that is reasonable inconsistent with guilt in fact occurred or existed before relying upon it, or before making allowance for the possibility of such an event. Such a possibility or a hypothesis where it arises in relation to a particular case need not be a proven hypothesis, it may simply be a reasonably possible hypothesis or possibility having regard to all the evidence, although this of course is not a case that turns upon hypotheses.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of purposes of supply, the Crown does not have to prove that the accused actually supplied this particular drug to any particular person. The ordinary meaning of the word ‘supply’ is to “give or provide something to somebody,” in relation to the prohibited drug, the subject of count 2. There is no evidence of the accused having given or provided anything to anybody. Although there is evidence which I will refer to shortly of the accused shortly before his arrest of supplying a prohibited drug identical in appearance to the drug the subject of count 2 to a young woman under the careful gaze of the police whose conduct in this matter has been exemplary.
	
	
	The law gives an extended meaning to the word ‘supply’ beyond the everyday meaning of the word. For the purposes of determining the offence the word ‘supply’ includes having a substance which is a prohibited drug for the purpose of giving it or providing it to another person. It means having a prohibited drug in a person’s possession for the purposes of supply.
	
	
	The combination of s 25 and 29 of the Act provides that in relation to a particular prohibited drug if the quantity is greater than what is described as the minimum trafficable quantity the person is regarded if having possession of that drug having it for the purpose of supply by reason of possession. In that regard the relevant weight I am informed by the Crown, I have not undertaken any private research, but I accept it to be so because it is not the subject of dispute to establish a relevant trafficable quantity of the prohibited drug 3,4 methylenedioxyamphetamine is 0.75 grams. And as I have said earlier the particulars of the charge and the evidence reveals that the 18 tablets or pills amounted to 5.36 grams.
	
	
	Thus, if established that the accused was in possession of those pills that particular prohibited drug, a conclusion can be reached that he was in possession for the purposes of supply. Unless he discharges the onus upon him that he had it in his possession for purposes other than supply and he has not sought to do so because the critical issue in the case is whether the accused possessed the prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Turning now to the way in which the case has been conducted although I have referred to some aspects of that. The Crown called evidence from Senior Constable Wilkinson who was a very impressive witness. He read from his statement primarily and there was really no dispute with the evidence he gave and through him a number of items or exhibits were produced in furtherance of the Crown case. Those items that were produced included statements of other police officers who were involved in the arrest of the accused. Their statements largely, if I may say this kindly, duplicate most of what Senior Constable Macmillan observed and gave evidence about. Although there is some additional material in one of the statements about conversations with a young lady by the name of Hulme to which I will refer later.
	
	
	There were photographs produced of the area of Darlinghurst where the accused was arrested, he being arrested near the intersection of Riley Street and Oxford Street. In an area that is described as “Oxford Square,” bearing in mind of course that the major square in Darlinghurst is referred to as Taylors Square.
	
	
	This area of Darlinghurst is, as I understand it, known as “The Gaf”, (variously spelt as G-A-F or G-A-F-F) because this little area which is like a very small pedestrian mall revealed in the photographs available to me was close to a nightclub that existed at some point called, as I understand the evidence, “The Gaff”.
	
	
	Photographs were also produced of the messages that were found on the phone of the accused and the phone of the young lady after the accused’s arrest for supplying her with five pills which the accused described as “ecstasy” in his interview with police and the photograph of the phone of the accused with those messages establishing a link between him and the young woman by means of a telecommunication by text message.
	
	
	There is a photograph of the accused’s car. There was also produced to the Court a certificate of analysis to which I have earlier referred indicating that the 18 tablets found in the accused’s car in the glove box inside a silver jewellery bag weighed the quantity particularised in the indictment. The period is not of great moment but they were 15% pure. These tablets were described I hasten to say by Senior Constable Wilkinson as being light brown, speckled in appearance with a “Mitsubishi” logo and in relation to the three tablets that were found in the possession of the accused, they likewise as the photographic evidence demonstrates were light brown, speckled in an identical manner to the extent that tablets of this type speckled with some other substance can be identical also with a Mitsubishi logo.
	
	
	The tablets found or pills found in the possession of Ms Hulme which the accused has supplied to her, the five tablets to which I earlier referred were identical in appearance and in that regard I point out I have photographs of the five tablets in the possession of the young woman when she was arrested, the three tablets found in the possession of the accused at the time of his arrest and the 18 tablets later found by the police search in the accused’s car.
	
	
	There is also photographic evidence of the cash that was found in the accused’s pocket. This cash clearly was from the transaction he had negotiated with Ms Hulme under the eye of the police or the eyes of the police. It amounted to $125, two $50 notes, two $10 notes and one $5 note. Ms Hulme told the police that she paid $125 for five tablets. The accused himself told the police that that was the case and as I said, that cash was found separate and apart from the cash in the accused’s wallet.
	
	
	I also have a photograph of the grey jewellery pouch but having mentioned that fact, a critical piece of evidence both from the defence and Crown cases was the electronic interview conducted with the accused, exhibit E which contains the detail of the interview of the accused and in the course of that interview video recorded as it was, one can see if not clearly the tablets, certainly the silver pouch in which the tablets were found by police.
	
	
	There is some other evidence establishing the connection of the accused with the Vodafone service that was in the accused’s possession but I point out that to all intents and purposes so far as the Crown case was concerned, the bare detail of the Crown case such as to implicate the accused just putting aside some representations made by the accused in the electronic interview were not in dispute.
	
	
	To turn now back to the facts as I find them to be, not necessarily having to refer to every factual detail, but hoping to cover the field for the purposes of this judgment. The police were conducting an operation in Oxford Square and the accused was observed while sitting with a young woman at a planter box nearby to the Exchange Hotel that the accused had been to some short time earlier, he was observed to drop into the possession of the woman some tablets which immediately aroused a suspicion of the police. She and he were arrested and separately spoken to. As I have earlier pointed out, she was in possession of the five pills or tablets to which I earlier referred. They were never tested I hasten to say and the evidence to link them to the three tablets later found in the accused’s possession plus the 18 tablets found in the accused’s car is entirely circumstantial but the circumstantial evidence indicating that these tablets were all from the same “batch” is completely overwhelming.
	
	
	The accused when arrested admitted that he sold the young lady five tablets for $125. He was in possession of that sum of cash. He was also in possession of the three pills to which I earlier referred. They were found in a mint container amongst some mints and as I said earlier, there was no issue as to the identical character of the eight tablets then located. The accused had told the police that he had earlier consumed one tablet.
	
	
	The accused co-operated with the police, of that there is no dispute. He provided the police with his mobile phone. He told the police that he had arrived at the location by himself and gave an indication that he had been as I said to a nearby nightclub or venue in the Exchange Hotel which is further down Oxford Street from Oxford Square. The Exchange Hotel under another name was once owned by a very famous Eastern Suburbs rugby league international called Andy Norville back in the 1960s but its character has changed over the last 40 years from a knockabout pub to a place of some celebrity and fame if that is the correct expression amongst a younger generation that now populate the Darlinghurst area.
	
	
	The police asked the accused to take them to where his car was located and I have a Google map which shows the location of his car in Francis Lane. This is about 400 odd metres away from where the accused was arrested. There are several ways of walking there. One can walk down Riley Street into Francis Lane or cut back into Yurong Street and walk down there. The police to drive there, of course, if anyone is familiar with the area could not drive from Oxford Street down Riley Street because it is now blocked off by a set of stairs that form part of Oxford Square. They drove apparently down Oxford Street, turned right into College Street and eventually found themselves at Francis Lane. The accused identified the car that he was driving. As I said, there is a photograph of it. They searched the car. There is no evidence of any prevarication of the accused in the finding of the car or identifying it and as I have earlier said, in searching the car they found the silver jewellery pouch as it was described in the glove box which contained the 18 tablets to which I referred.
	
	
	The count involving the supply to the young woman is based upon actual supply by the accused. The accused told the police initially that he was unaware of the presence of the 18 tablets in the glove box and he has never admitted that he was aware or had knowledge of the fact that the 18 tablets were in the glove box and then he was interviewed in the form of a record of interview to which I earlier referred. Some details of that have been referred to in the addresses and there is no need for me to go through that in chapter and verse although if I was directing a jury I would draw their attention to some details of it. Some aspects of it I will refer to in passing when I deal with the submissions and my consideration of the matter.
	
	
	In that interview, it must be fairly said the accused readily admitted his ownership of the phone, his possession of the pills that were found on him, the fact that he supplied Ms Hulme with the five pills that he had been paid by her, $125, that he was the owner or the possessor of the car in which the prohibited drugs the subject of count 2 were found and that all the pills were in effect the “same”.
	
	
	However, he denied knowledge of the presence of the tablets or pills found within the jewellery pouch in his motor vehicle. He talked about being a regular visitor to the locale at the Exchange Hotel called the “Hot Dam”. (As I understand it is spelt D-A-M). He said, however, that he had travelled to the hotel alone. He made no mention of any people with whom he was connected that may have been the source of the drugs. He claimed that he had purchased the pills that were actually found in his possession or had been sold to the young woman for $20 and that he was to make $5 profit from that. He, however, as I said, adamantly denied that he was aware that the pills were in his possession.
	
	
	The answers he gave, not revealing his “true knowledge” of the matter as it emerged from his evidence relied upon by the prosecution as being untruths which reflect adversely upon his credibility. It has not been put to me that they are evidence of consciousness of guilt and I will deal with that matter shortly. An example of an untruth that he told was when asked to give an explanation as to how the pouch found its way into his car, he said and I am quoting from the transcript E1, “I’m still confused about that” and he put his hands up in the air to reflect his confusion.
	
	
	I must confess the impression made to me of his interview was that he was ostensibly somewhat “coy” and it was the case that on occasions he was giving answers that in the context of his later evidence reflected some consideration by him of the need to be selective in providing information to the police which is most regrettable.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to point out, of course, that Senior Constable Wilkinson and his colleague, or Senior Constable Aquino were not obliged to accept any version that he gave. If he had told “the whole truth” in accordance with the evidence he gave in this Court, they would have still charged him I would have imagined, left the matter for a Court or some prosecuting authority to make some better assessment. He gave some information about drug dealing as he understood it in the hotel from the perspective of a person who used drugs obviously from time to time.
	
	
	The defence case involved the accused giving evidence. He revealed that the tablets in his possession and those obviously found in his car were from a friend called Jake Connor who had travelled to the eastern suburbs, in fact particularly to park the car in what is called East Sydney with another young man present. As I understood the spelling of the name was Zasch Laurie. The accused at this stage lived in the western suburbs of Sydney. He lived in a garage in the back of a house that his sister shared with two flatmates although Jake and Zasch, if I might call them by their first names, were not those flatmates.
	
	
	He said that he had agreed to sell pills or tablets for Jake who had provided him with nine tablets, the nine tablets that he accounted for at the time of his initial arrest. He maintained in his evidence that he did not know that the pills that were found in the glove box were there but he understood that they would have been Jake’s. He said that Jake had not told him that he had placed the tablets in the glove box. His reason for not telling the police at the time of the interview the truth of the matter was that he was covering for his friend and he said he was also concerned about his safety because Jake associated with “bad people”.
	
	
	He said he was aware that Jake had sold drugs, not only sold pills but sold other drugs. He said he had never sold pills for him before and he was very surprised to find the jewellery bag in his car when the police searched it. He could not recall initially how Ella Hulme may have got his phone number. It is clear on the evidence she sent him a text message that led to the sale of the five tablets. She obviously had his number but he gave an explanation for how it may have been that she had access to his mobile number.
	
	
	I note, although not much point has been made of it by the parties but it is common ground as I understand the case that she did not know the accused before. He did not know her and there is some evidence to support the fact that they were unfamiliar with one another in that sense because on my observation of the photographs of the phones that were produced showing the relevant text messages, the phone of the accused had her number but not her name. Her mobile phone with the same messages on it had a name “Wog Ben Sen....” (sic) which may be consistent with the fact that the accused’s number had been given to her under a particular name but as I say, little turns upon that ultimately but certainly it would appear that neither person knew the other personally.
	
	
	In cross-examination the accused agreed upon the fundamental of the Crown case. The Crown quite properly expertly put to him all the essential matters upon which the Crown relies to establish a circumstantial case including admitting the identical character of the various pills that were either in his possession or found in the car.
	
	
	He denied, however, that he made up a story about Jake Connors but said that he was covering for Jake but now he realised it was not worth the trouble to use his words. He said that the time that he had agreed to sell the pills for profit at $5 each, his head was not in a “good space”. He agreed he had not told the police the whole truth. He was aware of the person Wog Ben referred to in the text message received from the young lady to whom he sold the tablets and he agreed that it would have been better for him to tell the truth but he could not do so.
	
	
	He said that when he was released, in my notes he said this in cross examination, he went back to where he was living, Jake was there and immediately asked for the CD or the DVD of the interview the accused had in his possession. It seems to me from watching the interview the accused was picked up by his sister, presumably the custody manager granted him bail. I point out in passing and I will come back to this in a moment, the accused had no prior criminal convictions and he was 18 years and four or five months old so the grant of bail from a police officer would not be unexpected.
	
	
	He said that Jake viewed the CD and said that the CD was “good stuff” and the accused “covered his back”. Whilst he again conceded he had been untruthful to the police in a number of respects, he said this was to cover up for Jake. He said ultimately that whilst he maintained some contact with Jake he was no longer in contact or friends with him although there is evidence that they have some sort of Facebook relationship. He said that he did not expect Jake to come along and give evidence and he had not told Jake that he was going to dob him in.
	
	
	In re-examination he said again that his head space was not good, that he had been on anti-depressants for a number of years. He said that if he had known that the drugs were in the car, he would not have taken the police to search the car.
	
	
	During the course of giving his evidence, the accused was distressed from time to time. He particularly at one stage required a break. His distress was genuine. Fact finders of course are required to assess matters objectively and not allow emotion or feelings of ill will, prejudice, advice or any other emotion to contaminate the fact finding.
	
	
	I am aware of course of his limitations as a witness. He was barely articulate, sometimes he could not be heard. He is not a person who has given evidence before. I do not believe he has ever appeared in Court before as a party to proceedings. I could tell that he was under a lot of pressure but I particularly thought, for what it is worth although it is obviously not decisive because it may be accounted for for a range of reasons, his distress was genuine.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor sought in cross-examination to suggest, as was her entitlement, that the accused had come up with a story and that it had elements of what could be called recent invention. I point out that in the cross examination of the mother, the matter not having been led by the defence, she gave evidence that she in fact knew the person or knew of the person Jake Connor although she had not met him. She certainly knew Zasch Lawrie personally and that was consistent with the accused’s evidence. And she said the day after he came home from the police station he told her “about Jake and Zasch”, she then “encouraged him” to go to the police but he went to see his solicitor and the solicitor said any matter to be raised should be taken through him.
	
	
	His mother is a Department of Family and Community Services case worker and I take that by definition she has great responsibilities and is a person of otherwise good character. She gave evidence of the accused’s good character saying that he was an honest person and a compassionate person, but he was also a person who lacked confidence and he suffered a great deal of anxiety in his teenage years. He did not choose his friend well and she thought he went out with the wrong people.
	
	
	It would appear that the accused’s mother and father separated in 2006 when the accused was about 11 years of age. Although he largely lived with his mother, from time to time stayed with his father, but clearly at the age of 18 years and four months living with his older sister, who was four years older, he was beyond the thrall, the immediate thrall of his mother and his father. She said the offending was out of character.
	
	
	His father also gave evidence primarily as to character. He is an officer with the Westpac Bank. He gave evidence about the estrangement of himself from the boy’s mother and the fact that for various reasons obviously to do with custody arrangements he did not have as close a relationship with the accused as the mother. He said that the accused suffered from anxiety. He would take things personally and can be very defensive and kept to himself. He believed in his honesty. He thought he was an immature person and he expressed the view that his friends had taken advantage of his immaturity.
	
	
	The evidence of the parents, in conjunction with the fact that the accused had no prior criminal convictions or charges, is available as evidence of good character. It would appear the prior good character of the accused before he was arrested is not disputed, although in fairness in the careful directions of counsel for the accused it was not a matter particular seized upon by the Crown but in fairness the evidence of good character is to be seen in the context of the admitted bad character by the accused which the Crown relies upon heavily as very significant contextual evidence and circumstantial evidence.
	
	
	The accused had supplied prohibited drugs at the time of or about the time of the alleged commission of this offence and I bear that in mind. The law provides that the tribunal of fact is entitled to take evidence of an accused’s good character into account in his favour on the question of whether the prosecution has proved his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The fact that the accused is a person of good character is relevant to the likelihood of him having committed the offence alleged. It can be taken into account in that respect. It also can be taken into account to support his credibility.
	
	
	A court may reason in determining the facts of the case in a criminal trial that a person of good character is less likely to lie or give a false account either in giving evidence or in giving an account of the events in answer to questions asked by the police. Whether the court reasons in that way is a matter for the court that is the tribunal of fact to decide.
	
	
	I pause to point out, of course, the accused admits either directly or indirectly that he in fact did not tell the truth or the whole truth at the time that he was interviewed by the police and I have factored that into my assessment of character evidence. Of course none of this means that good character provides the accused with some kind of defence. It is only one of the many factors I have to take into account in determining whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilty of the accused. What weight I give to the fact that the accused is a person of good character, subject to the qualifications I have identified, is completely a matte for the tribunal of fact, that is me.
	
	
	With regard to the addresses of the parties the Crown very helpfully went through the legal elements, and I have reiterated those matters and I accept what the Crown has put to me, and the Crown said that its case was “wholly circumstantial” and without going through all the detail of what the Crown has identified, because I will deal with that in my consideration, she referred to the very significant fact that the relevant prohibited drugs were found in the car that accused was in possession of, for which he had the keys, which he had driven to the place it was parked, to which he had taken the police and found in the glove box of the car, although this was not developed by the Crown. But, as a matter of common sense, I accept at least the inference to be drawn, or the conclusion that might be drawn, that items in the glove box may more readily be left there by the person who is responsible for the car than some casual visitor to the car.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon heavily the identical character of the pills or tablets the subject of the charge to those found by admission of the accused in his possession or supplied to Ms Hulme, and of course it relied upon the context of the accused being caught cold, so to speak, supplying prohibited drugs to Mr Hulme and his possession of drugs or the tables containing drugs consistent with that that had been supplied to Ms Hulme in other circumstances.
	
	
	The defence pointed to other circumstances, however, that it said were inconsistent with guilt, including the open and honest and cooperative way in which the accused admitted his guilt in relation to supply to Ms Hulme the drugs in his possession, his ownership of the car. He also pointed to the fact the accused’s denial of possession was consistent whatever be the change in some material aspects of his account so far as his knowledge of the presence of the drugs in his car he was consistent.
	
	
	He voluntarily gave an interview. A young person, he might have been entitled with the information given to him by the Custody Manager to remain silent and he gave an exculpatory account albeit flawed by the lies that he told or the failure to provide relevant information.
	
	
	Furthermore, whilst it is conceded that the drugs were identical, notwithstanding the character of the pleading, the evidence of the accused explains why the drugs may be identical but be in the glove box in one quantity, that is in the silver jewellery pouch and also in his custody, that is at least the three tablets found when he was arrested plus the five that he supplied to Ms Hulme, and identical to the tablets in the car why that would be inconsistent with guilt.
	
	
	So far as his interview was concerned he pointed to the fact that he was very young, he was anxious, he was concerned, he was immature, he has reasons for not telling the truth as he explained in his evidence, he also explained the circumstances in which he may have received a text message out of the blue, so to speak, from someone he did not know.
	
	
	It was essentially submitted that in the context of considering character evidence and his general personality there was no reason to outright reject his account. The matter turns it was submitted, or hinges, on the onus of proof and the need for the Crown to exclude rational explanations inconsistent with things.
	
	
	I have taken all the submissions into account. I accept, of course, the analysis of the bare facts of the matter. The drugs in question were found in the accused’s car. He self-admittedly drove it to the place where it was parked and I have already dealt with the fact that he made various submissions against interest relevant to the charge although not admissions of themselves necessarily establishing his guilt, although the Crown would submit that they in fact do establish his guilty, particularly his admission that he drove there alone.
	
	
	The Crown’s reliance upon his possession of the pills or tablets and his earlier possession of those that he supplied was a critical matter I have taken into account and I accept, as I have said earlier, that the pills and tablets are to all intents and purposes the same or identical.
	
	
	I have given consideration, of course, to the context of this matter. He is a self-admitted supplier to Ms Hulme. I am mindful of the fact that he pleaded guilty to that count.
	
	
	I have already dealt with in submissions the issue of the peculiarities of the pleadings so far as the identification of the relevant prohibited drug and I have already discussed that matter with counsel. It is not a real issue in the case, it is not an issue at all. The Crown would have been fully entitled to have particularised the prohibited drugs, the same in each count consistent with the analyst’s findings of the character of the prohibited drug in the three pills found in the possession of the accused and the 18 pills found in the glove box of the car being identical one with the other.
	
	
	Also the Crown relies upon, although it was not the subject of specific detailed submission, the untruths told to the police concerning how he came to drive the car into town and his failure to identify who had supplied him with the drugs. At one point in the interview he said that he was not able to say they supplied him with the drugs whereas by his evidence in this Court we know him to know who that person was.
	
	
	Of course there are some logical peculiarities about all of this, as I pointed out in the course of submissions. In the context of considering “lies” on the accused case the lies are to be found in his interview in a material sense although not relied upon as consciousness of guilt by the Crown but in the Crown’s case the Crown would say that his evidence in this Court was untruthful because when he had an opportunity to be interviewed he gave an account that, whilst it involved a denial of guilt, did not adequately explained the circumstances in which 18 pills with this prohibited drug could be found in his glove box.
	
	
	This is a legitimate argument to raise for the Crown, putting aside the issues of logic that need to be addressed. On either version he has told untruths or failed to disclose full information and this is a matter relevant to the assessment of his credibility as a witness and a credibility of his denial of guilt in accordance with the High Court judgment of Zoneff. In any event it is not pressed as consciousness of guilt and I could not conclude it was evidence of consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	It should be pointed out of course, whichever version one looks at, there is still the denial and consistent denial of knowledge of drugs in the glove box although it might be fairly said by reference to the strength of the Crown case that the denial of the accused in the interview is, at face value, far less convincing than the denial of guilt in his evidence because the interview does not offer any explanation as to how the drugs could mysteriously emerge in his glove box.
	
	
	I have taken into account the significance of the exchange of text messages and the belief on the part of Ms Hulme that the accused whom she agreed to meet at the “Gaff” would supply her with drugs but the accused has given an explanation for that which is capable of explaining that meeting consistent with the accused doing a one off supply.
	
	
	I note, however, as has already been pointed out and very strenuously stressed by his counsel, that the accused when arrested immediately admitted his guilt, immediately disclosed his possession of the other pills. He cooperated with the police and told the police where his car was. I mean I suppose the police could have wandered around Palmer Street and Riley Street and Yurong Street and Stanley Street and Oxford Street with the keys and tried to open up any Toyota or Kia or whatever it was. They came across with the use of the key but that might have taken them hours and hours and hours.
	
	
	The accused did have in his possession a set of keys with a car key on it. That would not necessarily mean that he brought a car into town. If he told the police a lie about not having the car in town it would have been impenetrable. In my view it is at least highly probable that without his cooperation the police would never have found the car. The fence relies heavily on the accused’s “post offence conduct” and the way in which he within at least ten or 15 minutes of his arrest was directing the police straight to where the car was found.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the fact the accused was shaking when speaking to police but this is equally explained by the simple fact that he was under arrest for the first time and he knew that he was in a lot of trouble arising out of the admissions he had already made. If he was shaking from fear of disclosure one wonders why he would then go on to readily admit that his car was in town, if he in fact he had knowledge of the tablets in the car. A simple way to deal with that anxiety would be not to disclose that the car was parked where it was. As I say, it would not have been readily found.
	
	
	Furthermore, he has given evidence of the circumstances in which he came to drive into town and which provides, if I may use the expression rather guardedly, “an innocent explanation” for how the tablets or pills may have come into his glove box without his knowledge.
	
	
	I just pause for a moment, although it was never addressed by anybody to consider the fact, that if Jake is a drug supplier and he is going to a pub why he might leave the drugs in the glove box of the car and not take them with him if he was proposing to supply them during the night. It is not a matter that has been developed by either side and I suppose it is not for me to make up arguments for one or the other. I can see how it might be somewhat inconsistent with Jake’s possession of the drugs but he being a drug supplier that he would leave them behind in a car.
	
	
	On the other hand, he may well have decided to check out the venue so to speak, even having previously been there if he had, just to see that it was not being closely watched. I note in that regard on the accused’s version of very cleverly passed to the accused tablets that he got the accused to sell without drawing attention to himself.
	
	
	Another matter to take into account in this assessment in the context of the legal directions is the DNA examination sought by the accused’s counsel on instruction as evidence by exhibit 1 emerged from the evidence reveals that no identifiable DNA profile consistent with the accused is found. I appreciate of course it is an equivocal finding but it certainly does not established any connection with the accused and I note in the interview, when specifically asked by the police and properly so and I think cleverly so, whether there would be any explanation for his fingerprints or DNA being found on the silver pouch the accused said, no.
	
	
	I note also when arrested the accused did not have any lists with him or any seemingly any other record apart from the actual supply to which he admits consistent with drug supply. He had no large sums of cash and as I say only one phone message has been brought to my attention.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of his version now in court being a recent invention I note, as I said earlier, the mother’s cross-examination revealed quite spontaneously and quite honestly an account that was consistent with the account the accused gave, volunteered by him to his mother with whom he had an open relationship, in what was really the first opportunity one might have thought for him to explain himself, and I have already noted her advice to him.
	
	
	I also note in relation to that aspect of the matter the accused’s mother and father provide evidence not just of his character but of his personality, as I earlier said, which might explain his conduct in some ways, particularly his reticence to reveal the identity of Jake Connor.
	
	
	The accused is a slight young man, looks younger than his stated years. I note also a matter that I need to take into account relevant to the accused’s account, the evidence of Detective Wilkinson, Senior Constable Wilkinson’s assistance in confirming the existence of this person, that he is a mutual Facebook friend of the accused and that there would appear to be some intelligence relating to his activities about which the police officer cannot give any further information for reasons of public interest immunity which I undoubtedly accept.
	
	
	Ultimately, taking all matters into account and hopefully, generally dealing with, or hopefully dealing in general terms with, various matters that have been raised, I have concluded that the version the accused has given on oath before this Court in conjunction with all the matters identified by the Crown raises or were submitted by his counsel at least the reasonable possibility, consistent with his initial denials of knowledge, that the prohibited drugs the subject of count 2 were in the glove box of his car in circumstances where he was not aware that they were there, that the drugs were not his, nor did he have any knowledge of their presence in the car at the time he took police to where the car was and either gave, or did not give, permission for the police to search his car.
	
	
	I am mindful of the strength of the Crown argument about the identical character of the pills, bearing in mind of course what might on face value be the overwhelming strength of the Crown case that the pills were in a place, as I earlier said, over the accused ordinarily would have had exclusive control, but the accused’s explanation of his contact with Jake Connor provides at least a reasonable possibility or explanation for the pills in the glove box being, as I said, identical with the pills found in the possession of the accused.
	
	
	Ultimately, when it is all boiled down to a simple proposition, to go back to a final submission of when the counsel for the accused the matter really turns, as all criminal cases must, on the significance of the onus of proof and the standard or proof and I cannot conclude beyond reasonable doubt on the totality of the evidence that the Crown has established a possession for the purposes of supply by the accused either by reason of his knowledge or even by reckless conduct on his part.
	
	
	No issue of joint possession has been raised by the parties. I gave that some thought and I appreciate, on one view of it, if it was true that Jake was in the car with the accused issues of joint possession might fall for consideration. But on the accused’s evidence I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that no issue of joint possession needs to be addressed.
	
	
	I am very grateful I must say to the great professionalism of the learned Crown prosecutor and the helpful assistance of Mr Evendon in the conduct of this case. It has been conducted in the most sensible and economic fashion.

		21 September 2015",2015-02-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703965,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sie Chun Chan [2015] NSWSC 7,"Judgment


	
	This is an application for orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act (1990) NSW. That section enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application here pending for the making of a proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 19 January 2015. In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity, being the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). That offence is a serious criminal offence as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.
	
	
	The grounds upon which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in para 5 of his affidavit. Mr Spark says that he has read a fact sheet apparently prepared by an officer of the New South Wales Police. He forwarded an email to the police officer concerned to ask him if he had prepared the fact sheet, whether the material contained in it was to the best of his knowledge and belief true, and if it was prepared based on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described in the fact sheet. He received affirmative answers to those questions.
	
	
	Other evidence discloses the ownership by the defendant of the property described, namely, the motor vehicle.
	
	
	Mr Spark also annexed evidence that demonstrates that the defendant has been charged with the offence referred to, in addition to some other offences associated with the same matter.
	
	
	Section 10(5) requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. I have read the fact sheet and the other documents annexed to his affidavit and I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion is reasonably held.
	
	
	I am further satisfied, as s 10A(3) requires, that the defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the restraining order is sought is situated in New South Wales.
	
	
	Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. Mr Spark gives evidence in his affidavit of his awareness of how easy it is for people to attempt to dispose of motor vehicles in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act. I am satisfied that Mr Spark has the necessary knowledge and experience to express that opinion and I do not consider, in the light of that evidence, that the defendant should be given notice of this application before the order is made. The defendant has his rights under s 10C of the Act.
	
	
	Leave to file in court the summons, the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 19 January 2015, together with the statement of facts and circumstances.
	
	
	I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given by the solicitor for the plaintiff.
	
	
	I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the draft order.
	
	
	I grant the leave and liberty in paragraphs 3 and 7.
	
	
	These orders may be entered forthwith.

2703975,R v Denham [2015] NSWDC 21,"Judgment


	
	The offender was born in September 1942 and is now 73 years of age. Between 1968 and 1986 he committed multiple sexual offences against male children whom he met through his official capacity as teacher and priest with the Catholic Church.
	
	
	In August 2008 he was arrested and charged with a number of offences relating to this time. He pleaded guilty to 29 separate offences, taking into account 32 allied matters on 20 form 1 schedules, for offending against 39 male children. He has been in custody since the 14th August 2008, serving a sentence of 19 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 13 years and 10 months. His first available date for release is 13 June 2022. Reasons for decision were handed down in July 2010. [1] 
	
	
	Investigations continued and a further 18 men made statements to police in similar terms to the previous complaints; that is that they had been sexually abused as children when they were under his care or authority as a teacher or priest. The offender was subsequently charged on 30 November 2011. He pleaded not guilty. On 31 July 2013 as the trial was due to commence, he entered a plea of guilty to 25 separate charges with a further 23 charges to be taken into account on 14 form 1 schedules.
	
	
	This sentence relates to those later offences. As they were committed in the same time frame as the previous matters, often in similar circumstances there is some overlap of findings and sentence considerations. The totality of all of the offending behaviour gives rise to considerations of accumulation and concurrency with the previous offences. To some extent therefore it is necessary to revisit some of those considerations and findings. Much of the background information is the same. For ease of interpreting these reasons and to avoid repetition where appropriate I will reference the previous reasons by footnote.
	
	
	The general background to these matters and the offender’s position as priest and teacher is as contained in the 2010 decision. [2]  It was after publicity for those matters that the current complainant’s broke their silence.
	


OFFENCES TO BE INCLUDED


	
	In all there are: 2 offences under s 79, (Buggery), for which the maximum penalty was at the time of the offences was 14 years; 23 offences under s 81 (indecent assault), maximum at the time 5 years. The offender has asked the court to take into account 23 allied matters on 14 Form 1 schedules.
	
	
	The offences relate to 18 complainants, who were aged between 11 and 17 years old at the time of the criminal activity, which occurred between 1975/76 and 1979. In the main, the Form 1 offences relate to similar behaviour to the substantive offences charged and the penalties imposed will reflect that.
	


REPRESENTATIVE OFFENCES


	
	The facts relevant to the current charges including Form 1 matters, an understanding of the facts in the previous matters and specific reference in many sections of the current agreed facts, reinforce the understanding that the charged offences are representative of behaviour over a period of time. The current agreed facts for example note that the type of behaviour complained of was repeated many times. [3]  Where this is the case findings are made that offending behaviour was far from isolated. In any event, an overview of the charges makes that point more than adequately. Otherwise in relation to how to treat a finding that offences are representative of a wide course of behaviour, I rely on my reasoning in the 2010 decision. [4] 
	


TOTALITY OF OFFENDING BEHAVIOUR


	
	Each individual offence is serious. Some of the offences represent the most abhorrent and sadistic combination of circumstances that courts are likely to see. Taking into account the behaviour of the offender during the entire period of the offending and the background information contained in both sets of facts the offender’s pattern of offending was even wider that was previously understood. This observation will become relevant when considering where the sentences for the current offences sit in relation to the 2010 sentences. In the 2010 matter, separate and distinct sentences were imposed for individual offences. An attempt was made to ensure that as far as possible individual complainant’s matters were the subject of a distinct sentence. The imposition of an aggregate sentence for the whole of the current charges is now possible and a consideration of concurrency and accumulation on the previous matters is now required. Each individual offence will still be given separate consideration and an indicative sentence, but without the need to set individual commencement dates, the process will be more manageable and better comprehended. It is the most reasonable way of dealing with the current number of charges. The number of offences and complainants do not make it practical to allow individual accumulation.
	


HISTORICAL OFFENCES


	
	The offences were committed between 1975 or 1976 and 1979. Most occurred while he was employed as a teacher at St Pius X, after having been transferred from from the Singleton Parish and before he was transferred to Charlestown Parish.
	
	
	I otherwise adopt 2010 reasons for decision, [5]  as to how an assessment of the objective seriousness of historical offences should be reflected in the sentences imposed.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES


	
	In considering the aggravating features there are many facts common to all or most of the offences. I will describe and refer to them globally. For offences containing further aggravating features making them objectively more serious, I will reference those matters individually.
	
	
	There is also commonality in sentence considerations and background information for the previous and current matters. I will briefly recap those matters, many of which were dealt with in more detail in 2010.
	


COMPLAINANTS


	
	The complainant’s were from devout Catholic families who as part of their family obligations were required to attend school or church chosen by their parents and to honour and respect their priests and teachers. As a result they became easy prey for the offender who had to do little to gain their trust. He already had authority over them as their teacher and priest and their parents required the children to show respect to him. Significantly in the present offences, as in the prior offences, he targeted young children who were at a vulnerable stage of their personal development and education, entering puberty and high school. Often the targeted children were even more vulnerable due to their family circumstances and the offender knew this.
	


THREATS TO KEEP ACTIVITIES SECRET


	
	On many occasions the offender threatened the children with a further physical harm or with exposure to the school community as a homosexual if they complained. The threats had an immediate detrimental effect. Most children took the threats so seriously they did not complain to anyone until many years later. There is significant evidence that the offender knew that any complaints would be fruitless and he occasionally taunted the children with this knowledge, saying for example, “who is going to believe a kid over a priest,” [6]  Such statements no doubt increased the boys’ feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness.
	
	
	Many of the children were frightened to complain but those who did were variously not believed by their parents or when they did complain to the school authorities, usually Father Brennan, the principal, further physical punishment was meted out to them. As I will expand on later, this is relevant to a consideration of planning involving others in the process.
	


DISREGARD FOR COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS BY THOSE IN AUTHORITY


	
	On several occasions parents complained to the church or the school. To their knowledge those complaints were not acted upon. No public action was taken to acknowledge the substance of what was clearly the offender’s reputation within the school for habitual sexual assaults. However, in his interview with psychologist Ms A. McGregor  [7]  the offender said that he received “oblique warnings” while at St Pius X, and was told “the fathers don’t like that kind of thing” [8] . Ironically, he also told Dr Nielssen [9]  that he believed his reputation was “smeared” by sexual allegations while he was in Taree (1981 to 1985). The fact that he felt the allegations of sexual impropriety “unfair” and still felt so in 2010 is objectively illogical. As he was still actively criminally abusing children up to 1985 and had been doing so for a decade, his sensitivity is unjustified. This disclosure by the offender confirms that his criminality was well known and ignored.
	
	
	This offender was transferred between parishes frequently. He had been transferred from Mayfield to Singleton in February 1973, then to St Pius X in November 1975, to Charlestown in January 1980, to Taree in December 1981 and to Waverly College in May 1986. In all locations he was employed as assistant priest or teacher with religious duties. In 1994 the Newcastle Maitland Diocese took the action of directing he not work with children any more, but he continued to work within the church, without further investigation, or notification to anyone that he was considered a danger.  [10] 
	


PLANNING -INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINANTS


	
	At the school, he selected the most vulnerable boys to abuse. The Crown submissions show the detail that of the 18 complainants in the present charges, half were targeted during their first year a high school. This pattern is also evident in the previous charges. The Crown submits that as a teacher of several years standing the offender knew how vulnerable these young males were in the first few months of high school. That is a reasonable conclusion. Almost without exception, he also chose children whom he knew came from a difficult family background, and whose parents paid unquestioning respect to the offender as a member of the Catholic Church. The grooming process employed by him for such children included befriending them, offering them treats, abusing and then threatening them if they told of his behaviour. The parents, always respectful of his position in the church afforded him unwarranted status. As a result of this unquestioning respect and the protection offered by his co-workers this offender had a remarkable 18 years of uninterrupted offending in several parishes and schools. Even when particular offences appeared to be spontaneous, they were in reality a result of his long term grooming activity and cultivation of complicit adults. This allowed him to offend whenever and wherever he chose, sometimes apparently spontaneously.
	


PLANNING- ORGANISED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY


	
	The school, St Pius X, was described by nearly all of the complainants in this and in the previous proceedings as a brutal school where the offender’s predilection for sexually abusing young boys was well known, where punishment was meted out mercilessly, and where any complaint about the offender was ignored at best, and brutally punished on other occasions. [11]  The offender’s sadistic and violent behaviour toward children contributed to the atmosphere of fear in the school.
	
	
	The totality of the agreed facts in both matters brings with it an understanding which requires an updating of previous conclusions regarding the issues of planning and organisation of these paedophilic acts. The apparently protected status of the offender throughout his offending is a matter so obvious it cannot be ignored.
	
	
	The degree of offending as now before the court represents a considerable increase in the criminality of the offences viewed as a whole and nearly a doubling of the number of offences committed at the school. It is a continuous and very wide pattern of offending, the likes of which is fortunately not often seen in these courts. It is now clear that the offender not only targeted these vulnerable children continuously, but organised himself, either with or without the assistance of his work colleges to ensure that he was placed in positions where the abuse could continue unhindered, and complaints would be punished, fobbed off or ignored .Frequent transfers enabled him to commence with a new group of victims who knew nothing of his prior reputation.
	
	
	The combined sets of facts lead to an inescapable conclusion of the active or tacit collusion by at least 2 other church officers, during the years of offending behavior. Those officers must have known of this offender’s behavior and did nothing. There is sufficient evidence in both sets of facts to conclude complicity in the offending behavior by these other church officers which supports a finding of an organised criminal activity. I am aware that such a conclusion requires a finding beyond reasonable doubt. My reasoning follows.
	
	
	The principal, Father Brennan (who is now deceased) had been told on numerous occasions of Denham’s depraved behavior, by boys and parents yet did nothing about it. Father Brennan ignored complaints by several boys and at least 2 parents. [12]  Even after complaints, he continued to send boys out of class to this offender’s room where the children were abused  [13] . This offender was obviously confident of that support and he obtained it from Principal Brennan.
	
	
	Furthermore some of this offender’s abuse occurred in public places, such as in front of class, in the playground, in Father Brennan’s office  [14]  or in church, even outside the confessional. [15]  This offender was always very confident that he would not be stopped from this abusive behavior. He frequently taunted the boys that they had no one to complain to, on one occasion even saying “ if you want to tell someone, tell God”  [16] 
	
	
	A similar observation can be made about a number of trips taken to the Wingham Presbytery, in both these and the previous facts. The behavior of both priests, drinking, providing alcohol for the children speaks of a planning and actual support from one to the other of this organised abuse.
	
	
	One child [17]  recalls having the impression that another person was present during a late night session with the offender. In the previous sentence  [18] the same priest is referred to as being generally present at times the offender abused children. There is no other plausible explanation other than that the other priest knew what was occurring.
	
	
	In giving evidence in the current proceedings, the offender was asked whether any other person knew of his abuse. He denied it. However Mr Denham has both a history and an interest in minimising his offending behavior. He did not offer any explanation as to how his offending continued in the light of the complaints to Father Brennan and in the presence of Father Picken. I did not find his evidence convincing. The obvious conclusion drawn from both sets of facts is that at least Father Brennan and the Wingham priest, Father Picken knew of and either ignored or encouraged his activities.
	
	
	The sheer volume of boys involved in this sexual abuse and the number of times that each child was abused by the offender is staggering, even to this court. Taking both sets of facts together, he abused 57 boys, some of them repeatedly. Taking into account only the period when he was a teacher at St Pius X the offender operated as if he was at some paedophilic smorgasbord, entitled to abuse boys at any time or place of his choosing. In the 4 ½ years at that school 41 men who have now complained, detailing over 81 events, many representative offences, many of them in public or semi public places. It defies belief that his abuse of children was not only widely known but ignored or condoned by those in authority, at least at the school.
	


PLANNING AS A WHOLE


	
	This is a feature of the offending that this court did not fully appreciate in the previous sentence. The volume of complaints relative to this particular school, and the involvement I have found of the principal and the Wingham priest, now make a finding of significant planning and involvement of others in the criminal organisation possible to the required standard. This issue was raised with Counsel during the course of proceedings and before evidence was completed, and nothing in submissions or evidence has raised doubt. Specifically the brutality of the school, the direct complaints made to Father Brennan and the involvement of Brennan in sending students to Denham for no proper reason mean that no other logical conclusion is possible. [19] 
	
	
	Effectively all of these offences were the subject of long term planning, much of the planning involving these 2 other priests in the way I have described. The involvement of others allowing or facilitating the offences to occur is a significant aggravating feature of each offence.
	


PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE


	
	In considering the objective seriousness of the indecent assaults, the entire circumstances of the offending will be taken into account, however with respect to the physical acts, actions such as touching inside the clothing (skin contact) the infliction of pain either during or associated with the indecent assault, restraint during or as part of the act of indecency and any extended touching or fondling all increase the objective seriousness of the act of indecency.
	


HARM CAUSED TO VICTIMS


	
	Reading a combination of these and the previous facts, it becomes clear that the offender preyed on vulnerable children who sometimes had come from difficult life circumstances, or were vulnerable due to their size or shyness. The facts disclose that the offender seemed to relish the fact that their vulnerability was increased by his abuse and threats and violence towards them, by smirking, or making flippant comments at the time of abuse. [20] 
	
	
	In the previous matter I reached a conclusion  [21]  that the severe consequences of the offending behaviour was “sadly a usual and common result of this type of offending. They do not form part of separate circumstances of aggravation.” 
	
	
	I have reconsidered this conclusion for some of the current matters. As the crown rhetorically asks” How much worse does it get?” These offences were all committed against youths as they were approaching puberty, often when they were at a vulnerable stage of their school lives, by a person they were required by their family obligations to come into contact with and show respect to. For some who were already in otherwise vulnerable situations, the attention given to them was catastrophic both immediately and for their whole lives.
	
	
	Victims of this man attribute the difficulties they have encountered in later life, such a relationship difficulties, substance misuse and depression and mental illness, directly to the abuse they suffered at the offender’s hands. One of the victims summed up the effect on him by saying “what he has done has affected my entire life. Every day is a struggle”. The immediate physical toll was significant for many victims .The agreed facts note the children to have been confused  [22]  terrified  [23]  scared and helpless  [24] . The immediate emotional toll was often crushing. The long term consequences are frequently devastating  [25] . Where there is evidence that the initial and long term consequences are substantial, it will amount to an aggravating circumstance.  [26] 
	


AGE OF THE COMPLAINANTS AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENCES.


	
	For many of these offences, the children were young or very young. For the s 79 and s 81 offences there is no gradation of age included as an element of the offence, therefore the commission of such offences against children is a significant aggravating feature. Generally, the younger the victim the more serious is the criminality. [27] 
	


BREACH OF TRUST AND POSITION OF AUTHORITY


	
	It is an obvious aggravating feature if the offender was in a position of trust and violated that trust by sexually assaulting a child. In the 2010 reasons  [28]  I described how the consideration is relevant to the case of this offender. Those findings are similarly relevant to these offences. Breach of trust in his position as priest, teacher or where he obtained specific parental authority to take children away from their home are significant aggravating features of each of these charges.
	


WHERE THE OFFENCES WERE COMMITTED


	
	The offences were committed at the school, church or related excursions, therefore a feature of the children being under his authority. It is not a separate circumstance of aggravation. I reject the submission of Mr Smith that if offences were not committed at home or school it automatically lessens the seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	Some offences were committed after the children had confessed to the offender, and were in or near the confessional area. One can only imagine what effect this confrontation must have had on the boys’ mental state. The fact that the offences occurred at school or church will be taken into account as part of the consideration of a breach of trust/ position of authority and is demonstrative of that breach.
	
	
	In either case, the place where they were committed was places where the children ought to have been able to feel safe. Due to the planning of the offender, they were not.
	


SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES/ CONSIDERATIONS IN MITIGATION

PLEA OF GUILT


	
	The offender pleaded guilty after the trial was due to start. All witnesses, including many from the previous proceedings who were to give tendency evidence had been conferenced and were ready to participate in the current proceedings. Never the less there is utilitarian value in the plea and he will be afforded a 10% discount on the sentence that would have otherwise have been appropriate. This will apply to both the indicative individual sentences and the aggregate sentence imposed.
	


AGE OF OFFENDER


	
	The age of the offender at the time of sentence is relevant primarily on the basis that imprisonment may be more onerous for an older individual. There is no automatic reduction because of age. It is a matter to be considered together with the other circumstances of the case:
	


Age is not a licence to commit sexual offences nor should it be thought that a person who commits such offences can then expect to be allowed to go free merely because of advanced years”:  [29] 


	
	It is submitted on behalf of the offender that any further significant accumulation on the current sentence will see the offender released “well into his eighties would constitute a crushing sentence, and therefore is to be avoided”. Reliance is placed on R v Holyoak [30]  where the offender was 75 years of age. The court considered the offender’s age should usually be taken into account when jailing a man of advanced years. However, in that case the court found that notwithstanding the offenders advanced age, and proven physical frailty, those facts alone (my emphasis) would not be a reason to alter the sentence for what the court said were horrendous crimes of sexual abuse.
	
	
	The crown submits that the age of the offender is something that ought properly be considered where it is likely that the offender would die in prison because of the length of the sentence being considered. The case of R v Giardini [31]  supports that submission. However, in that case there was reliable evidence of the offender’s illness and prognosis of a much shortened life expectancy, from which the court drew a conclusion that the offender would not survive the minimum term of a combined sentence.
	
	
	There is no evidence of specific difficulties this offender will face. He is 73 years old now, and will be 79 when eligible for parole on the present sentence. There is little evidence of his health status, apart from a recent operation for some urinary difficulties, and a self-report of some minor issues which are controlled by medication. Dr Nielssen noted him to be cognitively alert. I observed in court that he was fully engaged in the procedures and forthcoming in his defense. Physically he appears to be a large and reasonably robust man for his age. He has apparently lead a physically undemanding life, and absent any evidence to the contrary could have many years still available to him.
	
	
	In any event these offences are collectively of such seriousness that his advanced age now cannot be an overriding consideration. Notwithstanding that, it is acknowledged that the offender’s age and the length of time between the offences and this sentence may reduce the consideration of general and specific deterrence as a sentencing consideration. He offended over a period of 18 years and then enjoyed 22 years untroubled by these offences. His current incarceration will see him in custody for nearly 14 years if he is released at the expiration of his non parole period. Notwithstanding his age, a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offending is necessary.
	


OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF OFFENDING


	
	In the 2010 decision  [32]  reference was made to the effect of this offender’s behavior on the institution of the church within society. It does not form a part of the aggravating circumstances.
	


GOOD CHARACTER


	
	In previous proceedings some evidence of good character evidence was called, and commented on.  [33]  It offered him little assistance then. No further evidence was given of any good deeds the offender stated he contributed to the community. There is no mitigation afforded to the offender under this heading.
	


DELAY


	
	In the previous decision  [34] . I referred to the consequences of delay in that matter. My Comments are relevant to the present proceedings as there is further delay in the current sentence .
	
	
	Mr Denham complained to Dr Nielssen  [35] that the current charges were not laid originally due to “ lack of proper investigation”. This is not entirely true. For reasons which are commonly known, the victims in these matters did not complain originally no doubt for their own personal reasons. Thereafter , there was a delay of nearly 2 years due to the guilty plea only being entered after the trial was due to commence. Thereafter he sought further adjournment of the current sentence proceedings to seek advice as to the prospects of appeal on the 2010 sentence.
	
	
	The effect of the delay in sentencing for these charges is largely that is makes for a more complicated sentencing process, as the court will have to consider not only the objective seriousness of each of the current offences, apply the appropriate discount for a later plea, compare them in general terms to the previous offences, for which he received a 25% discount for an early plea, and then consider the issue of accumulation of the current set of sentences on the previous combined sentences. Provided the court undertakes this process, the complication caused by delay in these charges can be offset fairly.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any detriment to the offender as a result of delay in the current sentences. Sometimes, delay can benefit to an offender if he is able to show that within the time of delay, progress has been made toward rehabilitation. I have heard evidence from the offender and read the most recent report from Dr Nielssen. [36]  Mr Denham demonstrates no increased level of insight or remorse now than he displayed 4 years ago [37] . There is no evidence that the offender is in any better personal position regarding his risks of re offending. The most recent report from Dr Nielssen confirms that except that he is older his risk factors remain the same. This is not surprising as the offender is not yet eligible to undertake any pre release program for sex offenders. However despite his interest in self education he has not taken any steps of which I am aware to educate himself on relevant issues, such as the consequences of his offending.
	
	
	Therefore delay is not a factor that assists him. The court will however take care to sentence him to a regime that would have been appropriate if all the matters had been dealt with together, taking into account any changed personal circumstances.
	


CONDITIONS IN CUSTODY


	
	This court makes an observation from the offender’s evidence and interview with Dr Nielssen, [38]  that Mr Denham now places himself to be in the position of a martyr . He considers the church to be “wrong” and seems to be offended that some of former colleagues had been told not to visit him. In his evidence he expressed distaste that he shares his section of the prison with serious offenders. He complained about being shackled during transport and about losing some of his books. The tenor of his evidence and his self-report to Dr Nielssen is that he considers himself to be of a different class to other inmates, and obviously not used to not being afforded status . He stated ”the saddest thing is that he has no one to discuss his interests with” (when referring to his books “The Moral Essays of Lincoln” and the ”History of the Later Roman Empire”). On a positive note he said he had recently met up with a colleague from another diocese and now had someone to communicate with in the yard.
	
	
	My observation of these reports and his evidence is that notwithstanding his complaints , Mr Denham is not enduring harsh treatment while in custody. He no doubt finds it boring.
	


REMORSE/ SPECIFIC DETERRENCE/ REHABILITATION/ LIKELIHOOD OF REOFFENDING


	
	I have heard Mr Denham give evidence in the present and previous sentence proceedings. I discern no progress in the degree of his insight into the very serious nature of his offences. He displays no remorse and no empathy for his victims.
	
	
	He told the court that he was currently housed with criminals of the worst kind and offered the insight to both the court and Dr Nielssen that he observed that many of these criminals has been sexually abused as children. However, even though he told Dr Nielssen that “(he) know(s) more than ever that abuse of any sort was just wrong”, [39]  I do not find that this observation supports a step toward rehabilitation. Mr Denham knew at the time of his offences it was wrong. He threatened children if they told anyone. Father Brennan covered for him. He admits to having warnings. He always knew this abuse was seriously wrong, and criminal. He nevertheless continued it for years.
	
	
	He told Dr Nielssen that he could not remember many of the offences. The frequency of his offending was such that sexual, sadistic abuse of vulnerable children was a lifestyle choice for him. He has not demonstrated remorse. The self absorption and sense of entitlement which was so obviously present during the offending, remains. He told Dr Nielssen  [40] in the most recent report that he does not indulge in self pity, but went on to complain about what he considers to be unfair treatment in custody , such as lack of books and being shackled during transport . My observation is that he has no remorse, no contrition , no understanding of the enormity of his crimes and is still focused on his own needs and comfort. He does not appear to have ever reflected that the effect of his abuse on 57 human beings has been, for some of them, to take away any enjoyment of life.
	


INDIVIDUAL OF OFFENCES

Complainant: MG

Plea Count 1: s.81 indecent assault male (masturbation)

Plea Count 2: s.81 indecent assault male (masturbation)

Form 1 matter: s.81 indecent assault male (fondling then masturbation)


	
	MG was born 28 September 1961. His parents were devout Catholics. In 1975 he met the offender, who was then the assistant parish priest at Singleton. The boy was an altar boy.
	


Form 1 matter (attached to Plea Count 1)


	
	The offender set up a youth club, located at the back of the presbytery. One day after school the boy was at the club alone. The offender invited the boy into the presbytery. MG complied. The offender gave the boy a bear hug and moved his hands down to the boy’s groin touching his penis and scrotum, outside his clothing. The offender then sat the boy down on the bed, pushed him down and undid his pants and pulled the boy’s penis out, then masturbated him until he ejaculated. The offender then made a joke about making a mess. He left the boy to clean himself.
	


Plea Count 1


	
	Whilst in Year 8, the offender obtained the parent’s permission to take him to drive-in cinema at Rutherford. During the movie the offender put his hand onto the boy’s groin area and fondled his penis. The offender undid the boy’s pants and reached into his underpants and pulled out his penis. He used his thumb to rub the head of the boy’s penis until it became erect and masturbated the boy until he ejaculated. The offender then gave the boy some tissues to clean himself up with. They left before the movie finished. The offender then drove the boy home.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Planning for this offence includes the setting up of and attendance at the youth club. Such behaviour is typically seen as grooming .As he had cultivated a relationship with the child and parents via the youth group and the church, there was no need for threats/ coercion. The offence was committed over a relatively long time as the behaviour, occupied the time at the drive in. The fact that the offence was not committed at the home/school is of no assistance as he was under the direct and sole authority of the offender with parental consent, and confined in a car for the duration. There was skin to skin contact and he caused the child to ejaculate, a confronting event no doubt for the child. This is a serious example of indecent assault, not less than mid range seriousness. Sentence: 2 years 9 months. NPP .1 year 9 months.
	


Plea Count 2:


	
	In 1976 the boy was invited down to St Pius X for a “male bonding” weekend. The boys were allocated a room to sleep in, and after they went to bed the offender came into the room, gave the boy a hug and said “I love you and God loves you.” Whilst hugging the boy he slipped his hand down the front of his pyjamas and held his penis and scrotum. The offender fondled the boy’s penis in an effort to make it erect. The offender then laid the boy down on the bed. The offender pulled the boy’s pants down and his top up, then masturbated the boy until ejaculation. The offender then said goodnight and left. The boy had a shower to clean himself up. At the end of the weekend the offender dropped the boy home.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Planning is similar to the previous matter. The offender obviously planned the weekend with sexual abuse in mind. There was skin to skin contact and ejaculation was caused. This is an offence of not below mid range seriousness.
	


Sentence 2 years and 9 months. NPP 1 year and 9 months.

Complainant: SL

Plea Count 3: s.81 indecent assault male (fondling genitals)

Form 1 matter: s.81 indecent assault male (fondling genitals)

	In 1977 the boy started year 9 and started running the Youth group. He organised a movie night on Friday nights, for about 20 children. The offender arrived. Once the movie started the offender tickled the boy from behind. The boy bent forward and the offender then grabbed his penis and testicles.

Form 1 matter (attached to Plea Count 3)


	
	The boy turned 17 in August 1979. He obtained his provisional licence. In November or December 1979, the offender organised for the boy to drive him to Sydney, on a weekend. On the way home the offender grabbed the boy on the penis. The boy became angry and grabbed the offender’s hand and flung it off him. He then punched the offender in the arm. The offender went quiet after this. He did not say a word for the whole way home. The offender did not touch the boy again.
	


Objective seriousness and Sentence


	
	This is a usual level of planning with the offender obviously intending abuse when he requested the child’s attendance. The time was relatively short and the touching appears to be outside the clothes. It is a representative offence, which for this boy makes it clear it was not an isolated incident. The 3 x Form 1 matters are of similar severity but underline the observation that the offender in general picked on compliant and vulnerable victims. This is an offence of lesser seriousness.
	


Sentence: 1 year NPP 8 months.

Form, 1 matter (attached to plea Count 4)

Form 1 matter: s.81 indecent assault male (fondle penis inside clothes)


	
	MH was born on 21 July 1965. His family was devoutly Catholic. He was an altar boy from the age of 10. In 1977 he started year 7 at St Pius X when he was 11 years old. The offender was the boy’s Year Master and presided over masses for which the child served as altar boy. The offender had taken an interest in the child’s older brother (who committed suicide in 1992). The offender was kind and affectionate to the boy (in a way that suggests grooming). The boy did not like this.
	


Form 1 matter (attached to Plea Count 5)


	
	In 1977 the boy was near his locker. The offender put his hands behind his back and then backed into the boy so that his hands were touching the child’s groin and started fondling his penis.
	


Form 1 matter (attached to Plea Count 5)


	
	About two months later the boy was acting as an altar boy and had assisted the offender with a mass. After the mass the offender removed his robes.

He ran and went back to class.
	


Plea Count 5


	
	Towards the middle of 1978, he was invited on a trip to Wingham with the offender and two other students. They were to stay there at the presbytery for the whole weekend, with the offender and the local priest Father Picken. On the Saturday the boys went to the rainforest. When the boys returned to the Presbytery the offender was drinking wine with Father Picken. They offered some to the boys who all drank a couple of glasses of wine. When they went to bed the offender came in, put his hand down the front of his pyjama pants and started to fondle his penis. The offender started to masturbate the boy. The boy trusted the offender so allowed him to do it. After a couple of minutes the boy told him to stop. The offender did not. The boy twisted so the offender could not access his penis. The offender then said “This is our little secret. Don’t bother telling anyone because no one will believe you.” The boy felt that there was someone else with the offender.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Planning involved organising the children, their parents and the Wingham priest. The child had nowhere to escape to for the whole weekend. Threats not to tell and skin to skin contact aggravate the acts.
	


Sentence 2 years 3 months NPP 1 year 6 months.

Plea Count 6


	
	In early 1977, the offender approached the boy before school started. He requested the child accompany him. They went to the offender’s bedroom. The offender told the boy to sit next to him on the bed. The offender placed his right hand on the boy’s left thigh and started to rub it. The offender then moved his hand up to the boy’s genitals, still on the outside of the boys clothing, and rubbed. The offender was saying “everything is OK. We’re just friends.” The boy did not know what to do he was scared and confused. The offender then asked the boy to lie down on the bed and take his pants off. The boy complied. The offender then started to rub the boy’s penis. The boy’s penis became erect. The offender repeatedly said “You’re enjoying this. This is good.” After a short time the offender told the boy to roll over onto his stomach. The boy did so. The offender then started to rub and fondle the boy’s legs and backside. The offender then inserted his finger into the boy’s anus, causing a sharp pain. The offender moved his finger in and out of the boy’s anus. The boy felt sick and described the pain as terrible. He buried his face in the covers of the bed and was crying. It felt like the incident lasted for a long time. The boy wanted it to stop but felt helpless. When the offender stopped, he told the boy to roll over and pull his pants up. The boy rolled over but was too upset to pull his pants up he just continued crying. The offender was talking to him about his erection, saying that it meant he wanted it and enjoyed it. The offender told the boy if he told anyone the offender would tell his father that he wanted it and the boy had come to him. The boy thought his father would beat him and kick him out of home. The boy remained there until he stopped crying. The offender repeated his threat. The boy pulled up his pants and left. The offender accompanied him back to the school grounds. The boy did not go to class until lunchtime. The boy made no complaint. He could not tell his father for fear of being beaten. The boy tried from then on to avoid the offender. He was now also scared at school. Until this incident school had been a safe haven for him from his home life.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence

Significant pain was caused by the actions of the offender, physical actions a high degree of seriousness for the offence charged. Sentence 4 years 6 months NPP 2 years 11 months.
	


Plea Count 7


	
	Within a month of the first incident, when outside a classroom, the offender again asked the boy to accompany him to his room. The child did as required. They returned to the offender’s quarters. The offender shut the door and directed the boy to sit on the bed. The offender stood in front of him, lifted his Priest’s robes up and pulled down his trousers and underpants exposing his erect penis.

If you tell anyone I’ll tell your family and friends. No one will believe you.” The boy left and returned to his locker. He collected his bag and left school for the day. He did not tell anyone.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Planning took the form of significant grooming. This was a sadistic offence, accompanied by threats and physical force. Forced fellatio and ejaculating into the child’s mouth is physically confronting. The child was crying, signifying his fear. The time involved was not very short as submitted. This is a high level of seriousness.
	


Sentence 4 years 6 months NPP 2 years 11 months.

Plea Count 8


	
	The next occasion was later in 1977, again at the school. The offender told the boy to go to his office. When they got to the office the offender shut the door. He then told the boy to stand in front of the desk and told him to remove his pants and underpants. The offender put his hand on the back of the boy’s head and pushed it into the desk. The offender then shoved his erect penis into the boy’s anus. The boy felt excruciating pain and started to cry. The offender continued to push the boy’s head into the desk and then reached around with his other hand and started to masturbate the boy. The offender continued until he ejaculated. Once he ejaculated he left his penis in the boy’s anus and continued to masturbate the boy. The boy was crying. The offender said “You loved it. You wanted it. You want more and more.” The offender eventually pulled his penis out and got dressed. He told the boy to get dressed. He said “If you tell anyone I’ll tell your dad. No one will believe you. You came to me.” The boy left the room and went to the toilets. He cleaned his anus and noticed that it was bleeding. He then left school for the day. He did not tell anyone.
	
	
	When he returned to school in 1978 the boy told Father Brennan that the offender had put his penis in his mouth and anus. Father Brennan became enraged and said “How dare you make up these lies. How dare you come into my office and make up lies about a man of his stature!” Father Brennan then caned the boy 6 times.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	The aggravating circumstances are grooming/ planning, threats, infliction of physical pain, forced intercourse causing physical harm (bleeding anus). Extreme immediate emotional distress. This is an offence of significant gravity.

The offender lost his balance and the boy ran out the door saying “I’m going to tell Father Brennan on you.” The offender said, “Who’s going to believe a kid instead of a priest?” The boy was crying and ran to the toilets. He remained there until he stopped crying. He then returned to class.
	


Objective seriousness and Sentence


	
	Aggravating features: Planning at a high level. Threats when the child protested. Serious sexual act by offender only stopped when the child ran. Immediate fear for the child. Combination of prayer and sexual abuse and confrontation of penis in the face.
	


Sentence 2 years 3 months NPP 1 year 6 months.

Complainant: SMW

Plea Count 17: s.81 indecent assault male (fondle genitals outside clothing)


	
	SMW was born on 17 September 1965. In 1978 he attended St Pius X, starting in Year 7. His father was an alcoholic and used to bully him at home.
	


Plea Count 17


	
	In 1978 when the boy was 12 years old he met the offender, as a teacher. . The boy used to ‘wag’ school with his friends DW and SW, and AC. They were caught in the middle of Year 7, 1978. They were sent to the offender for punishment. He was sent with SW and AC. The boys waited outside the offender’s room and were called in one at a time. AC was called in and remained there for about 5 minutes. Then the complainant was called in. The offender was sitting in his chair with another chair next to him. AC was still in the room behind a screen, facing a blackboard. The offender indicated that the complainant should sit in the chair next to the offender. The offender put his arm around the boy and said “Oh S-, you’ve been a bad boy. You’ve been whooping school. Now it’s up to you whether you want to be punished or not.” The offender then placed his right hand on the boy’s thigh and moved it up towards his groin. He then put his hand on the boy’s genitals. His hand was on the outside of the boy’s clothing. The offender then started touching the boy’s penis. The boy jumped from his chair and said “No, No way.” The offender said “Oh well this is your decision. I will have to punish you then.” The boy put his hand out and the offender caned him 5 times on each hand causing a blood blister on his left thumb. The boy cried and was made to go and stand in front of the black board. SW was then called into the room. He was caned and told to stand with the other two. After about 5 minutes they were told to leave.
	


Objective Seriousness and sentence


	
	The offence was planned. The physical actions of the sexual touching were stopped by the child and he was immediately painfully punished for refusing further sexual contact.
	


Sentence 1 year and 10 months. NPP 1 year and 1 month.

Victim: SW

Plea Count 18: s.81 indecent assault male (forced masturbation of offender)

Form 1 matter: s.81 indecent assault male (forced masturbation of offender)


	
	SW was born on 26 February 1966. He is the youngest of five boys. His mother was a devout Catholic. They would attend church every Sunday. In 1978 he started at St Pius, aged 11 turning 12. His brother DW was in the year ahead. The offender was the victim’s religious teacher. Shortly after the boy started at the school, he was called out to go to the offender’s office. The boy entered and was invited to sit. He did so. The offender told the boy he could come to him if he had any problems. As the boy was leaving the offender grabbed the boy’s hand, and led the boy over to sit on the offender’s lap. The offender put his arm around the boy and said “You’ll be alright, here at St Pius.” The boy then left.
	


Form 1 matter (attached to Plea Count 18)


	
	Not long after this, the boy was called to go and see the offender about a fight. He went to the offender’s office, asked to close the door and sit down. He did so. The offender asked him about the fight and told him there were other ways to express your anger and told the boy to stand up. The boy did so and put his hand out expecting to be caned. The offender took his hand and sat the boy down in his lap. The offender was moving from side to side and cuddling him. The offender put his face into the boy’s neck; he caressed the boy’s hair. The boy tried to get away but the offender held him firmly. The offender then started touching the boy on the groin, on the outside of the boy’s clothing. The boy could feel the offender’s erect penis as he was still sitting on the offender’s lap. The offender took hold of the boy’s hands and used them to touch the offender’s erect penis, on the outside of his clothes. After some time the offender let the boy leave. He did not cane him.
	


Plea Count 18


	
	Towards the end of 1978, the complainant, together with SMW and AC were sent to the offender for skipping school. AC was sent in first. When he came out he was red in the face and had marks on his fingers. SW was called in and remained with the offender for about 5 minutes. When he came out of the office he was “as white as a ghost”. The victim then went in to the office. The offender asked him why he had missed school. He said “Either come sit on my lap and we’ll talk about it or I’ll cane you.” The boy put his hand out to receive the cane. The offender grabbed his hand and pulled the boy onto his lap. He then cuddled the boy and kissed him on the neck. The boy tried to move away but was unsuccessful. The offender said “Let’s just talk”. The offender then touched the boy on the genitals with his hand on the outside of the boy’s clothing. The boy tried to push him away but the offender overpowered him. The offender then took the boy’s hand and put them onto the offender’s penis. The offender’s penis was erect. The offender was trying to kiss the boy again. The offender continued to say “It’s OK, It’s OK it’ll be alright.” The offender let him go and said “Six of the best for you, W-” He then caned him. Before the boy left the offender said “It’s OK, no one will know, it’ll be alright.” As the boy was leaving the offender touched him on the bottom. This occurred at least five or more times. The boy would get into trouble and be sent to the offender. The offender would then pull the boy onto his lap, cuddle him and touch the boy’s penis whilst making the boy touch his penis. He would then cane the boy six times and say “Six of the best for you W-… it’s OK, no one will know, it’ll be alright.” He would then squeeze and rub the boy on the bottom as he left. The abuse continued until the boy was expelled from school in Year 8.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Aggravating features: The ultimatum for sexual abuse to occur, the subsequent caning when the victim refused his advances. This behaviour would have placed the child in fear of further such contact and increases the seriousness of the offending generally. Not an isolated incident.
	


Sentence 1 year 4 months NPP 10 months.

Victim: OD

Plea Count 19: s.81 indecent assault male (fondle genitals over underpants)


	
	OD was born on 17 April 1964. He is the youngest of 8 children. His parents were devout Catholics and they attended church every Sunday. In 1976 he started Year 7 at St Pius aged 11. In 1977 he started Year 8. The offender was his religious teacher.
	


Plea Count 19


	
	During the summer of 1978 he was turning 13 or 14, the offender caught them smoking cigarettes. When they returned to school, the offender called them to see him. The other boy was called into the office first. About 5 minutes later he emerged, seeming upset. The offender then called the boy into the office. The offender said “You know you’re not meant to be smoking. I could send you to the principal.” The boy denied he had been smoking. The offender caned him twice on each hand. He then walked behind the boy and said “I thought I told you to tuck your shirt in.” The offender then grabbed the boy by the pants and started to tuck his shirt into his pants. The offender used two hands and as he was doing so he grabbed the boy on the penis and scrotum, from the outside of the boy’s underpants. The boy grabbed his hands and pushed them off his genitals and out of his pants. The boy grabbed for the door and opened it. As he was walking out there was a thump on the back of his head. The boy continued and left. He collected his school bag and went home.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Although this offence was individually opportunistic, the position of the offender at the school and his abuse of his position as disciplinarian increases the seriousness. The abuse was combined with gratuitous physical assault.
	


Sentence 11 months. NPP 8 months.

Victim: ST

Plea Count 20: s.81 indecent assault male (fondle genitals inside underwear)


	
	The victim ST was born on 20 March 1965. His mother was a very strict Catholic. In 1978 he started at St Pius in Year 7. On the first day of school the boy was caned by the offender for throwing a paper plane. The offender was his form teacher or year advisor. On that occasion he received about six strikes of the cane on his hand. After caning the boy the offender sat in a chair. The offender then started talking to the boy. The offender then grabbed the boy by the hips and pulled the boy in towards him so that the boy was standing between the legs of the offender pressing up against his groin. The offender’s hands were still on the boy’s hips, with his fingers on the boy’s bottom. The offender talked to him for a while and had a smirk on his face.
	


Plea Count 20


	
	A few days later the boy again was caned by the offender. After this, the offender grabbed the boy by the hips and pulled him so he was between the offender’s legs. The offender was seated, his hands were touching his bottom as he was talking to the boy. The offender then sat the boy on his lap. The offender had one hand rubbing the boy’s back, the fingers of that hand were going down the back of the boy’s pants and rubbing down the crack of the boy’s bottom. The offender’s other hand was on the boy’s leg rubbing up and down so that the offender’s thumb was touching the boy’s penis. The offender then moved that hand into the boy’s pants and fondled the boy on the penis, outside the boy’s underpants. After a time the boy was allowed to leave. The offender did this on a very regular basis. When the boy got the cane, which was about three times per week, the offender would fondle the boy’s bottom and penis. As the boy got older he would tell the offender to “fuck off”. Then the incidents started to diminish. In 1978 he told his mother about what the offender had done. She fobbed the boy off, calling him a “bad boy”.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Aggravating features: There was the usual grooming and planning behaviour, combined with caning the child to increase his fear of the offender. Limited physical contact outside of clothing, but of not short duration. Not an isolated incident. Harm caused to victim
	


Sentence; 1 year 10 months; NPP 1 year 1 month

Victim: PM

Plea Count 21: s.81 indecent assault male (forced fellatio on offender)

Plea Count 22: s.79 buggery (penile penetration of anus)

Form 1: s.81 indecent assault male (fondles penis inside underwear)


	
	The complainant PM was born on 2 November 1965. When he was 7 years old his father died. His mother remarried, but 6 months’ later in 1974 she died. The boy remained with his stepfather until he died in 1975, when the boy was 9 or 10 years old. The boy was then placed in St Anne’s Home for Children in Liverpool until he was adopted by an older female cousin. He lived with his adoptive family at Whitebridge in Newcastle. They had five other children. They were very strict Catholics and it was a strict household. In 1978 he started in year 7 at St Pius X. The offender was his religious instructor, this was taught every day. The victim recalls one particular boy being picked on by other boys and always having to see the offender after class.
	


Form 1 matter (attached to Plea Count 21)


	
	The victim was a good artist and used to draw in his school books. The offender approached him one day in the corridor and asked to see his drawings. The offender then took the boy to a small room. He sat and lifted the boy onto his lap. The offender then looked at the boy’s book and whilst doing so the offender fondled the boy’s penis initially on the outside of the clothing but then on the inside of the boys clothing. This continued for about ten minutes until the boy was able to leave. The offender said to him “I’m going to see you later.” The boy did not tell anyone as he was too scared to tell the principal as he thought he would get caned. He did not want to get picked on by his classmates like that other particular boy did. On another occasion when the victim was in Year 7, he was in the same room with the offender. The offender was fondling the boy’s penis. The boy started to get an erection and the offender then grabbed the boy’s hand and placed it on the offender’s penis and made the boy fondle it. The offender’s penis became erect. This continued for about 3 minutes. The offender said “Don’t say anything to anybody or I will cane you or I’ll tell your parents what you have been doing.” The boy was too afraid to tell anyone.
	


Comment:

This behaviour as context information represents the grooming of an extremely vulnerable child.

Plea Count 21


	
	In 1979 when the boy was in Year 8 he was again called into the room of the offender on the guise of having his books inspected. The offender again fondled the boy’s penis and made the boy fondle his. The offender then pushed the boy’s head down and inserted his penis into the boy’s mouth. He moved the boy’s head up and down on his penis. He told the boy if he did not do so he would be punished. He said “If you ever say anything to anyone I will throttle you, don’t you dare.” The boy replied “No sir, no I won’t”. Whilst in Year 8, 1979, the boy complained to his adoptive mother. She said “Sorry my son by there is nothing I can do about this.” She did however make a complaint to the school.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	The planning and grooming is indicative of a high degree of planning. The abuse was far from isolated. The child was already vulnerable. Harm caused to this complainant is an aggravating feature. Victim impact statement from this complainant sets of the long term consequences. Forced fellatio is a serious from of indecent assault. Threats not to tell. Highest category of offending.
	


Sentence: 4 years 6 months NPP 2 years 11 months

Plea Count 22


	
	In 1980 when the boy was in Year 9 aged 14 or 15 years, he was dragged from the playground by the offender for misbehaving. He was taken to the offender’s office and given the cane. The offender then got the boy to sit down and talked to him about his behaviour. The offender then put his hands down the boy’s pants and fondled his penis. The offender then pulled the boys pants and his own pants down. The offender then bent the boy over the desk and inserted his penis into the boy’s anus. The boy was crying “No please don’t!” The offender ignored the boy’s plea and continued. The boy felt incredible pain. Eventually the offender stopped and then yelled at the boy to get back to class. The boy complained to his adoptive brother when he got home. The brother counselled him and told him to tell their father. The boy did so and his adoptive father hit the boy for lying. His adoptive mother comforted the boy but told him she could not go against his adoptive father. She did however return to school to complain. From then on the boy tried to avoid the offender. He finished school in 1981.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Aggravating features: Planned forced intercourse, causing pain. Combination of sexual abuse and physical abuse. Immediate physical and emotional toll on child. Immediate physical pain. Child’s pleas to stop ignored. Not isolated incident of abuse. Long-term consequences for victim. This offence falls within the high-range of objective seriousness.
	


Sentence 12 years 7 months NPP 8 years 2 months.

Victim: PC

Plea Count 23: s.81 indecent assault male (fondle genitals outside clothing)


	
	The victim PC was born on 25 April 1967. He was taken to church by his father most weekends. In 1979 he started at St Pius X in Year 7. One afternoon in about June or July of 1979 the boy and his friend missed the school bus. They then walked back into the school grounds. There they met the offender. The offender told the boys to follow him. They did so. They were lead to an office in the school building. Once inside the office the offender grabbed the victim’s friend in the groin area and fondled him.
	


Plea Count 23


	
	The victim went to leave but the offender grabbed him by the ear. The offender then touched the boy’s genitals on the outside of his clothing. The offender then alternated between touching the victim and his friend on their genitals. The offender then took the victim’s hand and placed it on the offender’s penis, making the boy fondle him. When the offender let go of the victim’s hand and turned his attention towards the other boy, the victim again tried to leave. The offender said, “Wait, I’m going to have to speak to your parents.” The offender let go of the other boy, who then kicked the offender. The offender became very angry and grabbed both boys by the arm and squeezed them hard. He said “Don’t tell anyone, no one will believe you, if you have to tell anyone tell God.” The boys were then allowed to leave. The victim did not tell anyone of this incident, and after it he avoided the offender. In September or October of 1979 the boy complained to the principal Father Brennan. The boy left St Pius at the end of 1979.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Aggravating features. Presence of both children together. Threat to tell parents. Threats not to tell. Moderate planning.
	


Sentence 11 months NPP 8 months.

Victim: PB

Plea Count 24: s.81 indecent assault male (fondle penis over underpants)


	
	PB was born on 29 May 1966. He was from a very religious family who attended church every week. In 1978 he started Year 7 at St Pius X, aged 11. In 1979 when the boy was in Year 8 the offender was his religious teacher.
	


Plea Count 24


	
	Whilst the offender was his religious teacher in year 8 (1979) on one occasion he did not take the class. The class was taken by Father Brennan. During the class Father Brennan called the names of boys and sent them to go and see the offender. The boy’s name was called out and he was sent to see the offender in another room. The offender was sitting behind a desk. The offender said “Come around here, I need to talk to you about this.” The boy walked around to the offender. The offender then put his hand around the back of the boy and pulled him closer. The offender held him there in a tight grip. He moved his hand into the boy’s pocket and fondled the boy’s penis. The offender squeezed his penis causing pain. The offender was talking about the boy’s school report. The boy said “I don’t like that.” And pulled away from the offender. The offender tried to hold the boy and in doing so pushed the boy’s penis back against the boy’s body. The offender’s hand came out of the boy’s pocket but the offender was still holding the boy. The offender said “Come back here. I need to talk to you about this.” The offender pulled the boy back and again put his hand in the boy’s pocket and started fondling his penis again. The boy struggled again and was eventually able to get away from the offender. The offender then sent the boy back to class and asked him to tell Father Brennan to send the next boy. The boy felt confused and embarrassed by what the offender had done. He became scared of others finding out and teasing him for being a “poof”.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Aggravating features: Collusion/ planning with Brennan. The offence gives some insight into what may have been planned and organised behaviour on the part of certain teachers at the school. It is highly unlikely in the circumstances agreed to in this offence that the two were not acting in concert.
	


Sentence: 1 year 4 month NPP 10 months

Victim RM Plea Count 25: s.81 indecent assault male (penetration of anus with cane) Form 1 matter: s.81 indecent assault male (fondle penis over underpants)


	
	RM was born on 31 March 1967. His father was a Catholic. In 1979 he started Year 7 at St Pius. He recalls it as a brutal and sadistic school. The offender was his Year Master in 1979. He would joke with the students in the playground and cuddle them. He would come into class and see how the students were going.
	


Form 1 matter (attached to Plea Count 25)


	
	One lunchtime, a few months into Year 7, the boy went to the tuck shop to buy a drink. The offender stood behind him in the line and said “You look hot. Would you like an ice block?” The boy said “yes”. The offender then pushed himself against the back of the boy so that the offender’s genitals were pushing against the middle of the boy’s back. The offender then placed his hands around the boy and into the boy’s pockets. The offender dropped change into each pocket and at the same time pulled the boy towards him. He then started rubbing the boy on the penis and scrotum for about 5 seconds. The offender then walked away.
	


Plea Count 25


	
	In Year 7 towards September or October, the boy was standing outside a class room, having been sent from the room, when the offender approached him and asked him what he was doing. The boy explained and the offender said “You’d better come with me”. The offender took the boy to Father Brennan’s office. Father Brennan was not there. The offender shut the door. The offender told the boy to come and stand next to him. The offender put his arm around the shoulders of the boy and said “You can’t be getting sent out of class. You’ll be punished.” The offender moved the boy in front of him so that the boy’s back was to the offender. The boy was facing the desk. The offender undid the boy’s belt and pulled down his pants and underpants. The offender grabbed the boy by the back of the neck and pushed his face down onto the desk. He then pulled out the cane and moved to the left side of the boy. He swished the cane twice but did not hit the boy. He then said “This is for being sent out of class.” The offender then inserted the cane into the boy’s anus. The boy felt extreme pain and screamed. The offender pushed the cane in and out four times. The boy screamed the whole time. He was struggling but the offender held him down. After he had moved it in and out four times the offender pulled the cane out and then caned the boy four times on the backside. The boy continued to scream and sob. The boy pulled his pants up and the offender told the boy to stand on the other side of the desk and hold out his hand. He then caned the boy twice on each hand saying “This is for being a cry baby.” He then told the boy to go back to class. The boy went to the toilets until he stopped crying. He then went back to class.
	


Other acts


	
	The offender coming up behind the boy and rubbing his genitals on the boys back and then putting his hands in the boys pockets and rubbing his penis and scrotum happened about twenty times throughout Year 7.
	


Objective Seriousness and Sentence


	
	Aggravating features: Grooming by the offender. Planning. Public nature of earlier Form 1 matters. Penetration of an anus with a cane, many times, combined with corporal punishment that bring the case into the gravest of cases. The fact that it happened in Father Brennan’s (the Principal) office lends support to the notion that there was an organised undercurrent at this school, where sexualised behaviour was, at the very least sanctioned, and more than likely planned.
	


Sentence 4 years 6 months NPP 2 years 11 months

General Sentence Considerations: Aggregate Sentence, Special Circumstances.


	
	As already observed these offences against 18 children represent a serious form of this type of offending. The delay in charging is significant, but “Old Sins Cast Long Shadows.”41
	
	
	S 3 A of the Crimes Sentencing and Procedure Act requires the court to consider often competing aims of a sentence. Punishment which adequately denounces the criminal conduct and recognises the harm done to the victims and the community is called for, within the limitations imposed by the maximum penalties in existence at the time. Specific deterrence is addressed by virtue of the length of the sentence. A requirement to consider a plan for rehabilitation is somewhat overshadowed by other considerations and practicalities.
	
	
	Generally, when considering partially accumulating a sentence on an existing sentence, courts are required to set a non-parole period in accordance with s 44 which reflects a ratio for the whole sentence, rather than just the additional term imposed. In considering the total non-parole period it is also necessary to ensure that the aggregation of all of the sentences is a “just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved”. This approach has been confirmed in many cases. [41]  This consideration must therefore apply to both the total term to be served and the proportions of that term is served in custody and in the community.
	
	
	When considering accumulation for multiple offences, Appeal Courts have urged sentencing Courts to “take care when accumulating sentences where there are multiple victims to guard against the view that, in reality, there is virtually no penalty imposed at all” [42] .
	
	
	I propose to commence the sentence imposed today from today. That will represent an accumulation of 6 years 5 months and 9 days. This is an appropriate period of accumulation, representing almost half of the current non-parole period.
	
	
	It was submitted that due to the offender’s advanced age, special circumstances ought be found to reduce the non-parole period proportion of the total term. I have already referred to his age as it is relevant to the imposition of a sentence which he may or may not survive [43] , but this is a slightly different consideration as it affects the length of time to be served in a custodial setting and the proportion of a total sentence to be served under supervision in the community. There is evidence of an inverse ratio that exists between his age and risk of re-offending, even if a finding of rehabilitation is not otherwise made. Dr Nielsen made available to the court [44]  the Static –99R coding form which is simply a list of fixed risk factors for which scores are allocated to arrive at a total risk of re-offending score, which is then translated to low, medium or high category label. This offender’s total score is 3, which translates to the low-moderate range of risk categories. The risk score is reduced as a result of his age, and increased due to the number of male, unrelated victims, and prior offences.
	
	
	On the current sentence regime, he will be aged 79 years on his release. Notwithstanding that, there is a need to ensure that the sentence for these further offences, which represent only a slightly lesser number of complainants and similar types of offending result in a further substantial period of custody. To do otherwise would offend the principles referred to above. As a result, on his release, there will be little demonstrated need for him to be supervised by the authorities for the amount of time required under the s 44 ratio as it relates to the total of accumulated sentences. The period of supervision is already a very substantial one.
	
	
	By the time his non-parole period expires he will be aged nearly 85 years. At that time his advanced age will lessen his risk of re-offending. Therefore although a substantial term ought be served in a custodial setting, for the reasons mentioned above, there are circumstances which will result in a finding of special circumstances but to increase the non parole to parole ratio on the sentence I impose today, so that an appropriate amount of time is served in a custodial setting, but proportionally less time under supervision in the community. It is a practical and realistic conclusion. The conditions of parole for such an extended term are that while he will be eligible for release at the stated time he must demonstrate that he no longer a threat to the community. Due to the length of the sentences, the parole period is substantial, even with this finding.
	
	
	The offender, JOHN SIDNEY DENHAM, is sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 18 years, to commence on 23 January 2015 and expiring on 22 January 2033 with a non-parole period of 13 years. The offender is first eligible for parole on 22 January 2028. The relevant agency for the purposes of supervision is Probation and Parole Service.
	
	
	The total of the accumulated 2010 and current sentence will result in the offender serving a period in custody of 19 years 5 months 9 days with a period of 5 years supervision on his release.

2703980,Mallegowda v Sood (No. 3) [2015] NSWDC 14,"Judgment

Background


	
	These proceedings, consisting of a claim and cross-claim for defamation, are listed for hearing in the District Court at Newcastle commencing 16 March 2015 for three weeks, and were listed before me today to deal with the sole remaining interlocutory matter (pleading back contextual imputations).
	
	
	The procedural history of these actions, which is extensive, is set out in more detail below. Although I determined an argument on imputations in June 2013 (Mallegowda v Sood [2013] NSWDC 98), the proceedings were case managed by the list judges in the Defamation List, from the commencement of proceedings (originally filed in Newcastle in December 2012) until the matter was set down for hearing. In June 2014, I was allocated the hearing of these proceedings, which were set down as a five to seven day trial to commence on 18 August 2014. The circumstances in which that hearing date was adjourned are set out in my judgment: Mallegowda v Sood (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 216. Following the vacation of the hearing date, I made a series of timetables to permit the parties to amend their pleadings to take into account, inter alia, the impact of recent decisions of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to Hore-Lacy imputations (Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1380), pleading back contextual imputations (Hall v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1604 and to enable the first defendant to withdraw contextual imputations (a) to (h) and (l).
	
	
	By 14 November 2014, all parties assured me that the proceedings were ready to take a fresh hearing date. Most of the lay witnesses came from Newcastle, and the relevant events had occurred in Newcastle, so the proceedings were, on the application of the parties, transferred to the Newcastle Registry, and given a hearing date in the sittings of 16 March 2015, as a 2.5 to 3 week hearing matter.
	
	
	The issue of the plaintiff’s request to plead back the remaining contextual imputations was not dealt with in the 1 December 2014 Newcastle court directions hearing, as it was transferred to Sydney, to suit the convenience of the counsel concerned. Counsel provided the court with written submissions on this issue, and the matter was listed for today for the purpose of brief oral submissions to supplement the plaintiff’s application.
	
	
	However, on 27 January 2015, the defendants wrote to the court, without providing a copy of their correspondence to the solicitors for the plaintiff, indicating that they were no longer legally represented, and seeking to raise a number of new issues. The defendants were advised by my associate to bring an application before the court today, and to ensure that copies of all relevant documents, including the correspondence previously provided to the court, were served on the plaintiff’s legal representatives.
	
	
	The applications before me today are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s application to plead back the defendants’ contextual imputations;
	
	
	The 10 orders sought in the draft notice of motion handed up to the court during this morning; and
	
	
	Further oral applications made by the defendants.
	



	
	The parties agreed, given the large number of applications, that I should make orders in court and provide reasons for my determination by email later today or tomorrow, as both defendants had travelled considerable distances in order to be present in person at court.
	
	
	By way of general explanation of the defendants’ change of circumstances, the first defendant advised the court that he and the second defendant could no longer afford to retain their legal advisers. He said that they had already paid in excess of $500,000 in legal costs (set out in the extract from the defendants’ solicitors’ “combined matter ledger”, which is at page 11 of Exhibit 3) and owe a further $100,000. Although this ledger refers to there being only a sum of $86,000 owing in terms of costs, a hand written note at the bottom states “Billed to date: $584,418.17” followed by a similar note “Payment received to date $498,410.64”. No memorandum of fees from counsel, or from the solicitors for the defendants, is provided.
	
	
	As a memorandum of fees, the “combined matter ledger” is unsatisfactory. For example, it contains no GST information or summaries of how the very large sums which had been handwritten on to this document are made up. Nevertheless, I accept from the defendants that by reason of the very substantial fees they have already paid in these proceedings, they are unable to afford further legal advice.
	
	
	I shall first deal with the plaintiff’s application. As there are written submissions in relation to the issue of pleading back the imputations, there is no reason why I cannot deal with that application, on the basis that there is very little that either side would wish to add in this regard.
	
	
	The balance of the matters raised before me this morning, all of which Mr Rasmussen has had to deal with “on the run”, have been dealt with as best they can, given the lack of notice and the manner of presentation.
	


Pleading back the contextual imputations


	
	This brings me to the current form of the pleadings. At all relevant times, whether pleaded satisfactorily or not, the plaintiff has relied upon two publications, namely two comparatively short emails dated 21 and 24 September 2012. The imputations pleaded in the first publication are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a false accuser (the entire matter but particularly paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 22, 24 and 25);
	
	
	The plaintiff is dishonest (the entire matter complained of but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of corrupt or fraudulent conduct in that they misused IAN resources and funds to benefit their own needs (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of misusing his position as IAN treasurer in that Amit Sood collected funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function based upon a false promise to promote their business (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of misusing his position as IAN treasurer in that Amit Sood collected funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function for which Amit Sood did not account to the IAN or the sponsors (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of forcing out two members of the IAN committee in an attempt to keep their corrupt conduct hidden (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22);
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of misusing public funds (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22);
	
	
	The plaintiff sends vicious emails in order to sow the seeds of suspicion in the community against Amit Sood and Amit Karla (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21, 22);
	
	
	The plaintiff is deceiving the members of IAN by trying to cover up his involvement with a group of people who send vicious emails in order to sow the seeds of suspicion in the community against Amit Sood and Amit Karla (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21, 22);
	
	
	(i) The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of not being a true believer in Lord Ganesha because his actions were so malicious (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24);
	
	
	(i) The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of maliciously trying to divide the Indian Community in the name of Lord Ganesh Festival (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24);OR(ii) The plaintiff is maliciously trying to divide the Indian Community in the name of Lord Ganesh Festival (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25);
	



	
	The imputations pleaded in relation to the second publication are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff has caused Amit Sood trauma by maliciously responding to his hard work with a vicious brickbat (the entire matter but specifically lines 1-4);
	
	
	The plaintiff is a villain (the entire matter but specifically lines 19-22);
	
	
	The plaintiff sent a slanderous email about Amit Sood (the entire matter but specifically lines 23-24);
	
	
	The plaintiff has been deceiving the members of IAN by hiding his involvement with a group of people who sent a slanderous email about Amit Sood (the entire matter but specifically lines 23-26).
	



	
	The defendants pleaded defences of justification, contextual justification and a “Hore-Lacey Plea” (which is now abandoned).
	
	
	The contextual imputations pleaded in the first defendant’s defence (filed on 12 July 2013) to arise from each of the publications are set out below. By letter dated 25 November 2014 (Exhibit A), the defendants’ former solicitor wrote to the plaintiff withdrawing a number of these contextual imputations. This letter is in the following terms:
	


“We refer to the above matter and to your letter dated 14 November 2014. We understand that the Plaintiff’s Counsel, Mr Rasmussen, is preparing submissions in relation to the Defendants’ Contextual Truth defences.

Having considered the issues raised in relation to the Defences, we are instructed to advise that:

1. The First Defendant does not press the contextual imputations pleaded in paragraph 7 of the Defence of the First Defendant, namely, A to H inclusive and L,

2. The First Defendant presses the contextual imputations pleaded in paragraph 7 of the Defence of the First Defendant, namely J, K, and M and

3. The Second Defendant maintains that each of the contextual imputations pleaded in the Defence of the Second Defendant arises and differs in substance from the Plaintiff’s imputations.”


	
	The surviving contextual imputations for the first defendant have been underlined:
	



	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of being a fraudster. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of being corrupt. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant, while being IAN treasurer, of having conspired with Amit Kalra to defraud IAN. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of misusing his position as IAN treasurer to dishonestly obtain for himself funds from sponsors of an IAN Independence Day function by deception, namely by giving false promises to promote their business. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of, while IAN treasurer, fraudulently misappropriating money that he had obtained from sponsors of an Independence Day function on IAN’s behalf. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of, while IAN treasurer, having induced sponsors of an IAN Independence Day function by false promises to promote their business, to provide funds ostensibly to IAN, but which he intended to and did apply to his own use. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of having conspired with Mr Amit Kalra to sack a committee member of IAN in order to prevent that member from standing in the way of their engaging in continued corrupt conduct. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of having together with Amit Kalra sacked a committee member of IAN in order to make easy their continuing in corrupt conduct. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of having, while IAN treasurer, misappropriated cash which he had collected from members for tickets to an IAN function.
	
	
	The plaintiff made a cowardly attack on the first defendant by making grave allegations of misconduct against the first defendant to members of the first defendant’s Indian community while hiding his own identity.
	
	
	The plaintiff made a malicious attack on the first defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a person with a malicious character. (Withdrawn)
	
	
	The plaintiff, being Indian, by falsely attacking the first defendant, acted in a way calculated to cause suspicion and division within the Indian community.
	



	
	The second defendant’s contextual imputations are:
	



	
	The plaintiff sent a hoax e-mail to the members of IAN and other persons in the Newcastle Indian community about the first defendant, accusing him of misconduct.
	
	
	The plaintiff sent a hoax e-mail to the members of IAN and other persons in the Newcastle Indian community about the first defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff sent out a malicious and defamatory e-mail about the first defendant under a false name.
	
	
	The plaintiff acted in a cowardly manner in sending out an e-mail attacking the first defendant under a false name.
	



	
	In relation to the first defendant’s contextual imputations, the plaintiff seeks to strike out imputation (i), and plead back imputations (j), (k) and (m), and in relation to the second defendant’s contextual imputations, the plaintiff seeks to plead back imputations (a) to (d).
	
	
	The application is made following a recent decision of McCallum J in Hall v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd, which reversed the practice of refusing such applications which came into place, following the decisions in Ahmed v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2010] NSWDC 268 and Waterhouse v Age Co Ltd [2012] NSWSC 9: Hall v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd). As I noted in Creighton v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No 2) (2010) 11 DCLR (NSW) 271 at [20], the practice of plaintiffs “pleading back” a defendant’s contextual imputation or imputations was common until the nature of the contextual justification defence was recast in Kermode v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 852; [2011] NSWCA 174.
	
	
	Following Kermode, a s 26 defence could not be pleaded to a plaintiff’s imputations, and was restricted to those imputations which a defendant pleaded which were different in substance. This has, unfortunately, resulted in increasingly convoluted contextual justification imputations, as defendants searched to find “different” imputations to plead contextually. The problem was that a plaintiff would then seek leave to “plead back” these imputations, leaving the defendant without the benefit, if such an application was granted, of no separate imputations to ground a s 26 defence.
	
	
	It was against this background that courts began to refuse plaintiffs leave to do so (see Ahmed v Nationwide News Pty Ltd and Waterhouse v Age Co Ltd, supra). The basis for the argument that the plaintiff could not plead these imputations back is that case management, or delay, principles, mean that the plaintiff has to get the imputations right the first time, as McCallum J notes in Hall v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1604, citing McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 307). In Waterhouse v Age Co Ltd, Nicholas J held that a plaintiff who failed to identify all the imputations had thereby disqualified himself from being able to rely upon any contextual imputation later pleaded by the defendant, no matter how short the delay or how obscure the contextual imputation, on the basis that the plaintiff had to get the imputations “right the first time, at risk of refusal to amend at a later time”: Waterhouse v The Age Pty Ltd, citing Giles JA in McMahon at [49]. Given the difficulties of pleading imputations, and the absence of judicial guidance as to how a plaintiff is to identify every imputation available, this was a counsel of perfection, as well as being inconsistent with the right of any party to amend particulars and pleadings generally.
	
	
	These convoluted pleadings in turn caused complexities at the trial level, as Mr Rasmussen noted, referring to trials in which he had appeared. It did not resolve the problem caused to defendants by the watering down of the defence; it simply added to the burden of the trial judge in determining how the jury should be addressed and in determining, when assessing damages, how to take into account different findings by the jury as to the success or failure of the imputations in question.
	
	
	In Hall v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd, handed down on 14 November 2014, McCallum J declined to follow this reasoning. While her Honour noted that it seemed “unsporting to pull the contextual truth rug from underneath the defendants’ feet” (at [35]), there was no property in an imputation, and the application to amend, if brought promptly, should be granted in accordance with accepted principles for the right to amend generally. To those observations I would add that the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in Kermode is responsible for this situation, and that the refusal of leave to amend on case management or delay principles is inconsistent and unfair, given the court’s acceptance of delay in amendment in other areas of defamation law (for example, permitting the plaintiffs to amend the Reply after a trial and two appeals, and seven years after publication, in Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon [2012] NSWCA 364).
	
	
	In his first set of written submissions, dated 29 November 2014, Mr Connell submitted that the plaintiff’s delay is a significant reason for refusing leave.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen submits, in reply, that the application was made at the first opportunity after McCallum J’s judgment, as the date of Mr Connell’s submissions (only two weeks after her Honour’s decision was handed down) only too clearly demonstrates.
	
	
	In his second set of submissions, Mr Connell submits that, while the pleading back of the imputations was not an abuse of process in Hall v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, it is an abuse of process here, because the plaintiff “is expected to take great care in formulating his or her imputations” and that any effort to force a defendant to “abandon” a defence is “not a proper forensic purpose”.
	
	
	The first submission is an argument in sophistry, in that the exercise of formulating imputations is an imprecise art as well as a restatement of the counsel of perfection required for plaintiffs pleading imputations. Such a submission might have some merit if plaintiffs and defendants had to formulate their imputations in the same application, but this has never been the case. The second submission is misconceived, as the defendant is not forced to “abandon” the partial justification defence, but to rely upon the findings of fact in relation to those imputations proved to be true in reducing damages, rather than in an award in favour of the defendant based on s 26.
	
	
	I agree with the general submission Mr Connell makes, that the reading down of the s 26 contextual defence is an unfair result, and not one generally foreseen when the uniform legislation was enacted. However, this is a matter for legislative reform, and not for denial of a right to amend on the artificial basis of the need for plaintiffs to provide perfect pleadings, that would otherwise have been granted.
	
	
	No question of prejudice arises, as the defendants are prepared to plead justification to these imputations. Additionally, the issues of law at the trial, both on liability and damages, will be simplified.
	
	
	The plaintiff is accordingly granted leave to amend. However, the revised statement of claim must be served promptly, given the imminence of the trial date, and I have accordingly made a self-executing order.
	
	
	The plaintiff also sought to strike out one of the contextual imputations, namely imputation (i), on the basis that it did not differ in substance from imputations (d) and (e), the wording for which is almost identical. I am satisfied that imputation (i) and imputation (d) convey the same sting, in almost identical words, and accordingly contextual imputation (i) is struck out.
	


The defendants’ applications


	
	These proceedings were listed for the purpose of determining the plaintiff’s application to plead back the contextual imputations and strike out imputation (i), an application which took approximately a quarter of an hour. The remainder of the time was spent in dealing with the applications brought by the defendants.
	
	
	Some of these applications were made orally; others were made in accordance with a draft notice of motion handed up in court by the second defendant, which was served on the plaintiff’s solicitor yesterday. In this application the second defendant sought the following orders:
	



	
	That additional time be granted to defend the issue of contextual truth in the second defendant’s defence due to being self represented from 23rd of January 2015;
	
	
	That leave be granted to the second defendant to file subpoenas;
	
	
	That the costs awarded till date to the defendants be paid forthwith;
	
	
	That security of [sic] costs, be provided by plaintiff to the court;
	
	
	That the plaintiff inform the court on what basis his proceedings in case number 201400111009 listed for hearing at Newcastle Local Court on the 19th of January 2015 was adjourned;
	
	
	That the court be provided with the mental health status of the plaintiff prior to and till date of this matter;
	
	
	That an order be made to strike out the opinions of the third expert Dr. Roger Clarke in the draft Further Joint expert report of 22nd December 2015 [sic];
	
	
	That an order be made to the other two IT Forensic Experts, namely Dr Allan Watt and Mr Peter Chapman to finalise the Joint expert report, further to issue raised by the second defendant’s previous solicitors regarding the draft Further Joint expert report of 22nd December 2015 [sic];
	
	
	That an order be made to strike out the subpoena filed by the plaintiff to Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) on 19th of January 2015 at 7.11PM;
	
	
	Such other orders that the court sees fit.
	



	
	Although the first defendant initially told the court he did not seek any orders in the second defendant’s draft motion, he in fact joined in many of these applications. For this reason, the costs order set out below should apply to him as well.
	
	
	The applications brought by the defendant fall into a series of broad categories as set out below.
	


Applications in relation to the mental health of the plaintiff


	
	The defendants seek orders:
	



	
	That the court “be provided with the Mental health status of the plaintiff prior to and till [sic] date of this matter” and that the court make an order for the plaintiff to be examined by a psychiatrist;
	
	
	That the plaintiff explain the basis upon which proceedings in the Local Court against a third party were adjourned on 19 January 2015.
	
	
	Leave to issue a subpoena to the Hunter Valley health services for all the plaintiff’s medical records, along the same lines as the subpoena they issued for these records in 2013 (see [2013] NSWDC 98 at [37] – [39]).
	



	
	The second defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s “insanity” was the reason that he had brought the case, and that this was relevant to the proceedings because it was relevant to his credibility, as well as to his capacity to bring these proceedings. He sought leave to issue subpoenae for the plaintiff’s medical records over a number of years.
	
	
	The only decision of which I am aware where a court made an order for a party to be examined by a psychiatrist is Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Tectran Corporation Pty Ltd (No 7) (Court of Appeal, 5 April 1987, unreported). Dr Rajski was suffering from health problems while acting for himself and was seeking an adjournment. He refused to attend the appointment and there was little the court could do about this. The case turns on its own very convoluted set of facts, and is of little assistance, other than to point out the perils of such a course. There is no question of the plaintiff seeking any adjournment or suffering from health problems here, and he has given undertakings to the court through his legal representative that no claim for injury to health (which I note is neither pleaded nor particularised) will be brought.
	
	
	Many of the plaintiffs who come before this court, particularly in personal injury actions, have suffered psychiatric illness in relation to the circumstances of their claim, or have prior histories of mental illness. They are as entitled to justice as anyone else. Where the level of mental illness requires the appointment of a tutor for the purpose of conducting the litigation, a tutor may be appointed, but one party should not be able to ask the court to order that another party undergo mental examination, in a report prepared for the court, for the purpose of obtaining some kind of certificate of sanity. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff is mentally unfit to instruct his legal team, or otherwise unable to participate in the conduct of these proceedings. I am not prepared to accept statements from the defendants that the plaintiff is “insane” in their opinion, or that his state of sanity requires examination by the court. Nor am I prepared to grant leave for the defendants to issue subpoenae for medical records in support of such a claim.
	
	
	Even if I had the power to make the orders the defendants seek (which I doubt: McGuirk v University of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 104), it would be a gross misuse of psychiatric evidence to deny a party a right to a remedy for a wrong, on the basis that the party lacked the credibility to be able to bring a claim because of his mental state. The potential for misuse of psychiatric opinions in government and political matters is well recognised in the United States where, notwithstanding First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, the “Goldwater Rule” (section 7.3 of the American Psychiatric Association Rules) forbids medical practitioners from commenting on politicians’ mental states unless they have been retained to express such an opinion and have the patient’s consent. Laypersons in courts, including judges as well as litigants, should, in my view, similarly refrain from expressing such views.
	
	
	These applications are dismissed.
	


Application for special costs orders and security for costs


	
	The defendants sought orders that costs orders already made in their favour should be assessed forthwith. They were, however, unable to identify those costs orders with precision, and I note that there are costs orders made against them as well. Upon my pointing out that these costs would have to be not only the subject of identification but, if the defendants were successful, of assessment by a costs assessor, the defendants indicated that they sought an order for security for costs.
	
	
	Rule 42.21 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2004 (NSW) (“UCPR”) provides:
	


“42.21 Security for costs

(1) If, in any proceedings, it appears to the court on the application of a defendant:

(a) that a plaintiff is ordinarily resident outside Australia, or

(b) that the address of a plaintiff is not stated or is mis-stated in his or her originating process, and there is reason to believe that the failure to state an address or the mis-statement of the address was made with intention to deceive, or

(c) that, after the commencement of the proceedings, a plaintiff has changed his or her address, and there is reason to believe that the change was made by the plaintiff with a view to avoiding the consequences of the proceedings, or

(d) that there is reason to believe that a plaintiff, being a corporation, will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so, or

(e) that a plaintiff is suing, not for his or her own benefit, but for the benefit of some other person and there is reason to believe that the plaintiff will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so, or

(f) that there is reason to believe that the plaintiff has divested assets with the intention of avoiding the consequences of the proceedings,

the court may order the plaintiff to give such security as the court thinks fit, in such manner as the court directs, for the defendant’s costs of the proceedings and that the proceedings be stayed until the security is given.

(1A) In determining whether it is appropriate to make an order that a plaintiff referred to in subrule (1) give security for costs, the court may have regard to the following matters and such other matters as it considers relevant:

(a) the prospects of success or merits of the proceedings,

(b) the genuineness of the proceedings,

(c) the impecuniosity of the plaintiff,

(d) whether the plaintiff’s impecuniosity is attributable to the defendant’s conduct,

(e) whether the plaintiff is effectively in the position of a defendant,

(f) whether an order for security for costs would stifle the proceedings,

(g) whether the proceedings involves a matter of public importance,

(h) whether there has been an admission or payment in court,

(i) whether delay by the plaintiff in commencing the proceedings has prejudiced the defendant,

(j) the costs of the proceedings,

(k) whether the security sought is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the subject matter in dispute,

(l) the timing of the application for security for costs,

(m) whether an order for costs made against the plaintiff would be enforceable within Australia,

(n) the ease and convenience or otherwise of enforcing a New South Wales court judgment or order in the country of a non-resident plaintiff.

(1B) If the plaintiff is a natural person, an order for security for costs cannot be made merely on account of his or her impecuniosity.

(2) Security for costs is to be given in such manner, at such time and on such terms (if any) as the court may by order direct.

(3) If the plaintiff fails to comply with an order under this rule, the court may order that the proceeding on the plaintiff’s claim for relief in the proceedings be dismissed.

(4) This rule does not affect the provisions of any Act under which the court may require security for costs to be given.”


	
	The circumstances in which an order for security for costs will be made against an individual are limited to those set out in the rules. Such an application may be made where the plaintiff resides outside the jurisdiction (Kennedy v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2008] QSC 134), but that is not the case here.
	
	
	Even assuming there were grounds for the making of an order for security for costs against the plaintiff (which I do not accept), the same discretionary factors which arose in Corby v Channel Seven Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 245 would apply here. McCallum J noted at [36] – [37]:
	


“[36] The most compelling discretionary consideration against granting the orders sought is the delay in bringing the application. I do not accept the submission put by Mr Littlemore that I should conclude that the application is motivated, not by fear about the costs position but by a desire on the part of the defendants opportunistically to exploit the plaintiff’s personal situation of spending time in Bali to support her sister. Nonetheless, there is plain prejudice to the plaintiff as a result of the timing of this application. The proceedings have been listed for hearing since early October last year. As noted above, the plaintiff’s Counsel have spent weeks preparing for the hearing, as was appropriate having regard to the breadth of material referred to in support of the defendants’ defences. During that time, the plaintiff had to make an application to the Duty Judge seeking orders to compel the defendants to comply with the timetable for the preparation of the matter.

[37] The unfairness of making an order for security for costs at such a late stage is demonstrable. If the order did in fact prevent the plaintiff from prosecuting her claim, it would not only preclude her from prosecuting an apparently arguable claim, it would also preclude her from ever recovering the legal costs she has already incurred.”


	
	Similarly, in these proceedings, where the hearing date is six weeks away, the plaintiff would be greatly disadvantaged.
	
	
	An additional problem is that what the defendants really seek is not security for costs, but an order that the plaintiff pay the sum of $500,000 - $600,000, being their past solicitor and client costs in full to date (the hearing will cost another $250,000, but they have decided not to retain solicitors or counsel for the hearing in any event). The submission that the security is required because otherwise “the defendants cannot defend at the trial” is, therefore, disingenuous.
	
	
	The applications for costs payable forthwith (although never developed, in that these costs were never identified) and for security for costs are dismissed.
	


Applications in relation to subpoenae


	
	As is set out above, I have refused the defendants leave to subpoena the plaintiff’s medical records.
	
	
	The defendants also sought to set aside the subpoena the plaintiff proposes to serve on his employer for documents identified in pages 10 – 11 of the Joint Experts’ Report of 22 December 2014. The defendants submit that this is a fishing expedition. These documents will clearly assist the experts in their evidence, so this objection must fail.
	


Applications in relation to expert evidence


	
	The defendants sought orders for the striking out of Dr Roger Clarke’s evidence on the basis that he lacks the expertise to comment and should not have been permitted to provide evidence for the purpose of the conclave, as this means that the plaintiff has two experts while the defendants only have one.
	
	
	I have read the Further Joint Expert Report and consider that these issues are inappropriate to be dealt with as a separate question of law under UCPR r 28.2. These objections should be raised with the trial judge.
	


Application for transfer to the Supreme Court and for a stay of these orders


	
	The defendants told me that they were dissatisfied with the conduct of these proceedings in the Defamation List both prior to the matter being sent to me for hearing in August 2014 and since that date. They propose to appeal all of the orders made against them since these proceedings were commenced. If they do so within the time frame set out in these orders, they have liberty to seek a stay of these orders, as I have provided for this in the orders set out below.
	
	
	As I noted in my previous judgment, these proceedings have been conducted with extraordinary bitterness and hostility. Although Mr Rasmussen was inclined to doubt the defendants’ claim that they had expended $600,000 in legal fees on interlocutory applications to date, it is clear to me, from my perusal of the file, that the judges who case managed these proceedings heard and determined many applications, in most of which the defendants were the moving party, with exemplary courtesy and dispatch.
	
	
	The defendants also complain of delay by the plaintiff at every turn, but the honours on this subject appear to be at least equally divided. The defendants’ complaints of inadequate pleading of the statement of claim (currently in its third version) have some merit, but this is unfortunately a feature of defamation litigation generally.
	
	
	The defendants are roundly critical of their own lawyers, the plaintiff and his lawyers, and the judges of this court. They propose to seek a transfer of these proceedings to the Supreme Court. However, there is a hearing date allocated in six weeks’ time, and I note that in similar circumstances McCallum J refused an application to transfer to this court: Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc v McGuire [2014] NSWSC 1370.
	
	
	The defendants did not seek an adjournment of the hearing. They say that they do not propose to do so. They have, however, sought leave to bring such an application before the trial judge, and I have made an order to that effect.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff sought an indulgence in relation to the pleading back of the imputations, and in the ordinary course of events may have been vulnerable to a costs order. However, this application was dealt with more or less on the papers, while the defendants’ submissions, on a wide-ranging set of issues, took more than half a day. In those circumstances, the defendants should pay the plaintiff’s costs.
	


Orders


	
	By reason of the defendants’ coming from Brisbane and Port Macquarie, they agree to the procedure of my making orders in open court and providing a written decision by email later today.
	
	
	The application of the plaintiff to strike out contextual imputation (i) on the basis that it does not differ in substance from imputations pleaded by the plaintiff (notably imputations (d) and (e)) is granted.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application to plead back contextual imputations (j), (k) and (m) from the first defendant’s defence and contextual imputations (a) to (d) from the second defendant’s defence is granted.
	
	
	Note the first defendant has abandoned contextual imputations (a) to (h) and (l) in his solicitor’s letter of 25 November 2014 (see Exhibit A).
	
	
	The plaintiff to file a Fourth Further Amended Statement of Claim incorporating the above amendments in 7 days. If this document is not filed within 7 days, no further amended pleadings may be filed.
	
	
	Note the first defendant has no issues to raise before the court save to continue his objections in relation to the inclusion of Dr Clarke in the experts’ conclave, which, as previously noted, is a matter for the trial judge.
	
	
	Note that the plaintiff, who is present in court, through his counsel Mr Rasmussen confirms that there are no applications to adjourn the specially fixed trial under the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	Note that no claim for injury to health has been pleaded or particularised and accordingly may not be raised at the trial.
	
	
	The first defendant’s oral application to issue a subpoena to the Hunter New England Local Health District for information about the plaintiff’s mental health is refused.
	
	
	The defendants’ application for security for costs to be provided by the plaintiff in the sum of $584,418 is dismissed.
	
	
	The second defendant’s application for the plaintiff to provide information about his mental health status is rejected.
	
	
	The second defendant’s application for the plaintiff’s subpoena to the RMS to be set aside is refused.
	
	
	The application by the second defendant to strike out the opinion of Dr Clarke is a matter for the trial judge.
	
	
	An order refusing the second defendant’s application for a further report from Dr Allan Watt and Mr Peter Chapman in relation to “issues raised by the second defendant’s previous solicitors regarding the draft further joint expert report of 22 December 2014”.
	
	
	Defer the making of an order for stay of these orders pending the filing and serving of the defendants’ application for leave to appeal, such application to be filed in 14 days.
	
	
	Direct the plaintiff to issue subpoenae to all three experts (Dr Watt, Dr Clarke and Mr Chapman) to attend the trial to give evidence, but that the issue of who should pay the expert’s costs, and such other matters as the trial judge may deem appropriate (such as the selection of the date and the manner of giving evidence, including evidence by Skype through 4G network) is a matter for the trial judge.
	
	
	The defendants are to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the plaintiff’s application to plead back the defendants’ contextual imputations and to strike out the first defendant’s contextual imputation (i), as well as the costs of the 10 applications set out in the second defendant’s notice of motion (Exhibit 4) and the first defendant’s oral applications.
	
	
	Liberty to restore on 2 days’ notice to the Defamation List in relation to further interlocutory matters; any trial issues are to be raised with the trial judge in the relevant Newcastle sittings.
	
	
	Any application to adjourn the trial should be made to the trial judge.
	
	
	Any application to transfer these proceedings to the Supreme Court for “better case management” should be made to the Supreme Court.
	
	
	All documents to be served on the defendants may be served on him to their current email addresses.

		26 February 2015",2015-01-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703982,R v Chalmers [2015] NSWDC 70,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: In May last year I commenced a trial before me and a jury involving an allegation that the prisoner in this matter, Wayne Colin Chalmers, had committed an offence of dishonestly destroying property by means of fire with a view to making a gain. As the evidence against him mounted I began to wonder why Mr Chalmers was not pleading guilty. Eventually, after only a few day’s evidence, Mr Chalmers took the realistic decision to ask to be re arraigned and on this occasion he did enter a plea of guilty. It is now some time since that event. On occasions Mr Chalmers matter was listed for sentence but applications, appropriately made I emphasise, were made that the matter be adjourned, in particular so that he could be assessed by a forensic psychiatrist. That has now occurred. I am in a position to sentence Mr Chalmers and the value of the adjournments has been demonstrated by the substantial assistance that I gained from Dr Neilssen’s report tendered today.
	
	
	The offence for which Mr Chalmers stands to be sentenced was committed as long ago as 17 September 2009. On that occasion a four bedroom brick house in rural New South Wales was destroyed by fire. So complete was the damage that the premises were beyond repair and had to be demolished. Mr Chalmers did not own the premises. He rented them. He had moved in only a relatively short time before but soon afterwards began experiencing financial difficulties. At some stage Mr Chalmers formed the view that he could deal with his financial difficulties by setting fire to the house and claiming the proceeds of insurance which he held over the contents contained within the rented house.
	
	
	He took out an insurance policy with Allianz insurance the day before the fire. He tried to get his contents insured for the sum of $237,000 but Allianz would only insure it for a maximum of $199,000. That is the policy that he took out only hours before the premises were destroyed. He already had another home contents policy with NRMA for a similar amount.
	
	
	A number of circumstances pointed to Mr Chalmers’ guilt. The multiple insurance policies, one of which was taken out only hours before the house was destroyed is one such circumstance. But another important circumstance was this: His neighbour watched in the early hours of 17 December 2009 as a person fitting the description of the accused left from and returned to the premises driving a red Ford utility on several occasions throughout the early hours. When the Ford utility with a trailer attached left the premises it was weighed down but when it came back it was empty. As if that were not enough, later police became aware that property which should have been destroyed in the fire had Mr Chalmers been an innocent victim of some circumstance was still in existence and this is consistent with a safe in the premises which was supposed to have jewellery in it being found to be empty.
	
	
	The value of the property prior to the fire was estimated to be three quarters of a million dollars. That of course included the land value. The premises were insured and the owner was paid out more than $300,000 on account of her loss.
	
	
	One of the other circumstances the Crown would have relied on, had it been necessary, at trial was that Mr Chalmers, the Crown was going to submit, had a tendency to commit offences of this kind. On his criminal history is a similar offence to the one he is now to be sentenced on, committed on 15 May 2009, that is only a very short time before he committed this offence.
	
	
	Mr Chalmers has quite a lengthy criminal history of offending in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland. As I have just mentioned he has an offence of a similar type to the one for which he is to be sentenced as well as many offences involving dishonesty, some of assault and driving offences as well.
	
	
	Mr Chalmers is a man who has a significant history of mental illness. Indeed only very shortly before he committed this offence he was assessed by a psychiatrist as part of ongoing treatment. He was found to be experiencing hallucinations and to have persecutory beliefs, but he was responding well to a high dose of anti-psychotic medication.
	
	
	I mentioned before the assistance I gained from Dr Nielssen’s report. Dr Nielssen saw the offender and reviewed documentation including a report of the psychiatrist who saw Mr Chalmers shortly before committing this offence, and spoke to the offender’s mother. He concluded this way:
	


“It is clear that Mr Chalmers has a severe and disabling form of psychiatric disorder, from the history of a pattern of antisocial and self-defeating behaviour, and from the gross impairment in social judgment that is evident in his presentation and in his past behaviour, including this offence.”


	
	His condition cannot have been helped by his abuse of both alcohol and drugs, but of course his abuse of those substances has to be looked at in the light of his underlying mental illness. Dr Nielssen believed that there was a connection between the offender’s mental condition and the offence because:
	


“The offence itself and his behaviour on the day of the offence appear to be consistent with the outward manifestation of his condition, with impairment in social judgment, lack of inhibition and impulse control. He showed lack of judgment in apparently not recognising the scrutiny that taking out an insurance policy just before a suspicious fire might create.”


	
	The offender is the older of two boys. He had a younger brother who sadly died in 1998 from what was found to have been an accidental drug overdose. Mr Chalmers was deeply affected, it is no surprise to learn, from the death of his brother. He rarely saw his father as he was growing up, his parents having separated when he was quite young, but he has a very good relationship with his mother. She has supported him over what must have been a very difficult number of years. Mr Chalmers’ misbehaviour was apparent from an early age. He was expelled from schools, truanted and began committing offences at a very young age. No doubt a great deal of Mr Chalmers’ criminal offending results from his long term psychiatric illness.
	
	
	The consequences of his psychiatric illness are numerous when it comes to determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon him. Firstly his moral culpability is reduced. He is not to be sentenced as though he was a fully functioning adult who was in a position to reason with a completely healthy mind about whether or not to commit this offence. As Dr Nielssen notes he will be vulnerable in prison because of his impairment in social judgment and his poor impulse control. Dr Nielssen further notes that he would expect that the treatment available for Mr Chalmers’ various conditions in custody would be inferior to those available in the community. There is also a risk of setting back the ongoing treatment of the offender which has been able to improve his condition over recent times. For those reasons, amongst others, it is the case that a sentence more lenient than that which otherwise would be imposed would be appropriate.
	
	
	There is of course a reduced need for general deterrence but the authorities remind us that that does not mean that other factors to be considered in determining an appropriate sentence are to be ignored, in particular the issue of personal deterrence. The offender has demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. There have been one or two periods where he has remained offence free for a decent period of time, but certainly in 2009 he was offending at a significant level. There is no suggestion from anything I have read in Dr Nielssen’s report that personal deterrence should be ignored and I will not do so. The offender needs to know that if he continues to commit offences, particularly offences of this seriousness, he will continue to go to gaol.
	
	
	I should indicate that the offender’s plea of guilty did carry with it a utilitarian benefit, although as is obvious from the procedural history I have outlined, a very limited one indeed. I will however take it into account and there will be a modest reduction from the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed had Mr Chalmers been found guilty by a jury as would inevitably have been the case.
	
	
	There is no expression of remorse contained in Dr Nielssen’s report nor within any other piece of evidence before me. The only thing that Mr Roff could point to as demonstrating remorse was the offender’s plea of guilty, but in my view that, as I have made clear I trust, that was simply recognition of the inevitable. I do not find that the offender is remorseful at all.
	
	
	Although there is no evidence that the offender engaged in a great deal of planning leading up to him taking out the insurance policy with Allianz, once that was done he put a great deal of effort into committing this offence and seeing it through. This was certainly not a spur of the moment decision immediately regretted. There was a significant amount of harm caused by the offence. The loss was substantial. It may be that the owner was reimbursed by her own insurance company, but that is just a shifting of the loss not a mitigation of it.
	
	
	I note that this offence can be dealt with summarily. But this was an offence of such seriousness that it would have been completely wrong for it to have been dealt with in the Local Court with a jurisdictional limit of only two years.
	
	
	I note the suggestion that this offence was committed because of financial difficulty. Almost every case of an offence of this kind comes about because of financial difficulty. If this was a mitigating factor then the law would soon cease to have an appropriate deterrent effect as regards sentences for this type of offence.
	
	
	It has to be said that the prospects of Mr Chalmers’ rehabilitation are far from good. A great deal will depend on his attitude towards the way he has lived his life till now. If he wants to keep committing offences he has to understand that he will go back to gaol regularly, and for longer and longer periods. The only person who can break that cycle is the offender himself. He will of course be assisted by those who treat him whilst he is in custody and I am prepared to make a finding of special circumstances in his favour in order to assist him to make the right decisions about whether he will commit further offences once he is released from custody.
	
	
	It is of course sad to send Mr Chalmers back to gaol after he has been in the community with the support of his mother and where his medical conditions have been, it would seem, properly treated. But it is necessary to do so, particularly given the gravity of Mr Chalmers’ original offending. It is to be noted that the maximum penalty for offences of this type is 14 years imprisonment. That is a good indication of the seriousness with which parliament believes Judges should treat offences of this type.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years and a head sentence of four years to commence today 30 January 2015. The non-parole period will expire on 29 January 2017 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	The backup charge on the 166 certificate is dismissed.

		14 May 2015",2015-01-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2703987,Crespin v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 24,"Judgment


	
	These are reasons for the rulings I made on 30 January 2015 in a separate trial pursuant to r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) as to the imputations pleaded, and pursuant to UCPR r 14.28 in relation to the particulars and pleadings in the statement of claim.
	
	
	The matters complained of were published as a television programme, followed by an essentially identical publication on the Internet website. As to the Today Tonight broadcast of 12 November 2013 (“the television broadcast”), the following imputations are pleaded to have been conveyed and defamatory of the plaintiffs in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim (see Annexure A):
	


(a) The First Plaintiff failed to honour an agreement to buy Karyn Zerkel’s house (lines 1,2, 12, 18-31)

(b) The First Plaintiff is a callous person (6-8, 74-75).

(c) The First Plaintiff reneged on her contractual obligations to pay Karyn Zerkel $209,000 for her house by the Tamar River but continued to live in it at Karyn’s expense and while Karyn fell further and further behind with her mortgages (37-55).

(d) The First Plaintiff swindled Karyn Zerkel (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(e) The First Plaintiff is a thief who stole Karyn Zerkel’s home (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(f) The First Plaintiff conned Karyn Zerkel out of her house (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(g) The First Plaintiff is a cheat (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(h) The First Plaintiff falsely accused the Channel Seven reporter of trespassing (66- 67).

(i) The First Plaintiff is a ratbag (77).

(j) The First Plaintiff illegally squats and occupies a house which she does not own and refuses to pay rent (2-77).

(k) The Second Plaintiff hijacked a beautiful waterside property after failing to honour an agreement to buy it (2, 4-8, 22-24, 29-30, 37-39, 41-63, 68-75, 112-113).

(l) The Second Plaintiff is a callous person (6-8, 74-75).

(m) The Second Plaintiff reneged on his contractual obligations to pay Karyn Zerkel $209,000 for her house by the Tamar River but continued to live in it at Karyn’s expense and while Karyn fell further and further behind with her mortgages (37-55).

(n) The Second Plaintiff swindled Karyn Zerkel (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(o) The Second Plaintiff is a thief who stole Karyn Zerkel’s home (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(p) The Second Plaintiff conned Karyn Zerkel out of her house (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(q) The Second Plaintiff is a cheat (1, 2, 12, 18-31).

(r) The Second Plaintiff illegally squats and occupies a house which he does not own and refuses to pay rent (2-77).


	
	Apart from line differences, the imputations pleaded to arise from the website publication are the same (and are set out at paragraph 7 of the statement of claim). The text of both these publications is set out as a schedule to this judgment.
	
	
	A further series of “promotion” publications (the text for which is not provided, although imputations are pleaded) is set out in paragraphs 8 – 9 of the statement of claim. These claims, which cannot be the subject of rulings today because the text of each of the matters complained of has not been set out, are dealt with in more detail below.
	


The relevant principles


	
	I note the principles relevant to the court’s task in determining a capacity objection as a separate question, as well as on a strike out application under r 14.28 UCPR.
	
	
	The principles for determining objections to capacity are explained in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 at [6], Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 and Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135] – [136], where the court held that the determination of capacity is an issue of generosity and not of parsimony, as well as being a “matter of impression … the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant” (citing Berezovsky v Forbes [2001] EWCA Civ 1251 at [16]).
	
	
	Where the basis of the objection is one of form, the requirement is that the imputation must specify the act or condition attributed to the plaintiff by the matter complained of with sufficient clarity to enable the defendants to know the case they have to meet: Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135; Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20].
	
	
	The imputations the subject of challenge can be dealt with in groups, as they are asserted to arise in both the publications the subject of these rulings, and in respect to each of the two plaintiffs.
	


Imputations 5(b), 5(l), 7(b) and 7(l) – “callous person”


	
	The defendants submit that this imputation is defective in form because the use of the words “callous person” in the imputation is “insufficiently precise” (letter from Johnson Winter & Slattery dated 26 November 2014).
	
	
	Imputations using the words “callous” or “callousness” have been pleaded in many other defamation cases without challenge (see, for example, Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1380). In Visscher v Maritime Union of Australia (No 6) [2014] NSWSC 350 at [194] Beech-Jones J considered, but did not deal with, a submission that an imputation of “callous disregard” was not conveyed because the conduct in question did not rise to that standard. However, that is not the submission here. The defendants do not challenge the capacity of the plaintiffs’ attitude to the homeowner’s predicament (which, in the first plaintiff’s case, included laughing about it) to give rise to an imputation of conduct of this kind; the complaint is that the word “callous” itself is too vague and imprecise in meaning to be used in the imputations.
	
	
	The nature of the imprecision of “callous” was unexplained. I was not provided with a dictionary definition or any other information, such as philological or linguistic analysis or theory, to support the submission of imprecision.
	
	
	An imputation of being callous must be viewed in the context of the matter complained of. In the present case, the publication refers to the course of conduct of both the plaintiffs, and their asserted disregard for the distress of the homeowner (see in particular lines 88 – 113). I am satisfied that the use of the word “callous” in that context is not defective in form.
	
	
	One of the submissions made by the defendants was that they were uncertain what the case to meet on this imputation would be, particularly in relation to the second plaintiff. This final portion of the matter complained of refers to the conduct of both plaintiffs, and while the second plaintiff is not shown laughing, unlike the first defendant, I am satisfied that there is sufficient for such an imputation to go to the jury, although the capacity issue for the second plaintiff is “borderline” (Coleman v John Fairfax Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 564 at [9] per Levine J).
	
	
	The word “callous” is thus neither ambiguous nor uncertain in meaning, and the imputation in question is capable of being conveyed in relation to both plaintiffs. These imputations will go to the jury.
	


Imputations 5(d), 5 (n), 7(d) and 7(n); Imputations 5 (e), 5 (o), 7(e) and 7(o); Imputations 5(f), 5(p), 7(f) and 7(p); Imputations 5(g), 5(q), 7(g) and 7(q)


	
	These imputations use a variety of terms (“swindled”, “thief”, “conned”, “cheat”), in imputations of act and condition, in relation to each of the plaintiffs. These words appear to have been drawn at random from a thesaurus for the purpose of ascribing every kind of act of dishonesty attributable to the plaintiffs’ conduct. The problem is whether they differ in substance and, if so, whether the presence or absence of a particular element means that one or more should be pleaded as fallbacks to the others.
	
	
	Both parties, despite noting the warnings of the Court of Appeal in Singleton v Ffrench & Ors (1986) 5 NSWLR 425 concerning the taking of an excessively legalistic approach, addressed me as to the elements of the relevant elements in the criminal offences of swindling, theft, cheating and being a conman. The plaintiffs submitted that the difference between the imputations of “swindled” and “con” is that one is asserted to contain a mental element that the other lacks. Thus, “swindle” (for example, a business swindle) does not require the additional element of abuse of confidence and personal trickery that is imparted by the word “con” (which word is derived from “confidence”, according to the extract from the Macquarie Dictionary handed up by the defendants’ counsel). The defendants submitted that none of these imputations were conveyed and that if they were, they did not differ in substance.
	
	
	The first problem is that the ordinary reasonable reader may not be alive to such fine legal nuances between these words. The second problem is that, if “swindle” and “con” do have the different meanings submitted by the plaintiffs, they cannot both arise, as the presence or absence of the element of confidence means that one or the other must capture the sting.
	
	
	I am satisfied, on the low bar applicable to capacity arguments, that imputations of “swindle” and “con” arise, but I accept the defendants’ submission that they cannot both arise if one involves a mental element of what Mr Rasmussen called a “breach of confidence” and the other does not. The imputations containing these meanings should therefore be pleaded as alternatives or as a fallback to each other.
	
	
	The imputations of condition (as opposed to acts) may similarly need to be pleaded as alternatives. In their present form, the imputations of being a “cheat” and a “thief” do not reflect these, and the use of these other terms will add to the confusion at trial.
	
	
	I have struck out these imputations with leave to replead to enable these imputations to be reformulated. If the repleaded imputations are of being a swindler and a conman (or conwoman), in order to fit in with the acts pleaded, they should similarly be pleaded in the alternative.
	


Imputations 5(h) and 7(h) – “falsely”


	
	During argument the plaintiffs were granted leave to amend to plead “hypocritically” in place of “falsely”.
	
	
	Objections to imputations 5(j), 5(r), 7(j) and 7(r) were withdrawn.
	


Imputations 5(i) and 7(i) – “ratbag”


	
	The word “ratbag”, described in Merriam’s Online Dictionary as a “chiefly Australian” word, means a “despicable person”, according to dictionary definitions, including Wiktionary. Use of the word is also helpfully reviewed in the Sydney Morning Herald (Damien Murphy, “Death of the Ratbag”, 23 April 2005). As these dictionary definitions and the Sydney Morning Herald note, “ratbag” is a word capable of being used in a non-pejorative and/or humorous sense, much like the similarly Australian slang word “bludger”.
	
	
	The defendants submit that the word “ratbag” is “insufficiently precise”, and their submissions appear to hint that “ratbag” is impermissible as vulgar abuse as well as impermissible in form. As “ratbag” has never been the subject of challenge in an imputations ruling, I have been guided by other courts’ determination of what those courts have described as “Australian slang” words such as “rort”, “bludger” and “conman”.
	
	
	“Rort” is commonly used in imputations. In Gibson v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2007] NSWCA 284 the NSW Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal in relation to an imputation involving the word “rort”. The issue there was not the form of the imputation, but the fact that the jury asked for a dictionary definition of the word. McClellan CJ at CL noted the “Australian slang” nature of the word at [9].
	
	
	The use of “bludger” in an imputation is similarly accepted as unobjectionable. An imputation that the plaintiff was a bludger was permitted to go to the jury by Levine J in Laundy v Bourne (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 17 April 1998), and again in Scott v Jones & Anor [2002] NSWSC 210 at [24]. It is of interest to note that, in the jury trial in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd, the imputation “the plaintiff is a bludger” (which went without objection to the jury) was subsequently found by the jury to be conveyed, but not defamatory: Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 244 at [42] and [116]; Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd (No 4) [2012] NSWDC 12 at [246]. (As to the defendants’ ability to meet the necessary particulars of justification for such a term, see Dent v Macquarie Radio Network Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 186 at [19] – [20].) I also note the helpful judgment of Levine J in Young v Munro (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 12 May 1995), rejecting similar complaints about “conman”, “scam” and “racket”. “Ratbag” is similarly a word of real meaning, as well as being capable (like “bludger”) of non-defamatory use, and should not therefore be regarded as a term of vulgar abuse.
	
	
	Some decisions concerning the use of slang in imputations appear to be in conflict. For example, in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 20, Simpson J refused to permit the plaintiff to use the slang word “grub” in an imputation. Her Honour relied upon Bass v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 343 at [5] – [6], where the word “shonky” had been permitted to go to the jury. (I note, however, that while Hunt A-JA expressed concern at the use of this word, on the basis that it had been drawn from the matter complained rather than that it was slang, the fact remains that the case went to the jury with this imputation without incident or difficulty, and that its use did not impede the findings on appeal.)
	
	
	However, an explanation of these apparently different results may be that courts have avoided a “one size fits all” approach to slang words. Viewed in this context, the word “grub” is a pejorative slang word, of the same kind as “scumbag”, a word that, although superficially similar to “ratbag”, can only connote abuse. In Polias v Ryall [2013] NSWSC 1267 McCallum J refused to permit the pleading of any imputation that the plaintiff was a “scumbag”, where the matter complained of was a Facebook posting (“Scumbags gonna scum”), on the basis that it was vulgar abuse (at [30] – [32]).
	
	
	Although no submission that “ratbag” is vulgar abuse was put to me (or, for that matter, to Simpson J in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (No 2)  when considering “grub”), I am satisfied that this is a word which has, with the passage of time, come into such wide public usage as to have general acceptance and even (as some dictionaries, and the Sydney Morning Herald, both note) to be capable of use in a non-pejorative way.
	
	
	Everything depends upon the context in which the word is used; whether “ratbag” could amount to vulgar abuse, or is defamatory, would depend upon the rest of the publication, as was the case in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd. Unlike Polias v Ryall, where the context was the highly informal language of social media, the matters complained of in these proceedings relate the story of a media investigative report. Content (namely the content of the matter complained of) explains and shapes form (namely the word used in the imputation).
	
	
	The defendants next submit that the use of a word from the matter complained of, while permissible in some circumstances, does not encapsulate the sting of the libel (see the cases discussed in Waller v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 611).
	
	
	The use, in an imputation, of a word from the matter complained of may be permitted in appropriate cases: Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213; John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541 at [52] – [54]. The question is whether the use of a word from the publication is appropriate to encapsulate the sting of the libel. Should the plaintiffs be obliged to reformulate the word “ratbag” in order to identify the condition pleaded, or is this an example of an imputation that “X is disgusting” (Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 137)?
	
	
	In this particular context, the defamatory sting of “ratbag” is clear. The import of the word, in the context of each of the matters complained of, is that persons who have behaved in this way are despicable. As the context is clear, the plaintiffs ought not to be obliged to provide what Simpson J in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (No 2) at [23] called a “translation” of the word into proper English. Additionally, the term “ratbag” is widely understood in the general community, whereas the word “grub”, used in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (No 2), would not have had a similarly widely understood meaning.
	
	
	Does “ratbag” differ in substance from an imputation of being “callous”? Although this challenge was not raised by the defendants, I am of the view that there is sufficient difference in meaning for both imputations to go to the jury, and note similar findings in Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2010] NSWDC 244 at [116], where imputations of “leech” and “bludger”, despite their similarity, were allowed to go to the jury. Having regard to the Court of Appeal’s warning that imputations should be permitted on a generous, rather than a parsimonious, basis, I shall permit the plaintiffs to plead both imputations.
	
	
	Additionally, the defendants submit that only the first plaintiff is referred to as a “ratbag”, and she is called “a bit of a ratbag”, rather than a “ratbag”, and the allegation is restricted to the first plaintiff.
	
	
	However, lines 88 – 113 contain further claims about the plaintiffs’ conduct towards Ms Zerkel, which make it clear that Ms Zerkel is actually worse off than the victim of the other house purchase “scam” outlined in the matters complained of. That portion of the matter complained of, which follows the story about other persons clearly identified as ratbags, clearly suggests that the conduct of both plaintiffs has led to a worse result. Reasonable minds may differ as to whether that relates to both plaintiffs, and whether this means that one or both of them is a ratbag or only “a bit of a ratbag”.
	
	
	These imputations will accordingly go to the jury in relation to each of the plaintiffs.
	


Imputations 5(k) and 7(k)


	
	The name of the segment and the opening words both specifically use the word “hijack”. The meaning is clear. Notwithstanding the undesirability of a plaintiff merely repeating the words of the matter complained of, this is a clear example of a sting that the plaintiffs ought not to be obliged to parse and analyse in order to identify a less colourful or more accurate term. It is clear from the context that the word is a metaphor, used for its alliterative effect, and not a literal accusation of hijacking.
	
	
	I am puzzled as to why this imputation is attributed only to the second defendant, while the less dramatic imputation (a) (failing to honour an agreement) is pleaded for the first plaintiff, rather than an imputation in the form of 5(k) and 7(k) – or vice versa. The use of these variants tends to confirm that these imputations have not been drafted with care, and may warrant further attention in the redrafted statement of claim.
	
	
	These imputations will go to the jury for each of the plaintiffs.
	


Inadequate particulars of publication


	
	In paragraphs 8 and 9 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs assert that between 7 and 12 November 2013 the defendants published “multiple times defamatory promotions” for the plaintiffs “referred to in paragraph 4 above”. This is followed by the pleading of imputations that each of the plaintiffs is a swindler, a thief and a cheat.
	
	
	These imputations were not the subject of challenge, as the text of the promotions was not included. The additional problem of a plaintiff pleading one set of imputations from “multiple” imputations has thus not been addressed. The unsatisfactory nature of this pleading is such that the defendants currently seek only an order striking out this paragraph and its replacement with the text of these promotions, followed by imputations for each. Alternatively, if the promotions are relied upon for damages only, that must be specified.
	
	
	The problems caused by plaintiffs who refer to additional publications in this way without identifying whether these additional publications are relied upon in relation to liability, or for damages only, are starkly illustrated by the confusion caused in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231. The revised pleading must set out full particulars of these publications, including the date, content and imputations, and identify with clarity whether these publications are relied upon in relation to liability or for damages only – an issue the plaintiff failed to clarify in the s 7A jury trial before Kirby J in Habib v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd.
	


Internet particulars


	
	Although only noted in passing, and not the subject of orders, I draw the attention of the plaintiffs, when repleading the statement of claim, to the need for Internet publications to include particulars of downloading.
	


The claim for “general actual and special damages”


	
	The bringing of fanciful or unparticularised claims for special damages in defamation proceedings is viewed seriously by the court: Lighthouse Forward Planning Pty Ltd v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2014] QSC 217 at [42]–[49]. Prolonged failure to provide adequate particulars may result in the claim being dismissed: McGrane v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2012] QSC 133; Miller v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012] EWHC 3721 (QB).
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen submitted that these were early days for the litigation, and the plaintiffs needed time to put these particulars together. In due course an outline of the particulars in question could be provided.
	
	
	I do not accept this submission. The broadcast was published on 12 November 2013, and any claim for damages following such a broadcast (this being the most likely source) should be known to the plaintiffs by early 2015. The nature of any such loss is not immediately apparent from the pleading, and the defendants are entitled to know the case they are to meet.
	


Costs


	
	Although the plaintiffs were more successful than the defendant in relation to the imputations, three factors are of particular relevance as to costs.
	
	
	The first is that the pleading of the “multiple” defamatory publications in paragraphs 8 – 9 and the failure to provide particulars of “general actual and special damages” (whatever that term may mean) fall well short of the standard of pleadings to be expected in a specialist list. The second is that the objections raised by Johnson Winter & Slattery in their correspondence contained many sensible proposals, and should have resulted in a redrafted statement of claim, particularly in relation to paragraphs 8 – 9 and the damages claim. The third is that the letter in response to Johnson Winter & Slattery, which says little more than “we disagree” in relation to the imputations, and that the particulars of damages will be supplied “prior to the trial”, was of no assistance to me in the determination of the issues in dispute.
	
	
	Taking the above into account, the appropriate order is that each party should pay their own costs.
	


Orders


	
	Defendants’ objection to imputations 5(b), 5(l), 7(b) and 7(l) on the basis of form (“callous person”) dismissed; these imputations will go to the jury.
	
	
	Imputations 5(d) (“conned”) and 5(f) (“swindled”), and similarly 7(d) and 7(f), are to be pleaded as alternatives.
	
	
	Imputations 5(g) and 7(g) are struck out with leave to replead.
	
	
	Imputations 5(e) and 7(e) are struck out with leave to replead.
	
	
	Imputations 5(h) and 7(h) are struck out with leave to replead by replacing “falsely” with “hypocritically”.
	
	
	Imputations 5(i) and 7(i) will go to the jury.
	
	
	Imputations 5(j), 5(r), 7(j) and 7(r) will go to the jury (objections withdrawn).
	
	
	Imputations 5(k) and 7(k) will go to the jury.
	
	
	Require the plaintiffs in the redrafted statement of claim to include full particulars of the “multiple times” promotions for Today Tonight made between 7 and 12 November 2013.
	
	
	Any claim for “actual or special damages” must be fully particularised in the amended statement of claim.
	
	
	Amended Statement of Claim in 21 days.
	
	
	Each party pay their or its own costs.
	
	
	Matter stood over to Thursday 26 February 2015 at 2:00pm.

Squatting nightmare on Sunset Boulevard

One woman’s idyllic sleepy hamlet has turned into a nightmare after a move turned sour.



Karyn Zerkel has had a tough few years.

First there was the car accident - run off the road by a log truck. Facing years of rehab, she was forced to leave her idyllic Tasmanian hideaway in the sleepy hamlet Of Clarence Point.

She put it on the market and bought a tiny bungalow in Melbourne.

More stories from Today Tonight

However, that pales into insignificance compared to the moment Karyn befriended Liz Crispin.

“We met walking on the beach and we got to know each other, with the dogs together and that sort of thing; had the odd coffee together and they asked me out for dinner s couple of times,” Karyn said.

After two failed attempts to sell the house, Liz convinced Karyn to sell it to her and partner, Rob Franklin and that they agreed a price of $255,000.

“A couple of nights later they called and said how would you feel if we wanted to buy your house and so I said that would be perfect”

Karen says Liz even arranged to draw up a contract of sale.

“Over a period of two years they would be paying monthly into two accounts that 1 have and at the end of that time, pay a lump sum to finalise the agreement, the sale.”

“They owed me $209,000 and ft was due to he paid in March, when the contract finalized.”

But that’s when things turned sour. Instead of settling up, Liz and Rob stopped paying.

For the past eight months they've been sitting pretty, squatting by the beautiful Tamar River on the aptly-named Sunset Boulevard.

With their dogs and sports car, they are living it up at Karyn’s expense as she falls further and further behind with both mortgages.

She now fears they will repossess her house.

This one and that one; I mean at the moment, I actually don't own either of them,” Karyn said.

Karyn's son Ross is deaf and has been caring for his mum since the accident.

He says he feels like the situation is kicking her when she's down.

“I just want to get them out of there. I just want to get rid of them, full stop, so we can actually try and move ahead with our life and sell the house, and do it the way that mum wants to.”

Karyn's lawyer is desperately trying to negotiate a settlement.

1MEAGHER JA: I agree with Simpson J.

2SIMPSON J: On 20 September 2012, in the Children's Court at Parramatta, the applicant entered pleas of guilty to three charges. The charges were:


murder (of AG) (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 18); 
aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (Crimes Act, s 113(2)); 
intimidation (Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW), s 13(1)).

The applicant was committed for sentence to the Supreme Court of NSW, where he adhered to his pleas of guilty.

3Pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") the applicant asked that a further offence (of using a postal service to threaten or cause harm) identified on a Form 1 be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing.

4The maximum sentences applicable to the offences on the indictment are as follows:


murder: imprisonment for life; 
aggravated break and enter with intent: imprisonment for 14 years; 
intimidation: imprisonment for 5 years.

5In March 2013 Corrie Loveridge was tried on indictment in the Supreme Court for the murder of AG. On 12 April 2013 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Subsequently, Loveridge entered pleas of guilty to: 


a charge of specially aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence; 
an associated charge of robbery with the infliction of grievous bodily harm; 
a separate charge of recruiting a 15 year old child to procure a third person to inflict actual bodily harm on BB; and 
a charge of attempting to dissuade two witnesses from giving evidence. 

The offence of murder, and the offence of specially aggravated break and enter with intent, were committed jointly with the applicant. The offence of robbery was committed in the course of the break and enter although the applicant was not charged with that offence. The other offences were not associated with the applicant.

6The specially aggravated form of the break and enter offence to which Loveridge pleaded guilty carries a maximum term of imprisonment for 25 years, and, pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The robbery offence also carries a maximum term of imprisonment for 25 years.

7On 1 November 2013 Adams J imposed sentence on each offender. Pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, he imposed on each an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 45 years, with a non-parole period of 30 years. In accordance with s 53A(2)(b) he specified the ""indicative"" sentences that he would have imposed had separate sentences (instead of aggregate sentences) been imposed in respect of the individual offences.

8In respect of the applicant, the indicative sentences were:


murder: imprisonment for 45 years, with a non-parole period of 30 years; 
aggravated break, enter and steal: imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months; 
intimidation (taking into account the Form 1 offence): imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years.

9In respect of Loveridge, the indicative sentences were:


murder: imprisonment for 45 years, with a non-parole period of 30 years; 
specially aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence: imprisonment for 10 years, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months; 
robbery in company with the infliction of grievous bodily harm: imprisonment for 1 year and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months; 
recruiting a child to commit crime: imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years; 
influencing witnesses: imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years.

10The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the aggregate sentence imposed upon him. The grounds on which he seeks to rely are relatively confined. However, it is necessary to set out the nature of the offences to which he pleaded guilty.

Facts 

11The facts of the offences were put before Adams J in a Statement of Agreed Facts. It is convenient to recount them in chronological order.

(i) aggravated break and enter with intent

12During the evening of Tuesday 30 November 2010, the applicant and Loveridge were together, with others, in a house in Tobruk Street, North St Marys. They consumed alcohol, crystal amphetamine (commonly known as Ice) and marijuana. The applicant became agitated and stated his intention to ""fucken kill cunts"".

13At 1.25am on Wednesday, 1 December, the applicant and Loveridge agreed to break into a house at North St Marys. The house was occupied by Ms Elena Parrelli who was then aged 87 years, and was the grandmother of a friend of Loveridge. Loveridge was armed with a knife. The two offenders jumped over the back fence, opened the (closed but unlocked) rear door and entered the house. They began to search for items to steal. Ms Parrelli, who had been asleep but was disturbed by the noise, awoke and encountered the offenders. She was using a walking stick. Loveridge used the walking stick to hit her, more than once, over her head and body. Sufficient force was used to break the walking stick. Ms Parrelli was knocked to the floor. 

14The offenders continued to search the house. They screamed abuse at Ms Parrelli, threatening to do her serious injury. They stole a wrist watch and a television set, property to the value of about $1500.

15Ms Parrelli was taken to hospital, where she remained an inpatient for 22 days. She suffered injuries to her right forehead, the back of the head, the chest, the right eye and the left elbow.

16The circumstance of aggravation alleged against the applicant was that actual bodily harm was inflicted upon Ms Parrelli. The offence to which Loveridge pleaded guilty was the specially aggravated form of the offence. The circumstance of special aggravation was that he intentionally inflicted grievous bodily harm on Ms Parrelli.

(ii) murder of AG

17After the offence concerning Ms Parrelli, the offenders returned to the Tobruk Street address with the stolen property. At about 2.50am they left that house. Each was then armed with a kitchen knife.

18At about 3.15am they encountered AG, aged 17, who was walking with his brother DG and step-brother CM in Maple Road, St Marys. The offenders followed the three boys, shouting at them. They asked the time. CM said that he did not know the time. The applicant produced the knife he was carrying, which he swung towards the throat of CM. CM shouted to his brothers to get out of the way. Before AG could escape, Loveridge punched him and knocked him to the ground. Both offenders stabbed AG repeatedly, in the chest, back, head, neck, arms and groin. One of them cut his right Achilles tendon. Both also kicked him. The two offenders then walked away, but very shortly after returned. AG was still lying in the gutter. One of the offenders said ""Let's finish the dog"". They kicked AG, and again left.

19Ambulance and police attended, but AG died en route to the hospital. Post mortem examination showed at least 40 separate stab wounds, and cuts and bruising, as well as the cut to the Achilles tendon.

20The two offenders returned to the Tobruk Street premises. Both told the occupants of the premises that they had stabbed AG. Loveridge told of cutting his Achilles tendon. Later on the same day, both again spoke, to family members, of what they had done. The applicant said that he observed that AG was still moving:

""So I stabbed him in the neck and the back of the head and his dick.""

21The applicant was arrested on 16 November, and was conveyed to Green Valley Police Station, where he was interviewed. The interview was electronically recorded. He made admissions, and stated that he had no remorse for his conduct, and would do it again. He declined to elaborate on the details of the offences, and declined to identify his co-offender.

22In January 2011 the applicant told an officer of Corrective Services that he had been angry with his former partner (to whom I will refer as ""TM""), but did not wish to hurt her. He said that he had contemplated robbing a service station, but instead took out his aggression on AG, whom he had encountered by chance.

23From time to time the applicant has made other statements that signify his attitude to the murder. He has repeated that he does not regret ""killing the cunt"", and that he did so because he wanted to kill his former partner. In this context, he has said:

""'Cause I wanted to kill [TM] ... I just snapped and ... I thought they were white fellas, I wanted to hurt some cunt.""

24In letters written from prison he has given some small indication of remorse, saying, for example:

""I did kill an innocent person and I got to live with it for the rest of my life.""

He has also minimised the role he played.

(iii) intimidation

25The applicant was arrested on 16 December 2010 and refused bail. On 4 January 2011 the applicant telephoned his former girlfriend, TM. TM is the mother of the applicant's child. The relationship came to an end in 2010. In the telephone call of 4 January, the applicant accused TM of having sexual relations with other people. He said:

""I should have killed you, you cunt, T[-] I should have killed you ... I blame you for what I'm in here for, cunt, cause I was going to kill you, you motherfucker, I was going to kill you cunt ... I'll kill you, T[-] I promise I'll kill you.""

The applicant repeated this threat a number of times and told TM that, despite being in custody, he could still ""get her"". 

The applicant's personal circumstances

26The applicant was born in May 1993. He was 17 years of age at the time of the offences. He was 20 at sentencing.

27A great deal of material was placed before Adams J with respect to the applicant's personal history and circumstances. This included a confidential background report prepared on behalf of the Office of Juvenile Justice for the purposes of sentencing; a Pre-Sentence Report prepared on behalf of the Probation and Parole Service earlier in 2013; and extracts from the file held in the Department of Community Services with respect to the applicant and his family. This included, for example, psychologists' reports dating back as far as 2001. 

28The material disclosed a tragic history of abuse and neglect. The applicant is one of two siblings born to his parents, who are of Aboriginal heritage. His mother was 12 years of age when she gave birth to the applicant's older sister, 15 when the applicant was born. All members of the family have had extensive contact with the criminal justice system. From an early age he was exposed to neglect, physical abuse, exposure to parental heroin abuse and domestic violence. At about the age of 18 months he was first removed from his mother's care and placed in foster care. Since then he has had about 12 different placements, sometimes with extended family members and foster carers. 

29He has had virtually no education, having been enrolled in several different schools. He was twice referred to special schools catering for students with challenging behaviour. At all schools, his attendance was low. He truanted frequently. 

30He himself has become involved, from an early age, in drug and alcohol abuse. By the age of 11 he had accumulated a significant criminal record. His criminal record commenced in 2006 when he was found guilty in the Children's Court of robbery in company and various other offences. Since then he has been found guilty of various offences, including break, enter and steal and assault and affray. His past criminal history, however, bears no comparison to the present set of offences (including the aggravated break and enter).

The Remarks on Sentence

31Adams J recorded the agreed facts of the offences. He described the injuries to AG as ""horrific"". He said:

""13 ... There were 12 wounds including nine stab wounds to his back, of which six were potentially fatal; nine wounds to his right arm or hand, including two stab wounds; an incised wound to the left forearm; four stab wounds to the left upper leg near the groin area, including the scrotum; two wounds to the left upper leg posterior aspect; four wounds to the right leg including deep incised wounds severing the Achilles tendon, involving more than one stroke, being more like 'a sawing action'; and two wounds to the anterior chest wall including one through the heart which was fatal and one puncture wound possibly from medical intervention. There were four wounds to the head, including one stab wound which, although it was superficial because it was stopped by the skull, had been applied with substantial force resulting in a fracture. At the site of one incised wound a zigzag pattern was seen, such as might have come from the sole of a shoe. There were other small abrasions and scratches. The deceased suffered six wounds to the neck, of which one was a stab wound and two parallel horizontal superficial incised wounds with the appearance of having been inflicted in an attempt to cut the throat, made in quick succession while the head and neck were stationary.""

32As a result of the distribution of wounds, Adams J concluded that the two offenders were more or less equally involved. His Honour went on to say:

""14 ... One of the most troubling inferences that must be drawn from the large number of peripheral wounds is that, whilst it was their intention to kill the deceased, they wished also to torture him by the infliction of a maximum degree of pain. It is for this reason that I described the attack as sadistic. It was not a frenzied attack: the cutting of the Achilles tendon, the attempts to cut the throat and the position of the wounds, demonstrate this. It must have caused excruciating pain.""

33Adams J found the murder to be ""in the category of most serious cases"", and the break and enter to be ""a very serious example of this offence"". He noted that Ms Parrelli's physical injuries ultimately healed although the emotional trauma would remain with her for the rest of her life. 

34He was of the opinion that the applicant did not feel any remorse in respect of any of the offences. He considered that his pleas of guilty, far from being an expression of remorse, were a recognition of the inevitability of conviction. 

35He declined to allow any reduction in sentence attributable to the plea of guilty to the murder offence. He took that course because he considered that the protection of the public so required. In respect of the other offences he allowed a reduction of 25 per cent in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.

36His Honour proceeded to impose the sentences outlined above.

The grounds of appeal

37The proposed grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows:

""1. The Sentencing Judge erred in finding that the applicant intended to torture the deceased.

2. The Sentencing Judge erred in the assessment of the seriousness of the offence of murder.

3. The Sentencing Judge erred in giving no discount for the utilitarian plea of guilty in respect of the offence of murder.

4. The applicant has a legitimate grievance arising from the fact that the same aggregate sentence was imposed on his co-offender.""

Grounds 1 and 2: the objective seriousness of the offence of murder

38In written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant, it was acknowledged that the second ground depended upon the first: that is, it was necessary for the applicant to show that the inference explicitly drawn by Adams J that the offenders wished to ""torture [AG] by the infliction of the maximum degree of pain"" (para [14]) was not open to him on the evidence.

39The focus of the argument was on the use of the word ""torture"". In oral argument, senior counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that ""torture"" may be taken to be the intentional infliction of pain. The focus on the word ""torture"" is apt to deflect attention away from what Adams J meant, and what he said. It is clear in the context of para [14] that Adams J used the word in the sense mentioned above - the intentional infliction of pain.

40In the circumstances of this offence, as recounted above, I find it impossible to conceive how such an observation could be said to be other than open upon the evidence. The sheer number of stab wounds, inflicted by two individuals acting together, and the severing of the Achilles tendon, make such a finding inevitable. The inference is strengthened by the circumstance that the two offenders briefly left the scene, before returning with the expressed intention of ""finish[ing] the dog"". This would suggest that initially they were indifferent to whether or not they had killed AG. Other than killing, the only possible intention that could accompany the sustained attack on AG was an intention to inflict very severe injury, and pain, upon him. 

41It appears from para [14] that Adams J considered that an attack carried out with an intention to torture, and cause a maximum degree of pain, was distinguishable, in level of culpability, from an attack carried out in a ""frenzy"".

42In written submissions, senior counsel for the applicant posed, as an alternative to the conclusion of Adams J, the possibility that one or both of the offenders ""inflicted multiple stab wounds in a frenzy"". This was specifically rejected by Adams J, who considered that the cutting of the Achilles tendon, and attempts to cut AG's throat, and the position of the wounds, demonstrated otherwise. I do not see that the two are mutually exclusive. Indeed, it seems to me that a frenzied attack would carry with it the intention of inflicting maximum pain. 

43In any event, I see no advantage to the applicant in the argument. Apart from the two being not inconsistent, I find it difficult to see how a killing carried out in a ""frenzy"" is less objectively serious than a killing carried out with the intention of inflicting maximum pain. Whether the killing was carried out as a result of an intention to inflict maximum pain, or in a ""frenzy"", makes no difference to the assessment of objective seriousness. The challenged finding was open to his Honour, as was the categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offence. Even if the finding that the applicant wished to torture AG was not open, the alternative that the killing was carried out in a ""frenzied attack"" yields the same result in terms of objective gravity.

44However, the argument then took a somewhat different turn. In response to the applicant's written submissions, the Crown referred to a long line of authority (indeed, going back to 1913) that consistently holds that, in criminal proceedings, findings of fact made by a judge at first instance are binding on the appellate court unless they come within certain well established parameters: see, for example R v Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50; R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397. These decisions are based on s 5 and s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), which confers appellate jurisdiction on this Court (see below). The Crown's submissions prompted senior counsel for the applicant to issue a broadly expressed challenge to those longstanding decisions. He challenged the proposition that this Court is properly a ""court of error"", citing the capacity of this Court (in limited circumstances) to admit fresh evidence, and the capacity to interfere in a sentence (otherwise unassailable) where disparity in the subsequent sentence of a co-offender is demonstrated: Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376. In oral argument the bold and novel proposition was put that this Court should review the findings of fact of Adams J by taking the approach stated in Warren v Coombes [1979] HCA 9; 142 CLR 531 and Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118. He accepted that there was no authority for this rather startling proposition. Put succinctly, those decisions (both in the context of appeals in civil cases) establish that an appellate court may (or even must) make its own assessment of the facts of a case.

45Although this was, as I have characterised it, a bold, novel and startling proposition, proposing a major departure from established authority and practice, the argument put in support was pithy. It relied essentially upon observations made (in each case obiter) in two cases in this Court by Basten JA: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG [2010] NSWCCA 222; 220 A Crim R 19 and Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284. I will come to these observations in due course.

46In the meantime, notwithstanding the absence of comprehensive argument to support the contention that this Court ought to abandon a statutory construction that has stood for just over a century, it is necessary to deal with the argument.

The jurisdiction of this Court

47Jurisdiction to intervene in a sentence imposed on an offender derives from s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act. Section 5 relevantly provides:

""(1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court:
(a) ...
(b) ...
(c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person's conviction.""

48The scope of the appeal is to be found in s 6(3) of the same Act. Section 6(3) provides:

""(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""

49The Criminal Appeal Act came into effect on the date of assent, 16 April 1912. It established the Court of Criminal Appeal (""the Court""). Section 6(3) was then in the same terms as it now is (with one minor, irrelevant, variation). In 1913, the court dealt with an application for leave to appeal against a sentence: R v Skinner (1913) 13 SR (NSW) 280. The Chief Justice considered that, although the sentence imposed was a very severe one, it was unlikely that the sentencing judge had overlooked any relevant circumstance favourable to the applicant, and the Court would not be justified in interfering. Sly J was more expansive. His Honour said:

""The question of the sentence has given me a great deal of trouble, and I have given a great deal of thought and consideration to it. It appears to me a severe sentence, but before this Court can interfere they have to be satisfied that the learned Judge at the trial proceeded on some wrong principle or did not take into consideration some fact which he ought to have taken into consideration. The Judge at the trial was by far the best person to deal with the matter; he saw the accused in the witness box and how he gave his evidence; whether he glorified or not in his past misdeeds with regard to this girl, and, generally, his manner in the witness box, and it seems to me, on the principles his Honour the Chief Justice has mentioned, it would be impossible in this case for the Court to interfere. Considering the principles which have been pointed out, although I think it is a very severe sentence, and I do not think it is a sentence I would have passed myself, I do not think we would be justified in interfering with it."" (italics added)

Gordon J agreed. 

On one view, this was an unequivocal statement that, absent demonstrated error, the Court would not exercise its powers under s 6(3).

50On application for special leave to appeal to the High Court, the proposition, somewhat obliquely expressed by the Court, that before the Court would interfere in a sentencing decision, error must be established, was reinforced: Skinner v The King [1913] HCA 32; 16 CLR 336. Barton ACJ said:

""As to the second of those two points, of course the sentence is arrived at by the Judge at the trial under circumstances, many of which cannot be reproduced before the tribunal of appeal. He hears the witnesses giving their evidence, and also observes them while it is being given, and tested by cross-examination. He sees every change in their demeanour and conduct, and there are often circumstances of that kind that cannot very well appear in any mere report of the evidence. It follows that a Court of Criminal Appeal is not prone to interfere with the Judge's exercise of his discretion in apportioning the sentence, and will not interfere unless it is seen that the sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate. If the sentence is not merely arguably insufficient or excessive, but obviously so because, for instance, the Judge has acted on a wrong principle, or has clearly overlooked, or undervalued, or overestimated, or misunderstood, some salient feature of the evidence, the Court of Criminal Appeal will review the sentence; but, short of such reasons, I think it will not."" (pp 339-340, italics added) 

Isaacs J said:

""With regard to the sentence it was complained that the language of Sly J and Gordon J was not justified. The considerations stated by my brother Barton would appeal to one apart from any precedent. But the same view was taken in England before the New South Wales Parliament adopted the English Act, and was expressed almost in the words of those learned Judges ..."" 

His Honour quoted from English authority: 

""Of course if there was evidence that the Judge in passing sentence had proceeded on a wrong principle or given undue weight to some of the facts proved in evidence the Court would interfere; but it was not possible to allow appeals because members of this Court might have inflicted a different sentence more or less severe."" (R v Sidlow 24 TLR 572)

Isaacs J went on to say:

""That entirely bears out the language which is now pressed upon us as a misdirection."" (p 342)

51The proposition was not universally accepted. See, for example R v Gosper (1928) 45 WN (NSW) 165 where it was held that s 6(3) conferred on the Court ""unfettered judicial discretion"" as to the course it should take. That followed a similar view with respect to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act (inserted in 1924) in Whittaker v The King [1928] HCA 428; (1928) 41 CLR 230 (but it is worth reading the lengthy and contrary view of Isaacs J), and the views of Jordan CJ in R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554.

52I pass over the next half century and come to O'Donoghue. In a frequently cited passage, Hunt J (with whom Carruthers and Wood JJ agreed), said:

""It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this Court is not by way of rehearing. An appeal which is not by way of rehearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below ... Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this Court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge. The members of this Court may individually disagree with the findings which were made, but the Court cannot for that reason interfere with those findings. It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this Court can intervene in relation to a trial judge's findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice ..."" (p 401, internal citations omitted, italics added)

53It was the insistence that ""error"" must be shown before this Court will interfere in a sentence that attracted the applicant's challenge. However, as will appear below, the authorities he claims in support do not go to that point.

54Since O'Donoghue, the same principle has been re-stated on many occasions: for example, R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505; R v Aoun [2011] NSWCCA 284; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG [2010] NSWCCA 222; 220 A Crim R 19; Peters v R [2013] NSWCCA 324. In the interests of brevity, I have forborne to mention the other decisions identified by Johnson J in Aoun (at [35]) and Latham J in Peters (at [42]).

55The final nail in the coffin of any argument to the contrary is to be found in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 (a decision referred to in the applicant's argument in a different context) at [35]:

""The history of the provision [s 6(3)] is touched on in Lacey v A-G (Qld) [[2011] HCA 10; 242 CLR 573]. Notwithstanding the breadth of its language, it was settled at an early stage that the appellate court's authority to intervene is dependent upon demonstration of error."" (italics added)

The High Court cited its earlier decision in Skinner as authority.

56The two obiter passages in judgments of Basten JA on which the applicant founded his argument are in Aoun and JG. In Aoun, his Honour said:

""4 The statement by Hunt J in R v O'Donoghue ... was concerned with fact-finding by a trial judge in determining, on a voir dire, a dispute as to the admission of evidence. His Honour's succinct description of the nature of an error in respect of fact-finding is not to be treated as a comprehensive statement of the circumstances in which such error can arise. The scope of the appeal against conviction, provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1), is not limited to an error of law: any ground demonstrating that there has been a miscarriage of justice may suffice. The circumstances which can constitute such a ground are not to be constrained by the identification of common circumstances. Nor does it assist greatly to describe such grounds as forming 'the very narrow basis' upon which the court can intervene in relation to a finding of fact. Further, although it is undoubtedly helpful to be reminded that this court can only intervene in a case of 'error' and not in order to 'substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge', such timely reminders do not, in close cases, provide any useful criteria for locating the boundary between errors and differences of opinion."" (bold added, italics in original)

57Aoun was an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The bulk of para [4] and the substance of the argument contained therein, was directed to the scope of appeals against conviction. O'Donoghue involved a review of findings of fact following a voir dire with respect to the admissibility of evidence. Even a superficial reading of para [4] discloses that Basten JA does not question the proposition that demonstrated error is the foundation for the Court's jurisdiction to intervene in a sentence decision. As Latham J observed in Peters, what his Honour questioned was whether the list of circumstances identified by Hunt J in O'Donoghue as available to found the jurisdiction there under consideration was, or was intended to be, exhaustive. Although it is unnecessary in this case to decide, I would be of the view that it was not, and was not intended to be, exhaustive. For myself, I do not read Hunt J as suggesting that the circumstances he identifies as available to found the jurisdiction close the categories in which error in fact finding may be shown. It may be that error may be shown in other ways. What is essential is that error, properly so called, be demonstrated before this Court will interfere in a finding of fact. And it is not be overlooked that Hunt J's list of circumstances is to a large extent parallel with lists of circumstances that have in other cases been held to be available as a basis for interference in discretionary decisions: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. Generally, the language is similar to that used in the very early authorities on the proper role of this Court under the Criminal Appeal Act: see [49] - [50] above.

58In JG, Basten JA repeated his questioning of the completeness of Hunt J's list of factors that may give rise to ""error"". What Basten JA there said was specifically referable to conviction appeals. JG is even more remote from the present case than Aoun. It was concerned with an (interlocutory) appeal by the Crown under s 5(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act (with respect to the admissibility of evidence). Such an appeal had already been held (by Basten JA himself, with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) to be an appeal by way of rehearing: Norvenska v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 158. 

59Neither Aoun nor JG provides any support to the applicant's argument that it is open to this Court to review the finding of fact made by Adams J other than on established principles. Fundamental to those principles is that an error can be identified, either in the approach to the fact finding exercise, or in the principles applied. No such error has here been identified.

60The authorities that state the principles on which, it was submitted, this Court should review findings of fact by a sentencing judge are Warren v Coombes and Fox v Percy. As mentioned above, both are civil cases. Both are cases in which the operative legislation (relevant for present purposes) was s 75A of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), pursuant to which appeals are by way of rehearing. An issue, in particular in Fox v Percy, was the ""dichotomy"" between the appellate obligation to correct error, and appellate restraint in the interference with decisions properly committed to first instance judges. There is nothing, in either Warren v Coombes, or in Fox v Percy that could reasonably be extrapolated to decisions under s 5 or s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

61These conclusions have been drawn in the absence of full argument. No proper basis has been advanced for the proposed major departure from established authority and practice.

62I reject the proposition that this Court ought to review Adams J's finding of fact (made by inference from agreed facts) that the applicant wished to torture AG by the infliction of a maximum degree of pain. No error has been shown in that finding. I have already held that the finding was, on the evidence, open.

63It follows that I would reject Grounds 1 and 2.

Ground 3: plea of guilty

64Ground 3 alleges error in Adams J's decision to decline to give the applicant the benefit of a reduction in sentence attributable to his plea of guilty to the murder charge. Adams J gave reasons for that decision. He considered that the pleas were attributable to the recognition of the overwhelming strength of the Crown case, and inevitable conviction, rather than any remorse. Notwithstanding that, a reduction is ordinarily available in recognition of the utilitarian value of a guilty plea: R v Thomson; R v Houlton. It is not, however, in every case that such a reduction is to be allowed: Milat v R; Klein v R [2014] NSWCCA 29; special leave to appeal to the High Court refused: Milat v The Queen [2014] HCA Trans 205 (12 September 2014).

65A similar argument, in similar circumstances, was put in Milat, and rejected.

66During the hearing of the appeal, senior counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that, on the authority of Milat, Ground 3 must fail. I would accordingly reject Ground 3.

Ground 4: parity with the sentence imposed on Loveridge

67The applicant and Loveridge were sentenced identically. It was pointed out that there were some distinguishing features. One of these was the applicant's plea of guilty. That cannot survive the outcome of Ground 3. Other differentiating features were the ages of the two offenders: Loveridge was 18 years of age, the applicant a little under that age. This had some technical implications, for example that a standard non-parole period (25 years) applied to Loveridge in respect of the murder conviction, but not to the applicant. Further, s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) applied to the applicant, and not to Loveridge. That is not to be entirely disregarded, but, when it is taken into account that the applicant was just five months short of attaining the age of 18, and when that is added to the grossness of his conduct, the difference in the ages of the two offenders is of no moment. 

68The other matter advanced was that Loveridge was the first to use lethal violence. 

69To those points may be added the fact that Loveridge was sentenced in respect of more offences than the applicant. However, the overriding matter was the murder of AG. In that respect, the two offenders were indistinguishable. 

70In the circumstances of this case, there can be no legitimate sense of grievance in the applicant.

71I would reject Ground 4 of the application.

72It follows that I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

73WILSON J: I agree with Simpson J.

2703999,Steer v R [2014] NSWCCA 338,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J.

2HIDDEN J: After a trial in the District Court by judge alone, the applicant, Brian James Steer, was found guilty of attempting to escape from lawful custody, an offence under s 310D(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 13 months to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period he was serving at the relevant time and continues to serve. He seeks leave to appeal against his conviction and the sentence. 

3The applicant is well out of time to appeal, the verdict having been pronounced in August 2011 and the sentence passed in January 2012. From an affidavit of the applicant's solicitor, who had not represented him in the District Court, it appears that there was considerable delay in obtaining the material necessary to instruct counsel to advise on the merit of the matter for the purpose of a Legal Aid grant. Certainly, the delay is not the fault of the applicant. At the hearing the court decided to hear argument on the merits but the applicant's counsel, Mr Wendler, accepted that leave to appeal out of time should be refused if we did not find error. 

Evidence and verdict

4It was the Crown case that the applicant attempted to escape from Lithgow Correctional Centre on 4 March 2009. He was serving a lengthy aggregate sentence imposed by Whealy J in 2006 for murder and armed robbery. He is still serving that sentence, which expires in June 2036 and has an effective non-parole period expiring in February 2029. In his reasons for his verdict the trial judge recorded the following findings:

""Amongst other things, the Lithgow Correctional Centre has an area known as the 'Industries Area'. One side of that building is available for inmates to work in the textiles industry. On the other side of the building the area is set aside for inmates to work on the repair of car bumper bars.

Between those two areas there is a raised area for officers to observe the inmates' activities.

The Centre (at least insofar as the bumper bar area was concerned) had equipment capable to (sic) cutting metal.

Between 8.30am and 9am on a daily basis inmates are released from their cells. On 4 March 2009 Mr Steer was an inmate in cell unit 3/2.

Later in the morning of 4 March Mr Steer was observed by CCTV camera to enter the Industries Area. Although the entry to and exit from the Industries Area is monitored by continuous CCTV camera, there is no film footage of Mr Steer leaving that area.

The Industries Area was closed down between 1.30 and 2pm. 

At approximately 3pm there was a muster, (in effect a head count) for unit 3. After this muster it was determined that Mr Steer was missing.

Steps were then taken within the Lithgow Correctional Centre for a thorough search to be conducted for Mr Steer. 

In the course of that search the CCTV footage of the correctional centre was reviewed and in particular it was noted that there was CCTV footage showing Mr Steer entering but not leaving the Industries Area. He was last seen at approximately 1.35pm. 

Two correctional officers (Mr Bradford and Mr Handley) searched the Industries Area later that evening. They went to an electrical switchboard cupboard, opened the door and saw a gap within the cupboard into the ceiling. Whilst in that position they heard a noise coming from the ceiling directly above the cupboard. These officers then communicated with the Western Security Unit which is a unit within the Department of Corrective Services especially dedicated to provide security for correctional centres.

Two officers from this unit (Mr Crisafi and Mr Dean) by means of a ladder then entered the roof cavity of the Industrial Area through the hole in the ceiling discovered by Mr Bradford and Mr Handley. They did this at approximately 8.45pm.

The ceiling area was not illuminated and consequently was in pitch darkness. Mr Crisafi and Mr Dean had one torch with them. 

Upon entering the roof cavity these two officers discovered Mr Steer. Mr Steer must have been there from at least 3.30pm to 8.45pm but more likely was there from the time that the Industries Area closed at about 1.30pm.

Assuming that he was in the roof from 3.30pm, he was therefore in that dark place for at least five-and-one-quarter hours. Mr Steer was arrested and handcuffed and subsequently charged with the present offence.

He was interviewed by Mr Horan, a senior officer. Before being interviewed Mr Horan gave Mr Steer a caution. Mr Steer did not agree to be interviewed and exercised his right to silence.""


5His Honour described the relevant area of the prison as follows:

""The Industries Area is one of a number of buildings in the Lithgow Correctional Centre. The Centre is surrounded by two perimeter fences. The outer most perimeter fence is a high concrete wall possibly ten metres high on top of which is a roll.

The next perimeter fence is a mason steel fence also somewhere between six to ten metres high on top of which is razor wire. 

Between the mason steel fence and the concrete wall is an area known as the 'sterile area'. Entry into that area alerts sensors and cameras as does the touching of the mason steel fence.

Obviously enough, vehicular access can be gained to the centre. In particular, vehicular access can be gained to the Industries Area of the centre. That vehicular access includes large semi-trailers and other such vehicles.

Access to the Industries Area is on a daily basis or at most every two days.

Obviously these vehicles are a potential method of escape and therefore there is high security and searches for both entry and exits to the Centre. 

However no system is fool-proof and human error is not able to be excluded. 

Furthermore a degree of desperation may also cause an inmate to take risks which prima facie seem a long-shot.

The roof of the Industries Area was a long-shot but an available possible means of access to these vehicles I have referred to.""

6His Honour then went on to make the finding of fact which is central to this application:

""To constitute 'an attempt', an accused must take steps towards the commission of the crime - not merely preparatory. In this context it does not matter that it would be ultimately impossible to commit the crime or it could only be achieved with a great deal of difficulty and/or luck.

In the present case, the entry into the roof cavity of the Industries Area and remaining there for at least five-and-a-quarter hours in pitch dark goes beyond preparation and is a step preparatory in my view to escape and I am satisfied of that matter beyond reasonable doubt.""

His Honour also found that the applicant had the requisite intent, which is not challenged in this court.

7The applicant did not give evidence at the trial. The case advanced for him was that there were a number of alternative explanations for his behaviour consistent with his innocence. His Honour found that none of those explanations was reasonably available on the evidence. In this court no issue is taken with that finding either.

Conviction application

8In written submissions Mr Wendler addressed two grounds of appeal: firstly, that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence of the applicant concealing himself in the roof cavity was more than merely preparatory without first finding whether his conduct was sufficiently proximate to the commission of the complete offence; and, secondly, that his Honour erred in finding to the requisite standard that the evidence of the applicant hiding himself in the roof cavity for a period in excess of five hours constituted an attempt to escape from lawful custody.

9However, as refined in oral argument, Mr Wendler's contention was that his Honour's factual finding that the applicant's conduct was more than merely preparatory, and was proximate to the realisation of the offence, was not open. He did not take issue with his Honour's statement of the relevant law in the passage which I have cited above. That statement is consistent with that of Hodgson JA, with whom the other members of the court agreed, in R v Onuorah [2009] NSWCCA 238, 76 NSWLR 1. After a review of authority in relation to the common law notion of attempt, Hodgson JA said at [30] (10): 

""... the question in truth turns on whether an accused person intends each element of the relevant crime to occur, and in pursuance of that intention does acts that are not merely preparatory but are sufficiently proximate to the intended commission of the crime.""

10Mr Wendler relied upon the exposition of the law of attempt by Lord Diplock in Director of Public Prosecutions v Stonehouse [1978] A.C. 55 at 68:

""The constituent elements of the inchoate crime of an attempt are a physical act by the offender sufficiently proximate to the complete offence and an intention on the part of the offender to commit the complete offence. Acts that are merely preparatory to the commission of the offence ... are not sufficiently proximate to constitute an attempt. They do not indicate a fixed irrevocable intention to go on to commit the complete offence unless involuntarily prevented from doing so. As it was put in the locus classicus Reg. v. Eagleton (1855) Dears.C.C. 515, 538:

'The mere intention to commit a misdemeanour is not criminal. Some act is required, and we do not think that all acts towards committing a misdemeanour are indictable. Acts remotely leading towards the commission of the offence are not to be considered as attempts to commit it, but acts immediately connected with it are; ...'

In other words the offender must have crossed the Rubicon and burnt his boats.""

11Applying that test in the present case, Mr Wendler argued, it was not open to his Honour to find conduct of the applicant sufficiently proximate to the intended offence to amount to an attempt. As he put it in written submissions:

""The applicant submits that concealing himself in a high security prison such as Lithgow Prison, without more, was no more than a mere preparatory act remote and beyond the proximity of the completed crime of escape lawful custody. The place the applicant chose to hide was in the middle of the prison complex - a complex surrounded by two very high electronically monitored walls. 


...

The applicant's concealment in the Industrial Area of the prison was not sufficiently proximate to the offence charged and thus did not go beyond mere preparation for an escape from the prison. ... the applicant's conduct had not progressed to the point where it could be said that there was nothing left for the applicant to do other than avoid being found hiding by the prison authorities.""

12Mr Wendler sought to call in aid a decision of the English Court of Appeal in Reg. v. Campbell (1991) 93 Cr.App.R. 350, in which the court quashed a conviction of attempted robbery. Put shortly, that appellant had been lurking in the vicinity of a sub-post office for some time. He had been riding a motor cycle, and was wearing a crash helmet and gloves. As he walked towards the post office he was arrested. He was searched, and an imitation gun, sunglasses and a threatening note were found on him. He admitted that he had been reconnoitring the post office and had intended to use the note to frighten an employee behind the counter. However, he maintained that he had decided not to carry out the robbery and had been arrested before he could return to his motor cycle to leave. The court held that his acts were indicative of mere preparation and that, as he had not entered the place where the offence might have been carried out, it was unlikely that he could be said to have performed an act properly characterised as an attempt.

13By way of contrast, Mr Wendler referred to a decision of the same court in Reg. v Jones (1990) 91 Cr.App.R. 351, in which the court held that there was sufficient evidence to be left to the jury on a charge of attempted murder. In that case the appellant had had an affair with a woman for about 2 years, but she had terminated it and entered into a relationship with another man. The appellant disguised himself, sought out that man, who had just dropped his daughter at school, got into his car and pointed a loaded sawn-off shotgun at him. Fortunately, the man managed to disarm him. 

14Mr Wendler pointed out that in the latter case it was obvious that the acts of the appellant were sufficiently proximate to the offence of murder to amount to an attempt, whereas in the case of Campbell, despite a number of steps properly seen as preparatory to the offence of robbery, it was held that that proximity was not established. 

15Campbell turned on its own facts, and I do not find it of assistance in resolving the present application. The various expressions of the test in the authorities are necessarily in general terms. What is at issue here is their application to the facts of this case. The applicant entered the Industrial Area and managed to gain access to the roof cavity. There he remained, in darkness, for a lengthy period, missing the afternoon muster in the process. What he then proposed to do to get out of the prison complex is anyone's guess. It may be, as his Honour postulated, that he hoped to secrete himself in a vehicle which was leaving the Centre. 

16No doubt, it would have been difficult to achieve his purpose, but that is not to the point. It was clearly open to his Honour to conclude, adopting the language from Reg. v. Eagleton cited in D.P.P. v. Stonehouse, that the steps he did take were more than ""remotely leading towards the commission of the offence"", but were ""immediately connected with it."" Accordingly, the challenge to the conviction is not made out. 

17I would refuse leave to appeal against conviction.

Sentence application

18By s 310D of the Crimes Act, the offence of attempting to escape from lawful custody carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 10 years. His Honour held that the effect of s 57 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was that the sentence he imposed must be directed to be served cumulatively upon the non-parole period of the sentence imposed upon the offender by Whealy J. His Honour took the view that the offence of attempting to escape from lawful custody was ""an offence involving an escape from lawful custody committed by the offender while an inmate of a correctional centre"" within the meaning of subs (1) of that section. Mr Wendler did not take issue with that approach. 

19As I have said, his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 13 months, to commence at the expiration of the applicant's non-parole period, that is, on 23 February 2029. Mr Wendler submitted that that sentence is manifestly excessive.

20His Honour described the offence of attempting to escape from lawful custody as ""extremely serious"", referring to the maximum penalty prescribed for it. However, he accepted a submission made on behalf of the applicant that the steps taken by him, although adequate to establish the offence charged, ""had not gone significantly towards completion of the enterprise."" In terms of an attempt, his Honour characterised it as ""at the low end of the scale.""

21In arriving at the sentence of 13 months, his Honour noted that the fact that he was imposing a fixed term required some reduction of what would otherwise have been the head sentence which, in his view, would have been 18 months. Mr Wendler did not appear for the applicant in the District Court. Counsel then appearing, in submissions on sentence, postulated an 18 month sentence but argued that a fixed term ""equal to the length of a non-parole period"" his Honour might have imposed would be appropriate. His submission was that, in all the circumstances, the fixed term should be ""something under 12 months and in the vicinity of 6 to 12 months.""

22In submissions in this court, both Mr Wendler and the Crown prosecutor referred to R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94, a Crown appeal against a sentence for escaping from lawful custody. It is unnecessary to examine the facts of that case or the outcome. What is relevant for present purposes are the following statements of principle by Wood CJ at CL (with whom Hislop and Johnson JJ agreed) at [16]-[18].

""[16] The offence of escape has been regarded by the courts as a serious offence, which potentially jeopardises the future of minimum security facilities and threatens the continued provision to prisoners of beneficial and humanitarian custodial arrangements and opportunities. It may lead to additional restrictions being placed upon their access to external medical treatment, and it may also impede the progress of rehabilitation for offenders with favourable prospects, if conditions of detention are strengthened, in order to prevent escapes. 

[17] These considerations were noted, for example, in R v Thomson NSWCCA 21 May 1986 where, in a case decided before enactment of the Sentencing Act 1989, Street CJ observed that the ordinary sentence for an unremarkable escape 'could be expected to approximate two years' (at a time when the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 7 years); and also in R v Mathieson [2002] NSWCCA 97 at [27]. 

[18] Where the offender has remained at large for a very lengthy period or has used the opportunity of being at large to commit further offences, as was the case here, then the overall objective seriousness of his criminality is potentially increased: R v Plummer [2000] NSWCCA 363 at [34] and R v Josef Regina [2000] NSWCCA 100. The elements of both personal and general deterrence are also important, it being essential that prisoners understand that any offence of escape or attempted escape will result in a meaningful overall increase in their detention: R v Butler [2000] NSWCCA 525 at [18] and R v Smith [2004] NSWCCA 69. That this is so is also demonstrated by the fact that the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence has been increased from imprisonment for 7 years to imprisonment for 10 years.""

23The Chief Judge's observations about the threat posed by escapes to the benefit of minimum security facilities is not germane to the present case. Lithgow Correctional Centre is a maximum security prison. Otherwise, the Crown prosecutor relied upon that passage to demonstrate the seriousness with which the courts view offences of escaping from lawful custody and attempts to do so. Mr Wendler relied upon it, particularly by contrast to the type of case referred to by Wood CJ at CL at [18], to emphasise his Honour's finding that the applicant's offence was at the low end of the scale of objective gravity. Mr Wendler also pointed out that the sentence for the attempted escape will commence years hence, at the expiration of a very long non-parole period. A sentence which would delay the applicant's eligibility for parole by more than a year, he submitted, is clearly more than was called for in all the circumstances.

24The Crown prosecutor submitted that the sentence was within the proper bounds of his Honour's discretion, noting that it was only marginally outside the range of sentence suggested by the applicant's counsel. Mr Wendler argued that the concession of that range was ""over generous."" In written submissions he described the offence as ""amateurish, optimistic and devoid of any prospect of success.""

25The issue of sentence in this case has troubled me, and I can see the force in Mr Wendler's submissions. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that the sentence passed by his Honour should be disturbed.

26A matter to which his Honour did not refer in his remarks should be noted. Among the material before him were the remarks on sentence of Whealy J for the offences of murder and armed robbery, together with some Corrective Services Department material before his Honour in those proceedings. That material alleged an escape attempt in 1996. It also disclosed that in June 2006, while on remand at Parklea Correctional Centre, the applicant was suspected of involvement in an escape plot. This led to his being placed on a segregation order. He appealed against that order to the Serious Offenders Review Council, but it was confirmed. This material is relevant for present purposes, but it should be assessed with some caution. In the proceedings before Whealy J the applicant denied involvement in an escape plan in 2006, and he was never convicted of any offence arising from either allegation. 

27It is true, as the Crown prosecutor noted, that the sentence in the present case is just outside the range submitted by the applicant's counsel. That is not necessarily decisive, but it is a significant matter. It was open to his Honour to have dealt with the applicant more leniently for the reasons articulated by Mr Wendler, but I am not satisfied that the sentence which was passed was beyond the bounds of the legitimate exercise of his Honour's discretion.

28I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

2704012,R v Pavlou [2014] NSWCCA 337,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Adams J.
2ADAMS J:
Introduction
3On 16 May 2014 the respondent was sentenced on two counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), which prescribes in each case a maximum term of imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  The first count involved the supply on 16 November 2012 of 4.785 kg of 3,4-MDMA and the second count the supply on 13 December 2012 of 4.818 kg of amphetamine.  On each charge he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 4 years, the first sentence commencing on 17 February 2014 and the second commencing on 17 February 2015, resulting in an overall sentence of 7 years and 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years.  The starting point in each case was a sentence of 9 years imprisonment, reduced by 25% for his pleas of guilty.  The Crown appeals on the following grounds - 
1. His Honour fell into error by imposing sentences with an insufficient level of accumulation; 
2. His Honour erred in categorising the offences as ""about midway between the midrange and the least degree of objective seriousness"";
3. The sentence for count 1 is manifestly inadequate; and
4. The total sentence is manifestly inadequate.
Facts
4These were not in dispute.  The following account is largely taken from the sentencing judge's summary of the agreed statement of facts.  
5On 16 November 2012 police became aware that the respondent had come into possession of 20,000 MDMA tablets and that a runner was coming from Melbourne to pick them up.  The package of drugs was placed under the passenger seat by the respondent who had unsuccessfully attempted to conceal it in the panelling.  The runner arrived and was given the keys to the car and then left.  He was intercepted by police, who discovered the drugs.  The MDMA tablets weighed 4.785 kg with 31.5% purity.  The respondent, however, was not located until 13 December 2012 when a vehicle he was driving was stopped by police.  He was arrested and, on a search of the vehicle, a tool box was found containing 1.0888 kg of methylamphetamine of 66.5% purity and 3.37 kg of liquid methylamphetamine of 54% purity.  Although the agreed facts refer to the location of methylamphetamine powder and methylamphetamine oil in the vehicle being driven by the respondent on 13 December 2013, the analyst's certificate disclosed that the relevant drug was amphetamine, as, indeed, specified in the relevant Court Attendance Notice.  As it seems to me, nothing turns on this.  It is evident that amphetamine is an extremely dangerous drug.)  Notes relating to the manufacture of methylamphetamine including quantities, percentages and purity were found near his wallet in the car.  When he was interviewed, the respondent denied knowing anything about the drugs which were found and said he had not been involved in any drug supply activities.  Depending on a retail or wholesale price, all of the drugs are valued at between $700,000 to $1.3 million.  Initially, he was remanded in custody but was eventually granted bail on 11 March 2013, having spent 89 days in custody.  
Subjective circumstances
6The respondent was almost 35 years of age at the date of the offence with a minimal criminal record said by the sentencing judge to be ""of no relevance to the present offences"".  
7The respondent's evidence in the sentence proceedings, supported to some extent by his wife, is that in July 2012 when he returned from holiday in Greece he was not employed and recommenced his prior heroin and methylamphetamine habit.  However, because his wife controlled the family finances, he had no cash and so bought his drugs on credit, a debt reaching about $2,800 when he was approached by three men with whom he had been dealing for some time who told him, in effect, that the debt would be cleared if he did ""a few jobs"".  When he tried to deflect them by promising to pay the money, this offer was not accepted.  They threatened the life of members of his family if he went to the police.  He said that he was ""panicky"" and high on drugs when he undertook the first offence.  The second offence occurred when the same criminals took his father's utility and drove him north, blindfolding him, ending up on a rural property where he used drugs for a couple of days with another person until he was told to drive the vehicle to Sydney.  He said he was ""off his head"" on drugs.  
8The respondent's wife confirmed, amongst other things, that he came home from the first meeting with a black eye.  At the sentencing hearing a number of reports were tendered.  The first of these was from Ms Thawhida Rangiah, a registered psychologist to whom the respondent had been referred in mid-April 2013 for assessment and treatment of his mental health.  It is unnecessary to detail his personal history, his family relationships were unexceptional.  However, he had significant problems in high school when he became involved with what he described as ""the wrong group"".  He had no interest in school work and truanted on one occasion for 30 days.  By the time he was 14 he began to use drugs recreationally, use which continued into adulthood, starting to use ecstasy and speed from about the age of 18 and, from the age of 29 he started to use heroin as well, moving on to ice.  He continued, indeed, to use heroin and ice whilst he was on remand.  When he obtained bail he said he stopped using drugs, self-medicating with alcohol which he was able to control.  Ms Rangiah assessed him as suffering from acute stress disorder with high level anxiety and depressed mood which was managed reasonably well until he was informed by police of a phone call threatening his life (which I discuss later) inducing extremely severe depression requiring anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication to deal with what was called ""an acute mental health decline with suicidality"".  His mental health was volatile and medication needed to be adjusted several times.  Ms Rangiah reported that the respondent assumed full responsibility for his current situation and realised that this was what eventually happens in the drug milieu.
9The respondent was also seen by Mr Borenstein, a clinical psychologist who assessed him for intellectual functioning on 17 April 2014.  The test results showed that the respondent's verbal intelligence was in the borderline range and performance intelligence in the average range.  Compared to age-related peers, the respondent's verbal skills are in the bottom 4th percentile, that is, 96% of his age-related peers perform better on verbal reasoning/communication compared to the respondent.  His non-verbal abilities or practical skills are average.  Overall, the respondent's level of function is in the low average range, that is the 12th percentile compared to age-related peers.  Put otherwise, 88% of the respondent's age-related peers perform better on intelligence and problem solving tasks compared to him.  He demonstrated an adequate reading ability.  Dr Jonathan Adams, a forensic psychiatrist examined the respondent while he was on bail.  Passing over his personal history, to which sufficient reference has already been made, Dr Adams noted in the context of his mental state examination, that the applicant's account of events was easy to follow, there was no evidence of thought disorder or delusional beliefs; he endorsed occasional ruminating negative cognitions but there was no evidence of significant depressive cognitions.  As to his insight, Dr Adams thought he appeared to appreciate the relationship between stressors and his deteriorating mood state and was aware of the pathological basis of his mood change.  The respondent noted the deleterious impact of his longstanding illicit substance and alcohol use and expressed his wish to remain abstinent in the future.  He noted the benefits of psychiatric medication and psychological therapy and wished to remain compliant.  Overall, in Dr Adams' opinion, his level of insight was reasonable.  As to the respondent's mental state at the time of the offences - 
 ""Mr Pavlou conveyed how his mental state deteriorated from October 2012 onwards, precipitated by being threatened to engage in criminal activity.  Mr Pavlou described how his ensuing low, anxious and fearful mental state was set in the context of his continuing polysubstance dependence, which in my view worsened his mental state further.  Mr Pavlou recounted how he felt unable to manage his circumstances in any way other than engaging in the offending behaviour, which is perhaps understandable given his history of impaired problem solving skills, together with the reported severity of the threat.  Mr Pavlou related his use of illicit substances on the day of each offence, which from a psychiatric perspective likely further impaired his already compromised decision-making capacity and consequential thinking.""
10The sentencing judge referred to these reports in his remarks, quoting extensively from that of Dr Adams.  
11I have mentioned police information given to the respondent on his release on bail that he was at serious risk of harm.  The sentencing judge accepted that on 20 June 2013 the respondent was assaulted with an angle grinder suffering a number of injuries including a substantial laceration to his nose.  The respondent said that this was done by persons in his drug milieu as a warning not to provide any information to police.  His Honour noted that, in fact, the respondent has not done so ""perhaps understandably"".
Discussion  
12The sentencing judge referred to a number of authorities dealing with the way in which duress can be taken into account on sentence where it does not constitute a defence to the charge.  His Honour concluded -
""On balance I would find that some duress was operating on Mr Pavlou, but that does not explain why he did not go immediately to the police, particularly when one considers that his criminality was going to jump from being a very minor offender, some years before these offences, to committing offences that carry the maximum penalty known to the law in New South Wales for any offence, including murder"".
His Honour regarded the assault on 20 June 2013 as supporting the respondent's evidence about threats.  No complaint is made as to the way in which his Honour took this aspect into account.  
13The sentencing judge concluded that the respondent was not suffering from a mental illness or an intellectual handicap, although he was not someone ""who has a great capacity to think through decisions that he has made"".  His Honour did not think that a custodial sentence was likely to weigh any more heavily on him than other prisoners or that there was still not the need for specific deterrence.  His Honour did not think that the respondent's mental health had contributed materially to the commission of his offences although it might explain his failure to take other appropriate action such as informing the authorities.  He accepted that the respondent was remorseful, that he had a large supportive family and was otherwise well thought of as a person and as a worker.  His record did not disentitle him to leniency.  He thought that, if the respondent could continue his present regime of counselling and medication, he had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend.  His Honour accepted that the respondent might be at risk in custody and that this was likely to make it more onerous for him.  As is evident, his Honour found special circumstances justified a variation in the statutory ratio stipulated in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
14The sentencing judge referred to the standard non-parole period and the requirement to give it the significance explained in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120; 212 A Crim R 254.  Because of the particular contention relating to the sentencing judge's assessment of objective seriousness, it is, I think, relevant to note the following observations (omitting references) - 
""[27]  Section 54B(2) and s 54B(3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The latter requires that content be given to its specification as ""the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" ... Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.
...
[31]  The maximum penalty for a statutory offence serves as an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence ... An increase in the maximum penalty for an offence is an indication that sentences for that offence should be increased. It appears that for most, if not all, Div 1A offences, the standard non-parole period exceeds the mean non-parole period for the offence recorded in the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in the period before the enactment of Div 1A. As the Court of Criminal Appeal correctly pointed out in Way, it is necessary to treat this circumstance with care ... The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case....""
15In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 the court discussed the concept of objective seriousness at [79] [ff].  In the present context, the following seems particularly relevant -
""[86]  Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ""objectively"" to affect the ""seriousness"" of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender's capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected ..."" 
16The sentencing judge said, in connection with this aspect -
""I would regard this offending as below the midrange of objective seriousness about midway between the midrange and the least degree of objective seriousness.""
17It seems to me that his Honour meant by this description to refer to all of the objective circumstances of the case which, considering the respondent's motive involved duress, also included that matter.  Whether this reasoning quite conforms to the above cited passage from Muldrock is not altogether easy to determine but, to my mind, this is of no present relevance.  I simply refer to the issue to explain my understanding of this passage in his Honour's remarks on sentence.  
18Dealing first with the submission that the sentences were insufficiently accumulated, the Crown submitted that each offence was very serious in its own right and involved quantities 9.5 times the large commercial amount of MDMA and 5 times the large commercial amount of amphetamine.  They were of a relatively high purity and it was agreed they could be sold for a substantial sum.  I should interpolate that I do not think that any additional insight is gained into seriousness by dividing the quantity of drugs found by the lowest quantity in the particular category.  This adds no further information than the quantity itself.  It is obvious that, by and large, the greater the quantity, the graver the seriousness of the offence, but there is no mere arithmetical correlation here.  The Crown prosecutor also submitted that, whilst it is difficult to make a precise assessment of the respondent's role, the listening device material tendered on the sentence proceedings demonstrated that he was ""heavily involved in wholesale drug supply that included interstate aspects"".  It had been submitted by the Crown prosecutor at first instance that the sentencing judge would not accept the respondent's evidence about how he came to be involved in the offences, submitting that the listening device transcript was strong evidence that this involvement was not unwilling but, in fact, enthusiastic.  Whilst some parts of the conversation are capable of supporting this submission, the sentencing judge accepted the respondent's evidence about duress and accepted the involvement of the respondent as sufficiently described in the agreed facts.  Furthermore, except in the sense that he was, in substance, a volunteer who had fabricated his account of how he came to be involved (which was denied), it was not put to the respondent either in cross-examination or, for that matter, in submissions to the sentencing judge that he was ""heavily involved in whole-sale drug supply"" to any degree greater than that described in the agreed statement of facts.  The sentencing judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing the respondent and, in light of the way the matter was conducted before his Honour, I do not think it is appropriate to re-evaluate the respondent's role on the appeal.  
19The Crown prosecutor emphasised in this Court, as well, the fact that the two offences were committed a month apart and involve different prohibited drugs.  So far as accumulation is concerned, that is, to my mind, merely another way of considering whether the overall sentence reflected the total criminality involved in the offences, a matter which I will deal with in connection with ground 4.  
20So far as the sentencing judge's categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offences is concerned, the Crown prosecutor submitted in this Court that they should have been categorised as no less than ""just below the midrange of seriousness"".  In this respect we were taken to a number of decisions in this Court.  First was R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCA 34; 128 A Crim R 44, which was a Crown appeal before the commencement of the amendments relating to standard non-parole periods.  The Crown appealed from the inadequacy of the sentence imposed for supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin of 9 years with a non-parole period 4 years and 6 months, supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and supplying cocaine, a fixed term of 2 years.  The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently on the basis that each offence was part of one continuous exercise, so that the effective overall sentence was 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.  In dealing with the question of inadequacy, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Dowd JJ agreed) noted that, not only were the quantities substantial, over 3100 g of heroin and 9000 g of methylamphetamine, but the former was 83% pure whilst the latter was above average purity.  Furthermore, the heroin and amphetamine offences did not relate solely to drugs found at the time of the respondent's arrest but also to occasions of supply over an extensive period covered by listening device tapes and even longer so that the respondent was a party to a venture ""of considerable proportions and one in which he occupied a significant role"".  The Court held that the 25% discount given for the late plea of guilty was inappropriate, and reduced that discount to 10% but allowed a further discount for assistance, resulting in a total discount of 40%.  In the result, therefore, in respect of the methylamphetamine count, the respondent was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and, in respect of the heroin count, to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, effectively a total sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.  The starting point for the sentences, therefore, was about 13 years for the former offence and 15 years for the latter.  He had a number of prior convictions including one for supplying heroin in 1993.  His subjective circumstances may be described as not markedly dissimilar to the respondent's but the objective seriousness of his offence greatly exceeded that of the respondent here, not only because of the number and nature of the supplies with which he was involved but also because no element of duress was present.  For what it is worth, the accumulation was 2 years.  I do not think that this case provides any useful information except that it indicates (which is at all events obvious) that the respondent's sentences here could have been more severe without exceeding the appropriate discretionary range.  
21In R v Kazzi [2008] NSWCCA 77 the Crown appealed from an overall sentence of 8 years, with fixed terms and non-parole periods totalling 6 years, imposed for seven counts of supplying indictable, commercial or large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs, including one count of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (2.892 kg).  Although the combined discount of 30% for the respondent's pleas of guilty and assistance were ""generous"", it was held to be within the sentencing judge's discretion and not varied.  The Court accepted as open the sentencing judge's categorisation of the offence generally as being ""just below"" the middle of the range of objective seriousness but concluded that his Honour failed to take into account, having made this finding, the standard non-parole periods applicable to the offences.  The sentencing judge had found that the respondent was ""clearly nearer the top [of the drug hierarchy] than the bottom"".  The sentence relating to the methylamphetamine was increased to 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.  The starting point was about 14 years.  He had only a minor criminal history.  Again, the circumstances of the respondent's offences differ markedly from those of the respondent here.  I would note, also, that if it was reasonable to regard the objective seriousness of Kazzi's offences as just below the midrange of objective seriousness, it is not at all obvious that, in the respondent's case, the sentencing judge erred in his evaluation. 
22Lastly, the Crown pointed to XX v R [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38 where the offender had pleaded guilty to a number of counts, including one of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (3.165 kg) and one of supplying a large commercial quantity of MDMA (7.5 kg).  A number of offences were taken into account in sentencing him for the latter offence, including possession of a pistol, ammunition and a taser gun.  In respect of the drug offences the offender was sentenced to 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, wholly concurrent.  This reflected a total discount for plea and assistance of 60%.  The sentencing judge assessed the methylamphetamine offence as in the midrange and the MDMA offence as just above the midrange of seriousness.  The respondent was found to be involved as a principal in a substantial supply business.  On appeal, this characterisation was accepted.  The respondent was described in the Court of Criminal Appeal as ""a supplier at a midlevel in the hierarchy"".  In respect of the methylamphetamine offence, the Court of Criminal Appeal substituted a sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 2 years (varying its accumulation on one of the other counts) and, in respect of the MDMA offence, substituted a sentence of 8 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 7 months.  Again, I do not see this case as offering any real assistance in the present appeal.  I note, moreover, that the judge's characterisation of objective seriousness in the context of much more serious offending than that of the present respondent does not suggest that the sentencing judge's categorisation erred.  
23In my view, the Crown's submission in respect of objective seriousness should be rejected.  
24So far as the argument in respect of the manifest inadequacy of the sentence for count 1 is concerned, the Crown points to the proportions by which the quantities involved in each offence exceeded the large commercial quantity for that drug.  Since the MDMA was 9.5 times this quantity and the amphetamine was almost 5 times the quantity, it is submitted that, this alone, indicated that the sentence on count 1 should have been greater than the sentence for count 2.  The prosecutor relied on DAB v R; NJB v R [2010] NSWCCA 275 as, at least, an example of where such reasoning was applied.  DAB had pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of MDMA and of manufacturing the same quantity of the same drug and was sentenced in relation to each of the counts to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 12 years with non-parole periods of 8 years, in respect of the supply offence taking into account an additional offence of money laundering, described by Simpson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Hall J agreed) as ""itself a serious offence of its kind"".  Significantly different quantities of drugs were involved in the offences of supply and manufacture.  The large commercial quantity is 500 g for each offence, the supply involving just over 9 kg of tablets, whilst the manufacture involved just under 3 kg.  Simpson J concluded that the starting point of the sentences ought to have reflected a different level of criminality as indicated by these quantities, there being no other basis of differentiation in respect of the objective gravity of the offences or his personal circumstances.  Her Honour noted, also, that the sentence for the supply offence included the offence taken into account on the form 1, commenting ""the sentence in respect of the manufacturing count ought to have been less, if only for that reason.""  
25In R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131, an insider trading case, where it was accepted by Hoeben CJ at CL (Rothman and McCallum JJ agreeing) that the most significant indicator of the extent of criminality, as between the investment made and the profit obtained, was the former factor as indicating ""the size of the transaction and the best way of assessing that is by reference to the amount of money invested, or placed at risk"" (at [54]).  However, his Honour rejected the submission that the sentencing judge's determination of the terms of imprisonment (there being multiple counts) was ""unsatisfactory in that he did not indicate the basis on which he imposed... identical... [terms] of imprisonment in respect of a number of pairs of counts where the investment in one was almost 9 times that involved in the other with very much greater profit yields as well.""  Similar comparisons arose in respect of the other counts.  His Honour said - 
[63]  The Crown's criticism of the sentencing judge's approach on this basis is misconceived. It involves an application of mathematical precision to what is a discretionary decision based on an intuitive synthesis of all the relevant factors to which his Honour referred. It is contrary to remarks in Pearce ... Given the similarity in the steps taken by the respondent in relation to each offence, it was well open to the sentencing judge to structure the sentences as he did.
[64]  The Crown submitted that it was difficult to discern the basis upon which his Honour determined which sentences were to be concurrent and which were to be cumulative. Once again, this was a discretionary exercise on the part of his Honour which was open to him because of the similar nature of the offending. 26It seems to me that the Crown prosecutor's argument is fundamentally flawed.  First of all, if the sentence on count 1 is, as it were, the marker, there are good reasons for thinking that count 2 was more serious than the quantity of amphetamine involved, if for no other reason than it was the second offence.  Otherwise, if the sentence on count 2 were the marker, then the sentence on count 1 would be too heavy.  Furthermore, as Mr Johnston, counsel for the respondent pointed out, although the MDMA was indeed about 9 times the large commercial quantity of 500 g, its purity was only 31.5% whereas, though the amount of amphetamine was just over 4.5 times the commercial quantity of 1 kg, its purity was approximately double, ranging from 54% to 66.5%.
27I now come to what is, in my opinion, the substantive ground of appeal, namely that the total sentence is manifestly inadequate.  The Crown attached a schedule of decisions of this Court most of which were sentence appeals which had been dismissed.  It must follow, of course, that aside from any other indication in the judgments, the sentences were those imposed in the District Court although, of course, this is not to suggest at all that they are not informative.  During argument I pointed out to Counsel for the Crown that it is not very helpful to have an undigested list of cases attached to submissions which are said to reflect sentencing patterns.  I pointed out that this was little more than a submission that, whilst Counsel would not construct an argument out of the cases, somehow, the Court should.  That is, of course, not appropriate.  I agree that the information in the summaries makes them more informative than simply looking at the JIRS charts but, aside from indicating a general trend in sentencing, they do not offer any real assistance.  I note, in particular, that many of the quantities are greater than those involved here: in many the level of involvement was greater and none mention any issue of duress or limited intellectual capacity similar to that of the respondent.  Whilst it is true that most of the sentences appear to be greater than those imposed on the respondent, a distinct number are less.  In the end, the Crown relied specifically on the cases to which I have already referred and there is no need to discuss them further.
28For his part, Mr Johnston took us to four cases involving participation in supply of MDMA by one way or another.  The first of these is R v Opa [2004] NSWCCA 464.  The offender pleaded guilty to participating in the supply of 3.1 kg of MDMA, a large commercial quantity.  He was sentenced to a term of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years.  He had a substantial role in an enterprise of drug supply, although he was not the principal.  He was given a discount in the order of 15% but this was increased to 20% by the Court when it resentenced the offender.  In allowing the appeal R S Hulme J (with whom Giles JA and Lavine J agreed) held that the appropriate starting point was 12 years imprisonment, which he then reduced by 20% for the applicant's plea, yielding 9.6 years and then discounting by a further 41% for assistance to the authorities, ended with a head sentence of 5 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.  
29In Nassif [2005] NSWCCA 38 the appellant pleaded guilty to the offence of attempting to receive for supply about 123.5 kg of MDMA, obviously a large commercial quantity.  He had two prior convictions involving the supply of drugs.  This was described as a commercial dealing in which the offender was to be a wholesale dealer.  Allowing a 25% discount for his plea, the offender was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years.  At the time of the offence he was subject to a s 9 bond.  His appeal on the ground of manifest excess was dismissed.  
30Lastly, we were taken to R v Choi [2010] NSWCCA 318.  The Crown appealed against a sentence imposed on the offender for knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of MDMA in respect of which, having served approximately 6 and a half months of pre-sentence custody, he was sentenced to a further term of 17 months 15 days, execution of the sentence being suspended, this reflecting overall a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years.  The substance of the offence was that the offender agreed with his co-offender to supply 30,000 ecstasy tablets, weighing about 5.9 kg.  The applicant had a strong subjective case.  His sentence was discounted by 50% for his plea of guilty and assistance to authorities.  Hulme J (with whom Giles JA and Hislop J agreed) concluded that the objective seriousness of the offence ""fell at about the middle of the lower half of the range"".  The sentence was increased to one of 4 years 6 months after a discount of 50% from a starting point of 9 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months.  
Conclusion
31This Court has repeatedly emphasised the evaluative character of assessments of objective seriousness and the wide discretion posed in sentencing judges when determining the appropriate sentence resulting from the instinctive synthesis of all the relevant circumstances and it is not necessary to set out those authorities.  
32As I have already indicated, there are no patent errors in the sentencing judge's reasoning.  The comparative cases to which we have been taken demonstrate a range of sentences suggesting that the respondent's sentence was lenient but far from demonstrating that the sentences were manifestly inadequate or that the overall sentence was manifestly inadequate.  It is trite that it is not sufficient to justify interference with the sentence imposed at first instance that this Court would have imposed a heavier sentence.  Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.
33R A HULME J:  I agree with Adams J.

2704015,Leigh Brown v R [2014] NSWCCA 335,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Hidden J. I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he proposes.

2HIDDEN J: The applicant, Leigh Raymond Brown, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following counts:

1. Aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence (knowing there was a person present), an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years;

2. Supplying a prohibited drug (17.3 grams of methylamphetamine), an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, carrying a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment.

3In respect of each count the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account on sentence matters on a Form 1. In relation to the first count, these were offences of larceny of a car trailer and receiving stolen property (a Holden vehicle). In respect of the second count, these were offences of possessing a prohibited drug (1.96 grams of amphetamine) and possessing a prescribed restricted substance (anabolic steroid - testosterone/deca). In addition, he was dealt with for a number of related offences under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. These were two offences of stealing a motor vehicle and two offences of possessing a shortened firearm.

4After allowing a 25% discount of sentence in recognition of the pleas of guilty, the sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, dating from the day of his arrest, 31 August 2012. The indicative sentences for the principal offences, discounted for the pleas of guilty, were as follows:

Count 1 (Aggravated break and enter), taking into account the matters on the Form 1 - 4 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 8 months;

Count 2 (Supplying prohibited drug), taking into account the matters on the Form 1 - 3 years and 4 months.

5In respect of the matters dealt with under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, again after discount, the indicative sentences were:

Stealing the Holden R8 - 2 years and 3 months;

Stealing the Holden Commodore - 1 year and 6 months;

Each of the charges of possessing shortened firearms - 1 year and 6 months.

6His Honour noted that, if he had not passed an aggregate sentence, he would have imposed concurrent sentences on the two firearms offences but those sentences would have been partly accumulated upon the other sentences, for which there would themselves have been some partial accumulation.

Facts

7The facts of the offences, in chronological order, are helpfully summarised in the written submissions for the applicant, as follows:

""On 1 November 2011, the applicant received a Holden vehicle registration BUA00M knowing it to have been stolen (Form 1). The vehicle was subsequently stripped and the applicant was involved in telephone conversations relating to the sale of the vehicle and its various parts. The vehicle was recovered by the Police on 4 November 2011.

Between 9pm on 27 November 2011 and 7:30am on 28 November 2011, the applicant broke and entered premises at Wattle Grove (Count 1). At the time, he knew persons were present inside the premises. He stole a wallet containing $300, a drivers licence, personal cards and car keys relating to a Holden R8 HSV registration number MP2802. He used the keys to steal this vehicle which was parked in the driveway (s.166 certificate).

On the same evening, the applicant attended premises in Moorebank where he took a trailer registration number V70355 (Form 1).

On the same evening, the applicant stole a VT Holden Commodore from premises at Milperra (s.166 certificate). This vehicle had been built for the purpose of drag racing.

The three vehicles were taken to premises in Ambarvale.

On the evenings of 28 and 29 November 2011 the applicant was involved in communications relating to the sale of the Holden R8 and the VT Holden Commodore.

On 29 November 2011, the Police executed a search warrant at premises in Ambarvale and located the VT Holden Commodore and the trailer.

In early December 2011, the Police intercepted a number of calls between the applicant and another male person suggestive of street-level drug supply.

On 30 December 2011, the Police executed a search warrant at the applicant's residence at Rosemeadow. The Police located a shortened shotgun loaded with four shells wrapped in a towel at the bottom of the applicants' bed (s.166 certificate) and a shortened .308 Winchester rifle loaded with five cartridges located in a backpack (s.166 certificate). Neither firearm was found to be in working order.

The police also located 17.13 grams of methyl-amphetamine at 12.5% purity (Count 2), 1.96 grams of amphetamine (Form 1) and six glass vials of testosterone (Form 1).""

8As to the offence of aggravated break and enter, his Honour found that the applicant was aware that at least one person was in the premises at the time, although that person was asleep in a bedroom. He placed that offence and the four offences on the s 166 certificate at the lower end of the scale for offences of that kind. As to the offence of supplying methylamphetamine, he noted that the amount of the drug was three times the indictable quantity, but accepted that ""the deemed supply"" of the drug was largely to support the applicant's own habit. He found that offence to be ""towards the lower end of the range."" I shall turn later to his Honour's assessment of the firearms offences, which is the subject of one of the grounds of appeal.

Subjective case

9The applicant was 28 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 31. He has a substantial criminal history, commencing when he was only 14 years old. It comprises offences of dishonesty and of violence, together with drug offences and driving offences. He had previously served terms of imprisonment, and on a number of occasions been dealt with by bonds or suspended sentences. 

10His background is unfortunate. His Honour noted that he had a troubled upbringing. His father was violent towards his mother and his older brothers. His mother subsequently had other partners, but it seems that they were not desirable role models for him. Moreover, his mother was a heroin addict. He suffered from ADHD and had a limited education. 

11He started smoking cannabis at the age of 9 or 10, under the influence of older boys with whom he was associating. From the age of about 14 he commenced using amphetamine, and thereafter developed a pattern of polysubstance abuse. At stages he used methamphetamine, ecstasy and LSD, and from the age of 21 he used cocaine and began to drink alcohol. 

12He was using drugs at the time of the offences. At that time he was also suffering from depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, arising from a violent incident some years earlier in which he was shot in the leg. His Honour noted that he had had no legitimate employment up to that time, surviving and maintaining his drug habit by committing ""a significant number of criminal offences."" 

13After the offences, committed in late 2011, he fled to Queensland to avoid arrest. It was there that he was arrested on 31 August 2012. Significantly, however, during his sojourn in Queensland he ceased to use drugs, without professional help, and obtained employment as a labourer. He has remained drug free since. In the later part of 2011, before he committed the present offences, he had formed a relationship with a woman who, apparently, is law abiding, drug free and does not drink alcohol. She went with him to Queensland. The relationship endures, and in January 2013 she gave birth to their child, a daughter.

14Some years previously, his mother had defeated her drug addiction with the help of her current partner, and they moved to a rural area. The applicant has re-established a relationship with her. He told a psychologist, whose report was in evidence, that upon his release he wanted to move to that area so as to be near his mother, to obtain work, and to find accommodation with his partner and their daughter. He also said that he wanted to develop a relationship with his daughter as a supportive father and role model. To the psychologist he expressed remorse for his crimes, as he did in evidence in the sentence proceedings.

15The psychological report was prepared in July 2013. The psychologist expressed the opinion that, in the light of the applicant's long history of substance abuse and anti-social associates, he needs long term assistance and support. She recommended his participation in drug programs while in custody, and an outpatient rehabilitation program upon his release, together with a period of supervision by Community Offender Services to monitor his substance use through regular urinalysis or breathalyser screening. 

16His Honour noted this progress towards rehabilitation in his remarks, adding that ""notwithstanding the two year period that he has not used drugs, the fact that in the preceding twenty years he had regularly used a wide range of drugs means that his prospects of rehabilitation must at this stage be somewhat guarded."" 

17About two months after being taken into custody, the applicant was placed on protection after having been assaulted and having been threatened with violence because one of his brothers was proposing to give evidence on behalf of the Crown in unrelated proceedings. In the event, those proceedings had been completed without the brother having to give evidence. Nevertheless, the applicant was still on protection at the time he was sentenced, although his Honour was not persuaded that that was likely to remain the case for any significant period after sentence was imposed. 

The application

18Counsel for the applicant, Mr White, argued three grounds of appeal, the third being that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive. In argument on that third ground an issue was raised which persuades me that this court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant. I shall return to this but, given that conclusion, it is sufficient to refer to the other two grounds only briefly. 

19The first ground is that the indicative sentence for one of the related matters dealt with under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act exceeds the maximum sentence available. This was the offence of stealing the Holden R8, for which his Honour indicated a sentence of 2 years and 3 months. His Honour's approach to that sentence was governed by s 168(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which provides:

""(3) In sentencing or otherwise dealing with a person for a back up offence or related offence, the court has the same functions, and is subject to the same restrictions and procedures, as the Local Court.""

The effect of s 267(2) of the Act is that the maximum sentence the Local Court could have imposed for that offence was imprisonment for 2 years.

20In this court the Crown prosecutor conceded the error, but submitted that it was not material because it made no difference to the aggregate sentence imposed. As this court is to re-sentence, there is no need to resolve that issue. 

21The second ground relates to a finding his Honour made concerning the two related offences of possessing firearms. The applicant told the psychologist that he had them because he had been threatened by someone, that he knew they were not in working order, but he wanted them so as to be able to threaten people for his self-protection. He said that the bullets came with the firearms, and he had no intention of repairing them so as to be able to fire them. His Honour accepted that account, but was not persuaded ""on the balance of probabilities that they were totally unconnected with the supply of prohibited drugs"" by the applicant. It is that finding which is challenged by this ground. 

22It seems to me that that finding was open but, again, it is unnecessary to resolve the issue. For the purpose of re-sentence I also accept that the applicant knew that the weapons were not in working order and kept them for his own protection. However, it is most likely that his fear of being threatened arose from the illicit drug milieu in which he moved at the time. 

23Mr White submitted that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive, as are each of the indicative sentences. The thrust of this ground is his argument, which I accept, that his Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the origin of the applicant's drug addiction and his achievement in defeating it in recent years. In the event, this was treated by the parties as a discrete issue to which argument was directed. My finding that his Honour did fall into error in that respect enlivens this court's discretion to intervene and re-sentence the applicant. A general ground of manifest excess need not be determined.

24It is clear, and his Honour accepted, that the applicant's pattern of offending had its origin in his disturbed background and the drug addiction attributable to it. It is notable that that addiction commenced at the age of 9 or 10, an age at which his use of drugs could hardly be classified as a personal choice. There then ensued a period of consistent drug abuse and associated criminal activity. Yet after his flight to Queensland at the end of 2011, he defeated his drug addiction through his own efforts, has remained drug free, and appears to be on the path to rehabilitation.

25Mr White referred to the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346. The Chief Judge dealt with the relevance of drug addiction to sentence in a well-known passage at [273] (397-8). After dealing with the principles governing the bearing of addiction upon the offender's culpability for the crime in question, his Honour continued:

""... (c) It may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, in so far as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it, might:

(i) impact upon the prospects of recidivism/rehabilitation, in which respect it may on occasions prove to be a two-edged sword (eg Lewis Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 1 July 1992);

(ii) suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness, or surgery (cf Hodge Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 2 November 1993; and Talbot); or where it occurred at a very young age, or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete;

(iii) justify special consideration in the case of offenders judged to be at the ""cross roads"": Osenkowski(19882) 5 A Crim R 394.""

26Simpson J agreed with Wood CJ at CL on this issue (at [348]), adding some observations of her own. At [336] (410), her Honour noted that in some cases drug addiction may have its origins ""in arrogance, in an antipathetical attitude to the laws of society, or in weakness of character."" She continued:

""In other cases, I have no doubt, it has its origins in social disadvantage, poverty, emotional, financial, or social deprivation, poor educational achievement, unemployment, and the despair and loss of self-worth that can result from these circumstances or any combination of them. In this court one sometimes sees cases in which drug taking stems from sexual assault or exploitation, sometimes committed when the person who turns to drugs, and who comes before the court, is very young, and sometimes the precipitating events have occurred many years before. Drug addiction is not always the disease; it is, as often as not, a symptom of social disease.""

27Later in her judgment, her Honour said at [344] (412):

""Where circumstances such as those I have mentioned (or others equally deserving of compassion) have been the foundation for the drug addiction, and part of the causal chain leading to the commission of crime, then it would be appropriate, in my view, for the rehabilitative aspects of sentencing to assume a more significant role than might otherwise be the case. In an appropriate case, rehabilitation might outweigh other sentencing factors. In order for those circumstances to provide a reason for reduction of sentence, however, there would need to be strong evidence of real progress towards actual rehabilitation. I would not wish to be understood to be saying other than that leniency of the kind to which I refer depends heavily upon demonstrated (as distinct from theoretical) rehabilitative prospects.""

28These observations are apposite to the present case. True it is, as the Crown prosecutor in this court pointed out, that the applicant stood for sentence for a persistent course of criminal activity, against the background of an unfavourable criminal history. Further offences were taken into account when he was sentenced for both of the principal offences. Nevertheless, there was force in the submissions of counsel appearing for him in the sentence proceedings that he was ""a classic product"" of his childhood and, at the time of sentence, was ""at a cross-roads."" 

29It does not appear from his remarks on sentence that his Honour approached the matter in this way. This is a case in which the applicant was entitled to a measure of leniency for the reasons articulated by Simpson J in the passage from her judgment in Henry which I have quoted in [27] above. Equally, it is a case in which, to adopt her Honour's words in the passage last cited, it was ""appropriate...for the rehabilitative aspects of sentencing to assume a more significant role than might otherwise be the case."" There was also ""strong evidence of real progress towards actual rehabilitation."" That said, while I myself might assess his prospects of rehabilitation as better than ""somewhat guarded"", it is important that a sentence be structured so as to afford him the opportunity of a lengthy period of conditional liberty, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole. To that end, like his Honour, I would find special circumstances. 

30While taking these matters into account, it remains necessary to pass a sentence which adequately reflects the applicant's criminality. However, the non-parole period, while also meeting the need for an appropriate measure of punishment and retribution, must recognise the progress he has made towards defeating his drug addiction and encourage him to remain on that rehabilitative path. The balance of term I propose would provide for a lengthy period of supervision and maintain the sanction of parole for a further period thereafter.

31For the purpose of sentence, we received an affidavit of the applicant of 6 November 2014, and were assisted by enquiries made by the Crown prosecutor's instructing solicitor about his present custodial status. Even though his brother was not required to give evidence in the proceedings to which I have referred, he is still on protection and likely to remain so. He has completed a drug rehabilitation program, and remains drug free. He has also completed some educational programs to improve his employment prospects. His intention upon his release is to live with his mother, together with his partner and child, until he is able to obtain his own housing. 

32Accordingly, the court should intervene and resentence the applicant. I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence passed in the District Court and, in lieu, sentence the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 31 August 2012 and expiring on 30 August 2018, with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years, commencing on 31 August 2012 and expiring on 28 February 2015. I would indicate that, if an aggregate sentence had not been imposed, I would have passed the following sentences:


Count 1 (aggravated break and enter), taking into account the matters on the Form 1 - 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years; 
 

Count 2 (supplying a prohibited drug), taking into account the matters on the Form 1 - 2 ½ years; 
 

On each of the offences on the section 166 certificate - 15 months.

33RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J and with his Honour's reasons.

34I would, however, add this. I do not regard the sentence imposed at first instance as manifestly excessive as that expression is usually understood. Indeed, given the extent of the applicant's criminality for which it was imposed, it was arguably lenient.

35However, under the aegis of the ""manifestly excessive"" ground, and with the acquiescence of the Crown, were raised the issues of the circumstances in which the applicant had become drug addicted and his achievement in apparently overcoming that addiction in conjunction with obtaining, for the first time in his life, regular employment.

36For someone who was in the applicant's situation, his achievements are remarkable. They lessen greatly the weight needing to be given to personal deterrence, rehabilitation and the protection of the community in determining the length of the applicant's non parole period. No doubt his reform has its own rewards but it enables the Court also to provide some reward.

2704016,Barr v Broomby [2014] NSWSC 1852,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Paul Andrew Barr, seeks orders under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 in respect of a decision in the Local Court refusing his application for costs in the proceedings R v Paul Andrew Barr, pursuant to s 213(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

2The Local Court of NSW, the second defendant, has entered a submitting appearance. It is convenient to deal with the background to the matter before considering the relief sought.

Background facts

3On 18 February 2013, the first defendant, Detective Senior Constable Richard Broomby, charged the plaintiff, Paul Andrew Barr, with an offence of committing an act of indecency contrary to s 61N(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. It was alleged that the plaintiff indecently assaulted the complainant between 9pm and 9:30pm on 13 January 2013 at the Beach House Bar and Grill in Port Macquarie (the Beach House). The plaintiff subsequently entered a plea of not guilty to the charge and the proceedings were listed before Magistrate Hodgson in the Local Court at Port Macquarie on 29 November 2013.

4It was acknowledged by both parties, as well as the learned magistrate, that there were significant inconsistencies in the version of events depicted in the CCTV footage and that described by the complainant in the evidence she gave during examination in court. There were also inconsistencies between the complainant's statement to police and the evidence she provided in court. However, for the purposes of this judgment, it is not necessary to deal comprehensively with these inconsistencies. Rather, I have sought to outline briefly the necessary facts and will expand upon them as necessary throughout this judgment.

5On Sunday, 13 January 2013, the complainant finished work at Zebu Bar and Grill at approximately 5.00 or 5:30pm and had some dinner and drinks in the bar area. The complainant then went to the Beach House with two friends, Shay Glenville and Louise Varricvidio. It is unclear from the evidence when the plaintiff joined the complainant and her friends. It matters little; it suffices to say that the complainant was acquainted with the plaintiff's girlfriend, Sarah Sacchetti, and at some point the two, along with other friends of the plaintiff, being Tony Demsey and Jacob Hurrell, joined the complainant and her friends in the area in which they were sitting. The group continued drinking together. 

6At approximately 8.50pm, the plaintiff and the complainant went through a doorway that purportedly led to an office and a set of stairs. Upstairs, among other rooms, was a bathroom. The area was not subject to CCTV recording. I note that there is no dispute that the complainant and the plaintiff went into the office area and to the upstairs area. It is the events that occurred in the upstairs area that were the prime subject of dispute between the parties in the Local Court proceedings. The purpose of the trip to the upstairs area was also disputed by the parties.

7According to the complainant's evidence, she followed the plaintiff through an office, up the stairs and into another room or hallway. There was a doorway leading to a disabled bathroom, which the plaintiff pushed open with his left harm and pushed the complainant towards the door. The plaintiff unzipped his trousers and put his right hand on the complainant's collarbone, pushing her towards the wall and pinning her against it. The complainant could feel the plaintiff had an erection. The plaintiff started feeling around her dress, between her thigh and knee, however did not actually pull her dress up. The plaintiff tried to kiss the complainant, at which point she pushed him away and her hand connected with his nose. The plaintiff then ran out of the room. 

8The CCTV footage shows the plaintiff leaving the area at 9.02pm, approximately 13 minutes after the two entered the upstairs area. The complainant stated that she went downstairs and saw the plaintiff walking across Horton Street, the road outside the Beach Hotel. The CCTV footage shows the complainant exiting the area through the same door as the plaintiff approximately 20 seconds later. She begins talking to a male in the outdoor area. The footage shows the two move to the bar area, where they are approached by a security guard, and then depicts them leaving the Beach Hotel. The complaint reports that she then spoke with Jacob Hurrell, who walked her to Zebu Bar and Grill where she contacted her boyfriend, Samuel Ammish. Mr Ammish met the complainant at Zebu and took the complainant to the Port Macquarie Police Station where she reported the alleged incident. 

Local Court proceedings

9At the hearing, the prosecution called evidence from the first defendant and the complainant. Statements of Detective Senior Constable Griffith and Senior Constable Sanger were admitted by consent and an edited DVD of CCTV footage of the Beach House on the night of the alleged incident was played to the Court. 

10As previously noted, the complainant's recollection of the events in court was generally inconsistent with the CCTV footage. In recognising these inconsistencies, his Honour noted that the complainant ""was affected by alcohol, obviously she hasn't had the benefit of viewing the CCTV footage to refresh her memory and there's a lot she can't remember. You can't take it much further than that"" (Transcript, p 51). His Honour requested the parties to address him on the inconsistencies and prior inconsistent statements made by the complainant during her evidence. In their address, the plaintiff made submissions for a May v O'Sullivan direction: May v O'Sullivan (1955) 93 CLR 592.

11After hearing addresses from both parties, Magistrate Hodgson subsequently dismissed the charge against the plaintiff. His Honour noted, ""On an evidentiary basis it is very difficult for the prosecution because any jury would be told there are numerous inconsistencies between [the complainant's] version of what happened and what we know happened by viewing the CCTV footage before and after"" and, after weighing up the inconsistencies, ""accept[ed] the defence submission that a jury properly instructed would not convict the defendant on that evidence"" (Transcript, 54).

12Subsequent to Magistrate Hodgson dismissing the proceedings, the plaintiff made an application for costs under s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In sum, the plaintiff submitted that the prosecution did not investigate the matter properly. The plaintiff also tendered a letter from Lindeman Lawyers to the Port Macquarie Police, highlighting inconsistencies between the CCTV footage and the complainant's evidence, and inviting the prosecution to withdraw the charge. In response, the prosecution tendered the prosecution brief.

13In declining to make an order for costs and rejecting the submission that the prosecution did not properly investigate the matter, his Honour gave reasons as follows: 

""I have regard to the submission on costs. ... On paper the brief sounds pretty solid. The complainant had given a comprehensive statement and certainly her evidence today did not measure up to that statement. She says it was twelve months ago and she could not remember a lot and certainly there is a lot of discrepancies in her evidence. It is submitted that the officer in charge did not check out the crime scene and he did the right thing he tried to get CCTV footage of it and there was not any however he did get a lot of CCTV footage and the defendant has summarised that and helped the court by tendering their condensed version. It is my opinion that on the evidence the prosecution did what they had to do. They interviewed the appropriate witnesses, they complied the evidence and it appeared to be a reasonably strong case and they ran it. If they did not run the case they could have been subject to a lot of criticism. The complainant was an employee of the defendant and she made an immediate complaint well contemporaneous complaint and it was an appropriate matter for determination by the Court in my opinion."" (Transcript, 56).

14His Honour was not satisfied as to any of the grounds in s 214 and, accordingly, did not consider whether to exercise any residual discretion in s 213 to award costs to the plaintiff. 

15The plaintiff now seeks prerogative relief and submits that his Honour erred in refusing the application for costs by committing jurisdictional error and/or an error of law on the face of the record by:

(1)Failing to ask the correct questions in relation to the application under s 214(1)(c);

(2)Misapprehending or misconceiving the limits of the jurisdiction, pursuant to s 214(1)(c), by not considering all the elements of the subsection; 

(3)Taking into account irrelevant matters and failing to take into account relevant matters; and

(4)Otherwise failing to accord the plaintiff procedural fairness.

These submissions will be dealt with in detail later in these reasons. 

16I note that these proceedings were brought by way of summons filed on 3 March 2014 and amended summons filed 10 July 2014. A further amended summons was filed in Court on 30 October 2014, seeking an additional order pursuant to Rule 59.10(2) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, extending the time for the filing of the summons to 3 March 2014. The extension of time is not opposed and the extension was granted.

Jurisdiction and nature of review

17While there is no right of appeal in respect of a decision refusing an award of costs under s 213, in limited circumstances an order in the nature of prerogative relief can be sought by enlivening the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act. As there is no privative or ouster clause in respect of a decision under s 213, the power of this Court to provide relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act is available on the grounds discussed in Craig v State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 175-176; O'Brien v Hutchinson [2012] NSWSC 429 at [4]. That is, this Court has the power to issue orders in the nature of certiorari for errors of law on the face of the record and for jurisdictional error. 

18Error of law on the face of the record includes the reasons of an inferior court or tribunal: s 69(4) Supreme Court Act; see also Craig at 176-180 and the discussion of Craig, along with the reasons generally, in Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission (NSW); Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority (NSW) [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [71]-[75]. 

19Generally, jurisdictional error will be disclosed where a decision maker has: not taken into account a criterion required by law; taken into account an irrelevant criterion; utilised the wrong test or asked itself the wrong question; or misapprehended the nature or limits of its powers as a consequence of which it has performed an act or made a decision (or not done so), which is not sanctioned by authority: see, inter alia, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; (1986) 162 CLR 24. 

20Further, jurisdictional error will occur if there were a denial of procedural fairness. Yet, at all times, the distinction between a merit review and judicial review must be kept in mind, otherwise we are ""apt to encourage a slide into impermissible merit review"": Swift v SAS Trustee Corp [2010] NSWCA 182 at [45].

21The immense pressure and workload born by Magistrates in Local Courts is well recognised, and accordingly, the terms of any reasons for judgment are not to be scrutinised with an eye focused on finding error: see, e.g. Western Freight Management Pty Ltd v Roads and Maritime Services NSW [2013] NSWSC 260 at [70] and [83]; O'Brien at [14]. Instead, their substance is to be examined to determine whether the correct test was applied. It is a well-accepted principle that it is not appropriate for the Court to examine reasons with a critical eye attuned to error: see, for example, Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 456; (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287. This principle was summarised succinctly by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6; (1996) 185 CLR 259, where their Honours said, at 272:

""...the reasons of an administrative decision maker are meant to inform and not be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed"". 

22I am required to abide by the above principles when considering the appeal to this Court. 

23I note, as it was an issue raised before me, that as the current proceedings regard a purported failure of the Local Court to make an order in the plaintiff's favour, rather than review of an order made against him, the provisions of ss 52 and 53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 are not applicable.

Relevant legislation

24Section 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that a court may award costs in criminal proceedings only in accordance with that Act. Section 213 provides that a court may award costs at the end of summary proceedings in favour of an accused person if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn, subject to the limitations outlined in s 214. 

25Section 214(1) relevantly provides: 

""214 Limit on award of professional costs to accused person against prosecutor acting in public capacity

(1) Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following:

(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,

(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,

(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, 

(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.""

26The onus rests on the applicant for costs to demonstrate that he or she meets the legislative criteria: Fosse v DPP [1999] NSWSC 367 at [16]; Southon & Ors v Plath [2010] NSWCCA 292 at [68]. This onus extends to satisfying the court of a component part of s 214(1) upon which a discretionary determination may be based. With respect to s 214(1)(c), this requires the plaintiff to establish: 

(1) That the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate or investigate properly;

(2) Any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware;

(3) Which suggested that the accused person might not be guilty or for any other reason the proceedings should not have been brought.

27That is, the applicant must identify both the ""matter"" of which the prosecution was or ought to have been aware and show that this matter suggested the applicant may not be guilty, or that the proceeding should not have been brought: Cliftleigh Haulage Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [2007] NSWCCA 13 at [20], considering an equivalent provision, being s 70(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. A relevant ""matter"" must be a matter of fact or evidence: Andrews v Ardler & Brown [2013] NSWDC 94 at [50]. Further, s 214(1)(c) does not apply to every failure to investigate a matter, only those failures that the court considers to be ""unreasonable"". 

28It is recognised that the onus imported on the applicant to establish one or more of the grounds in s 214(1) is a ""heavy onus"": N v A [2012] NSWCA 318 at [17]. His Honour, Barrett JA, with whom Meagher JA agreed, continued, at [17], that: 

""Appellate intervention will generally be warranted [in relation to a costs order] only if the primary tribunal's decision was affected by an erroneous view of the law or the facts, by failure to take relevant considerations into account or by the taking of irrelevant considerations into account; or if the result is plainly unreasonable or unjust: Maiden v Maiden [1909] HCA 16 ; (1909) 7 CLR 727; Gronow v Gronow [1979] HCA 63 ; (1979) 144 CLR 513.""

29In considering whether the reasons disclose a jurisdictional error or error of law on the face of the record, it must be remembered that a court's reasons for dismissing an application for costs need not be as extensive as, for example, a court's reasons for finding an offence proved or not proved. As their Honours, Maxwell P and Kellam JA, noted in Luxmore Pty Ltd v Hydedale Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 212 at [12]: 

""In the ordinary case, it is both appropriate and desirable that a costs question be decided at the conclusion of argument. Rarely will it be necessary for a judge to give detailed reasons for decision adverting to every matter debated in argument. This court will assume, as should the parties, that every matter addressed in argument on costs has been considered. This court will set its face against any proposition which would require judges disposing of questions of costs to give elaborate reasons.""

30A number of aspects of s 214(1) involve the exercise of a normative judgment on the part of the court. For example, whether something was ""unreasonable"", ""improper"" or whether there were ""exceptional circumstances"" is an evaluative exercise. As his Honour, Justice Beech-Jones noted, with which I respectfully agree, conclusions by the Local Court on these determinations are very much a matter of opinion: O'Brien at [9]. 

31As has been recognised on numerous occasions by this Court and others, the formation of an opinion preparatory to the exercise of a discretion is not readily susceptible to review for error of law, unless such a conclusion lacks a legally defensible foundation in the factual matter or in logic: Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81; (1985) 159 CLR 550; Luu v Renevier (1989) 91 ALR 39 at [50]; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo (1995) 57 FCR 194. Further, a number of phrases in s 214(1) are ""not technical legal phrases but words which have a 'common understanding'"": O'Brien at [10].

32It should also be noted that the decision to award costs in criminal proceedings is an exercise of discretion. However, the exercise of this discretion is not wholly unfettered and is one that can only be invoked once the relevant decision maker has been satisfied both that the criteria in s 213 have been met and that none of the limitations in s 214 apply. 

The Appeal to this Court

Did his Honour err in failing to take into account relevant considerations?

33The plaintiff asserts the ""relevant matter"" in the current proceedings is threefold, namely: 

(1)The failure to speak to two witnesses, Mr Daniel Sciascia and the security guard depicted in the CCTV footage speaking with the complainant shortly after the alleged incident; 

(2)The failure to visit the alleged crime scene; and

(3)The failure to take into account all of the video evidence in the prosecution's possession. 

34The plaintiff submits that the learned magistrate, by failing to address each isolated matter, failed to exercise the jurisdiction prescribed by s 214(1)(c) and failed to address the case being put to him. The plaintiff submits these failures are so fundamental as to amount to jurisdictional error. 

35The plaintiff also relies on the statement of his Honour as to the complainant's employment to establish a failure to accord procedural fairness and otherwise establish jurisdictional error. One of the fundamental propositions underlying the plaintiff's complaint is that this statement was erroneous. 

Failure to speak to relevant witnesses

36In the Local Court proceedings, the learned Magistrate rejected the plaintiff's submission that the prosecutor's failure to interview both Mr Sciascia and the security guard at the Beach House, as well as their failure to visit and investigate the scene of the alleged incident, satisfied the criteria in s 214(1)(c) for an award of costs. 

37The plaintiff submits that the failure of the prosecution to interview Mr Sciascia or the security guard, in light of the CCTV footage, was unreasonable as if Mr Sciascia's evidence was accepted it may have suggested a lack of guilt on the part of the plaintiff. As such, the plaintiff submits that his Honour's finding that the prosecution interviewed the ""appropriate witnesses"" was a significant factual error and was a finding not open to his Honour, particularly given his Honour's comments regarding Mr Sciascia on the May v O'Sullivan direction. 

38The first defendant submits, in essence, that unless it can be said that the magistrate's finding that the prosecution had interviewed all appropriate witnesses was not open to his Honour, this matter is not susceptible to judicial review. 

39The proceedings involve an alleged indecent assault with no eyewitnesses. As such, contemporaneous statements or events are particularly relevant to the merits of the matter. The complainant made contemporaneous statements regarding the alleged incident to three persons, being Samuel Ammish, Tony Demsey and Jacob Mark Hurrell. Both Mr Dempsey and Mr Hurrell were present at the Beach Hotel on the night of the alleged incident. The police spoke with and obtained statements from these persons, which were part of the brief of evidence. The statements of these witnesses broadly corroborate the complainant's account of the incident to police, as evidenced by her statement. 

40The statement of Detective Griffith notes that the police were aware, by viewing the CCTV footage, that two other persons spoke with the complainant after the alleged incident however they did not make further inquiries to ascertain their identities. It is not clear, from the evidence before the Court, whether the prosecution made inquiries of the complainant about her conversation with these two persons, being Mr Sciascia and the security guard. It is accepted that speaking with Mr Sciascia or the security guard may have been a relevant line of inquiry. However, s 214(1)(c) draws a distinction between a failure to investigate relevant evidence and a failure to investigate evidence ""which suggest[s] that the accused person might not be guilty or for any other reason the proceedings should not have been brought"". 

41It was accepted by the parties, and this fact was made clear to his Honour, that Mr Sciascia and the security guard were persons to whom no report of the alleged incident was made, nor were they eyewitnesses to the alleged incident (Transcript, p 18): cf the circumstances in Cliftleigh Haulage. Thus, while both Mr Sciascia and the security guard may have been able to provide relevant evidence, that is, for example, that the complainant was present at the Beach Hotel on the night of the alleged incident, on the evidence currently before the Court it cannot be accepted that the evidence of either would suggest, or provide any support for the proposition, that the plaintiff might not be guilty of the offence or that the proceedings should not have been brought for any other reason. 

42Nor can it be reasonably suggested that the CCTV footage, or the complainant's statement, suggests that inquiry of Mr Sciascia or the security guard may suggest that the accused might not be guilty. As such, it cannot be said that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate, or to investigate properly, a relevant matter for the purposes of s 214(1)(c) by failing to call or interview either or both as witnesses. Moreover, it is not alleged that the prosecutor failed to call any witnesses to whom the complainant reported the alleged incident. 

43I note that it cannot be said that the complainant's failure to report the incident to a person with whom she was merely acquainted, being Mr Sciascia, or a complete stranger, being the security guard, would enable a prosecutor to infer that the proceedings should not have been brought against the plaintiff. It is well recognised that many persons who have experienced sexual or indecent assault do not report the incident until sometime later, and often will not even report it to persons with whom they are very close. Thus, the absence of a statement by the complainant to either Mr Sciascia or to the security guard regarding the alleged incident cannot be used to infer the plaintiff's guilt or innocence. 

44It was open to his Honour to conclude that the prosecutor interviewed the ""appropriate witnesses"" and thereby reject the plaintiff's submission that the failure to interview Mr Sciascia and the security guard constituted a failure to take into account a relevant matter for the purposes of s 214(1)(c). I am not satisfied that this conclusion demonstrates a misconstruction of the nature of his Honour's function as prescribed by s 214(1)(c) and accordingly I do not consider his Honour fell into jurisdictional error. 

Failure to visit alleged crime scene

45It is in evidence that there was no CCTV footage of the area in which the alleged incident occurred. As such, in the Local Court proceedings counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the failure of the police to visit the alleged crime scene constituted an unreasonable failure to investigate under section 214(1)(c). In support of this submission, the plaintiff suggested that the layout of the upstairs area ""may have been entirely different to what was alleged"" by the complainant. 

46While it can be accepted that the credibility of the complainant may have been undermined if her description of the upstairs area was inaccurate, it was not put to the complainant that the area was not as she described. Nor does any of the evidence suggest that her description of the area was anything other than accurate. There has not been a submission made, nor from the evidence before this Court could one have been made, which suggests that viewing the alleged crime scene could have made a significant difference in the criminal prosecution. 

47The learned magistrate was required to take into account any unreasonable failures by the prosecution to investigate a matter that was not only relevant, but capable of suggesting either the innocence of the plaintiff or another reason for why the proceedings should not have been brought. There is no suggestion that the failure of the prosecution to view the upstairs area would have been able to satisfy his Honour of these matters. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that his Honour's failure to specifically address this submission in his reasons evidences an error of law. 

Failure to take into account all of the relevant CCTV footage 

48The police seized approximately 32 hours of CCTV footage, which covered several areas of the Beach Hotel for the period surrounding the alleged incident. In the Local Court proceedings, the first defendant gave evidence that he, Mr Lindeman and a technical expert went through the CCTV footage and condensed it to a DVD of approximately an hour, consisting of the relevant footage. The first defendant was not cross-examined on this point, nor was it put to him that he had not viewed the entire 32 hours of footage. 

49The plaintiff submits that a principal concern of the Magistrate should have been the substantial inconsistencies between the complainant's statement and the CCTV footage, particularly the differing evidence in relation to times (Transcript, 19). The plaintiff also points to the complainant's failure to mention the first person she came into contact with, being Mr Sciascia. 

50The prosecution, while acknowledging the inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence before the Local Court, submits that the inconsistencies did not arise on comparing the complainant's statement with the CCTV footage. Specifically, the CCTV footage was consistent with the complainant's evidence in two important respects, being that both depicted the complainant and the plaintiff proceeding upstairs together and returning downstairs within minutes of each other. 

51Aside from the description of the alleged incident, the statement of the complainant to police is relatively vague when describing the night. That being said, the complainant's statement is mostly consistent with the CCTV footage. For example, the complainant states that she and her friends were drinking with the plaintiff prior to the alleged incident; that she and the plaintiff went to the upstairs area together; and that the plaintiff returned from the upstairs area slightly prior to her coming downstairs. The complainant also stated, at [16], that when she went downstairs she saw the plaintiff power walking towards the Fig Café. This statement accords with the CCTV footage at 9.02pm and plaintiff's counsel's interpretation of where the plaintiff was walking (Transcript p 17, line 40). 

52There were, however, inconsistencies between the complainant's statement and the CCTV footage. For example, the complainant's statement said she and the plaintiff went upstairs ""between 9.00pm and 9.30pm"" and did not provide any estimate of the time the two remained upstairs. The CCTV footage depicts the two going through the door to the upstairs area at approximately 8:49pm. The complainant's statement also omits to mention speaking with either Mr Sciascia or the security guard. 

53At most, this slight difference in time estimation could only be classified as a minor inconsistency. I also do not consider the omissions in the complainant's statement, when compared with the CCTV footage, were sufficiently persuasive to affect the complainant's credibility to the extent that her statement would be entirely inconsistent with the plaintiff's guilt, or sufficient to suggest that the proceedings should not have been brought.

54The significant inconsistencies between the complainant's evidence and the CCTV footage arose for the first time in the complainant's oral evidence, particularly during cross-examination. As I have previously noted, these inconsistencies were recognised by both the parties and the learned magistrate. The major inconsistences in the complainant's oral evidence concern the duration of the alleged incident and her recollection of the events immediately following, including talking to Mr Sciascia. 

55The complainant estimated the time from when she entered the upstairs toilets to the plaintiff leaving the area to be ""five, seven minutes if that"" (Transcript, p 31 line 13; p 46), whereas the time markings on the CCTV footage show the time elapsed as being approximately 13 minutes. While this is arguably a significant inconsistency, the proposition that a witness would be able to recall precisely the amount of time spent in a particular area nearly 12 months prior is one that I would reject. 

56Under cross-examination the complainant denied having seen or spoken to Mr Sciascia on the night of the alleged incident, nor does she recall being asked to leave by the security guard, assuming this is what occurred when the security guard approached her in the bar area. The complainant also agreed, under cross-examination, that she did not inform the police in her statement that one of the reasons she went upstairs with the plaintiff was to use the toilet (Transcript, p 37). 

57Section 214(1)(c) does not provide an entitlement to costs where one aspect of the evidence is found to be unmaintainable because of contrary evidence put forward by the defence, or because the prosecution evidence has effectively been undermined in cross-examination: Southon v Plath at [73] per Beazley JA (considering s 257D(1)(c) Criminal Procedure Act, which is in equivalent terms to s 214(1)(c)). The fact that a witness's evidence, once subject to cross-examination, is not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt an element of the offence does not, of itself, prove that the prosecution failed to investigate a matter of which it was aware or ought to have been aware. Moreover, that there was a conflict in the complainant's evidence does not suggest there was an unreasonable failure to investigate: Director-General, New South Wales Department of Industry and Investment v Coomes [2012] NSWLEC 251 at [71]. 

58A magistrate considering whether the conditions of s 214(1)(c) are satisfied is not to apply the benefit of hindsight: Endycott (Roads and Maritime Services) v Bulga Coal Management Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1124 at [56] per Grove AJ (considering s 257D(1)(d) Criminal Procedure Act, which is in substantially the same terms as s 214(1)(c)). Thus, while the learned magistrate would have been aware, and in fact noted, that the complainant's evidence in court did not measure up to her prior statement to police or the CCTV footage, the significant inconsistencies in her evidence arose during the trial and were not apparent from the prosecution brief. 

59Furthermore, the inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence have to be viewed as part of the whole of the evidence collected by the prosecution. I have already noted that contemporaneous statements were made to other persons about the alleged incident, which persons provided statements that broadly corroborated the complainant's statement to police. In determining whether costs should be awarded under s 214(1)(c), the learned magistrate was correct in acknowledging these discrepancies, yet concluding that, on the paper brief, it was an appropriate matter for determination by the court. In making this finding, I do not consider the learned magistrate misconstrued a limit on his Honour's power as prescribed by the legislation. 

60With the exception of the discrepancies between the complainant's statement and the CCTV footage, the plaintiff has failed to particularise what ""relevant"" CCTV footage the prosecution failed to take into account. Counsel for the plaintiff seemed to suggest that the prosecution should have taken into account the plaintiff's behaviour earlier in the evening, such as the plaintiff's apparent dismissal of the complainant when she appears to reach out her arms towards him as he is walking past the area where the group is drinking, as being relevant to the plaintiff's innocence or guilt. Assuming this is the relevant CCTV footage that the prosecution failed to take into account, I do not see how it can be accepted that this would have any bearing on the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff. Nor can the fact, if it be the fact, that the complainant appears to have been acting in a friendly manner toward the plaintiff prior to the alleged incident be suggestive of the innocence of the plaintiff. 

61Further, I do not accept the plaintiff's submission that the complainant's apparent ""jovial"" appearance in the CCTV footage when she is speaking with Mr Sciascia, or the fact that she gave him a hug, suggests that the plaintiff may be innocent of the alleged conduct.

Did his Honour err in taking into account irrelevant considerations?

62The plaintiff submits that the Local Court's decision not to make an order as to costs is partly based on his Honour's view that if the case had not been run, the prosecution may have been subject to criticism. The plaintiff also points to his Honour's comment about the complainant's employment as an irrelevant consideration.  

63With respect to counsel for the plaintiff, I consider the plaintiff's interpretation of his Honour's reasons is misconstrued. In noting that the prosecution may be criticised were they not to run the case, his Honour, albeit in short form, appears to have been summarising his assessment of the strength of the prosecution case based on the evidence before him. This included the brief of evidence which was tendered on the costs application and the other evidence that adduced throughout the Local Court proceedings. Both parties were aware of the evidence tendered to support the charge and were given opportunities to address his Honour on its sufficiency. 

64In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40; (1986) 162 CLR 24, Mason J observed, at 41: 

""...in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising the statutory power. I say 'generally' because both principle and authority indicate that in some circumstances a court may set aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance. The preferred ground on which this is done, however, is not the failure to take into account relevant considerations or the taking into account of irrelevant considerations, but that the decision is ""manifestly unreasonable"". This ground of review was considered by Lord Greene M.R. in Wednesbury Corporation, in which his Lordship said that it would only be made out if it were shown that the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have come to it."" [references omitted].

65It cannot be suggested that, in coming to the conclusion that ""If they [the prosecution] did not run it they could have been subject to a lot of criticism"", his Honour was taking into account an irrelevant consideration or that his decision was ""manifestly unreasonable"". Rather, his Honour was undertaking the exact process required of him by s 214(1)(c), being determining if, on the evidence, the matter was suitable for determination by the court and whether the prosecution failed to investigate, or properly investigate, any relevant matter. 

66To interpret his Honour's comment regarding the potential for public criticism as an ""irrelevant consideration"" would be to over zealously scrutinise his Honour's reasons and to act contrary to the well-established principles articulated in Wu Shan Liang. Accordingly, I do not consider that this statement by his Honour discloses any irregularity. 

67Similarly, his Honour's comment regarding the complainant's employment was a finding of fact, review of which would involve examining the merits. Furthermore, I do not consider his Honour placed any weight on this fact in coming to his decision. 

Did his Honour otherwise fail to accord the plaintiff procedural fairness

68Procedural fairness depends, fundamentally, on the circumstances of the hearing and its statutory context: R v Commonwealth Conciliation & Arbitration Commission; Ex parte Angliss Group (1969) 122 CLR 546 at 552-3. As stated by Kitto J in Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1963) 113 CLR 475 at 504:

""What the law requires in the discharge of a quasi-judicial function is judicial fairness. That is not a label for any fixed body of rules. What is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances.""

69In Kioa v West, Mason J, at 587, explained: 

""...Recent decisions illustrate the importance which the law attaches to the need to bring to a person's attention the critical issue or factor on which the administrative decision is likely to turn so that he may have an opportunity of dealing with it"". 

70Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the practical effect of the alleged denial of procedural fairness with which the courts are concerned and procedural fairness is not determined in the abstract. The concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; (2003) 214 CLR 1. 

71More recently, in Warkworth Mining Ltd v Bulga Milbrodale Progress Association Inc [2014] NSWCA 105; (2014) 307 ALR 262, the Court of Appeal summarised the principles of procedural fairness, and noted, at [41]-[42], that: 
""...where a court determines a matter on a basis that was not in issue or argued in the proceedings, there will have been a denial of procedural fairness... That general principle is, however, subject to an important qualification, stated at the practical level, by asking, 'Would further information possibly have made any difference to the decision'"". (Citations omitted).

72The plaintiff points to the following conclusions of his Honour and submits that, as these conclusions were not raised with his Honour by counsel, counsel was not given an opportunity to be heard in regard to these matters:

(1)That if the police did not run the case they could be subject to criticism;

(2)On the paper the brief sounded pretty solid;

(3)That the complainant was an employee of the defendant.

73I have already dealt with the comments of his Honour regarding (1) and (3). The only remaining conclusion is his Honour's remark regarding the brief of evidence. 

74The brief was tendered by the prosecution in the course of their submissions regarding costs. It can be assumed that the prosecutor was aware of everything in the brief of evidence and the obvious lines of inquiry arising from it. The prosecutor was also under an obligation, arising from the Guidelines made in accordance with the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, to disclose all relevant material as prescribed by those regulations to the accused: see R v Lipton [2011] NSWCCA 247; (2011) 82 NSWLR 123. There is nothing before the Court to suggest that the plaintiff did not receive the brief of evidence in this matter. Nor did the plaintiff object when the brief was tendered by the prosecution. 

75Fundamental to the process of procedural fairness is that a party is provided with an adequate opportunity to prepare and to present that party's case. Both parties were aware of the contents, or at least, the substantial contents, of the brief of evidence. Both parties were accorded an opportunity to respond, and did respond, to the matters relevant to deciding the application for costs. Procedural fairness does not go so far as to require his Honour to ensure each party utilises the opportunity given to their advantage (Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 343 per Deane J), nor to have notified the parties of his thought process when considering the application (Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 592).

76As earlier stated, procedural fairness depends on the statutory context for the decision-making process. It cannot be said that his Honour's conclusion on whether or not the brief appeared to support the maintaining of a charge against the plaintiff was anything other than a conclusion he was required to make in exercising his jurisdiction under s 214(1)(c) Criminal Procedure Act. Accordingly, this ground must be dismissed. 

Conclusion

77For the foregoing reasons, I am not satisfied that the record in the present case discloses jurisdictional error or an error of law. While his Honour did not independently address each of the submissions on the costs application raised by the plaintiff, it is clear that his Honour considered the issues that were before him and came to a conclusion that was required by law. 

78I make the following orders:

(1)Order that there be an extension of time until 3 March 2014 for the filing of the summons, pursuant to rule 59.10(2) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005;

(2)The summons be dismissed;

(3)The plaintiff is to pay the first defendant's costs of and incidental to the proceedings, as agreed or assessed.

		23 December 2014",2014-12-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704037,Wayne v The Owners Corporation SP64622 (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 245,"Judgment

1The plaintiff by notice of motion filed on 20 November 2014 seeks the following orders:

(1)The defendants serve on the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified by affidavit in accordance with UCPR 22.3 in answer to the interrogatories, a draft of which is annexure 'A' to the affidavit of David Wayne sworn on 20 November 2014 in these proceedings.

(2)Such further or other order as the court thinks fit.

(3)Costs of this motion to be costs in the cause.

2The affidavit in support asserts that the questions to which the plaintiff seeks answers are necessary ""as they directly relate to the matters complained of and the real issues in dispute"" on the basis that ""I believe the defendants have communicated a slander"". The plaintiff seeks to interrogate the defendants ""to enable the plaintiff to properly plead my [sic] case against the defendants"" (paragraph 8).

3I will not set out the text of the 94 proposed interrogatories. There are 16 questions administered to the third defendant, 29 to the fourth defendant, 29 to the fifth defendant and 20 to the sixth defendant. The matters the subject of enquiry range from whether the sixth defendant is a Justice of the Peace, the ""evidence"" provided to substantiate the matter complained of, whether complaints were made to the police (and if so, what was said), and ""in what respects do you allege that the words constituted an unfair or inaccurate report"" in relation to a document the plaintiff asserts was tendered at the meeting.

4The basis upon which the plaintiff seeks the interrogatories is that they are ""necessary"" (r 22.1(4) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW)) in that they ""directly relate to the matters complained of"" and ""the real issues in dispute"". Counsel for the defendants have pointed out, in their respective helpful submissions, that there is no evidence:

(a)As to the information presently in the plaintiff's possession;

(b)As to the efforts (including conversations, correspondence, subpoenas or other materials) the plaintiff has made to obtain information;

(c)The extent to which those efforts have borne fruit;

(d)As to why he has repeatedly changed the content, timing and circumstances of the slanders pleaded in the four statements of claim filed during the course of 2014;

(e)As to where he obtained the very specific and lengthy terms of the slander he has pleaded at Paragraph 9 of the Amended Statement of Claim filed 13 November 2014, and as to why he considers this source so unreliable that he requires interrogatories.

5The text of the publication in the currently pleaded statement of claim could not be clearer. What is asserted is that the fourth and fifth defendants uttered separate slanders at the meeting on 30 April 2013 in front of the persons present, who are listed. The third defendant is their employer. The basis upon which the sixth defendant remains in the litigation is unclear, but that is principally because no words are attributed to him.

6This application is misconceived. The plaintiff has conflated the entitlement of a party to ask interrogatories at the close of interlocutory steps with the very limited entitlement of a plaintiff to seek interrogatories in order to establish that a defendant has published allegedly defamatory matters to a person or persons whom the plaintiff has so far been unable to identify, and/or on occasions he has so far been unable to specify.

7The nature of this special exception is explained by Hunt J in Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd [1982] 1 NSWLR 294. The evidence before the court on that occasion is described by Hunt J at 295-296 as follows:

""Evidence has been led by the plaintiff (including a memorandum produced on subpoena by GMAC recording the relevant telephone communication from the defendant) which establishes at least one of the publications of which complaint is made in the statement of claim. It is conceded by the defendant that its business is that of a credit agency. It is, in my view, a matter of general knowledge or notoriety that the nature of such a business is to collect information relating to the credit-worthiness of traders and consumers and to supply that information to members or subscribers who may make credit checks concerning traders or consumers. Such information is generally supplied pursuant to a contractual duty to do so.

If in the case of GMAC the defendant published the statement that the plaintiff had been made bankrupt, the inference is in my view clearly open from the very nature of the defendant's business that the same or similar information has been published to any other inquirer concerning the plaintiff's credit. This is a sufficient indication of the nature or the purport of the publication to those other subscribers concerning which discovery is sought: Macintosh v Dun (1904) 21 WN (NSW) 200, at p 201.

...

Thus, without reliance upon this additional material in the memorandum, I infer that the defendant would have published statements that the plaintiff had been made bankrupt to persons other than GMAC. In these circumstances, the application cannot, in my view, be characterized and dismissed as a fishing expedition.""

8Similarly, an order was made in Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 11. The issue there was publication outside Australia. Nicholas J said at [8]-[9]:

""[8] Neither party has adduced any evidence of actual international publication of the matters complained of. The plaintiff submitted that it is a matter of notoriety or general knowledge that ""The Sydney Morning Herald"" is a, if not the, principal newspaper in Australia with nationwide circulation from which it may be inferred that it is likely that the edition sued upon were published in places beyond Australia. For the defendant it was acknowledged that it could be reasonably inferred that it is the usual practice of the defendant to make the newspaper available in places overseas (T p 30). Nevertheless, it did not accept that the matters complained of had been published in any form outside Australia (T pp 9, 10). It was put that, absent evidence from the plaintiff, the question of the likelihood of such publication was speculative only, and the basis for the inference had not been established.

[9] In this case, the inference in my view is clearly open. Although the defendant's concession is not, in terms, an admission that the matters complained of were in fact published to any person in a place or places beyond Australia, it is consistent with, at least, the likelihood that they were. This conclusion is reinforced by the absence of evidence from the defendant of any departure from its usual practice, or otherwise to the contrary. If the matters complained of were not published beyond Australia it was open to the defendant to say so and, to adopt the words of Reynolds, J in Oswin v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd (1968) 1 NSWR 461 at 463, I am unimpressed by the argument that the plaintiff must fail because he did not show affirmatively that such publication did take place. In any event, and regardless of the defendant's acknowledgement, I accept the plaintiff's submission that it may be inferred from the very nature of the defendant's newspaper and its business that it is likely that editions containing the matters complained were published beyond Australia, for example, in embassies and in aeroplanes.""

9Finally, in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club [2013] NSWSC 1101 the plaintiff brought proceedings for defamation against the persons who spoke to a broadcaster (as opposed to the broadcaster) relying upon the transcript of the interview and working backwards. McCallum J noted (at [25]) that the pleading of the oral publication in relation to certain of those defendants was embarrassing, because it did not provide the whole of any single publication sought to be sued on, or the context, in circumstances where it was clear from the transcript that words had been spoken, but the nature of what those words were was not the subject of precise identification. Her Honour accordingly made an order as follows (at [29]):

""[29] Dealing with the last point first, in my view no order should be made for the sixth defendant to answer interrogatories in the terms served. As submitted on his behalf, the form of the interrogatories is dense and confusing and is complicated by the inclusion of the phrases ""relating to"" and the phrase I have elsewhere described as ""the rogue conjunction"", namely ""and/or"". The plaintiff in my view is entitled to no more than leave to administer an interrogatory (if at all) in the terms proposed by Ms Wass, as follows:

Did you say [X] or words to that effect?

and

If so, what were the exact words spoken?""

10Her Honour explained the reason for this order (at [36]) as follows:

""[36] The appropriate course in my view is to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to draft a further form of interrogatory which he would seek to have answered. I would indicate that, if the sixth defendant objects to the further interrogatories proposed, I would not grant leave to administer any interrogatory that went further than to pose a question in the terms suggested as being appropriate by Ms Wass in her written submissions at para 6. Whether that question should be posed by reference to the transcript of the interview from The Sunday Telegraph or some other material is perhaps a matter upon which the parties could agree. But absent agreement, the transcript of the interview in The Sunday Telegraph appears to me to be the appropriate point of reference for the plaintiff's proposed claim against Mr Irvine.""

11None of these exceptions apply in this case. First, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has failed to establish that he is unable to frame his cause of action precisely, or that he requires interrogatories in order to do so (Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club at [31] and [35]; Atkinson v Fosbroke (1866) LR 1 QB 628; Russell v Stubbs Ltd [1913] 2 KB 200). Mr Richardson submits, and I accept, that the plaintiff is attempting to ""see if he can find a case... of which at present he knows nothing"" (Russell v Stubbs Ltd at [204]).

12Secondly, there is no evidence of uncertainty as to what was said. In Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club McCallum J had a transcript before her in circumstance where a question arose as to the accuracy of material in that transcript. No comparable evidence exists here and the plaintiff cannot establish that his interrogatories are unnecessary.

13Thirdly, the nature of the questions asked indicate that the plaintiff is not only on a fishing expedition, but, by reason of the sheer number of questions irrelevant to the issue of publication, making a request which is both oppressive and futile: Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd at 297C and 297E.

14The plaintiff referred in his submissions, on a number of occasions, to having sought these interrogatories because he is a litigant in person. As I indicated in my previous judgment (Wayne v The Owners Corporation SP64622 [2014] NSWDC 217), the fact that a party to litigation is self-represented is not a licence to bring hopeless applications before the court (see Mbuzi v Hall [2010] QSC 359; Mbuzi v Griffith University [2014] FCA 1323). 

15Accordingly the plaintiff's notice of motion will be dismissed with costs.

Application for summary dismissal by the sixth defendant

16The statement of claim in its current form does not plead that the sixth defendant said any words. The closest the plaintiff gets to a claim against the sixth defendant is that another person has said that the sixth defendant is prepared to make a statement in relation to issues raised in the matter complained of. An earlier claim that the sixth defendant answered the telephone, and then made statements of and concerning the plaintiff of a defamatory nature, has been deleted.

17The plaintiff is not ready to meet this separate application and this argument has accordingly been listed on Thursday 19 February 2015 for hearing. No defences need to be filed until this application has been determined.

An additional issue

18At the request of Mr Richardson, I have varied order 10 of my judgment order of 30 October 2014 to include the phrase ""and payable"" between words ""assessable"" and ""forthwith"".

Orders

(1)Plaintiff's notice of motion filed on 20 November 2014 is dismissed.

(2)Plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.

(3)Stand over to Thursday 19 February 2015 at 2:00pm the sixth defendant's application for summary dismissal.

(4)Vary order 10 of Gibson DCJ's orders of 30 October 2014 to read: ""The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the third to sixth defendants of this application, including the costs of 2 May 2014, 20 June 2014, 29 August 2014, 10 October 2014 and today (30 October 2014), assessable and payable forthwith and on an indemnity basis.""

		18 December 2014",2014-12-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704041,Smith v R [2014] NSWCCA 316,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  On 16 December 2011 at the Penrith Local Court the applicant pleaded guilty to the gross negligence manslaughter of a six year old child (by failing to obtain medical assistance) who was murdered by his de facto partner on 13 July 2010 and to being an accessory after the fact to her murder, that offence having been committed between 13 July 2010 and 21 April 2011.
2Manslaughter is an offence contrary to s18(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 and subject to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.  The accessorial charge which is contrary to s18(1)(a)/349(1) Crimes Act 1900 is also subject to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.
3Sentence proceedings were heard before Latham J on 15 February, 1 March and 15 March 2013.  On 3 May 2013 her Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:
Manslaughter:  imprisonment for a fixed term of 7 years to commence 22 April 2011 and expire 21 April 2018.Accessory after the fact to murder:  imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 22 April 2014 and expiring on 21 April 2023 with a balance of term of 4 years to expire 21 April 2027.
The total sentence was one of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.
4The applicant has sought leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds:
(1)A lesser sentence is warranted in law due to the assistance given by the applicant to the authorities in relation to his co-offender, Kristi Abrahams.
(2)Her Honour erred in not finding that there was any diminution in moral culpability arising from the relationship between the applicant and the deceased.
(3)The sentence for the offence of accessory after the fact of murder was manifestly excessive.
(4)Her Honour erred in:
(a)Imposing a sentence of 13 years for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder when she intended to fix a sentence of 12 years.
(b)Imposing an aggregate sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years rather than a total aggregate sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years 3 months.
(c)Failing to impose a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder.
Factual background
5The sentence hearing proceeded on the basis of a lengthy statement of agreed facts prepared by the Crown which her Honour summarised in the sentence judgment at pp 2-8.
6The applicant, who was aged 34 at the time of sentence, commenced a relationship with Ms Abrahams in 2006.  She had a daughter, the deceased, who was born in  April 2004 during her relationship with a former partner.  This relationship ended following an assault by Ms Abrahams on the deceased on 3 July 2005.  The child's father reported the assault to the police.  Ms Abrahams was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was convicted of that offence on 1 May 2006 in the Local Court.  She received a s9 bond for a period of 12 months.
7The deceased was placed in foster care for 18 months.  Ms Abrahams was directed to enter into a parental care plan to attend anger management and counselling programs.  She was allowed supervised access to the deceased.
8The deceased was restored to Ms Abrahams' custody on 23 December 2006.  At that time she and the applicant rented premises in Mount Druitt being a two bedroom unit on the first floor.  The applicant adopted the role of father to the deceased and thought of himself as her father.  The applicant and Ms Abrahams subsequently had two children together, one born in February 2008 and the other in July 2010.  The deceased occupied one bedroom of the unit while Ms Abrahams and the applicant shared the second bedroom with the other two children.
9At about 9.30am on 1 August 2010 Ms Abrahams called triple 0 and reported the deceased missing from her bedroom and the front door of the unit open.  She told police that the applicant was searching for the missing child.  Police undertook a large scale search and investigation but the deceased could not be found.
10Ms Abrahams and the applicant were interviewed by the police on two occasions, in August and September 2010.  They each gave false accounts of the deceased's disappearance.  They maintained that they put the deceased to bed at about 9.30pm.  They further maintained that Ms Abrahams discovered the deceased missing from her bedroom at about 9.30am as she was returning from the bathroom.  She said that she woke the applicant to look for the deceased while she rang triple 0.  The applicant told police that he was yelling out the deceased's name throughout the neighbourhood, although none of the neighbours heard or saw anything consistent with that version of events.
11The applicant claimed in the course of his interview with police that the deceased was a normal, happy child and that Ms Abrahams' parenting was in no way inappropriate.  He said that Ms Abrahams did no more than administer ""a little smack"" to the deceased if she misbehaved.  He described the relationship between Ms Abrahams and the deceased as ""good"" and denied that he or Ms Abrahams would do anything to harm the child.
12The investigation generated a significant amount of national media attention, which included the applicant speaking on behalf of Ms Abrahams and asking for anyone who knew anything to come forward and contact the police.  He and Ms Abrahams took part in a number of media interviews, including an article published in ""Who"" Magazine.  In  interviews on the ABC and by the Daily Telegraph the applicant denied having anything to do with the child's disappearance.  The versions by the applicant and Ms Abrahams relating to the disappearance of the child were repeated to a number of DOCS officers after August 2010.  
13Both of their children were removed from their care on 20 April 2011 as a result of a number of developments in the investigation of the deceased's disappearance.  These developments included the detection of the deceased's blood throughout the Mt Druitt unit and the availability of evidence from witnesses who saw bruising and injuries on the deceased while she was in the care of the applicant and Ms Abrahams.
14As a result of a covert police operation that included recorded conversations between an undercover operative (UCO) and the applicant, telephone intercepts, surveillance and listening devices, it became apparent on 21 April 2011 that the deceased received an injury on the evening of 13 July 2010 which resulted in a loss of consciousness.  It was the Crown case against Ms Abrahams that Ms Abrahams was responsible for that injury.
15The applicant's account to the UCO was that he was changing the nappy on one of the other children in the lounge-room while Ms Abrahams and the deceased were in the deceased's bedroom.  He said that he heard ""a loud bang"" come from the deceased's bedroom.  He entered the bedroom and saw the child lying on the bedroom floor breathing but unconscious.
16The applicant said that he panicked and did not know what to do.  He was trying to wake the child but was unsuccessful.  He said that the child was still breathing at this stage and he tried everything for ""half the night"" but the child would not wake.  Ms Abrahams placed the child in bed and the applicant and Ms Abrahams retired for the night.
17The next morning the applicant went to work.  When he came home the child was dead.  Ms Abrahams was still with the deceased at the unit.  Later that day, Ms Abrahams and the applicant took a suitcase from the garage, placed the deceased's body in the suitcase and placed the suitcase in the deceased's bedroom.  The body remained in the suitcase in the bedroom for a number of days while they decided how they were to dispose of the body.  The applicant rode his bicycle to nearby bushland to locate a suitable burial site.  When he had done so, he dug a shallow grave with a hammer, which he subsequently cleaned and threw away.  The bicycle was also cleaned to remove any traces of the gravesite.  
18At about 5.30am on Sunday, 18 July 2010 the applicant called a taxi and told the operator to collect them from a false address.  The applicant also provided to the operator a false address as the destination.  When the taxi arrived, the applicant corrected that destination and placed the suitcase containing the deceased's body into the boot of the taxi.  Both Ms Abrahams and the applicant disguised their appearance for the purposes of this journey.
19The taxi travelled to a street in Shalvey where Ms Abrahams and the applicant, who was carrying the suitcase, left the taxi and walked for approximately 30 minutes along a number of fire-trails to the gravesite that had previously been prepared.  The deceased's body was placed in the grave and the applicant poured a bottle of petrol onto the body which he ignited.  He threw the bottle into the fire and filled the grave.  The suitcase was carried a short distance away and also set on fire.
20The applicant and Ms Abrahams remained in the area for about an hour.  They left together in a taxi at about 7am from Shalvey and were driven back to the vicinity of their unit.  The applicant returned to the gravesite alone a couple of days later to ensure that the suitcase was fully burnt.  He threw the wire frame of the suitcase into the bush.
21The applicant and Ms Abrahams threw out the shoes and the clothing that they were wearing when they buried the deceased's body and destroyed their mobile telephone SIM cards.  Police retrieved deleted SMS text messages from the applicant's phone and from Ms Abraham's phone.  On 28 July 2010 Ms Abrahams purchased items purportedly intended for the deceased, including a Tinkerbell poster and some toys.
22After giving this account to the UCO, the applicant and Ms Abrahams took him to the deceased's gravesite in the expectation that he would assist them in removing and disposing of the deceased's remains to avoid any implication in her death.  Ms Abrahams and the applicant were arrested at the gravesite on 22 April 2011.  Police found the deceased's remains in a shallow grave.  The remains were taken to the Glebe Morgue where a post mortem was carried out.
23The results of the post mortem confirmed that the deceased was the victim of long term physical abuse, up to the night of the injury.  There were several sharp edge fractures to the teeth, indicative of a recent injury possibly sustained by forcible closure of the mouth during a blow to the head or a similar trauma.  Several bony injuries suggested repeated assaults over the weeks and months before the deceased's death.  These injuries were generally only found in the remains of children who suffered from ""severe physical abuse"".  The condition of the body precluded a finding as to the cause of death. 
24A specialist odontologist reported that the fractures of the teeth appeared to be recent and consistent with trauma during life rather than post mortem.  The pattern of distribution of the fractures was said to be consistent with the lower teeth being forced up against the upper teeth.  The type and degree of force required to cause such fracturing of the enamel was said to be consistent with a contact sport blow, or from jumping from a height and landing heavily on the ground.  There were indications from the remains that the body had been disturbed by scavengers, such as a dog or fox.  
25During the sentence proceedings before Latham J the following exchanges took place between counsel and her Honour:
""HER HONOUR:  Look, the extent to which he was cowed, if you like, during the course of the relationship is one thing.  Since his arrest, and Ms Abrahams' arrest for these offences, he has steadfastly maintained, as is his right, his silence and he hasn't provided any further information as to how Kiesha may have died.
AUSTIN:  He has offered to give evidence.  It's been indicated through a solicitor that he has offered to give evidence, but the Crown don't want him called in a trial after these proceedings since another Crown is going to run the prosecution.  It's been indicated that he won't be called at trial.  My solicitors had instructions that he would give evidence, but there is no interest in that.  As I say, he doesn't offer anything other than he was outside the room at the time.""  (15.2.2013 - T.13.13)
""HER HONOUR:  Mr Austin, I have been told that the reason that the trial of Ms Abrahams is listed for the length of time it is listed is because a significant issue in the trial is going to be the cause of death.  So that's why it is particularly significant that he took the steps that he did take to dispose of the child's body. 
AUSTIN:  Yes your Honour.  I think we may be at cross purposes, because your Honour seemed to be suggesting that there was no evidence he could give now that may assist in relation to overcoming that hurdle.  There has been no suggestion that in fact there is.  He has pleaded accessory on the basis he wasn't aware of how the injury itself was inflicted.
HER HONOUR:  Certainly he's not aware of how the particular injury that caused the child to lapse into unconsciousness was inflicted.  But he would certainly be aware of the history of Ms Abrahams' relationship with the child and the kind of events that one would witness if one were living in a relation with her in the weeks and months prior to the child's death.  Now that's a significant issue, I would have thought, about which he could provide some assistance.  But I accept that your client has offered that and it has been declined but there is nothing I can do about that. 
AUSTIN:  I raise it only in response to your Honour's question but it's a matter I would have raised for the record because I am concerned that what may happen some months down the track with a different Crown prosecuting this case after my client has been dealt with -  but there is nothing your Honour can do about that - but it may become the basis of it a particular type of appeal if he were approached and ended up giving evidence.
... 
CROWN:  I think the director would be involved in this case.  But in relation to the question of assistance.  The police have - evidence from the bar table - the officer in charge spoke to the offender in custody about the provision of assistance and was declined, that is, he declined to provide assistance to the police.  End of story.  
HER HONOUR:  Was an approach made after the solicitors had indicated he would provide assistance. 
CROWN:  There has been no firm indication to the Crown that he would provide assistance.  I am instructed that the police spoke to the offender after Ms Abrahams was committed for trial and he declined to provide any assistance.
AUSTIN:  Unfortunately my instructing solicitor who has been running the carriage of the matter has had to go other proceedings because a barrister dropped out on him at short notice.  I am in possession of written signed instructions from my client saying that he would give evidence if requested.  I have got the document here.  That's as far as I can go.  What's happened in terms of conversations, as I know the matter has been informally discussed in conversations between myself and the Crown, and it was a matter --   
HER HONOUR:  Not this Crown. 
AUSTIN:  But there was never anything set down in writing in relation to that.  But I have been involved in this matter for a long time, and that I can say that it was made clear to he wouldn't be accepted as a reliable witness and that it wasn't an interest.  My concern has always been that if another Crown takes a different view of whether he could assist the Crown case he may ultimately be approached to give evidence.  And all I can ever indicate is that he would be willing to that.  I can see why it could be categorised as not particularly assisting the Crown case.  I see what your Honour is talking about now, in terms of the way the case has been formulated against Ms Abrahams and is being presented, but we were more concerned about whether he could give a witness testimony in relation to the assault that led to the death. 
... 
AUSTIN:  On the listening device material and from dealings with my client I could also understand the situation where a Crown would choose not to call him to give evidence in fear that his evidence may not only not assist the Crown case but may lead to a situation where it improves the defence's position.  So it is not an easy decision to make in relation to this particular offender.  But he has always indicated that he would give evidence.  Whether it is worth anything, I don't know.
HER HONOUR:  Sorry, it's all very well for people to say they will give evidence.  The Crown is not in a position to assess it's worthwhile until they see it in black and white on the page and that would take a significant amount of time.  The question of whether or not he is reliable is one for the jury.  It wouldn't be the first time that the Crown has relied on the evidence of an alleged co-Offender in a trial.  I am content to proceed on the basis of what's been handed up and discussed today.  
I think that somebody ought to determine once and for all, because if (A) he is prepared to actually speak to the police and provide a statement and (B) if the Crown has the opportunity to look at that statement, whether they are inclined to call him at trial or not, because at the moment both counsel are talking as though no one really knows what the true position is.
Anyway, subject to any other submissions that you want to put to me, one course that we could pursue would be to stand the matter over for mention in approximately a fortnight's time and see if this issue could be resolved one way or the other.  
AUSTIN:  My client has indicated to me this morning to that aspect that if called he would be willing to give evidence.  That's all I can say.  I'm quite happy for that course to be followed, if it is something that the Crown wants to take up. 
HER HONOUR:  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not suggesting the Crown has to take it up.  But as things presently stand, you are of the view that he is prepared to provide evidence.  The Crown has got instructions that when he was spoken to he said I'm not helping.  So somehow that controversy has to be resolved, and then I'm in a position to know whether or not, if he is prepared to provide a statement, whether the Crown is inclined to use it or not.  So we have to go some way towards solving that problem don't we. 
AUSTIN:  As I say, my concern was, given the state of the law that after he was sentenced he would still be subject to someone else involved now, without the Crown at the bar table involved, deciding that he would be called in the proceedings for whatever reason and that's a matter that can't be dealt with in these proceedings. 
...
CROWN:  I don't oppose the offender speaking to the police about what assistance, if any, he can provide.  Whether the Crown relies on it is another question. 
HER HONOUR:  I'm not suggesting that even if he provides a statement the Crown would use it but at the very least we have to understand whether or not he is prepared to say anything.""  (15.2.2013 - T.14.13 - 17.3) 
26It was common ground that on 22 February the applicant was re-interviewed by the police and made an induced statement.  When the matter next came before her Honour on 1 March 2013 a transcript of the induced statement was not available.  It became available and had been read by the parties when the matter came before her Honour on 15 March 2013.  On that occasion, the Crown said:
""CROWN:  Your Honour might recall this matter last came before the Court on 1 March.  On that occasion it was adjourned until today to give the parties an opportunity to read an interview conducted between police and the offender on 22 February.  That material has now been given to my friend and the Crown also has a transcript of the record of interview.  To put it simply, there will be no affidavit of assistance and there is no level of assistance.  On that basis the Court can proceed to sentencing.  My friend is aware of that.""  (15.3.2013 - T.18)
Mr Austin advised the Court that he had nothing to add.
27On 14 March 2013 the officer-in-charge of the investigation of the applicant's offences made a statement concerning the applicant's induced statement.  His conclusion was that the applicant had not been truthful in relation to the murder of the deceased and the involvement of himself and Ms Abrahams.  The officer identified a number of discrepancies between what the applicant said in the induced statement and what he had told the undercover operative.  The officer also identified what he regarded as an internal inconsistency in the version of events set out in the induced statement.  This statement by the officer-in-charge of the investigation was available to the DPP before the Crown advised Latham J of its approach to the induced statement on 15 March 2013.
28For completeness, it is necessary to set out some matters which occurred following the handing down of sentence by her Honour on 3 May 2013.  This material is controversial in that the applicant sought to rely upon it as ""fresh evidence"" or as evidence indicating that a miscarriage of justice had occurred.  The Crown did not accept that this evidence was admissible on either basis.  The Court advised that it would rule on the admissibility of the evidence in the judgment.  In order to understand the Court's ruling, it is necessary to set out that evidence.
29Mr Andrew Tiedt, who was the solicitor acting for Ms Abrahams at all material times, gave evidence by way of affidavit that Ms Abrahams had pleaded not guilty to the murder of the deceased and that her trial was listed to commence on 17 June 2013 with an estimate of four weeks.  Ms Manuell SC was briefed to appear on behalf of Ms Abrahams.  Various preliminary disputes were heard by Harrison J, the trial judge, including an application by Ms Abrahams for a judge alone trial.  That application was refused.  On 10 June 2013 Ms Manuell SC sought an urgent hearing date for an appeal from that ruling pursuant to s5F(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
30By letter dated Tuesday, 11 June 2013 (attached to an email sent at 2.54pm that day) the DPP advised Mr Tiedt that it proposed to call the applicant to give evidence in the prosecution case.  Served with the letter was the induced statement of the applicant of 22 February 2013.
31Relevantly, the letter from the DPP of 11 June 2013 stated:
""1. I'm writing to inform you that the Crown intends to call Robert Smith on the following issues:
(a)whether he caused an injury to the deceased, and
(b)any evidence he is able to give as to the circumstances of the blow/s that caused the death of the deceased.  It is anticipated that he will deny inflicting any such blow/s.  I note that the Crown prosecutor informed Ms Manuell SC of the intention this morning.  I expect that the Crown will call Smith towards the end of the Crown case.  
Please find following induced statement of Robert Smith dated 22nd February 2013 which was obtained by police during the course of his sentence proceedings ...""
32Mr Tiedt deposed that before 11 June 2013 he had not been advised that the DPP intended to call the applicant and was not aware of the existence of the applicant's induced statement.
33In his affidavit Mr Tiedt said:
""15 I formed the view that the evidence the prosecution was proposing to call from Mr Smith was likely to be very significant.  The following excerpts from Smith's interview were especially probative and damaging to Ms Abraham's case at trial.""
(Mr Tiedt then set out the following questions and answers - 91, 126 - 129, 148, 180 - 187, 193 - 196).
""16 Ms Manuell and I then had a conference with Ms Abrahams at Silverwater on Wednesday 12 June 2013, at which time Ms Manuell and I discussed Mr Smith's statement with Ms Abrahams.  Ms Abrahams then instructed us that she wished to plead guilty to murder and the s81C offence.
17 I understand that when Ms Manuell returned to chambers, she advised the CCA Registrar that Ms Abrahams did not wish to proceed with a s5F appeal.  I also understand that Ms Manuell advised Mr Maxwell by email that day of Ms Abrahams' instructions to plead guilty.  Ms Manuell also advised the associate to Harrison J.
18 Ms Abrahams entered her guilty pleas on 17 June 2013 and the sentencing proceedings took place the following week.""
Mr Tiedt was not cross-examined on his affidavit.
34Mr Austin of counsel swore an affidavit where he deposed:
""7 As at 15 March 2013 I did not know and did not anticipate that the Crown proposed to call Mr Smith at the trial of Ms Abrahams.  Had I known that fact at that time, I would have made submissions to her Honour that some discount should have been given to the applicant for assistance to authorities pursuant to s23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""
Sentence proceedings
35Having summarised the agreed facts, Latham J assessed the objective gravity of the offences.  Her Honour found that the applicant had breached the duty of care which he owed to the deceased as her stepfather by failing to seek medical treatment at the time of the incident on the evening of 13 July or immediately thereafter despite knowing that the deceased had suffered a significant injury.  Her Honour found that the applicant's failure to seek medical treatment at any time and his complete disregard for the welfare of the deceased, constituted gross criminal negligence of a very high order.  
36In support of that conclusion, her Honour took into account that the applicant was aware of the circumstances under which the deceased had previously been removed from Ms Abrahams' care.  She took into account the post mortem findings that the deceased had been repeatedly injured over  the weeks and months before her death, which were supported by the evidence of witnesses from the neighbourhood who had observed bruising to the deceased during her short life.
37Her Honour found beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was aware of Ms Abrahams' physical abuse of the deceased and that it was against this background that his failure to seek medical attention for her on the night or subsequently ought be assessed.  This was despite the fact that he was unaware on the evening of 13 July 2010 of the precise nature of the deceased's injury.
38Her Honour specifically found:
""35 I reject out of hand any suggestion that the offender was so overborne or intimidated by Ms Abrahams that his judgment was compromised against acting in the child's interests. .... I acknowledge that Ms Abrahams appeared to be the dominant partner in the relationship, and that she was violent towards him, according to the offender, as well as towards their children. However, the offender is a mature male who was gainfully employed, of average intelligence, with no relevant drug or alcohol issues while he was in the relationship, and was acutely aware of the deceased's vulnerability.  He made a simple and cowardly choice that favoured his relationship with Ms Abrahams over the needs of a gravely injured child. In other words, he acted more out of loyalty to Ms Abrahams than out of fear of reprisal from her for calling for medical assistance.

36 The offender stands to be sentenced on the basis of his failure to act, not on the basis that his conduct injured the deceased and thereby lead to her death. Nonetheless, in circumstances where this helpless and vulnerable child depended for survival as much on the person who stood by and did nothing, as upon the person who assaulted her, it is a rather fine distinction.
37 In my view, this offence stands towards the top of the range of objective seriousness comprehended by this species of manslaughter. By ""species of manslaughter"", I mean to refer to gross criminal negligence manslaughter.""
39When considering the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, her Honour noted that the relevant conduct had taken place over a long period of time, i.e. 13 July 2010 - 21 April 2011.  Having reviewed all of the steps which the applicant took to conceal the murder (which are set out at [17] - [22] hereof) her Honour concluded:
""39 The offender's assistance to Ms Abrahams in an attempt to prevent her arrest and prosecution for the murder of her own child was extensive, lengthy and potentially effective. The offender assumed the primary role in the disposal and destruction of the deceased's body, the destruction of evidence and in the maintenance of a false account to the authorities and to the public at large. The act of burning the body was particularly heinous, given the difficulty of ascertaining a definitive cause of death at post mortem.
40 It is pertinent to reflect upon the offender's determined and sustained course of conduct over a period of nine months following the death of the child. Within two days of her death, the offender assiduously applied himself to the execution of a plan which was designed to destroy any evidence linking Ms Abrahams to that event, the centrepiece of which was the implied allegation that an unknown person was responsible for the child's disappearance. The offender persisted in playing the role of distraught parent, not just for the purposes of the police investigation but also for the media, all the while knowing what he had done. These were not spontaneous, ill-considered acts carried out in panic such as are usually encountered by the courts when dealing with this offence in the context of a relationship.

41 I accept the Crown's submission that this offence is in the ""worst case"" category. I am unaware of any case of accessory after the fact to murder that approximates the objective gravity of this offence. Moreover, it is difficult to envisage what more the offender could have done, that might further elevate the objective criminality.""
40Her Honour then reviewed the applicant's subjective case.  He had a criminal record which included property offences and motor vehicle offences.  The most significant offence was one of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm for which in 2002 he received a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months and a balance of term of 6 months.  
41There was before her Honour a report of a clinical and forensic psychologist, Dr Milic, and a report of a consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Furst.  Her Honour noted that the applicant did not give evidence on sentence so that the history recorded in those reports was not otherwise confirmed by him.
42The history recorded by the psychologist and psychiatrist indicated an uneventful childhood.  His work history was somewhat patchy but he had been in regular employment from 2004 until the date of his arrest.  Both doctors assessed him as having an immature and passive personality style with a limited capacity for self-reflection.  Dr Furst suggested that the applicant's passive personality style, low self-esteem and the trauma associated with regular abuse in the relationship created a type of ""learned helplessness"" and higher levels of anxiety which prevented him from leaving Ms Abrahams. 
43While Dr Furst considered that his initial failure to assist the deceased may have been due to a fear of Ms Abrahams, he concluded:
""He continued to lie to police and other authorities after the offence in question and his efforts to conceal the offence were probably calculated and deliberate.""
44Her Honour was somewhat sceptical of the history given by the applicant to Dr Furst of him being regularly subject to physical abuse by Ms Abrahams on a weekly basis and as many as three times per week.  This was in contrast to the history recorded by Dr Milic that often two months would elapse between arguments.  Her Honour noted that none of this history of abuse was even hinted at in the course of the conversations between the applicant and the undercover operative.
45Her Honour set out her conclusions as follows:
""55 In the absence of evidence confirmatory of the offender's account of the extent of Ms Abrahams' violence towards him, I am prepared to accept that Ms Abrahams was volatile, argumentative, domineering and verbally abusive towards the offender, and that on occasions she threw objects and broke household items. However, I do not accept that her physical violence towards him was as frequent or as serious as the offender has described to the respective doctors. I do not accept that there was anything so dire about the offender's circumstances, that his moral culpability for either offence is reduced.""
46Given the circumstances of the offence, her Honour had particular regard to general deterrence but gave lesser weight to specific deterrence.  She thought his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonably sound, provided he developed further insight into his offending conduct.  Her Honour allowed in the applicant's favour a 25 percent discount for his early plea of guilty.
47Because of the fourth ground of appeal, it is necessary to set out the concluding paragraphs ([60] - [64]) of the sentence judgment.
""60 Taking into account the above objective and subjective factors, I would impose a head sentence of seven years for the manslaughter offence and a head sentence of twelve years for the accessorial offence. Despite the fact that there is little overlap in the criminality inherent in each offence, there are considerations of totality at play. The offender has not previously served a lengthy prison term, he is still a relatively young man and a complete absence of concurrency would give rise to a disproportionate sentence. Accordingly, there ought be a measure of partial concurrency.

61 I do not consider that a finding of special circumstances is warranted. I have taken the offender's custodial conditions into account in fixing the appropriate head sentence and any lesser non-parole period than that prescribed by the legislature would fail in my view to adequately reflect the offender's criminality. The balance of the aggregate term will in any event provide the offender with sufficient time to address his reintegration into the community.

62 Robert Smith, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter.  I sentence you to a fixed term of seven (7) years to date from 22 April 2011 and to expire on 21 April 2018. 

63 You are convicted of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder.  I sentence you to a non-parole period of nine (9) years to date from 22 April 2014, to expire 21 April 2023. I fix a balance of term of four (4) years to expire 21 April 2027.
64 The aggregate sentence is one of sixteen (16) years with a non-parole period of twelve (12) years. You are eligible for release on 22 April 2023.""
48In response to the affidavit of Mr Tiedt the Crown relied upon an affidavit of Ms Prowse, who was the solicitor with the carriage of the matters involving the applicant and Ms Abrahams.  She said that shortly before 6 June 2013 she provided police with a subpoena addressed to the applicant requiring his attendance at the trial of Ms Abrahams.  Ms Prowse said:
""At this stage the Crown did not intend to call Smith to give evidence at trial however I had formed the view that it would be prudent for him to be subpoenaed in case an issue arose during the course of the trial and he would be required to attend at short notice.  I was aware that there could be a delay in serving a subpoena on a person in custody and arranging for them to be brought to court.""
49In that affidavit Ms Prowse also said:
""9 On 11 June 2013 it was decided that the Crown would call Smith to give evidence in Abraham's trial.  The purpose of calling him would be to introduce into the evidence the statements he made to the undercover officer which provided the basis for the agreed facts that had been tendered during his sentence proceedings.  It was also anticipated that he would deny inflicting any injuries to the deceased.
10 Later that day (11 June 2013 at 2.45pm) I sent an email to Mr Tiedt informing him of the Crown's intention to call Smith.
11 On 12 June 2013 at 4.55 pm the Crown received an email from Abrahams' counsel, Janet Manuell, indicating that Abrahams would plea guilty to murder on the basis of reckless indifference.""
THE APPEALGround 1 - A lesser sentence is warranted in law due to the assistance given by the applicant to the authorities in relation to his co-offender Kristi Abrahams.
50The applicant noted that after he had been sentenced, but shortly before Ms Abrahams' trial was due to commence, Ms Abrahams' legal advisers were notified that he would give evidence and a copy of his induced statement of 22 February 2013 was served (on 11 June 2013).  He submitted that the notification that he would give evidence and the induced statement were material in eliciting pleas of guilty from Ms Abrahams.  The applicant relied upon the affidavit of Mr Tiedt to establish that issue.
51The applicant submitted that the change of position by the Crown, i.e. deciding to call him to give evidence and the serving of the induced statement with its consequential effect of bringing about Ms Abrahams' plea of guilty, constituted fresh evidence or should be admitted on the basis that to reject it would involve a miscarriage of justice insofar as his sentencing was concerned.  
52He submitted that these matters could properly be regarded as ""fresh evidence"" since they had been raised before her Honour in the sentence proceedings but had been dealt with on an incorrect basis, i.e. that the induced statement was of no value and that he would not give evidence in those proceedings.  The applicant submitted that these particular circumstances, while unusual, were analogous to those cases where medical evidence or a medical condition was known to the sentencing judge but inadequately understood so that proper weight was not given to it.  The applicant submitted that looked at in that way, the evidence could properly be regarded as ""fresh evidence"".  
53The applicant relied upon the provisions of s23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the rationale behind that section as explained in the judgment of Mahoney JA (Newman and James JJ agreeing) in ""C"" (1994) 75 A Crim R 309 at 314-315).  That case stressed the value to the criminal justice system of giving adequate recognition to assistance provided by offenders.
54The applicant submitted that by reference to the criteria in that section, the assistance which he had given was significant and useful and had made an important contribution to the decision by Ms Abrahams to enter a plea of guilty.  The applicant submitted that because of that assistance, he was entitled to a significant discount from his sentence.
55The applicant submitted that although the induced statement was in existence at the time when he was sentenced, the new development was the change in position by the Crown when it decided to call him to give evidence.  He submitted that once that decision was made, the contents of the induced statement came into play and that it was clear from the affidavit of Mr Tiedt that it was the contents of the induced statement, together with the prospect of him giving evidence to substantiate it, which brought about the plea of guilty by Ms Abrahams.  He submitted that this was the correct way to characterise what had occurred when assessing the value of the assistance which he had provided.  He submitted that had the sentencing judge been aware of those matters, she would have been obliged to further discount his sentence for that assistance and that this Court ought correct that miscarriage of justice and re-sentence him so as to make adequate allowance for his provision of assistance.
56Under this ground the applicant also submitted that by reference to paragraphs 6 - 17 of his affidavit of 16 September 2014 there was ""fresh evidence"" that his conditions of imprisonment had been significantly more onerous because of the assistance which he had provided.  While this issue was raised briefly in oral argument in the appeal (T.4.44, T.47.1) it was not otherwise developed or pursued. 
Consideration
57The question of what constitutes ""fresh evidence"" and its admissibility on appeal was comprehensively analysed by Simpson J (with whom Davies J and Grove AJ agreed) in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118.  The evidence in that case comprised psychological and psychiatric reports which were not before the sentencing judge.    When reviewing the issue generally, her Honour said:""The principles applicable to the tender of fresh evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence 
104 The general principle is that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at p 377. That applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals. 
105 The rule is far from absolute, and has been diluted over the years. In criminal cases it has long been recognised that the rigour with which it is applied must be tempered in order to accommodate the interests of justice: Green v The King [1939] HCA 4; 61 CLR 167, per Latham CJ; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 per Barwick CJ. In criminal cases, two important but competing policy considerations collide: 
(1) that the administration of justice requires finality in litigation; in general, parties to litigation (including criminal litigation) have one, and one only, opportunity to present their cases in the best light they can, and are bound by the conduct of their cases at first instance; 
(2) that error in the sentencing process, however caused, that is the occasion of injustice, ought to be remedied. 
But there are limits as to the extent to which the court may legitimately accept additional evidence. There is no call here to consider the application of the principles in appeals against conviction: these have most recently been considered in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 and Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61 at [282] and following. These remarks are confined to the circumstances in which this Court may properly, and will, admit and take account of additional evidence on applications for leave to appeal against sentence, in respect of which a distinct sub-set of principles has evolved. 
106 I say ""additional evidence"" because a distinction has been drawn between ""fresh"" evidence and ""new"" evidence: see Abou-Chabake, per Kirby J, at [63]. 
107 ""Fresh"" evidence has been defined by Mason J (as he then was) in Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; 142 CLR 659 at p 675 as: 
""... evidence of which the accused was unaware at the time of his trial and ... evidence which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence."" 
""New"" evidence, on the other hand, is evidence that does not qualify as ""fresh"", either because it was available, but not used, at first instance, or because, in the exercise of reasonable diligence it could have been obtained. The distinction is important in the present case. 
108 If evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion - the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance. If it is not judged to have that capacity, its admission is pointless, and, while it has to be considered in order for that evaluation to be made, the evidence may not, in the result, be acted upon: see, for example, Fordham. 
109 It may be thought that, on the definition as stated by Mason J, evidence of facts, circumstances and events that have arisen subsequently to the first instance decision would qualify as fresh evidence because it meets both criteria. However, with respect to applications for leave to appeal against sentence, there is an additional, sometimes intractable, barrier to admissibility. Jurisdiction of this Court in sentencing matters derives from s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The powers of the Court are spelled out in s 6(3) which is in the following terms: 

""6(3) ... the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal."" 
110 A fundamental pre-condition to the exercise of the power of the Court to quash a sentence and pass another sentence is the formation of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. In other words, this Court, as a matter of law, cannot interfere with a sentence passed at first instance unless it has identified some error, either in the sentencing process or in the outcome of the sentencing process. That has this additional implication: axiomatically, evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account, no matter how compelling they may be. If the facts did not exist at the time of sentencing, it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account. In those circumstances, the impact on the sentence is a matter for the executive government: R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177. 
111 The issue has arisen, and the principle I have stated has been applied, in a number of cases concerning applicants who have, post sentencing, provided assistance to prosecution authorities: Scullion v R (NSWCCA, 15 July 1992, unreported); JM v R [2008] NSWCCA 254; R v Willard [2001] NSWCCA 6; 120 A Crim R 450; Munday (supra). 
112 The same principle would, no doubt, be held to apply where additional evidence of a medical nature is sought to be adduced on appeal, but where the relevant condition did not exist at the time of sentencing. 
113 Too rigid an application of the principle clearly has potential to be the cause of injustice, and has led to the development of the sub-set of evidentiary propositions peculiar to the admission of additional evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence.  Where it is held that the facts or circumstances of which evidence is sought to be adduced existed at the time of sentencing, even if not known, or imperfectly understood, at that time, then, where the interests of justice have so dictated, the Court has admitted the additional evidence (sometimes properly categorised as fresh evidence) in order to correct the misunderstanding. It appears that the justification for this is that, although on the state of the evidence before the sentencing judge, no error could be identified in the process or the sentence, the sentencing proceeded upon an erroneous view of the factual circumstances. This proposition is sometimes traced back to the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 588. In all cases the power to admit the additional evidence is a discretionary one; ""proper grounds"" must be established as a foundation for the exercise of the discretion to admit the evidence: R v Lanham [1970] 2 NSWR 217. 
114 Two classes of case have emerged. I have already referred to cases in which evidence of post sentencing assistance to authorities has not been admitted. However, in other cases, where it has been held that the circumstances existed at the time of sentencing, even if not put before the sentencing judge, the evidence may be admitted. An example is R v Many (1990) 51 A Crim R 54.  An extension occurs where there is some evidence of assistance, but subsequent events show that its significance was not fully appreciated: Springer v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 289; 177 A Crim R 13. 
115 Another, and increasingly common, category concerns medical evidence. Examples of these are R v Abbott (1984) 17 A Crim R 355; R v Ehrenburg (NSWCCA, 14 December 1990, unreported ); R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359; R v Ashton [2002] NSWCCA 498; 137 A Crim R 73; Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261; Stumbles v R [2006] NSWCCA 418; Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1. 
...

121 That the evidence may cast light on circumstances known, but not fully appreciated, at sentencing, does not dictate that it will be admitted. The judgment remains a discretionary one. It is proper for the Court to examine the circumstances of, and any explanation for, the non-production of the evidence - a deliberate decision on the part either of the applicant, or his or her legal representatives, ignorance in the applicant of the significance of the evidence, resulting in its not being communicated to the legal representatives, incompetent legal representation.  At the outer limits, the cases also include those in which post sentencing circumstances are taken into account as relevant to known pre-sentencing circumstances (for example, Springer). Also relevant will be the potential significance of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance (for example, Ashton).""
58In order to apply those principles to the facts of this case, it is necessary to identify with some precision the information which was before the sentencing judge and what it is that is said to be ""fresh"" and to have given rise to an entitlement to a discount for assistance.
59The following information was before Latham J:
(i)The applicant had offered to give evidence against Ms Abrahams.
(ii)Despite that offer, the Crown did not intend to call him.
(iii)There was (as the applicant's counsel stated) a chance that the Crown would change its position and call the applicant as a witness.
(iv)The applicant could not give evidence as to how the injury was inflicted.
(v)Her Honour thought that the applicant might be able to give evidence as to the relationship between Ms Abrahams and the deceased before her death.
(vi)It was conceded by the applicant's counsel that his evidence might not assist the Crown case but could assist that of Ms Abrahams.
(vii)The applicant had participated in an interview with the police and that an induced statement dated 22 February 2013 had been produced (but which was not before her Honour).
(viii)The Crown confirmed that despite the existence of an induced statement, no affidavit of assistance would be provided and that there was no level of assistance.
60The only change to those matters which were before her Honour was the fact that almost three months later the Crown advised Ms Abrahams and her lawyers that they intended to call the applicant to give evidence on a limited basis, i.e. that he did not cause an injury to the deceased on the evening of 13 July 2010 and as to what he saw and heard on that night.  The Crown also served the induced statement of 22 February 2013.  
61Relying on the affidavit of Mr Tiedt, it is the applicant's submission that this led to a sequence of events which culminated in Ms Abrahams entering a plea of guilty.  There are considerable difficulties with that submission.  The first is that we do not know what case Ms Abrahams intended to put forward.  If she intended to put forward a case that it was the applicant and not her who injured the deceased on 13 July 2010, it would have been appreciated by her legal advisers that the riposte by the Crown would be to call the applicant.  There could be no surprise if that were her case, in being told either before or during the trial that the applicant would be giving evidence on behalf of the Crown.
62If as was submitted in the appeal, Ms Abrahams' case was as set out in pars [9] and [10] of her sentencing judgment (R v Kristi Anne Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952) to the effect that an accident had occurred, i.e. the deceased had jumped and hit her head on the bottom of the bed, there was always a possibility that the Crown would decide to call the applicant to give evidence.  In any event, the service of the applicant's induced statement was not contingent on him being called to give evidence in her trial. The Crown was obliged to serve the statement under its disclosure obligations in any event. 
63There is a further consideration.  Fundamental to and implicit in the applicant's submission is the proposition that until the induced statement was served on her legal advisers, neither they nor Ms Abrahams knew what evidence the applicant was likely to give should he be called.  That is a most surprising proposition given that the applicant was sentenced on 3 May 2013.  It verges on the incredible to suggest that Ms Abrahams' legal advisers would not have read the sentence judgment of the applicant, her co-offender.
64The sentence judgment, based as it was on an agreed statement of facts, was a matter of public record.  The agreed statement of facts was also a matter of public record.  Both the sentence judgment and the statement of facts were available to the legal advisers of Ms Abrahams. The statement of facts containing as it did substantial excerpts from the communications between the applicant and the UCO made clear (if there were any doubt on the issue) what the applicant would say in relation to his knowledge of what had occurred on the night of 13 July 2010.  It is difficult to see how anything in the applicant's induced statement would have come as a surprise to Ms Abrahams' legal advisers in those circumstances.
65While making due allowance for the constraints of legal professional privilege under which Mr Tiedt swore his affidavit, it is difficult to see how the particular matters in the induced statement to which he referred either on their own or in combination with the advice that the applicant was going to be called to give evidence, could have had the effect of bringing about a plea of guilty on the part of Ms Abrahams.  The three issues were:
(i)Attempts to wake up the deceased including compressions and CPR.
(ii)The applicant wanting to call for help but being afraid of Ms Abrahams.
(iii)That he and Ms Abrahams thereafter watched TV; that she checked on the deceased a couple of times but could not wake her up and that he thought that the deceased was dead.
66Those matters were fully set out in the sentence judgment and the agreed statement of facts pursuant to which the applicant was sentenced.  The effect of the sentence judgment and the statement of facts is clear, i.e. the deceased was severely injured on the night of 13 July 2010 and nothing was done to assist her.  Insofar as the case against Ms Abrahams was concerned, it mattered little whether the deceased died within hours of the incident occurring or the next day.
67When one compares the induced statement with either the agreed facts, the sentence judgment or with what the applicant said to the UCO, it is clear why no affidavit of assistance was given and why the Crown did not regard the induced statement as of any value in the proceedings against Ms Abrahams.  This emerges from a simple comparison of their contents and from the statement of the police officer in charge of the investigation made on 14 March 2013.  It added nothing to the information already possessed by the Crown.  On the contrary, it sought to reduce the significance of the ""bang"" which he heard on the night of 13 July 2010 which caused him to enter the deceased's bedroom.  It continually made excuses for his behaviour and raised for the first time his fear of Ms Abrahams because of physical and mental assaults by her on him during their relationship.  His assertion that he did not see Ms Abrahams act violently towards the deceased during their relationship was entirely inconsistent with the autopsy results which revealed long term physical abuse of the deceased.  
68It follows that I do not asses the importance of either the notification that the Crown would call the applicant in its case against Ms Abrahams or the service of the induced statement as having the importance apparently placed upon them by Mr Tiedt.  This is especially so when the particular evidence notified by the Crown to be adduced from the applicant was quite different from that identified by Mr Tiedt as apparently being of importance in his discussions with Ms Abrahams.  As already indicated, the induced statement added nothing to information already available to Ms Abrahams and her legal advisers.  
69It does not follow, as Mr Tiedt suggests (and as relied upon by the applicant) that, just because the plea of guilty was entered not long after the occurrence of these events, those events caused or contributed to the entry of the plea of guilty.  Such a submission involves speculative reasoning at best.  What we do know occurred was a conference between senior counsel, Mr Tiedt and Ms Abrahams.  A reasonable inference to be drawn from that fact is that all the strengths and weaknesses of Ms Abrahams' case were discussed.  As a result of that discussion, the decision to plead guilty was made.  It does not follow that the decision to plead guilty was due to the induced statement or the giving of evidence by the applicant.  To go that extra step and to argue ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" involves flawed reasoning and is not supported by the evidence.
70By reference to the particular matters to be considered by the Court in s23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the illusory nature of the assistance provided becomes apparent.  The very low evaluation by the authorities was justified for the reasons already indicated.  As also indicated, the lack of truthfulness and reliability of the induced statement is apparent.  When assessing the nature and extent of an offender's assistance, not only is the extent of the assistance to be taken into account, but any risk to which the person is exposed is also taken into account.  Here the extent of the assistance was minimal and it was offered at no risk to the applicant.  
71From what was said before Latham J, the offer to give evidence was made very late and only shortly before the sentencing proceedings.  While there was evidence in the applicant's affidavit that he had experienced onerous conditions while serving his sentence, nothing was put before this Court to suggest that this was due to any assistance which he had provided to the Crown.  On the contrary, the obvious reason for him being subjected to limited association restrictions was the nature of the offences of which he had been convicted.
72In summary, there was nothing in the induced statement which was not already known to the police.  A comparison of the induced statement with the conversations between the applicant and the UCO make it clear that the applicant consistently sought to distance himself from the admissions he had made to the UCO.  It is not without significance that defence counsel, who was fully familiar with both what had been said to the UCO and the induced statement, did not traverse the proposition put forward by the Crown that the induced statement was of no assistance.  The induced statement and the notification that the applicant would be called to give evidence at her trial added nothing to the information already available to Ms Abrahams' legal advisers.
73It follows that I am not satisfied that either the induced statement or the notification that the applicant would give evidence was capable of constituting assistance in the relevant sense nor that it in fact had that effect, i.e. brought about or contributed to the plea of guilty.
74As was stated in Khoury, the authorities draw a distinction, not always clearly, between events or circumstances that did not exist or that post date sentencing and events or circumstances relevant to and casting new light on circumstances that did exist and were known, although perhaps imperfectly understood at the time of sentencing.  The most frequent example of this is new or additional information concerning a medical condition of an offender which is known at the time of sentencing to be present.  The circumstances of this case are somewhat analogous to that situation.  The applicant made it clear that he was prepared to give evidence and made an induced statement.  What was not fully appreciated was that the Crown would change its position and call the applicant.  It was always the case, however, that the induced statement would be served pursuant to the Crown's disclosure obligations.  Looked at in that way the evidence as to what happened after the sentencing proceedings could be characterised as ""fresh"".
75That, however, does not end the matter.  In R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359, Howie AJ (Hunt CJ at CL and Smart AJ agreeing) stated at 377 - 378 that even if the evidence is ""fresh"", it ought not be received by the Court unless it affects the outcome of the case.  Generally, it must be shown that the sentencing of the offender, in the absence of the ""fresh evidence"", resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  The miscarriage of justice principle discussed in R v Fordham was applied in Norrie v R [2008] NSWCCA 185 at [22].
76For the reasons indicated, the change in the Crown's position in deciding to call the applicant and the service of the induced statement did not amount to assistance of the kind which would have affected the outcome of the applicant's sentencing proceedings.  It follows that in my opinion the interests of justice do not require the admission of the ""fresh"" evidence sought to be relied upon by the applicant.
77If I am wrong in that conclusion and the evidence is admissible, I would still dismiss this ground of appeal.
78Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 recognises the approach to sentencing that permits a reduction by reason of co-operation with authorities in the sentence that would otherwise be imposed.  Section 23(3) provides:
""(3)  A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.""
It is therefore necessary to take into account the value of the assistance given.  In this case, I have had regard to the magnitude of the offending and the extended period over which the accessorial offence occurred, and the minimal value, if any, of the assistance provided.  In those circumstances a sentence less than that imposed would come in conflict with s23(3).  Any sentence less than that imposed by her Honour would be inadequate to meet proper sentencing requirements.  
79This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - Her Honour erred in not finding that there was any diminution in moral culpability arising from the relationship between the applicant and the deceased.
Ground 3 - The sentence for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder was manifestly excessive.
80These grounds of appeal can be conveniently dealt with together.  The applicant submitted that allowing for the discount of 25 percent for the early plea of guilty, her Honour's starting point for the offence of accessory after the fact must have been a sentence of 17 years and 3 months.   The starting point for the non-parole period must have been 12 years.  The applicant submitted that by reference to statistics and what they showed of general sentencing trends, this sentence was manifestly excessive.
81The applicant submitted that between October 2006 and September 2013 of 23 cases where offenders were sentenced in relation to the offence of accessory after the fact of murder, the longest non-parole period of imprisonment was 6 years.  He submitted that because of that sentencing trend, a non-parole period of 9 years with a starting point of 12 years was well outside the range of sentences imposed for this offence.  Those sentences, he submitted, demonstrated the permissible range of sentences for this offence.
82The applicant submitted that the gravamen of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder was rendering assistance which helped the principal offender to evade justice.  This meant that the relationship between the applicant and Ms Abrahams was a relevant factor in assessing the appropriate sentence.  On that issue, the applicant referred to the following findings:
Ms Abrahams was volatile, argumentative, domineering and verbally abusive towards him.On occasions she threw objects or broke household items during arguments with him.He had an immature and passive personality style with limited capacity for self-reflection.  Although there was no finding to this effect, it followed from those findings that her Honour accepted that he was fearful of Ms Abrahams.  The fact that he made no mention to the UCO of her violent conduct towards him was unremarkable because that subject was not raised during their conversations.
83The applicant submitted that her Honour erred in finding that his moral culpability for this offence was not reduced at all as a result of those considerations.  He submitted that such a finding could not stand with her Honour's finding that Ms Abrahams had been violent to him.  He submitted that the domineering nature of the relationship between them should reduce, even to a modest degree, his moral culpability.  This was particularly so when he was not present in the bedroom when the deceased was murdered.
Consideration
84Her Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending was open to her.  She characterised it as a particularly horrendous case.  The victim was a child in relation to whom the applicant had parental responsibilities and deservedly attracted a finding of greater culpability for that reason.  The accessory charge was based on the planning and carrying out of acts relating to the disposal of the child's corpse, burning the body, destroying and removing evidence, creating and maintaining a series of ""ongoing false accounts"" to both the police and media ""the centrepiece of which was the implied allegation that an unknown person was responsible for the child's disappearance"" and ""playing the role of a distraught parent"".  It was a ""determined and sustained course of conduct over a period of nine months"" and the applicant had assiduously applied himself to the execution of a plan which was designed to destroy any evidence implicating the murderer.  Significantly, the applicant has not challenged her Honour's assessment that the accessory offence was in the ""worst case category"".
85Following on from that assessment, her Honour noted that general deterrence was an important element in determining an appropriate sentence.  That being so, the subjective features of the applicant while important should not overshadow the objective seriousness of the offence:  R v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594.  The assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant's criminality as being in the ""worst case category"" and the importance of general deterrence called for an appropriately stern sentence.
86Statistics derived from decided cases are of little assistance.  None of the cases to which the applicant referred was assessed as a worst case.  It follows that the statistics are of little assistance in establishing that the sentence imposed in this instance was outside any permissible range.
87As was accepted by the applicant, care needs to be taken when using statistics and comparing sentences generally.  This is particularly so where the case under consideration is accepted to be in the ""worst case category"".  In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said at [54]:
""54 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits.  As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".
88One of the distinguishing features of this case when compared to other cases is the period of time over which the applicant provided assistance to the murderer.  In Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [90] - [122] Hamill J undertook a review of sentences imposed in other cases of accessory after the fact offences.  The review was designed to ""test the proposition that the applicant's criminality fell just below the upper range"".  Having carried out that exercise, his Honour concluded at [121]:
""121 This survey of cases confirms the observations of Fullerton J as to the diversity of circumstances which can give rise to criminal liability under s 349(1) of the Crimes Act.  Along with the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission, they establish a wide range of sentencing outcomes. A consistent theme in the cases is that cases involving the disposal of a murder victim's body generally fall at the higher end of objective criminality. The remarks of Simpson J in R v Quach have been adopted in many cases (at [11]): 
""Assistance in the disposal of a body after murder takes a crime of this kind into the upper echelons of the offence (of this kind)....[and being] of considerably more seriousness than, for example, assisting an offender to clean himself or herself after the murder"".""
89It follows that the statistics are not particularly helpful in this case and provide no basis for a successful challenge to her Honour's sentence on the basis of manifest excess.
90In relation to the applicant's fear of his co-offender, her Honour specifically referred to that issue in her sentence judgment and identified the evidentiary basis for her conclusion (see [38] and [45] hereof).  The applicant has not provided any basis for successfully challenging her Honour's findings on that issue.  These findings were well open on the evidence.  Given the active and purposeful participation of the applicant in the months following the deceased's death, those acts not being spontaneous or ill considered or carried out in panic, her Honour was not required to make a finding that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced by reason of any abusive physical relationship.  This is particularly so when her Honour had real doubts as to the genuineness of the history given by the applicant to the doctors on this issue.  
91Nothing has been put which would justify this Court replacing her Honour's careful factual findings with its own assessment.  To do so would be contrary to principle (Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15]).  For the applicant to succeed on this ground he had to show that the undervaluing of his subjective case, in particular that relating to his relationship with Ms Abrahams, resulted in a sentence which was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  He has failed to establish that proposition.
92These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
Ground 4 - Her Honour erred in:
(a) Imposing a sentence of 13 years for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder when she intended to fix a sentence of 12 years.(b) Imposing an aggregate sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years rather than a total aggregate sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years and 3 months.(c) Failing to impose a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder.
93The applicant's submission on this ground depended upon the concluding paragraphs of the sentencing judgment of Latham J (see [47] hereof).  The applicant submitted that her Honour's intention when imposing sentence was correctly set out at [60] of her judgment where the head sentences for the offences were identified as 7 years for manslaughter and 12 years for the accessorial offence.
94He submitted that when her Honour came to setting out the detail of the sentences at [62] - [64] she erred in that the head sentence for the accessorial offence was expressed as 13 years, i.e. a non-parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 4 years.  The applicant submitted that on the assumption that [60] correctly set out her Honour's intent, a slip had clearly occurred so that the specific detail of the sentence for the accessorial offence should have been a head sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months.
Consideration
95 The applicant has a right to seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed: s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act. There is no right of appeal against the remarks on sentence. The remarks are relevant to ascertain whether there is an error in the sentence imposed. In the present case, Latham J imposed a sentence for a fixed term of 7 years commencing on 22 April 2011 for the manslaughter offence and a further sentence of 13 years (with a non-parole period of 9 years) commencing 22 April 2014 for the accessorial liability offence. The total effective sentence was 16 years. 
96The statutory ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act required that the non-parole period for the total term be 12 years, unless special circumstances were found (and they were not) or reasons were given for a higher ratio than the ratio of 75% between the non-parole period and the total term (and they were not): Rios v R [2012] NSWCCA 8.
97Accordingly, the total effective sentence and non-parole period imposed correctly reflected the individual sentences imposed for the two separate offences and provided for a non-parole period in accordance with the ratio in s 44.
98In these circumstances, the passing reference in the remarks to the ""head sentence of twelve years for the accessorial offence"" ([60] of the remarks) cannot reasonably be regarded but a slip. There is no justification for the submission that her Honour failed to take into account the 25% discount for the plea of guilty since her Honour expressed adverted to the need for the discount before imposing the sentence.
99The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
100FULLERTON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
101ADAMSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2704043,R v Gaul [2014] NSWDC 306,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Martin John Gaul. He has pleaded guilty to a crime called aggravated break, enter and steal. That is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards it as a serious offence because it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the offence. Not only that, Parliament regards it as so serious that it has additionally fixed a five year standard non‑parole period.
	


HIS HONOUR: I will just depart from my remarks on sentence. Have I asked Mr Gaul whether he adheres to his plea? I can’t remember?

FRASER: Yes. That was asked of him yesterday.

HIS HONOUR: Yesterday.

FRASER: He confirmed that.

HIS HONOUR: Have we checked with the Form 1 offences. Mr Gaul, you’re asking me to take into account the goods in custody and the housebreaking implements when I sentence you, that’s right, isn’t it?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And you admit your guilt for that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Good. I will return to my remarks on sentence.


	
	When I am sentencing him for the aggravated break, enter and steal, Mr Gaul has asked me to take into account two other offences. One is possessing housebreaking implements which is a crime against s 114(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of seven years imprisonment to that offence. The other offence he has asked me to take into account is one of goods in custody which is an offence against s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act carrying a maximum of six months imprisonment. I will take into account those two offences when I am sentencing Mr Gaul and I have signed a certificate to that effect.
	
	
	It is important for a judge in sentencing an offender to set out briefly what happened so that an assessment can be made of just how serious an example of the particular crime the offence was that the judge is sentencing the offender for.
	
	
	The crime in this case occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning 14 June 2014 at a block of units in Botany Road, Botany. One of the residents was woken up and when he looked through the window he saw household items scattered around the ground at the back of the block near the laundry. There is a common laundry on the ground floor at the back of unit block that is only accessible via an external door opening onto the backyard of the units.
	
	
	The resident saw Catrina Moy looking through the window into the laundry. She said a number of times “Babe, we got to go.” The resident bravely went down and asked Ms Moy what was going on. She claimed that she and her partner were moving into the units. The resident at that stage had seen a number of items belonging to himself amongst those scattered around in the backyard. Ms Moy was a little vague about whom she was moving in with.
	
	
	The resident sensibly phoned the police and again overheard Ms Moy saying, “I can’t carry anymore. I can’t fit anything else in my hands.” The police arrived and introduced themselves.
	
	
	At this stage Martin Gaul was on the scene. He had been inside the laundry. He claimed that they were visiting a friend in one of the units and that they themselves lived nearby.
	
	
	The police saw the items scattered around and they saw the window open and something hanging out of it. The laundry door itself was closed and locked. The police saw a large amount of property stacked up along the wall. They found a lot of property in a backpack that Mr Gaul had. Mr Gaul persevered in explaining that he was “just getting my tent out of the storage room so I had somewhere to sleep tonight.” The resident identified to the police a number of items that belonged to him or his family that were spread around the backyard.
	
	
	The facts which are part of exhibit A record that both Mr Gaul and Ms Moy “had been inside the laundry, gaining access to it by opening and climbing through the previously closed window.” Mr Gaul was inside the laundry handing items outside to Ms Moy who was packing them up. They had put some around the side of the house. Mr Gaul and, as it happens, Catrina Moy were both charged with aggravated break, enter and steal. The aggravation is the fact that they were in company.
	
	
	It is also important for a judge to say something about and to take into account the personal circumstances of an offender starting with any criminal record.
	
	
	In this case Mr Gaul has a criminal record. He did not start offending until his early 20s. Then he has a number of convictions including larceny, malicious damage, possessing drugs, apprehended violence orders matters and common assault. He has served community service orders, periodic detention and home detention. Most of the cases were dealt with in the Local Court.
	
	
	Mr Gaul has been in custody since his arrest on 14 June 2014. It is significant to note that when he committed this offence Mr Gaul was on bail in respect of other offences and his bail was revoked, so I need to take into account that factor as well.
	
	
	Ms R Fraser, who appeared for Mr Gaul, called her client to give evidence. She also tendered some helpful material in respect of her client including a report from a medical practitioner Dr Phil Wiren. Mr Gaul in evidence confirmed that he had been seeing Dr Wiren fortnightly for some three years. Mr Gaul also confirmed that the material contained in Dr Wiren’s report as well as another report from a clinical psychologist Michelle Player was truthful insofar as it recorded things that he had said.
	
	
	One matter which Mr Gaul to his credit disclosed is in evidence and which did not appear in the reports is that he spent some time addicted to heroin. He was apparently too ashamed to acknowledge that to the doctor and the psychologist. He acknowledged in evidence a longstanding problem with alcohol and prohibited drugs of dependence. To his credit he had been attending a Drug and Alcohol Support Group weekly in Darlinghurst, and again to his credit he said that he is not taking any illegal drugs in custody.
	
	
	This is Mr Gaul’s first time in custody apart from periodic detention and Ms Fraser asked him about it. He described it graphically by saying that his “nerves were shot”. He demonstrated this by picking up a cup in the witness box. It was obvious that his hand was shaking. He has been assaulted once in prison and was stood over a second time. He is currently in protection. At Parklea he obtained or was looking for work in the print shop. He said that he finds prison very stressful and frightening.
	
	
	Ms Fraser asked her client what he intended to do when he was released. He has a truck licence. He has experience in the past as a driver. He wants to upgrade his licence.
	


HIS HONOUR: Have you already got it, the MC?

OFFENDER: Yeah, I don’t have to upgrade because I’ve got a licence.

HIS HONOUR: You’ve got the MC already, haven’t you?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

His licence includes one which means that he can drive semitrailers and he is going to get some work of that kind which he has done before. He is going to move in with his brother who is a single man living in Botany and whom he has lived with before.


	
	He acknowledged not remembering much about the offence. He had taken a lot of Serepax but he did say how ashamed and deeply sorry he was that he had committed it.
	
	
	Under cross-examination by Ms S Harris who appeared as the Crown Prosecutor Mr Gaul explained that his brother has had no problems with the police and has no criminal record. He is in a relationship with his co-offender Catrina Moy but they will live separately when he is released. He wants to pursue some counselling to deal with his drug and alcohol addiction, although he says that he ceased drinking alcohol some years ago. He has also tried to come off drugs but evidently has had relapses, including the night of this crime. He explained that in prison he has put on a lot of weight and got his life back and does not intend to throw it away again by using illegal drugs. He would be prepared to do rehabilitation if necessary. He said that the biggest deterrent is being imprisoned again and he does not want to have to return.
	
	
	As I said, the material tendered by Ms Fraser was very helpful. Mr Gaul is being treated by a sympathetic and supportive medical practitioner who diagnosed Mr Gaul as suffering from a “schizoaffective psychosis”. I take into account that he is a not a psychiatrist but it is clear from the symptoms and the medication which has been prescribed for Mr Gaul in the past and currently that he has a mental health issue. Dr Wiren prescribed a management plan for his patient and assessed the factors for and against a positive prognostic outlook. He said that if Mr Gaul stays away from prohibited drugs and stays in good health and accepts support from those who can help him then that will point favourably to a good outlook. He thought that the overall prognosis was basically optimistic.
	
	
	Ms Fraser arranged for her client to be assessed by a forensic psychologist Michelle Player. Ms Player took a history of a childhood which she recorded as “characterised by his father modelling alcohol abuse on a nightly basis.” Mr Gaulhimself described his father as “a violent drunk.”
	
	
	Mr Gaul and Ms Moy have an 18 month old daughter but the daughter was removed from their care and placed in foster care at birth. He was in a former relationship for some nine years and has two sons from that relationship. They are now aged 13 and ten. He was apparently “devastated” when that relationship broke up and he responded by misusing alcohol for some years. He developed a cannabis habit and acknowledged that he was taking cannabis on the night of the offence. He has had past problems with amphetamines and abuse of prescribed medications including, as I said, taking some 15 Serepax tablets on the night of the crime.
	
	
	Ms Player also noted the anxiety which Mr Gaul is experiencing as a result of being in prison. She thought that he is “a psychologically vulnerable man who demonstrates poor insight with regard to his psychosocial function and behaviour.” She thought that Mr Gaul “would benefit from receiving support whilst in custody as well as substantial professional interventions as he transitions to the community.” Ms Player thought that Mr Gaul’s “main recidivism risk is that he will relapse to illicit drug or excessive alcohol use upon his release from gaol.”
	
	
	Ms Player thought that “gaol is unlikely to offer as much rehabilitative opportunity to Mr Gaul as compared to supervised, supported residence in the community where he can pursue stable employment, participate in pro‑social activities and better draw upon his brother’s support.” Ms Player expressed the opinion that a “sentence that allows him to maximise his time in the community under supervision and appropriate interventions ... should help in reducing his risk of recidivism.”
	
	
	Ms Fraser also prepared some very helpful and well-articulated written submissions on behalf of her client. She submitted that the offending was “an opportunistic, poorly planned, and poorly executed example of a break and enter type offence.” She also argued that the offence occurred late at night so that it would be less likely that residents would be around and that there was no damage and little property taken; in fact all of it was recovered. I accept those submissions.
	
	
	Ms Harris agreed that the offending was towards the lower end of the scale. She reminded me of course that nevertheless Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment to the crime. She pointed to Mr Gaul’s persistence in his efforts in persevering with the crime. She also reminded me that Mr Gaul was on conditional liberty at the time but acknowledged that there was no previous history of any break, enter and steal offence. Ms Harris also pointed out that Mr Gaul had benefited from leniency from the courts before and fairly acknowledged that his remorse seemed genuine. She proposed that his biggest concern was a need for drug rehabilitation.
	
	
	I also took into account - in agreeing that the crime was at the lower end of seriousness - Ms Fraser’s submission about the drug use on the night tending to show that the crime was “impulsive, unplanned and unorganised.”
	
	
	Ms Fraser submitted that her client is unlikely to reoffend. I think she is right in suggesting that so far as this specific kind of crime is concerned. Nevertheless he does have a record for other less serious offending. She proposed that her client’s prospects of rehabilitation were good because of his previous compliance with supervision, his early plea, accepting responsibility and the impact of prison. She also drew my attention to her client’s personal background. This is, she reminded me, her client’s first period of full‑time custody.
	
	
	Ms Harris and Ms Fraser parted ways in regard to the kind of sentence which should be imposed. Ms Harris argued that this crime can be met only with a sentence of full‑time custody. She made it clear that the time served to date is insufficient. On the other hand Ms Fraser argued that it is open for me to impose a sentence other than full‑time custody, including a suspended sentence.
	
	
	Given that this offence lies at the lower end of the range for seriousness and the limited previous record for this kind of crime I would regard an appropriate sentence for Mr Gaul as being one of two years and eight months imprisonment. However, he has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I will therefore discount that sentence by 25% to represent that plea. Accordingly, I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of two years imprisonment.
	
	
	It is at this point that I need to decide what to do with the opposing submissions of Ms Fraser and Ms Harris. I have decided to suspend the sentence of two years imprisonment and to direct Mr Gaul’s release today on a good behaviour bond that will accompany that suspended sentence.
	
	
	My reasons are these. First, Mr Gaul has already served some six months imprisonment as a result of this offending behaviour. I acknowledge that part of that may be because his bail was refused or revoked in respect of other offending. Nevertheless, as a result of a crime that he committed, he has now spent the last six months in prison.
	
	
	Secondly, I regard the impact which prison has had on him as genuine. He is obviously scared out of his wits by the environment that he finds himself in and I accept that it has had a very deterrent effect.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Gaul seems to have a settled plan which will contribute to some stability in his life. That plan involves not only accommodation but also employment which he is qualified for.
	
	
	Fourthly, I think it is important in Mr Gaul’s case that he receive as much benefit as possible from supervision and support within the community. In that regard I give some weight - some significant weight - to the reports of Ms Player and Dr Wiren. I would regard it as more desirable that, rather than a shorter non-parole period and longer parole period being less than two years, Mr Gaul should use the whole of the two years in his efforts to stabilise himself and get support and help. I also take into account Ms Fraser’s submission that her client has a track record of rehabilitation when he stopped his alcohol consumption at some time in the past.
	
	
	Finally, I confirm that I take into account that Mr Gaul has already spent a period of time in custody and I bear that in mind in suspending the sentence.
	


HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now, Mr Gaul, if you would stand up.


	
	I convict you of the offence of break, enter and steal. I impose a sentence of two years imprisonment. I make an order under s 12 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that your enter into a good behaviour bond for two years. The conditions of the good behaviour bond are these -
	



	
	That you be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That you notify the registrar of this court of your residential address and any change.
	
	
	That you attend court if you receive a notice to do so.
	
	
	That you accept supervision from Community Corrections and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions from any officer of that service.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I will go through that again in a moment, if you will just have a seat.

Ms Fraser and Mr Allison, any other conditions?

FRASER: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It’s just a general supervision by Community Corrections and they can work out what his needs are.

FRASER: I think that’s the most appropriate course, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Allison?

ALLISON: No more, in terms of that, your Honour, I don’t submit there be any further conditions required. I would wonder if your Honour’s minded to make an order for the transcript of these proceedings, particularly in relation to the co-offender.

HIS HONOUR: I will, I will make that direction now. I’ll make the order that my remarks on sentence, indeed, of the proceedings, I suppose of his evidence as well.

So I direct of transcript of yesterday’s proceedings and today’s remarks on sentence to be made available to me on or before, what’s the date for Ms Moy?

FRASER: 20 March 2015.

ALLISON: 20 March.

On or before 18 March 2015.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Gaul, you’ve got a suspended sentence. I should put it this way, you’ve got a gaol sentence of two years.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And I’ve suspended that.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: It’s still a gaol sentence.

OFFENDER: Yes, I understand that.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. You need to be processed by Correctives today and you need to be signed up for your good behaviour bond.

OFFENDER: What do you mean by “processed by Correctives”?

HIS HONOUR: They’re going to release you today, I imagine, I don’t know.

OFFENDER: At the courthouse or at Parklea?

HIS HONOUR: I’m not sure, let’s ask. What’s normal? They’re usually released from here but that’s, as he said, usually, I don’t know whether you’ve got stuff at Parklea or not, do you, you’ve probably got some belongings there or you don’t? I will leave that to them but you will be released by the sounds of it today but they’ve got to get forms filled in and things like that. But the important thing for you to remember is you’ve got a two year prison sentence dating from today but I have suspended it and what’s important to understand about a suspended sentence is it’s not like a normal good behaviour bond. If you breach a suspended sentence the law makes it very hard for the judge not to send you to gaol. So if you come back before me in the next two years having done something wrong and being breached, my hands are pretty well tied and I’ve got to send you back in.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Now that’s important for you to understand. You made a very big impression on me yesterday about prison and how you’re responding to it, so if you don’t want to go in, back in--

OFFENDER: No. I don’t want to go.

HIS HONOUR: I know you don’t. So you keep clean for two years.

OFFENDER: I will.

HIS HONOUR: All right. The second thing is I have made, conditions are, that you’ve got to obviously stay out of trouble. If you get a notice to come back to court you turn up rather than having the police and Sherriff’s Officers chasing after you, and let the court know where you’re living, your brother’s address. Are you going to go there today?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: What’s his address?

OFFENDER: 3/24 Chelmsford Ave, Botany.

HIS HONOUR: 3/24 Chelmsford Ave, Botany.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And his name is David Gaul, isn’t it?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, David Gaul. Okay, well there’s no need for you to notify the court we’ve got it on record now but if you change that address you let them know. And the last thing is you’ve got to let Corrections, which is the old Parole Service, Community Corrections supervise you and look after you because look you’ve got a drug addiction and an alcohol addiction. You’ve got a good track record, you’ve dealt with it as Ms Fraser points out but you know you’d taken all that Serepax, taken the cannabis and look where you found yourself - in someone’s backyard doing what you did and you’re here in court having spent six months in prison. So you need to deal with that or you’ll be back. They’ll help you and they will encourage you with your employment. So let them help you, and that’s a condition that you agree to comply with what they suggest. Does all that make sense?

OFFENDER: That’s good.

HIS HONOUR: All right, good, I’m going to check with Ms Fraser.

FRASER: Yes, your Honour, just something that’s come to mind, ordinarily you may direct the offender to attend Probation and Parole or Corrective Services within a seven day period.

HIS HONOUR: That’s a good point. What’s the nearest place, Botany, so what would be the--

FRASER: It’s probably the city office at Wentworth Avenue.

OFFENDER: The city.

HIS HONOUR: The city office at Wentworth Avenue.

OFFENDER: Yes.

Part of the order will be that you attend the city office of the Community Corrections Service on or before next Wednesday 24 December 2014.

HIS HONOUR: Now that’s less than a week but I want you to turn up before Christmas, that’s why I’ve given you that time. I don’t want to leave it until after Christmas because it might be too long. I want you to be focussed, get to Wentworth Avenue, sign up with them and start getting help now so that you can get back on track.

OFFENDER: I’ll be there tomorrow.

HIS HONOUR: Good on you. Anything else, Ms Fraser?

FRASER: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Allison?

ALLISON: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you both for your assistance. Good luck.

OFFENDER: Thanks a lot, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I will now adjourn.

2704044,R v Jiao (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 353,"Judgment


	
	Yi-Hua Jiao was charged by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions with an offence against the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). The charge was laid under s 400.9(1) of the Code. The charge is contained in an indictment which was filed in the District Court on 12 December 2013. The charge alleged that between 19 and 22 January 2013, in Sydney, Ms Jiao “dealt with money, it being reasonable to suspect that the money was proceeds of crime, and at the time of dealing the value of the money was $100,000 or more.”
	
	
	Ms Jiao was arraigned before me on 1 December 2014 on the presentation of that indictment by Mr B Neild, the Crown Prosecutor. She pleaded not guilty and accordingly there was a trial with a jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty two days ago on 17 December 2014. I therefore now have to sentence Ms Jiao for this crime, which I convicted her of when the jury returned with its verdict.
	
	
	It is first important for a judge to set out briefly what happened which constituted the crime, so that the judge can make an assessment of how serious an example of the crime this particular offence was. Ms Jiao holds two passports, one from Taiwan and one from New Zealand. She flew to Australia on 18 January 2013 and was staying at the Star Casino here in Sydney.
	
	
	Two days later, on 20 January, she collected a bag of money from a man who has been identified as a Mr Nguyen. She did not know Mr Nguyen before collecting the money. There was an arrangement for them to be able to identify each other. It involved the serial number on an Australian $5 note. Once the identification was made, Ms Jiao accompanied Mr Nguyen into the casino car park. They then returned to the room in which she was staying in the hotel attached to the casino. There we understand that the bag was opened. It was a backpack covered with a plastic bag. Inside the backpack was money. The money was Australian currency. Ms Jiao then went down to the casino part of the building and handed the money in to be counted. The money amounted to over $620,000.
	
	
	I heard evidence from a relatively senior member of the casino staff about the condition of the money. The bank notes were not in good condition, or at least many of them were not. They were in some way soiled and they were gritty. They were not wrapped in a way consistent with the way that a bank would wrap currency.
	
	
	Ms Jiao then wanted to transfer the money to another account, but was not permitted to by the casino for its own reasons to do with its procedures. She was given instructions about what she could and could not do. She could bank it into an account in her own name.
	
	
	The following day, which was a Monday, she withdrew about half the amount and took it to a nearby Commonwealth Bank. By this stage the casino staff had become suspicious about the funds and had alerted the Australian Federal Police. The police turned up at the Bank and arrested Ms Jiao. They interviewed her at length. She appeared to be cooperative and forthcoming with information. The result of the interview was the charge that I have referred to, which is that she dealt with money in circumstances where it was reasonable to suspect that the money was the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	As I have said, that is an offence against s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). The Commonwealth Parliament has fixed a maximum of three years’ imprisonment to that offence. The maximum used to be two years’ imprisonment. But it seems to me from a footnote to that provision in one of the services, that the maximum was increased with effect from 19 March 2010.
	
	
	It is important to note, as the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed in Shi v R [2014] NSWCCA 276, that there is no requirement to prove any knowledge or belief as to the money being the proceeds of crime: see [42] of the judgment of Bellew J, with whom Leeming JA and Fullerton J agreed.
	
	
	It is also important to note that one of the issues before the jury in this case was the question of whether Ms Jiao had made out a defence to the charge under s 400.9(5) of the Criminal Code by proving that she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the money was derived or realised directly or indirectly from some form of unlawful activity. That issue was squarely put before the jury and it rejected that defence by the verdict which it returned.
	
	
	I have been assisted in the sentence proceedings by Mr Neild and by Mr F Santisi of counsel, who appeared for Ms Jiao in the trial and in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Neild emphasised the importance of general deterrence in a case such as this. That emphasis is supported by Bellew J and the Court of Criminal Appeal in Shi because the Court had to resentence the offender in that case. His Honour said at [109] that “[m]oney laundering is a serious criminal activity.” The offending, I might add, in that case was more persistent and serious. But in the same paragraph his Honour agreed with the sentencing judge in that case that “general deterrence is an important factor in the consideration of an appropriate sentence”. I accept Mr Neild’s submission.
	
	
	I also accept the submission of Mr Neild that it was not a fleeting or transitory transaction. Mr Santisi argued that the behaviour was short‑lived. I do not agree with that. The behaviour occurred over a couple of days. I think it is fair to say that it is not as serious as behaviour which might occur over some weeks, but I think Mr Neild is right in characterising it as not fleeting or transitory.
	
	
	I also accept Mr Neild’s submission that the amount of money involved is well over the minimum for that offence of $100,000. It is over six times the minimum. That must be a factor which I take into account.
	
	
	I take into account, objectively speaking, that the transactions as found by the jury were obviously done in circumstances where it was reasonable to suspect that the money was proceeds of crime. That follows from the condition of the bank notes and the use of the process of identification. I repeat I make that observation as an objective factor. I do not attribute to Ms Jiao any subjective intention insofar as I am sentencing her, I am talking about the transaction as such.
	
	
	To my mind the offence does not fall at the lowest end of this kind of offending because of the amount involved and the fact that it was over a couple of days. On the other hand it is far from the most serious example of this crime and probably falls just within the middle of the range of seriousness for crimes such as this.
	
	
	Mr Neild pointed out that in some cases offenders plead guilty and as a result the sentence which they receive is discounted. The discount will reflect the fact that the offenders have facilitated the course of justice and exhibited some contrition. Those submissions are not available to Ms Jiao. She is not being penalised for defending her case, it is simply that arguments available to other offenders are not available to her.
	
	
	Mr Neild fairly acknowledged that Ms Jiao’s prospects of rehabilitation must be good. This is her first offence. The police acknowledge that there is no record of any criminal behaviour on her part that they can find anywhere.
	
	
	Mr Neild submitted that in the circumstances I can impose nothing less than a sentence of full‑time in custody. Indeed s 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) provides that I “shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment” unless “after having considered all other available sentences” I am “satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case”.
	
	
	Mr Santisi argued that I need not impose a sentence of full‑time imprisonment. In his helpful written and oral submissions, he pointed out that his client is a foreign national of otherwise good character who will find full‑time custody difficult in Australia. She has no family here.
	
	
	I accept that there was no victim as such, and there was no actual loss because the money was confiscated. Indeed it is the subject of separate proceedings. Although I have taken it into account in assessing where this lies objectively in the range of seriousness, it was, as Mr Santisi argued, relatively unsophisticated. I also accept that it is unlikely that Ms Jiao would reoffend.
	
	
	Mr Neild took me to a schedule of comparative cases which became MFI 54. They are the matter of Shi, which I have already mentioned, along with Assafiri [2007] NSWCCA 159 and Cahyadi (2007) 168 A Crim R 41. I have received a good deal of assistance from those cases.
	
	
	I also accept that it appears that Ms Jiao was cooperative in her interview with the police. I take into account her age and the fact that she has no previous convictions. However, what it seems to me is apparent from the authorities that I have referred to, is that the courts regard this kind of offending against s 400.9(1) as very serious. It seems that the Federal Parliament also regards it as serious. That is borne out by the fact that it saw fit to increase the maximum penalty a few years ago. Such a step by Parliament is consistent with courts being required to increase sentences which are imposed for that crime.
	
	
	I note in the matter of Shi, where the maximum was three years, that the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal was one of one year and three months. However that was after a plea of guilty and after taking into account more than the sentencing judge had - assistance given by the offender to the authorities. I acknowledge that the offending behaviour as set out at [109] of Bellew J’s judgment was more serious than the offending in this case, but the sentences, for example, in respect of counts 1 and 2 (I should add one and three of the sentences were the same) were respective sums of money which were not far removed from the amount involved in this case.
	
	
	I note that in the other two cases which I have referred to, the Court of Criminal Appeal imposed or agreed with sentences of full time custody when the maximum was two years’ imprisonment. The relative amount involved in Cahyadi was less than the amount involved here. The same can be said for the amount in Assafiri.
	
	
	Given the importance of general deterrence and despite the material put before me by Mr Santisi and the arguments presented, I do regard this as a case where I have no other option than to sentence Ms Jiao to a sentence of full time imprisonment. It is regrettable that for a person of her age and time in life she will have to go to gaol, but it seems to me that both Parliament and the Court of Criminal Appeal in New South Wales have made it clear, which I of course accept, that these kinds of crimes are regarded as serious and that general deterrence is an important factor.
	
	
	I regard an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances, given the observations and findings which I have made, as being one of six months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	​Ms Jiao, I sentence you to six months’ imprisonment for the offence. It will commence today, 19 December 2014, and it will expire on 18 June 2015.
	



	
	​I direct that the exhibits in the trial be retained in the Court registry. In the event of no notice of appeal either against conviction or sentence being filed on or before Friday, 27 February 2015, I direct that the exhibits be returned to the parties who tendered them.

2704046,Gogani v R [2014] NSWCCA 313,"Judgment


1PRICE J: Yashar Gogani, the applicant, was tried in May 2013 before his Honour Judge Norrish QC and a jury of 12 on an indictment containing the following charges: 

Count 1: That the applicant between the 27 January 2011 and 22 March 2011 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with Neil Pettersen, Terry Faumuina and other unknown persons to break and enter the premises of the Perfume Network of Australia Pty Ltd ('The Perfume Network') in Rosehill and commit a serious offence within, namely larceny, in the circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company with Neil Pettersen, Terry Faumuina and other unknown persons. 

This is an offence of conspiracy to commit the offence of aggravated break, enter, and steal (aggravated by being in company). Whilst the substantive offence the subject of the conspiracy alleged against the applicant is an offence against s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the offence of conspiracy to commit such an offence itself is a common law offence. 

Count 2: That the applicant, on or about 20 March 2011 at Rosehill in the State of New South Wales, did steal an Isuzu truck registration BB58UH, the property of Jamil El Helwah. This is an offence contrary to s 154A(1) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 5 years. 

2The trial commenced on 13 May 2013 and the jury returned its verdict of guilty to both counts on 27 May 2013. On 9 August 2013, the applicant was sentenced as follows: 

Count 1: a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months imprisonment, commencing on 7 August 2013, with an additional term of 2 years and 9 months imprisonment. The earliest date the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is 6 May 2018.

Count 2: 18 months imprisonment, commencing on 7 August 2013 and concluding on 6 February 2015. 

The appeal against conviction: 

3The applicant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence on count 1. He neither appeals against his conviction on count 2 nor the sentence imposed. 

4The sole ground against his conviction on count 1 is that ""the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence."" 

Crown case and evidence at trial: 


5The case against the applicant on the first count was circumstantial. The Crown alleged that the applicant, Mr Pettersen, Mr Faumuina and other unknown persons, agreed to and planned to break into and enter the premises of the Perfume Network (a warehouse and retail premises) at 142 James Ruse Drive, Rosehill and to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, in circumstances of aggravation, namely in company with Mr Pettersen, Mr Faumuina and unknown persons. The Perfume Network's premises was located on the western side of James Ruse Drive between the Rosehill Racecourse and the Parramatta River and operated within a complex of other businesses in the vicinity of 142 James Ruse Drive. 

6The evidence at trial revealed that the Perfume Network's Warehouse in March 2011 had several million dollars in stock. From 27 January 2011- 21 March 2011, the applicant was the subject of lawful telephonic interception and visual surveillance.

7The Crown adduced evidence from recordings of intercepted telephone material involving the applicant, Mr Pettersen, Mr Faumuina and others, and lawfully intercepted SMS messages said to be sent to, or sent by the applicant. The Crown also relied on surveillance reports of the applicant, Mr Pettersen and others conducted by undercover operatives within NSW Police, CCTV footage, and a tax invoice recording the visit to Bunnings Warehouse in Artarmon by Mr Pettersen, the applicant and another person. 

8The evidence that the Crown principally relies upon is summarised in the chronology below. For ease of understanding the Crown case, the Crown submissions as to particular items of evidence are included in the chronology.

Mr Pettersen (product 1412): ""Cause we just - don't we need to go two out, right, to see her and then we've got to get rid of the girls later.""

It was submitted by the Crown that the references to meeting girls, hotties and bitches was coded conversation about preparing for the break and enter and obtaining cars.

The Crown relies on this telephone call to highlight a declared intention on the part of the applicant to be present when the offence is committed. 


7 March
10:48
(AB 335)

Telephone call (product 10082): Mr Pettersen telephoned the Perfume Network asking for its opening and closing hours. The female who answered the phone said they opened at 9:00am and closed at 5:30pm. This is the only direct reference to the Perfume Network in the evidence.

Attendance of the applicant in company with Mr Pettersen to purchase:
Cutter bolt Trojan;
Gloves garden; and
Axe gardenmaster.

The Crown contended that the purchase of these items was clearly evidence of the conspirators arming themselves with tools to effect forced entry to the Perfume Network's premises. 


Telephone intercept material continued 


9 March
17:27
(AB 339 - 354)

Numerous telephone calls between the applicant, Mr Pettersen and Mr Faumuina referring to 'breakfast' and 'dinner'. 
Applicant told Mr Pettersen that Mr Faumuina and his mates (AB 348): ""Just him and his mates are all keen for dinner.""

The Crown case was that references to dinner was to doing the break and enter at night-time and breakfast referred to doing the break and enter in the daytime.

While, ""arcay"", ""objay"" and ""ivingdray"" are respectively Pig Latin for car, job and driving.


10 March
16:51
(AB 368)

Telephone call (product 10320):
Applicant: ""Worst-case scenario: if, if it's worse, worst-case, you guys are going to have to come to me.""

Reply from Mr Faumuina: ""Nah fukn oaf. Dont want to catch any diseases. We'll meet soon then.""
The Crown submitted that there must have been something more than just a plan to do more surveillance at that point.


Telephone intercept material continued 


11 March
15:45
(AB 397)

Telephone call (product 6103):

(AB 439)

Telephone call (product 11082):
Applicant: ""Um, somebody needs to go to Bunnings before nine o'clock.""
Mr Pettersen: ""Yeah I won't be able to get there, have to just go to the servo or something.""


20 March
21:53
(AB 441)

Telephone call (product 11083): the applicant told Mr Pettersen that he was leaving his house. 


20 March
22:41
(AB 197)

Surveillance report by 1688 who observed the applicant attending a BP service station, 669 Pennant Hills Road, in Beecroft. 


Surveillance report of the applicant and Mr Pettersen by 1951 (ex K)


20 March 
23:33
(AB 199)

The surveillance report by 1951 observed the applicant reach into the window of the Mazda (BFR85Z), which was parked beside the northern kerb of Gladstone street, North Parramatta 50 metres east of Brickfield Street and withdraw his hand: ""The applicant walked to the driver's side of vehicle BFR85Z and appeared to reach into the vehicle via the open driver's door window and back out again."" 

The Crown submitted that even though the items purchased at Bunnings Warehouse Artarmon on 8 March 2011 were not seen in the possession of the conspirators, the applicant was seen to reach into the open driver's door window and withdraw his hand. 


20 March - Stealing of the Isuzu truck (BB58UH) (ex K)


20 March
23:38
(AB 199)

Mr Pettersen, and the applicant were observed approaching and standing next to an Isuzu truck, the subject of the count 2 offence. Mr Pettersen then drove the truck, and the applicant followed in the Mazda. The route taken by the vehicles was marked on ex C1. At 11:52pm the truck was parked on the eastern kerb of Arthur Street in Parramatta, 50 metres north of Hassal Street, and the Mazda was parked behind it (ex C1, C2 and C3 provide maps of the vicinity). 

The Crown submits this was a final preparatory step to the commission of the aggravated break, enter and steal which was planned to be committed shortly after 7:30am on 21 March 2011.

The Crown contends that the stealing of the truck and the parking of it near the rear of the Perfume Network premises at a time when it was proposed to commit the offence, when considered together with the other evidence, is consistent with an agreement to commit the offence charged. 


21 March - SMS message at 1:57am


01:57
(AB 442)

SMS message sent from the applicant to Mr Faumuina at 1:57am on 21 March 2011 (product 7953):
""From the wog cancel cancel never ever dont write back to this!!""

The Crown relies on this to show that the applicant was aware that whatever he and Mr Pettersen were doing had been compromised. 


Between 5:27 and 11:06am
(AB 443)

Mr Faumuina called Sarah Wilson's (the applicant's de facto) phone number, five times. On each occasion it went to voicemail. He did not leave a message.


9Jonne Sofrenic, a Senior Intelligence Analyst with the Police Department, prepared ex C1, C2 and C3. Ex C1 is a UBD street map of Parramatta, Oatlands, Camellia and Harris Park. Ex C2 and C3 are aerial maps, with ex C3 being a zoomed in view of the relevant areas around the Perfume Network. 

10Detective Senior Constable Wolsely, who took 8 photographs (ex A) of the Perfume Network on 3 May 2012, gave evidence. Detective Wolsely, took the photograph (ex A3) standing in front of the car spot where the black Suzuki Swift was, parked facing the Perfume Network. He stated (T9 24-27):

""You can see the perfume warehouse there, which is the building on the left. You can see the start of the word ""Wholesale"", W-H, and P-E-R underneath, which is ""Wholesale Perfumes."" That's a view that would have been seen by the occupants in the black Suzuki.""

11When asked about the distance between the location of the abandoned Isuzu truck (ex C3 4), Detective Wolsely agreed that the distance of the drive to the Perfume Network in the Rosehill Business Park (ex C3 1) would be approximately 350 metres (T380 46-48).

12Detective Senior Constable Benjamin Morgan, who took photographs of the Perfume Network on 6 May 2013, described what was depicted in the photographs (ex F). In cross-examination, Detective Morgan agreed that the Perfume Network is contained within an industrial or commercial complex on James Ruse Drive with a number of other businesses. He said that it is not possible to see the premises of the Perfume Network from a carpark directly across from James Ruse Drive. When asked about the number of lanes and how busy James Ruse Drive is, he replied (T53 23-24):

""Not exactly sure on how many lanes it is, but it's a busy road, yes. There's a number - there's more than one lane each way, yes.""

13Jamil El Helweh gave evidence that in March 2011, he was the owner of a white Pantec Isuzu truck registration number BB58UH. Mr El Helweh said that he had an online store and was selling homewares that were basically high end kitchenware. He used the truck for storage of the high end kitchenware and had only driven the truck around five times during the entire time that he owned it. When the truck was not being used, Mr El Helweh parked it about 15 to 20 metres from the entrance to his home address in Parramatta. The truck was an old truck with a separate door and ignition keys and a further key for the padlock on the back of the truck. Mr El Helweh had only one set of keys for each of the three locks to the truck and no-one else had copies of the keys.

14Mr El Helwah last saw the truck on Saturday 19 March 2011 when he parked it in the usual spot. When asked whether it was locked or not, Mr El Helweh replied (T245 3-4): 

""I've always kept it locked because I stored quite expensive stuff in it. Usually I wouldn't keep it open. I would have had it locked."" 

15Early on Monday 21 March 2011, Mr El Helweh was informed by police that his truck was located on Arthur Street, North Parramatta. When he attended at Arthur Street, he saw his truck with the right hand side door slightly open and the back doors open about 30 centimetres. The truck's ignition had been pulled apart with wires hanging down. He said that the shelving units on each side that he had used for storage had fallen down and the stock that had been on the shelving was on the floor. 

16Mr El Helweh marked ex M, an aerial map, with an X to indicate the location where his truck was found. In cross-examination, he disagreed that it was difficult for him to be precise about where the truck was found on Arthur Street because of the time that had elapsed. He agreed that he told police that he didn't notice anything missing from the back of the truck. 

17The Crown called Manish Aggarwal, a self-employed businessman who operated the Perfume Network, a business which imported designer perfumes. The business operated from premises located in Unit 1, 142 James Ruse Drive Parramatta, which was part of the Rosehill Business Park. Access to the Business Park was via River Road West. 

18The business had a showroom at the front for wholesale and retail customers with an office area and warehouse at the back. The majority of the stock was kept in the warehouse in boxes stored on pallets. There were 4 rows of about 25 metres long and 2 aisles of pallets. The average weight of a pallet was between 100 and 500 kilograms. The pallets were loaded and unloaded with a forklift, with the highest pallet sitting about 4.4 metres high. Mr Aggarwal's warehouse was approximately 90% full at March 2011. At that time, the total value of the stock kept on premises was just over $4 million. 


19Mr Aggarwal identified ex F1 as a photograph of the warehouse. The rear entrance to the warehouse consisted of a gate that opened up followed by a roller door. In front of the gate, there were three bollards and another four at the back of the gate. He identified two sirens that made noise if the warehouse was broken into. He said (T261 5-7):

""At any break-in, through the front door, to the back door, if anyone forces entry into the warehouse, the sensors will pick that up and the sirens will go off.""

20There was also a CCTV camera. A back to base alarm system, activated by sensors and monitored by an alarm company was operational in the warehouse before March 2011. On top of the warehouse gate was a sensor, which was activated when the gates opened. Two white sirens were connected to the alarm. To the right of the roller door was a further small door, which opened the warehouse. The door had mesh and a single bollard on the inside. This door was also fitted with an alarm sensor and was unchanged since March 2011.

21In cross-examination, Mr Aggarwal agreed that he had been in the business complex since January 2005. In March 2011, he said there were roughly 10 businesses in the complex. His attention was drawn to the northern entrance of the Rosehill Business Park on ex C3, near where the words ""River Road West"" appear. He agreed that is where his stock came in. His business was open for retail between 9:00am and 5:30pm and was a busy business. 

22When asked about the other businesses in the complex, he knew that unit 3 opened at about 7:30am. He identified unit 3 on ex C3.

23In her closing address, the Crown told the jury that the Crown relied upon ""a consideration of the totality of the calls, what is said in those calls by the [applicant] and others, together with the surveillance evidence, their visit to Bunnings on 8 March, which shows that the [applicant] must have had this agreement with these other persons to break and enter the Perfume Network for the purpose of stealing and that he intended that was to happen."" (T3 36-42)

24The Crown suggested to the members of the jury that they considered ""what the [applicant] really meant when he was talking in those calls, what others were saying to him and what he says himself that he is doing and going to do, and you compare that to what he was doing and going to do as seen by surveillance officers and the locations where he was"" (T18 27-34). The Crown submitted that the evidence showed beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant conspired with Mr Pettersen, Mr Faumuina and the others to commit the break and enter offence for the purpose of stealing in the circumstances where those others were to be present. 

The applicant's case at trial

25The applicant did not give or call evidence during the trial. The applicant did not dispute that the inference was reasonably available that he and Mr Pettersen were planning a nefarious activity, which quite possibly included criminal activity, across the indictment period. 

26The arguments made to the jury by the applicant's counsel included the following: 

""The concession must readily be made the Crown case is reasonably convincing on the chain of reasoning that Gogani, Faumuina and Pettersen are talking in code. They're planning an event by talking in code, in part, leading to the conclusion that the event is highly likely to be the commission of a crime. But when it comes to proving that that asserted crime is a break enter and steal, aggravated by being in company and nothing else, I submit to you the Crown case becomes considerably less compelling"" (T11 6-13).

In the early morning of 21 March 2011, the Isuzu truck was recovered with high end cookware still in the back from storage from Mr El Helwah's business. Ex C3 shows that the truck was abandoned on Arthur Street near the corner of Tramway Avenue, Parramatta. The truck location is at a point inconvenient for loading up with stolen goods from the Perfume Network; 

The fact that a truck was used instead of a car, allows an inference to be made that it was to be used to load up stolen goods. However, it would not be suitable for that purpose, with high-end cookware throughout the storage area of the truck. The applicant and his associates would need to dump that somewhere, whether it's on Arthur Street or elsewhere, hot wire to start it, drive it through the adjoining streets of a grand total distance (which Detective Constable Wolsely agreed), was approximately 350 metres, including turning off River Road West into the Rosehill Business Park before parking it near the rear of unit 1 where the Perfume Network is located; and 

The sun would have been well and truly up at 7:30am on 21 March 2011, the alleged time of the break and enter. 

27It was the defence case that the Crown had not disproved any of the following hypotheses consistent with an acquittal on the indictment, namely (AWS 8):

(a)""That across the indictment period the applicant and Mr Pettersen had planned to commit a different offence or offences, an unknown offence of offences, or had commenced negotiations on poorly-defined plans to commit offences (falling in short of reaching a concluded agreement) - or some combination of these possibilities;
(b)That the plan as alleged was not shown to require the applicant's actual presence at the scene during the commission of the break, enter and steal (on the hypothesis that the jury accepted that the plan was to commit a break, enter and steal), having the effect that he did not conspire to commit the particular offence alleged, as that offence required the applicant to be in the company with his co-offenders; and 
(c)That the target premises was not the Perfume Network at James Ruse Drive, Rosehill.""

Ground 1: The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence

28Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides relevantly as follows: 

""6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases 

(1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence..."" 


29The correct approach to determining a ground of appeal which asserts that verdicts are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, was considered by the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400. The majority summarised the relevant principles as follows: 

""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal 

[11] It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ: 

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty'. 

[12] This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.' 

[13] The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.' 

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter. 

[14] In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality'. In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated: 

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""

Argument 

30Mr Game SC submitted the inference was reasonably available that the applicant and Mr Pettersen were planning a nefarious activity, which quite possibly included criminal activity, somewhere near the general vicinity of the Rosehill Business Park. However, he contended there was no evidence that the break and enter was going to occur at the Perfume Network. He pointed out that there was only one direct reference made to the Perfume Network, namely, the telephone call by Mr Pettersen on 7 March 2011. He argued that it could not be excluded that another business or premises was the real target of what was planned by the applicant and his associates. 

31A further submission was that there was nothing in the surveillance evidence to exclude the businesses along James Ruse Drive, Rosehill, including the nine other businesses located in the same industrial complex as the Perfume Network, as the asserted target of any conspiracy, or even to indicate that the Perfume Network was a more likely target. He submitted that the surveillance evidence went no higher than that the applicant and his associates were observed in the general area of the Perfume Network premises on 1 February 2011. 

32Mr Game contended that the surveillance evidence of 1 February 2011, has limited probative value because the surveillance operatives did not describe any of the three occupants of the vehicle walking from the business complex onto the eastern footpath of James Ruse Drive, peering or pointing across James Ruse Drive, or doing anything else to suggest that their attention was on the Perfume Network. He acknowledged that there was no dispute that the applicant was involved in the majority of the intercepted telephone calls. However, he submitted that the contents of the telephone calls, particularly those closest to the alleged conspiracy were at best for the Crown, equivocal on the issue of whether the applicant was personally going to be present to a degree where he was ""in company."" 

33Another submission was that the telephone conversation on 5 March 2011, where the applicant states ""and find out about that other thing for me"" is suggestive of a reference to another job. He argued that it would be very difficult to infer that this telephone call was a reference to a job that was being planned for the 20-21 March 2011. 

34Mr Game stated that it seemed far-fetched to suggest that a bolt cutter, an axe and gardening gloves would suffice to break into the Perfume Network's comprehensive security system and that any such entry and theft could be accomplished without detection. He argued that despite the fact that the applicant and Mr Pettersen were under police surveillance on 20-21 March 2011, when the plan was alleged to have come to a head, neither of them were seen that night with any of the equipment purchased at Bunnings; nor were any of those items found in the Isuzu truck when the police recovered it in the early morning of 21 March 2011. He argued that nothing in the evidence clearly pointed towards a conspiracy to commit a break and enter and it was therefore not open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt the applicant's guilt of count 1. He stated that it was not open to the jury to conclude that the applicant planned with his associates to commit break, enter and steal (and no other offence); that the plan included his presence while the offence was being committed; nor that the target premises was the Perfume Network. Mr Game submitted that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 

35The submissions made by the Crown as to particular items of evidence have been summarised in the chronology at [8] above. Mr Adams for the Crown contended that the applicant's submissions focused on inferences that could not be drawn from individual pieces of evidence, rather than the inferences that were available from the entire circumstantial matrix. He argued that the three elements in contention could be proved by inferring their existence from the evidence tendered in Court. 

36Mr Adams submitted that the Perfume Network was the target premises. He pointed out that persons, who are intending to commit a burglary, speak in code about their intentions and preparations and are cautious not to name the target premises. He contended that the jury were entitled to have regard not only to the contents of the telephone conversations, but also to the proximity of conversations and events with one another. He argued that the telephone conversation of the 31 January 2011, in which the applicant (who was driving at the time), is conversing with Mr Pettersen in a manner that is consistent, (when considered in combination with the surveillance evidence, various telephone calls, particularly those of 28 January 2011 and 7 March 2011) with him being directed to the Perfume Network, as opposed to the general vicinity of the Rosehill Business Park. He pointed out that the telephone conversation on 31 January 2011 occurred the day before the applicant, Mr Pettersen and Mr Faumuina are observed in the carpark across the road from the Perfume Network by surveillance operatives. 

37Another submission was that the telephone conversation of the 5 March 2011, containing the assertion ""...I'm going to be eating as well"" shows a declared intention on the part of the applicant to be present when the offence is committed. 

38Mr Adams contended that the applicant's visit to Bunnings Warehouse Artarmon on 8 March 2011 in company with Mr Pettersen, to purchase a bolt cutter, an axe and gardening gloves was clearly evidence of the conspirators arming themselves with tools to effect forced entry into the Perfume Network. He submitted that even though the items were not seen in the possession of the conspirators on the evening of the 20 March 2011, the surveillance police at Brickfield Street, North Parramatta observed the applicant reach into the window of the Mazda and withdraw his hand. 

39Another submission was that the stealing of the Isuzu truck on 20 March 2011, was a final preparatory step to the commission of the aggravated break, enter and steal which was to be committed shortly after 7:30am on 21 March 2011. Mr Adams argued that the stolen truck being parked in Arthur Street at midnight gave the conspirators the ability to drive straight up into River Road at 7.30am and a commercial vehicle had been chosen so as not to arouse suspicion. He said whether the conspirators intended to take pallets of perfume was unknown. He submitted that ""the modus operandi"" was not something the Crown had to prove. Mr Adams pointed out that the text message sent by the applicant at 1:57am on 21 March 2011 showed that the applicant was aware that whatever he and Mr Pettersen were doing had been compromised. 

40Mr Adams urged the Court to consider the evidence in combination, whereby the totality of the telephone intercept material, surveillance reports, attendance of the applicant at Bunnings Warehouse Artarmon, establish that the planned offence was a break, enter and steal at the Perfume Network. He submitted that the appeal should be dismissed.
Consideration 

41In a circumstantial case, the evidence must be considered as a whole and not by a piecemeal approach to each particular circumstance: Chamberlain v R [No 2] [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521. As was said by the majority (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ) in R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [46]:

""It has often been said that a jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances. It is of critical importance to recognise, however, that in considering a circumstantial case, all the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence.""

42Because of the particulars in the indictment, in order to establish that the applicant was guilty of count 1, the Crown was obliged to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that there was an agreement reached between the applicant, Mr Pettersen, Mr Faumuina and others whereby:

(i) They were to commit a break, enter and steal offence;

(ii) The targeted premises was the Perfume Network; and 

(iii) The applicant and others were to be physically present at the time of the commission of the planned offence.

43The applicant accepted both at trial and upon appeal that it was reasonably open to the jury to find that he, Mr Pettersen and Mr Faumuina were speaking in code and were planning to commit a crime. The principal submission, however, was that it was not open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the targeted premises was the Perfume Network and the applicant was to be physically present during the commission of the break, enter and steal. 

44The circumstantial evidence to be considered as a whole and in combination includes: 

(a) The telephone conversation of 31 January 2011 between the applicant and Mr Pettersen whereby Mr Pettersen provides directions to him. This evidence is to be considered with ex C1 and ex G to indicate that the Perfume Network is in a location consistent with ""down on your right"" to which Mr Pettersen makes reference in the call;

(b) On 1 February 2011, the applicant, Mr Pettersen and Mr Faumuina were observed by the police undercover operatives driving together in a car into the carpark in an industrial complex on the north east corner of Grand Avenue North and James Ruse Drive, Camellia at 5.02pm. The car was parked so that it was facing west. The men exited and re-entered the car on a number of occasions before driving off at 5.35pm. This carpark was over the other side of James Ruse Drive from the Perfume Network premises and the industrial complex in which these premises were located;

(c) The telephone conversation between the applicant and Mr Faumuina on 5 March 2011 during which the applicant said: ""But I don't need too many people to come to dinner just one or two because I'm going to be eating as well"";

(d) Mr Pettersen's telephone call on 7 March 2011 to the Perfume Network asking for its opening and closing times;

(e) The applicant's attendance with Mr Pettersen at Bunning's Warehouse Artarmon on 8 March 2011 when a bolt cutter, garden gloves and axe were purchased;

(f) The stealing of the Isuzu truck on 20 March 2011; 

(g) The telephone call on 20 March 2011 with Mr Pettersen during which the applicant asked ""...and what time should I say to make, um, the booking is in the morning? Seven-thirty?"";

(h) The surveillance report of the applicant and Mr Pettersen getting out of the Mazda at 11.22pm on 20 March 2011 and walking out of sight. At 11.33pm they walked back to the vehicle. The applicant reached in through the driver's door window. He then walked around the back of the car to where Mr Pettersen was standing. The two of them crouched down, then stood up and walked north on Brickfield Street until they were out of sight; 

(i) The surveillance report of the two men a few minutes later standing next to the stolen truck. Mr Pettersen then drove the truck with the applicant following in the Mazda. At 11.52pm, the truck was parked on the eastern kerb of Arthur Street in Parramatta, 50 metres north of Hassall Street and the Mazda was parked behind it. At midnight, the Mazda was driven away from Arthur Street by the applicant with Mr Pettersen sitting in the passenger seat; and 

(j) The SMS message sent at 1.57am on 21 March 2011 from the applicant to Mr Faumuina ""from the wog cancel cancel never ever don't write back to this!!""

45The requirement to consider the evidence as a whole does not mean that the Crown case must be considered at its highest in favour of the Crown and that evidence unfavourable to the Crown is to be disregarded. 

46The telephone call between Mr Pettersen and the applicant providing directions on 31 January 2011 did not result in the applicant driving into the premises of the Perfume Network. However, he was seen with Mr Pettersen and Mr Faumuina the next day in the carpark of the industrial business complex that was separated by James Ruse Drive from the Perfume Network. The surveillance evidence of the carpark was confined to the men exiting and re-entering the car that was facing west on a number of occasions. As the applicant submitted, none of the men were described as peering or pointing across James Ruse Drive or crossing the road or doing anything else to suggest that their attention was on the Perfume Network. 

47The evidence adduced by the Crown as to what could be seen from the carpark was inconsistent. According to Detective Senior Constable Wolsely the start of the word ""Wholesale"" on the Perfume Warehouse building could be seen, whereas Detective Senior Constable Morgan said that it was not possible to see the Perfume Network premises from the carpark. In any event, it is evident that a detailed study of the Perfume Network premises could not be undertaken from this carpark. There were some 10 other businesses within the Rosehill Business Park complex. 

48The Perfume Network premises was protected by a security system. The purchase of a bolt cutter, garden gloves and axe does not point to a planned break in of a warehouse that had monitored sensors and sirens that would go off when forced entry was made, CCTV cameras, a roller door that closed electronically and a collar sitting inside an adjacent bollard so that the roller door could not be opened unless the bollard was removed. 

49Although the bolt cutter, garden gloves and axe were purchased on 8 March 2011, these items were not seen again despite continuing police surveillance. The Crown's submission that the applicant might have been reaching through the window of the Mazda on 20 March 2011 for these items could amount to no more than speculation even when the circumstantial case is considered in combination. 

50The size, weight and method of storage of the goods in the Perfume Network Warehouse does not support the Crown case that it was the intended targeted premises. The majority of the stock was kept in boxes and stored on pallets. The average weight of a pallet was between 100 and 500 kilograms. The pallets were loaded and unloaded with a forklift, with the highest pallet sitting about 4.4 metres high. 

51Should the purpose of stealing the Isuzu truck have been the loading into it of stolen goods from the Perfume Network Warehouse, the shelving units and the high-end kitchenware stored in the truck would have diminished the truck's ability to store stolen pallets. There is no evidence that the applicant or his co-conspirators had given any thought to the use of a forklift that would have been required to load the pallets onto the truck. Whilst the Isuzu truck was parked in Arthur Street approximately 350 metres from the premises of the Perfume Network, it appears from ex C3 that there were other businesses in the nearby vicinity. 

52The sole direct reference to the Perfume Network is Mr Petterson's telephone call of 7 March 2011. In oral argument in this Court, the Crown accepted RA Hulme J's proposition that to sustain a conviction the Crown would have to exclude the possibility that the enquiry about the opening hours of the Perfume Network might have been relevant to an enterprise to rob some other premises in the vicinity so as to obtain knowledge of when people might be about. 

53As to the third essential element of the offence that the Crown was obliged to prove, the conversation on 5 March 2011 that the Crown relies upon as demonstrating the applicant's intention to be present during the commission of the break and enter is open to reasonable interpretations other than that contended by the Crown. Furthermore, it appears clear from further intercepted telephone calls that there was at least one postponement of the intended crime.

54The phone calls after 5 March 2011 do not plainly suggest that the applicant intended to be present at the time of the planned offence. During the telephone call between the applicant and Mr Faumuina on 11 March 2011, the applicant explained that plans for breakfast over the weekend had been cancelled and that ""it all came down to safety."" The applicant told Mr Faumuina ""I've got nothing but love for you... I'm not going to fuck you up... I'd rather you kick back for another week than get fucked over ...[b]ecause straight up, nigger, I'm not visiting you."" This conversation is open to the reasonable interpretation that the applicant was concerned about Mr Faumuina being arrested and not himself personally. 

55Another telephone call that is open to a similar interpretation is that between the applicant and Mr Faumuina on 14 March 2011. This call includes the applicant saying ""don't stress out: we will be having breakfast for all of us this week."" The applicant, however, goes on to explain why breakfast was called off ""...the thing is, like, it'd be you that catches the disease and I wouldn't fuckin forgive myself"" and ""...I would have been sending you in there blind to the restaurant and, fuck, you don't want to go in blind.""

56Weighing all of the circumstances of the case in combination, although I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to conclude that the agreed offence was to commit a break and enter, I am of the opinion that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant with Mr Pettersen and Mr Faumuina had agreed to break into and enter the premises of the Perfume Network. The Crown did not exclude the reasonable possibility that the intended target of the break and enter was one of the other businesses within the Rosehill Business Park complex. Furthermore, it was not open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was to be physically present at the time of the commission of the offence. In my view, the jury acting reasonably must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant as charged on the indictment for count 1. 

57This is not a case where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence has an impact upon the conclusion that I have reached. 

58I would uphold Ground 1 of the appeal and quash the conviction on 
count 1.

Re-Sentence?

59Section 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is as follows: 

""7 Powers of court in special cases 
(1) If it appears to the court that an appellant on an appeal under section 5 (1), though not properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment, has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment, the court may either affirm the sentence passed at the trial or pass such sentence whether more or less severe in substitution therefor as it thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law by the conviction on the count or part of the indictment on which it considers the appellant has been properly convicted.""

60As the conviction for count 1 has been set aside, this Court may either affirm the sentence imposed for count 2 or pass a sentence for that offence whether more or less severe in substitution for the sentence imposed by the trial judge. 

61The applicant concedes and submits that an 18 month 'head sentence' for the offence of 'take and drive conveyance' (count 2) imposed by the trial judge is appropriate. However, the applicant submits that if the sentence for count 2 is the applicant's only detainer, then a fixed term sentence for that offence becomes inappropriate. The applicant contends that the Court should structure a duration of non-parole period that allows the applicant's release to parole forthwith, while retaining the subsisting expiration date of the sentence at 6 February 2015. 

62The question for this Court, the applicant argues is whether an 18 month fixed term for count 2 to be served fully cumulatively on a 14 month non-parole period for another offence is an ""anomalous"" result once the conviction for the conspiracy is quashed. 

63The applicant referred to the submissions made in the appeal against sentence for count 1 concerning an asserted error made by the trial judge in the application of the totality principle when the proper sentence is being considered for count 2. The applicant contended that this Court ""applying the totality principle, would consider the net impact of its sentence for the 'take and drive conveyance' offence in the context of the [applicant] already having served a non-parole period of 14 months (from 7 June 2012 - 6 August 2013) pursuant to another sentence imposed at Sydney District Court in a separate sentencing exercise for the offence of enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (namely intimidation)"" (ASWS7 17).

64The applicant's final submission was that even if the Court concluded that the trial judge intended the 18 months imprisonment for count 2 to be only the non-parole period for the offence and that an increase in the head sentence is warranted, the Court would impose a sentence that would allow the applicant's immediate release to parole. 

65On the question of re-sentence, the Crown submitted that the removal of the conspiracy offence does nothing to raise the totality principle to greater prominence. The Crown argued that when considering the objective seriousness of the offence and matters personal to the applicant, the length of the sentence (subject to the Crown's further argument on a fixed term or non-parole period) and the degree of accumulation are both appropriate. The Crown referred to various matters which militated in favour of the overall sentence being increased by imposing an additional term during which the applicant would have had the benefit of supervision in the community. 

66The Crown's final submission was that this Court should impose an additional term of sufficient duration to enable supervision of the applicant aimed at addressing his drug problems and antisocial behaviour to enhance his prospects of rehabilitation. 
Consideration 

67I propose to affirm the sentence ""passed at the trial"" for count 2 for the following reasons:

(i) The conclusion that the conviction on count 1 should be quashed does not mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence of stealing the truck. The truck was stolen to assist the applicant and his co-conspirators in the commission of an offence of break, enter and steal of one of the businesses within the Rosehill Business Park. The contents of the truck included Mr El Helweh's high-end kitchenware. As the Crown submitted, the quashing of the conviction on count 1 was brought about as a result of the over-particularisation of the Crown case at trial.

(ii) As the trial judge observed in his remarks on sentence, the applicant was on parole at the time this offence was committed (ROS 10). He had been sentenced in the Sydney District Court on 6 March 2009 for an offence of break and enter with intent to steal to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year 10 months to date from 10 February 2009 and to expire on 9 December 2010 with an additional term of 1 year 2 months. He was to be released subject to supervision. This is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 

(iii) The applicant's previous criminal history which the trial judge detailed in his sentencing remarks is significant (ROS 9-10). His prior convictions include offences of break and enter, being armed with intent to commit a serious indictable offence and take and drive a conveyance. Greater weight is to be placed on personal deterrence and protection of society: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566.

(iv) The Probation and Parole report that was tendered during the proceedings on sentence described the applicant's drug dependency as ""unresolved"" (ROS 13). The applicant has a long history of drug dependency which the Probation and Parole Service reported that he had little success in addressing. 

(v) In considering the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, the trial judge took into account that when the applicant was on bail for counts 1 and 2, he committed an offence of aggravated enter a dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation. His Honour was unable to conclude that the applicant ""has good or reasonable prospects of rehabilitation or that he is not likely to re-offend in the future"" (ROS 22). 

(vi) The trial judge plainly considered the principle of totality when sentencing the applicant. He determined that the sentences for counts 1 and 2 were to be served concurrently but should commence after the expiration of the non-parole period for the aggravated break and enter on 7 August 2013. Whilst his Honour may have applied the totality principle to the non-parole period that had expired three days prior to the time that the applicant was sentenced, he was not obliged to do so. 

(vii) Although the applicant will serve a total term of 2 years 8 months for the offence of aggravated break and enter and count 2, I am of the view that a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment is the minimum period of custody that reflects the objective seriousness of count 2. 

68I do not propose to accede to the Crown's request to extend the term of imprisonment by imposing an additional term.

Orders 

69Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

(i) Appeal upheld and the conviction on count 1 is quashed. 

(ii) Order the entry of a verdict of acquittal on count 1.

(iii) Confirm the sentence imposed by the trial judge for count 2. 

70McCallum J: I agree with Price J that the conviction for count 1 should be quashed, for the reasons his Honour's has stated. On the strength of my analysis of the evidence at the trial, I agree with his Honour that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the applicant's guilt of the offence in count 1 as particularised by the Crown and that it was accordingly not open to the jury to convict the applicant on that count.

71As to the sentence for the remaining count, I agree with R A Hulme J that there is nothing to indicate that the sentencing judge set the fixed term of 18 months at the level of what might otherwise have been a non-parole period. Accordingly, I agree with the first two orders proposed by Price J (which deal with count 1) and the orders proposed by R A Hulme J as to count 2.

72RA Hulme J: I agree with Price J that the conviction for count 1 should be quashed for the reasons his Honour has provided.

73I regret that I am unable to agree that the sentence for count 2 should be confirmed. 

74There is nothing to indicate that Norrish QC DCJ set the fixed term of 18 months at the level of what might otherwise have been a non-parole period. If that offence is all for which the appellant stood to be sentenced it would have had a non-parole period set and it would have been either the usual three-quarters of the total term, or something less to take into account the prior sentence. 

75The further submissions for the appellant suggest that there is little to be achieved by trying to replicate what might have been done in terms of the length of the non-parole period when regard is had to the prior sentence. It is submitted that the Court should take a practical approach and set a non-parole period that achieves an immediate release to parole. I agree. 









76I propose the following orders:

1. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), quash the sentence imposed on count 2.

2. In lieu, sentence the appellant to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period commencing 7 August 2013 and expiring on 17 December 2014. The balance of the term of the sentence will expire on 6 February 2015. 

3. Direct the appellant's release to parole forthwith.

2704057,R v AN [2014] NSWSC 1879,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	The offender, AN, was charged on indictment that on 5 November 2010, at Bossley Park in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Eden Delir.
	
	
	On 10 September 2014, he entered a plea of guilty to a charge of Manslaughter and the Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment.
	
	
	In February 2014, the Crown had indicated to the offender’s legal representatives that it would accept a plea to manslaughter. Thereafter the required procedures were followed leading eventually to the guilty plea being entered.
	
	
	Accordingly, the offender now stands for sentence in respect of the offence of manslaughter, the sentencing hearing having proceeded on 5 December 2014. Attached to these Remarks on Sentence is a Schedule setting out particulars as to the exhibited material tendered on behalf of the Crown and on behalf of the offender.
	
	
	The offender was born on 18 May 1995 in Iraq. He was accordingly 15 years of age at the date of the commission of the offence on 30 October 2010 and is presently 19 years of age.
	
	
	Exhibit A, a Statement of Agreed Facts signed on behalf of the offender, was tendered by the Crown.
	
	
	The facts and circumstances to which I will refer are based upon the facts as agreed in that document.
	


The Basis of Criminal Liability for Manslaughter


	
	I turn to the basis of criminal liability for manslaughter.
	
	
	In Exhibit A, set out the basis for the offender’s criminal liability and what follows is based upon the matters contained in that exhibit.
	
	
	The Crown observed that it is not part of the offender’s liability for the offence of manslaughter that he physically attacked the deceased, Eden Delir, himself. However, he admits that he was present during the assault upon Eden Delir, was aware that it was to take place, and stood together with the offending group, present, willing and able to assist physically if needed, and by those acts encouraged and assisted others in what was a joint criminal enterprise: Exhibit A at [1].
	
	
	The offender’s conduct accordingly establishes that he was complicit in what was an unlawful and dangerous act or acts. During the joint criminal enterprise in question, Eden Delir suffered a series of blows to his body by several of those who participated in the attack. Eden Delir was, by arrangement, the intended victim. It was not a random attack. The assault included the use of weapons. During the enterprise in which the offender participated, the act of another in the course of it had, as its direct physical consequence, the death of Eden Delir.
	
	
	Injury was inflicted upon the deceased when he was struck to the head with a weapon, an empty wine bottle, which caused fatal injury to the blood vessels in his head. The haemorrhage of blood to surrounding areas of his brain, and consequent intracranial swelling, starved his brain of the oxygen necessary for life. Brain dead by arrival at hospital that night, Eden Delir was incapable of surviving without medical intervention in a hospital. On 5 November 2010, the life support system on which he depended was turned off: Exhibit A at [3].
	
	
	In the Statement of Agreed Facts it was recorded that present with the offender were five other associates including the offender referred to as JP. Eden Delir was the victim of an unprovoked assault during which one of the offender’s co-offenders, JP, struck him to the head with the bottle. However, it was noted in Exhibit A that though not responsible for delivering the fatal blow or other physical attacks, the offender shares criminal and moral responsibility in the events and its consequence, namely death, because he participated in the joint criminal enterprise that brought it about: Exhibit A at [4].
	
	
	In the Agreed Statement of Facts it is noted that the criminal endeavour had as its object the use of violence and the combined force of numbers. It did not involve an intention to kill and no member of the joint criminal enterprise has been alleged to have entertained that intent throughout the entirety of legal proceedings: Exhibit A at [5].
	
	
	It was further noted in Exhibit A that the Crown accepted, and it is manifest in the plea of guilty to manslaughter in satisfaction of the indictment charging murder, that the Crown was not in a position to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender entertained a specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm or that he is punishable for his participation in a joint criminal enterprise in which the infliction of grievous bodily harm was intended by another or others: Exhibit A at [6].
	
	
	Accordingly, the offender is to be punished for the offence of manslaughter in which he shares criminal and moral responsibility for the death of Eden Delir: Exhibit A at [7].
	


Factual Circumstances


	
	I turn to the factual circumstances.
	
	
	It is not necessary to provide a full and detailed account of all relevant facts concerning the attack upon Eden Delir that occurred on 30 October 2010 as has been necessary in the sentencing of other co-offenders who have been convicted at trial.
	
	
	It is sufficient to note that the crime of manslaughter was committed by the offender at a Halloween party held in Restwell Road, Bossley Park on the evening of 30 October 2010. However, the assault upon Eden Delir had its genesis in events that had occurred earlier in the same year: Exhibit A at [9]. The offender, it is to be noted, was not involved in those events.
	
	
	The events concerning the incident that occurred in February 2010 explain why it was that Eden Delir became the target of the violence that caused his death and it is relevant to an evaluation of the degrees of relative culpability in the joint criminal enterprise. It is not, as I have stated, alleged either that the offender was party to those earlier events, or that he possessed knowledge to a material degree of them or that his sentence is aggravated by the earlier events.
	
	
	Briefly, it may be recorded that on 20 February 2010 Eden Delir was called out by a co-offender who may be here referred to as JH and when outside his home three males with bandanas covering their faces ran towards him. They surrounded him. The co-offender, JH, then ran away. Eden Delir was assaulted and robbed of his Nokia mobile phone. On this occasion, Eden was kicked a number of times to the head and upper body and was subsequently treated in hospital for injuries sustained.
	
	
	On 30 October 2010, a number of people were invited to the Halloween party, largely through the internet website, Facebook.
	
	
	A number of persons, known as “the Wakeley Boys” attended uninvited. They had expected to encounter and confront another group referred to as “the Campbelltown Boys”. However, as events turned out the Campbelltown boys did not attend the party.
	
	
	At approximately 8:40pm a number of partygoers, including Eden Delir, and the group known as the Wakeley Boys together with the offender, were out the front of the house where the party was being held.
	
	
	Eden Delir became the subject of comments made by one or more of the offending group, with a comment being made “that’s the guy who snitched”: Exhibit A at [26].
	
	
	One of the members of the group called out to Eden Delir and upon Eden and that person walking towards each other, the latter person took his white cap and said “what does your hat say”. This, on the evidence, was a distraction tactic. Eden was then punched by a person who ran around the side of a truck with great ferocity, hitting him in the right side of the head causing him to fall to the ground.
	
	
	He was immediately encircled by members of the group with which the offender was associated. This supports an inference that there was an element of planned co-ordination. Members of the group commenced to kick, punch and stomp on Eden, he having already been placed in a very vulnerable state. It was during the attack that he was struck with the wine bottle which shattered: Exhibit A at [29]. That action caused Eden Delir once again to fall to the ground.
	
	
	Though still under attack, Eden somehow managed to escape from the group and run up Restwell Road. He was chased by one or more of the members of that group.
	
	
	The offender was a member of the group who had surrounded Eden Delir before and at the time he was on the ground: Exhibit A at [32].
	
	
	A post-mortem examination was conducted by Dr Stephen Wills on 9 November 2010. Dr Wills’ post-mortem report indicates that the cause of death was “head injury”. His report detailed a multiplicity of wounds and bruising to Eden’s head and face, to his upper limbs and to other parts of his body.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	I turn to the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The objective circumstances of the attack upon Eden Delir establish that he was ambushed, rendered vulnerable and then set upon by four or more of the group of six that had encircled him.
	
	
	The attack was entirely unprovoked. There had been no dispute or disagreement or confrontation prior to the attack being launched upon him.
	
	
	The attack upon Eden Delir can only be described and regarded as a ferocious and cowardly one. The force of numbers against one vulnerable young victim, the use of weapons in the nature of a steel pole by at least one of the attackers, and in due course the use of a bottle as a weapon, marks out the offence as a very objectively serious offence of manslaughter.
	
	
	It is clear on the evidence that the motivation of those who decided upon and participated in the attack on Eden Delir was associated with the fact that following the assault upon him on 20 February 2010, Eden Delir was interviewed by police and gave a statement to them. This was seen by members of the group of attackers as being totally unacceptable and regarded by their members as “snitching”, and it is clear that the sole motive of those who decided upon the attack was related to the fact that Eden had provided information when interviewed by police. The attack was a form of retaliation or revenge.
	


The Offender’s Role


	
	I turn to the offender’s role.
	
	
	A further matter of importance in determining sentence is the role of the offender in the group attack upon Eden Delir.
	
	
	There are a number of matters to be stated in this respect:
	


(1)   The Crown made clear that it is not in a position to prove that the offender physically attacked Eden Delir with a weapon or otherwise.

(2)   There is no evidence or allegation that the offender was involved in the attack upon the deceased that occurred on 20 February 2010.

(3)   There is no evidence that, as at 30 October 2010, the offender had any knowledge, at the time of attending the party, of the events that had occurred on 20 February 2010.

(4)   There is no evidence and no allegation that the offender was one of the principal decision-makers who initiated the attack upon Eden Delir.


	
	The Crown’s submission was that the offender, assessed on a relative basis of culpability as amongst the offenders, is at the lower end of the hierarchy: T 4:15-20, 5 December 2014.
	
	
	The Crown’s further submission in this respect was in the following terms:
	


“… it is a matter for the Court, of course, to evaluate relative moral culpability and there is a wide range of it amongst these co-offenders, but in terms of parity, he is going to be at the bottom of the hierarchy, the reason being the basis upon which he has pleaded guilty …” (T 4:20-25)


	
	The Crown properly observed, however, that the offence was nonetheless a serious one.
	
	
	The seriousness of the offending arose, amongst other matters, in the Crown’s submission, from the degree of force utilised, that a number of assaults upon Eden Delir took place which persisted for some time, the number of individuals involved, assaults that included both punching and kicking and the use of weapons. As the Crown observed, and I accept, there was co-ordination amongst a number of the co-accused as to the roles the attackers adopted or pursued during the attack which only ended when Eden Delir managed to escape and not by reason of the members of the attacking group ceasing the assaults of their own accord.
	
	
	Plainly, as the Crown observed, there was a foreseeable risk to life and limb.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, and I accept, that the assault upon Eden Delir was triggered by the disapproval held against someone who is labelled a “snitch”: T 6:10-15.
	
	
	Mr Spencer of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the offender, confirmed that his client accepted that he was present at the time of the assault and was ready, willing and able to assist if needed: T 9:25-30.
	
	
	Accordingly, it was accepted that he became a party to a joint criminal enterprise but that he was not complicit in the “… actual blow or assault, himself, upon the deceased …”: T 9:30-35.
	
	
	Accordingly, Mr Spencer submitted that the offender was in a markedly different position in terms of complicity and culpability than his co-offenders.
	
	
	Further, it was submitted that the Crown could not and did not attempt to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender entertained a specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm or that his participation in the joint criminal enterprise in which the infliction of grievous bodily harm was intended by others. This was an important matter, he submitted, as to the issue of his intention as distinct from the intention of others: T 9:35-41.
	
	
	On the offender’s state of mind, Mr Spencer further submitted:
	


“… he was not possessed of knowledge to a material degree as to the intent of others and therefore his sentence is not [aggravated] by the earlier events. In other words someone thought the deceased was a snitch and was going to do something to him. It is not asserted that he knew of that. You have a background of why the deceased was singled out and the Crown alluded to that.

As I’ve said before, it is not alleged that this offender was possessed of that knowledge to any material extent … it can’t be said to be an aggregated part of the events.” (T 10:5-10)


	
	Mr Spencer submitted that the offender was at the lower end of the range. He noted that the range of sentences on a charge of manslaughter varies greatly and each case had to be determined in accordance with its own facts.
	
	
	As noted earlier, the Crown similarly accepted that the offender’s culpability should be assessed at the lower end of the hierarchy, and I accept that submission.
	


Subjective Factors


	
	I turn to the subjective factors.
	
	
	As I have noted earlier, the offender was 15 years of age at the date of the offence and, prior to the subject offence, did not have any criminal antecedents.
	
	
	Exhibit B establishes that on 7 December 2010 he committed an offence of break and enter a house and on 20 December 2010 an offence of take and drive conveyance without consent of the owner (two counts). He was placed on a s 33(1) bond in respect of the first of those offences for a 12-month period and in respect of the second offences for a period of 9 months.
	
	
	The Juvenile Justice Confidential Background Report dated 28 November 2014 written by Ms Wong, Juvenile Justice Counsellor and Sarah Abusharif, Assistant Manager, Clinical, contains relevant information concerning the offender, his family and his living circumstances. The report is based upon multiple interviews with the offender.
	
	
	He was, as I have stated, born in Iraq and his family moved to Greece when he was two years of age to escape the war in that country. He and his family resided in Greece for five years before being granted refugee status to relocate to Australia when the offender was seven years of age.
	
	
	There was no evidence indicating that the offender experienced any significant difficulties or hardships assimilating to life in Australia.
	
	
	The offender’s father died from a heart attack in the year of the subject offence. Following that, the authors of the report observed that, on the offender’s account, he did not wish to witness his mother’s grieving. He reported his lack of understanding regarding how to deal with his grief which led to him truanting from school and gravitating towards anti-social friends and behaviours. He said he spent an increasing amount of time outside the home.
	
	
	The offender stated that since being granted bail he “got his act together”. His former high school confirmed that his attitude towards schooling improved in Years 11 and 12. Following his completion of school he enrolled in the Diploma of Engineering (Standard) at UTS: Insearch (University of Technology, Sydney).
	
	
	Exhibit 2 establishes that he commenced his course on 11 February 2014 but withdrew after one semester. The study period in the first semester was from 11 February 2014 to 23 May 2014.
	
	
	The authors of the Background Report observed that the offender’s re-engagement in and willingness to complete his university degree may be a protective factor in assisting him in preventing further offending behaviours.
	
	
	There was no history of drug abuse, although the offender reported that he drank two to three beers on the night of the offence and that this made him feel intoxicated and affected his appreciation of the severity of the attack.
	
	
	The denials or non-acceptance of his responsibility, as recorded in the Background Report are, of course, inconsistent with his plea to the charge of manslaughter on the basis of unlawful and dangerous act. However, it was made clear by Mr Spencer that no reliance was placed upon his inconsistent statements as recorded in the Background Report: T 2:20-35.
	
	
	The account in the Background Report, however, refers to the fact that the offender said that he was of the understanding that a “fight” was going to occur, but denied that the victim was the intended target or that weapons would be used.
	
	
	The offender identified that following his father’s death he behaved impulsively and did not think about the consequences of his behaviour.
	
	
	The authors of the report observed:
	


“Further intervention may be beneficial to explore any underlying factors surrounding [AN’s] denial, the reasons for providing inconsistent accounts of his involvement, and avoidance in discussing his attitudes and beliefs regarding the offence …” (at p 6)


	
	The report of Dr Mohammad Abu-Arab, clinical Psychologist dated 20 October 2014, was tendered (Exhibit 1).
	
	
	The offender was referred to Dr Abu-Arab by his general practitioner for counselling, trauma and depression management.
	
	
	The report records the loss of the offender’s father was an unfortunate blow to him at his age, namely, 15 years of age, and that he had reported that losing his father had affected his life to an extreme extent. In this respect it was noted:
	


“At the age of 14 years he lost his father, and he was left with three younger siblings, and his mother was depressed.” (at p 3)


	
	Dr Abu-Arab observed that the loss of a parent at the age the offender was when his father died (14 years and 11 months) is known as a stressful event in a person who is said to be able to manage and cope with the loss of a family member: Report at pp 3-4.
	


Discussion


	
	It is relevant to discuss, at this point, the purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	The purposes of sentencing are specified in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. They are stated to include:
	


(a)   To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence.

(b)   To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences.

(c)   To protect the community from the offender.

(d)   To promote the rehabilitation of the offender.

(e)   To make the offender accountable for his or her actions.

(f)   To denounce the conduct of the offender.

(g)   To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.


	
	Section 21A of that Act specifies that, in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the Court is to take into account the aggravating and the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(2) and (3) and any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	In the present case, the aggravating factors associated with the offence involve the offence involved the actual use of weapons by co-offenders, parties to the joint criminal enterprise with the offender, and the offence and the events involved a planned or organised criminal activity, it being observed, as I have earlier noted, that the offender did not use any weapon himself and was not a principal in the planning of the attack.
	
	
	The mitigating factors under s 21A(3) include the following: the offender not having any record of previous convictions, that he was of good character, where the offender in question has good prospects of rehabilitation (whether by reason of the his age or otherwise), as well as a guilty plea being entered and any remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if, amongst other things, the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions.
	
	
	This is a case, as I have stated, which involves a type of offending that is most serious. The fact that it was a group attack upon Eden Delir, who was completely outnumbered and was attacked by surprise and without warning in an attack involving the use of weapons, are all matters, as I have stated, that characterise the offence as an objectively very serious one.
	
	
	It is in that context that the individual culpability of the offender is to be assessed.
	
	
	Two co-offenders have thus far been sentenced on the basis of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter, such co-offenders having been high in the hierarchy of culpability.
	
	
	On the basis identified in the Crown’s submissions and the submissions on behalf of the offender, I accept that there is no evidence in the present case which establishes that the offender was one of those who physically attacked Eden Delir. On the basis stated by the Crown, I accept that the offender’s culpability must be assessed at the lower end of the range or hierarchy of culpability for the objectively serious offence in this case.
	
	
	There is to be taken into account the offender’s plea of guilty which, on accepted principles, entitles him to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed. Important in determining the extent of the discount is the time at which the plea is entered or which could reasonably have been entered. I have adverted earlier to the fact that it was in February 2014 that the Crown indicated that it would accept a plea of manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. That said, the guilty plea was entered at a late stage.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider an appropriate discount for the offender’s plea is a discount of 15%.
	
	
	Whilst the Background Report records that the offender was able to acknowledge the amount of grief that the victim’s parents might feel over the loss of their son, there is no evidence that establishes any genuine remorse or contrition upon the basis that he has accepted responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	Apart from his culpability being assessed towards the lower end of the relevant hierarchy of culpability, for reasons I have earlier discussed, there is also to be taken into account as subjective factors the fact that he was only 15 years of age at the time of the offence, that he had suffered the trauma of losing his father with associated grieving by his mother which further impacted upon him, which all contributed to his truancy at school and his association with anti-social persons.
	
	
	These individually, and in combination, represent strong subjective factors which are to be taken into account on sentencing. They are factors that operate in mitigation and affect the determination of the appropriate sentence for the offence.
	


Victims Impact Statements


	
	There were tendered at the sentencing hearing Victim Impact Statements.
	
	
	The parents of Eden Delir, Ardavaz and Dorothy Delir, and their daughter Annabelle, provided Victim Impact Statements which were marked respectively Exhibits D and E in the proceedings.
	
	
	The Statements are expressed in dignified but poignant terms, reflecting the immense loss that each have suffered with the death of their son and brother, on all accounts, a very fine young person. The Statements evidence the fact that the loss of Eden has had and will continue to impact upon their lives.
	
	
	On behalf of the Court I again express my condolences to the members of Eden’s family for the immense pain and suffering that they have and they will continue to endure.
	
	
	I have noted the provisions of Division 2 of Part 3 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in particular s 28 thereof. I have of course given close consideration to the victim impact statements in this case as significant material that is before the Court. In circumstances where no submissions have been made in relation to s 28, I have determined that the sentence should not be increased by virtue of the statements to which the Division applies, but is to be determined, as otherwise appropriate, on the evidence and the findings I have made.
	


Rehabilitation Prospects


	
	I turn to the question of the offender’s rehabilitation prospects.
	
	
	In determining the offender’s rehabilitation prospects I have taken into account the Background Report of Juvenile Justice, together with the psychological report of Dr Abu-Arab.
	
	
	The offender appears to have a supportive family and he has made efforts to advance his education, although he has discontinued his diploma course. However, his progress in completing his high school education and moving to a tertiary education, although only for a limited time, gives reason to believe that the offender does have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. I have not overlooked, in forming that conclusion, the offences that were committed in late 2010 for which he was placed on two bonds. However, on balance I consider that, at his age, the relevant subjective factors and having regard to the fact that he had no prior convictions before the subject offence, that his rehabilitation prospects are, as I have earlier stated, good and that is a factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.
	


Sentence


	
	On the question of sentence, in order to give effect to the findings made as to the relative objective criminality of the offender’s behaviour taking into account both the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective factors that I am required to take into account, along with the Crown’s acceptance that the offender’s role marks out his criminality at the low end of the hierarchy, I have determined that the starting point for the sentence is a period of 7 years, which, after applying a discount of 15% for the offender’s plea, results in a term of 5 years 11 months (rounded out).
	
	
	I have also determined that a finding of special circumstances should be made given the offender’s age and the fact that, prior to the offence, he had no criminal record.
	
	
	On the basis of the finding of special circumstances I vary the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the total term.
	
	
	AN, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 17 December 2014 and to expire on 16 December 2017, and a parole period of 2 years 11 months to commence on 17 December 2017 and to expire on 16 November 2020.
	
	
	Accordingly, the total sentence imposed is a period of 5 years and 11 months comprised of a non-parole period of 3 years with a parole period of 2 years and 11 months.
	
	
	Accordingly the first date upon which you will be eligible for parole will be on 16 December 2017.
	
	
	I direct that a report be prepared by Juvenile Justice in relation to the offender for the purpose of ascertaining whether there are circumstances falling within the provisions of s 19(4)(b) and/or (c) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.
	
	
	The sentence that I have imposed is subject to a determination to be made as to whether an order may be made under the provisions of s 19(4) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 following any report from Juvenile Justice. For the purposes of s 19, the period of incarceration in a juvenile detention institution can only operate until the age of 21 years unless the provisions of s 19(4) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 apply. Accordingly, in that respect, and for that purpose, the proceedings are stood over part-heard to 9:30am on Friday, 13 March 2015.

		14 January 2015",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704061,McGeown v R [2014] NSWCCA 314,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA: I have had the advantage of reading Adams J's judgment in draft.  I respectfully disagree with the orders which his Honour proposes granting leave to appeal, allowing the appeal and imposing a lesser sentence; I would dismiss the appeal.  His Honour's description of the factual background, the objective and subjective features of the matter, and of other decisions, enables me to explain my reasoning concisely.
2The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence (namely, larceny), contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The circumstance of aggravation was that she was in company.  There were three other offences taken into account on a Form 1, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), including the serious offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty.  The maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 5 years.
3The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 months.  The only ground for which leave is sought to appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
4Adams J's reasons reproduce the agreed facts of the ""ram-raid"" of a pharmacy in Sans Souci and the theft of medication and a small amount of cash in the early hours of 4 December 2012.  In light of the submissions about the relevance of the ""brazen"" nature of the conduct, I would supplement those facts with the following, drawn from the statement of agreed facts tendered at the sentencing hearing.  After being used to crash through the front glass window of the pharmacy, the stolen Nissan Navara was used to effect an escape from police.  The Navara reversed at speed into a fully marked police vehicle, causing extensive front end damage to the latter.  The senior constable who was the passenger in the police vehicle chased the Navara on foot, smashed the rear nearside window and held the nearside pillar.  However, the driver did not stop, but accelerated.  The senior constable let go for safety.  The Navara was pursued by a second fully marked police vehicle.  Shortly thereafter, the Navara stopped suddenly and, again, reversed at speed into the second police vehicle ""in a clear attempt to immobilise the pursuing police vehicle"".  That attempt was unsuccessful, but when the pursuit resumed, the Navara once again stopped suddenly and reversed at speed colliding with the police vehicle, such that it could no longer continue.
5As Adams J's reasons disclose, the applicant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, was found to show remorse and contrition, and comes from a seriously disadvantaged background, reflected in her addiction and her extensive criminal history.  It may be accepted that she was affected by drugs throughout the entirety of the offending for which she was sentenced.  Moreover, the applicant provided valuable assistance to police, which, together with her early plea, gave rise to an unchallenged entitlement to a 50% discount on sentence.
6On the other hand, the offences took place while the applicant was on bail, and while she was subject to six good behaviour bonds imposed pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  The sentencing judge found that there was some degree of planning, although such planning was minimal.
7The sentencing judge found that the offence was above the mid-range of seriousness for offences of this type.  The applicant said it was not clear whether that was a reference to ""ram-raid"" offences, break enter and steal more generally, or offences under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act.  On a fair reading of his reasons, I consider that his Honour was referring to break enter and steal, not to the much wider range of conduct that falls within s 112(2) once the range of serious indictable offences which constitute an element of that offence is borne in mind.  That accords with the approach adopted in other offences of this type, and indeed with the approach adopted by the applicant's own submissions.
8The applicant did not steal the Navara, nor was she driving it at any time, however she was in the vehicle when it reversed into the front glass display window of the pharmacy, and left it in order to steal the prescription drugs and small amount of cash.  As was said in R v Reilly; R v Smith [2012] NSWCCA 166 at [37]:
""[A] 'ram-raid' is a serious instance of an offence of break, enter and steal because of the inevitable destruction that is unleashed by the use of a motor vehicle to smash into commercial premises and the difficulty that store owners have protecting their property from such an offence.  Both specific and general deterrence would normally play an important part in the sentencing task for a ram-raid offence.""
9As Adams J observes, objective seriousness is a matter of evaluative judgment about which reasonable minds can reasonably differ.  Undoubtedly the offence was brazen, and on a fair reading of the remarks on sentence, the primary judge considered that to be relevant to his assessment of objective seriousness.  I see no error in his Honour's taking of that course.  Spigelman CJ said in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]:
""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.""
10Simpson J said at [46] that:
""[t]he importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.""
11Those passages have been repeatedly endorsed:  see for recent examples R v Lolesio [2014] NSWCCA 219 at [63]-[64] and Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [46]-[47]. 
12It was appropriate, given the wide range of offending conduct that answers the description of s 112(2), for the primary judge to focus on a class of conduct - ""ram-raids"" - and to identify his assessment of the relative objective seriousness within that class.  When regard is had to the nature of the offence, coupled with applicant's prior record for similar offences, the fact that she was on bail and subject to bond, and that there was a large amount of damage to the structure of the premises and its stock, I conclude that no error is established in the assessment of objective seriousness.  But in any event, I doubt that anything turns on the point.  The only ground of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly excessive, and in order to advance that ground, the applicant, appropriately, pointed to a series of decisions of this Court in other ""ram-raiding"" offences.
13I respectfully disagree with the approach adopted by the applicant in focussing on the starting point of 8 years imprisonment.  I agree with what this Court held in TYN v R [2009] NSWCCA 146 at [33]-[34], to the effect that where (as here) there is no dispute as to the reductions in sentence to which an offender is entitled, it is necessary to have regard to the starting point, lest the discounts be used to conceal and thereby sustain what might otherwise be a manifestly excessive sentence.
14However, the ultimate question must be whether the sentence passed on the applicant's conviction is manifestly excessive.  The sentence actually imposed was a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 months.  The non-parole period is short.  It is less than 42% of the head sentence.
15The applicant must show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at [25].  The fact that a sentence is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases is not sufficient: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [59].  In a case such as the present, ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"":  Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58].  
16I do not consider that the applicant has demonstrated that the sentence is manifestly excessive, in the presently relevant sense of authorising this Court to set it aside and resentence.  
17Counsel for the applicant took the Court to four other ""ram-raiding"" decisions, with the view of demonstrating manifest excess.  Adams J has referred to those decisions, including R v Reilly, R v Smith [2012] NSWCCA 166, which was said by the applicant to be a ""very comparable"" case, and where the starting points were (assuming a 25% discount for a plea) 6 years and 8 months and 6 years for Smith and Reilly respectively.  As it was put in oral submissions:
""Starting, say, with the higher head sentence there of six years and eight months and then applying exactly the same proportions downwards one would end up with a three year four month head sentence, and then applying special circumstances to the non-parole period one would end up with a non-parole period of one year and five months, or 17 months, so that would be a three month reduction in the non-parole period.""
18I cannot agree that such reasoning demonstrates manifest excess.  Three months is a not inconsiderable time, but even if (as was invited by counsel's submission) attention is confined to the non-parole period of the sentences, there is self-evident difficulty in demonstrating that a 20 month non-parole period is manifestly excessive when a 17 month non-parole period in a case said to be comparable is not.
19Forbes v R [2009] NSWCCA 292 involved a ""ram-raid"" in an arcade in Bowral. There was more extensive planning.  The property damage to the arcade was more than $16,000, which is comparable to the structural damage in this appeal (assessed at $15,358 excluding clean-up costs and temporary security).  In addition, an ATM machine was taken.  Some $54,500 was removed from the machine, which sum was not recovered (that is considerably more culpable than the small amount of cash and drugs stolen in the present case, even allowing for the destruction of the pharmacy's stock valued at $30,508.55).  The vehicle (valued at $3,500) and the machine (valued at $10,000) were then set on fire.  There were five offences on a Form 1 to three of which regard was had in imposing a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months.  The sentence reflected a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of his plea, so that the starting point in Forbes, as in the present case, was 8 years.  This Court considered the sentence to be within the legitimate bounds of the sentencing judge's discretion.
20Aspects of Forbes may be contrasted with the present case.  Forbes was not himself present when the ram-raid occurred; it was a case of joint criminal enterprise.  Nor was Forbes on conditional liberty at the time the offences were committed.  Moreover, Forbes was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation.  Finally, the Form 1 offences taken into account in Forbes were deemed larceny of a vehicle, stealing a vehicle and malicious damage by fire to a vehicle, whereas the assault to police committed by the applicant was not only serious (it involved placing a senior constable in a headlock before assistance was received from other officers) but also severable from the ram-raid itself.  Different judges would give different weights to the various similarities and differences between Forbes and the present case.  To my mind, when all those matters are borne in mind, the sentence which this Court said was within the legitimate bounds of the sentencing judge's discretion in Forbes illustrates how difficult it is for the applicant to demonstrate manifest excess.
21Ultimately, the question is whether a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 20 months, for the offence of break, enter and steal, executed by means of a ""ram-raid"" in a stolen vehicle, committed while the offender was on bail and subject to bond, involving a small measure of planning and a substantial degree of property damage, and taking into account the Form 1 matters, but bearing in mind the offender's entitlement to a 50% discount and unfortunate subjective circumstances, was manifestly excessive so as to require this Court's intervention.  I am not persuaded that it is.  
22I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.
23ADAMS J:
Introduction
24On 4 December 2012 the applicant was in the company of Russell Sabelgunst and Paul Master when Sabelgunst drove a stolen Nissan Navara through the front glass display window of a pharmacy, which was then entered by the applicant who stole some boxes of Xanax, Alprax and Serapax and about $500 in cash before re-entering the vehicle and leaving the vicinity of the shop.  The applicant was arrested shortly afterwards and ultimately pleaded guilty to the offence of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing under s 112 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the circumstance of aggravation being that, at the time of the offence, she was in company with another person, namely Sabelgunst.  The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence is 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  Three further offences were taken into account on a Form 1: being carried in the stolen vehicle (maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment); possession of alprazolam (maximum penalty 6 months imprisonment and/or $2,200 fine) and assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty (maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment). 
25The applicant was sentenced to a term of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months, commencing on 13 March 2013, when a sentence which she was serving at the time for other offences expired.  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from this sentence on the ground that it is manifestly excessive.  
Facts
26These were not in dispute and were summarised in the learned sentencing judge's remarks on sentence, from which the following is taken.  The motor vehicle used in the ram-raid was stolen by unknown persons and driven to the applicant's residence where she was waiting with Sabelgunst.  He drove the vehicle with Master sitting in the backseat and the applicant in the passenger seat to the pharmacy where, at about 3.20 am, it was reversed into the front window, causing extensive structural and internal damage.  Whilst the co-offenders remained in the vehicle, the applicant entered the pharmacy and stole 15 boxes of benzodiazepine medication containing variously 25 and 50 tablets each, together with the cash register tray which contained about $500 in cash.  As a result of information received, police attended the applicant's residence and saw the Nissan which had been used in the offence coming out of a block of units.  The police vehicle stopped behind the Nissan which then suddenly reversed at speed into the front of the police car causing extensive front-end damage.  Police chased the vehicle on foot and a constable managed to smash the rear inside window and take hold of a pillar, but the Nissan accelerated and the officer let go.  The police car followed the Nissan which again reversed back into it and proceeded forward once more.  It then collided with a second police car, with a further collision disabling the first police car.  The offenders managed to escape and parked the vehicle ultimately in premises at Hurstville where the cash register was opened and all but about $60 of the money removed.  The applicant and Sabelgunst commenced to take some of the drugs which had been stolen.  They then made their way back to the applicant's premises.  At about 8.40 am she answered the door to police, informing them that Sabelgunst was not there but he was found hiding in the main bedroom when police entered with her consent and both were arrested.  
27Following her arrest the applicant informed police that she wished to fully cooperate and assisted by retracing her movements and retrieving various relevant items.  She participated in a recorded interview where she gave additional information and made full admissions.  However, when she admitted to having taken half a Xanax tablet whilst in custody before being interviewed, she was subjected to a full strip search and became aggressive, during the struggle with police placing an officer in a headlock until further police arrived.  A bottle of Xanax fell from her purse at this stage.  She was subsequently charged with assault police and possessing a prescribed restricted drug, these offences being those on the Form 1 to which I have referred.  The other offence on the Form 1 was allowing herself to be carried in the Nissan knowing that it was stolen.  
28The applicant has been in custody since her arrest on 4 December 2012, and entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity.  She signed an undertaking to give evidence against Sabelgunst whose trial was listed to commence on 28 January 2014.  Her overall sentence, taking into account her early plea of guilty and a further discount for her assistance, was reduced by 50%.
29The damage to the pharmacy amounted to almost $49,000 of which something over $30,000 was attributed to ""damaged stock"".
30The sentencing judge accepted that, although there was some degree of planning involved in the offence, it was minimal.  He considered the offence was serious and concluded - 
""It is above the midrange of seriousness for offences of this type and significant weight should be given to the elements of punishment and retribution together with both specific and general deterrence ... [The] offence was brazen, causing extensive damage to property and is an offence, becoming unfortunately all too commonplace within the community.""
Criminal record
31The applicant, who was 36 years of age at the time of the offence, has a long criminal record commencing with the illegal use of conveyance in August 1993 when she was 16 years of age.  Since then she has committed multiple offences, including those involving theft, in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998.  There was then a gap of almost seven years but she was then convicted in December 2005 of doing an act with intent to influence a witness and was given a suspended sentence of 9 months and placed on a bond for 2 years for contravening an apprehended violence order.  Further offences involving resisting or hindering police followed in 2007, and receiving in 2009 when she was also convicted again of resisting or hindering a police officer in the execution of duty, possession of a prohibited drug and possession of a prohibited weapon and affray, all of which were dealt with by non-custodial outcomes.  In 2012 she was convicted of breaking, entering and stealing for which she was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment commencing on 27 October 2011 with a non-parole period of 4 months concluding on 26 February 2012, and placed on a s 9 bond for 6 months following her conviction on 29 March 2012 in respect of forged prescriptions and goods in custody.  On 20 July 2012 her parole order was revoked, leaving her with a balance of parole of about 5 weeks to serve, expiring on 29 August 2012.  Further offences relating to forged prescriptions resulted in a sentence of 2 months commencing 16 November 2012 and concluding on 15 January 2013.  On 15 March 2013 the applicant was convicted of two charges of receiving for which she was sentenced, overall to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 16 January 2013 and ending on 14 July 2013.  The sentencing judge, noting this lengthy criminal history, described it (with respect rightly) as consistent with a history of ongoing drug use.  His Honour noted that, at the time of committing the offences for which she was to be sentenced, the applicant was subject to six good behaviour bonds imposed on 16 February 2012 and also subject to bail for a number of offences, not, of course, as serious as the current offences but nevertheless involving drug related dishonesty.  
Subjective features
32The applicant gave evidence in which she described herself as having been addicted to drugs more than half her life.  The applicant's drug use commenced at the age of 12 and by the age of 18 she was regularly injecting heroin.  She had attempted suicide on five occasions by overdosing and has had numerous accidental overdoses.  She said being in a residential drug rehabilitation program in 2010/2011 was one of the happiest times of her life.  However she relapsed when her mother died at this time.  The applicant was at the time of sentencing on the methadone program and had managed to reduce her dose from 8 to 1.5 ml which is certainly a marked improvement.  She has two daughters who reside with their paternal grandparents and visit her.  A psychological report prepared by Mr John Tzanis noted that the applicant described an unstable upbringing with both parents being alcoholics who later separated.  Her mother entered into another relationship in which she was the victim of domestic violence and she saw her mother stab her partner in self-defence.  The applicant's two children, aged 10 and 15 years, were removed from her care because of the insufficient level of care she provided and, later, her alcohol and drug abuse.  At the time of sentence she was prescribed Avanza for depression and Epilim to stabilise mood swings.  The applicant said (and it may be readily accepted) she committed the current offences under the influence of drugs.  Mr Tzanis concluded that the applicant had a history of mental health issues consequential upon the trauma and domestic violence she has experienced, with poorly developed distress tolerance and emotional regulation skills together with a long term history of polydrug abuse and a lack of prosocial supports.  
33The sentencing judge concluded that there was little doubt the applicant had suffered significant social deprivation which had not dissipated over time and should be taken into account when considering the overall sentence and non-parole period.  His Honour accepted, in light of her evidence in the proceedings and, given her record of entering an early plea of guilty (and assistance to the authorities), the applicant was remorseful and contrite.  As I read his remarks, he accepted that she found herself in a different position than previously and, given further support, she would be better able to remain drug free when released.
34It is evident that the sentencing judge found special circumstances justifying a variation in the ratio prescribed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  It is not disputed that his Honour's allowance in this regard was appropriate.  
Discussion
35Mr Neild for the applicant submitted at the outset that the sentencing judge's characterisation of the offence as ""above the midrange of seriousness for offences of this type"" was mistaken but that, at all events, the starting point of 8 years was significantly out of kilter with other sentences in ram-raid cases.  The first of these cases to which he referred the Court is Leslie v R [2009] NSWCCA 203.  The offender had been charged with a series of 10 very serious offences with various co-offenders, several involving the use of weapons.  One of the offences involved the offender and another man stealing two motor vehicles, one of which was driven through the doors of a cafeteria, ramming the ATM, which was lifted into the rear of the other vehicle and driven from the scene.  The ATM was cut open and $78,000 was obtained.  Over $75,000 in damage had been caused.  The offender was 24 years of age at the time of the offences and 27 when he was sentenced.  He had been using cannabis since his early teens and, at the time of his arrest, he was also using ecstasy and ice.  He claimed to be in an affected state when he committed the offence.  He had come from a supportive family.  There was no apparent remorse for the offence although the probation report said that it appeared the applicant had considerable insight into the seriousness of his addictions and their consequences and appeared motivated towards his rehabilitation whilst in prison.  He required intensive long term drug and alcohol rehabilitation while he was serving his sentence and when he re-entered the community.  The sentencing judge assessed the offence midway between the midrange and the high-range of objective seriousness, given the substantial sum stolen, the high degree of planning, including the stealing of the two motor vehicles used in the offence and the substantial amount of property damaged.  The offender appealed against his sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 5 years as manifestly excessive, in particular submitting that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.  His appeal was dismissed, though it is relevant to note that this case was decided before Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 and, on one reading, with respect, the Court of Criminal Appeal may have given inappropriate emphasis to the standard non-parole period.  
36Johnson v R [2009] NSWCCA 204 involved an appeal by a co-offender of Leslie in respect of his sentence for the same ram-raid at which the ATM was stolen.  Johnson was sentenced at the same time for armed robbery and two other aggravated breaking, entering and stealing offences.  In respect of the ram-raid offence, he was sentenced to a term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years, taking into account one charge of aggravated break, enter and steal, two charges of maliciously damaging property by means of fire, two charges of stealing motor vehicles and one charge of possessing the proceeds of crime.  Johnson was 19 years of age at the time of the offences and 22 years of age at the time of sentence.  He had a troubled upbringing, commencing to consume alcohol and use cannabis from the age of 12, occasionally also using other drugs, including ice, at the time of the offences.  The sentencing judge accepted he was genuinely remorseful with a low to moderate risk of recidivism if he resolved his substance abuse problem.  Essentially, Johnson appealed on the same grounds as Leslie.  Again, this appeal was dismissed.  Neither of the judgments reveal that either offender had prior criminal convictions.  
37The next judgment pointed to by Mr Neild is McDonald v R [2011] NSWCCA 2.  The offender had pleaded guilty to committing a ram-raid on an ATM, in respect of which a 25% deduction for his early plea was allowed and an effective sentence was imposed of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months.  It appears that the offence had involved a degree of planning, three vehicles were stolen, it was a joint criminal enterprise involving two other persons and extensive damage resulted.  The offences were connected and concurrent terms imposed for the four offences involved.  The judgment does not indicate the sentences passed in respect of each of the offences, perhaps because his essential complaint was that the sentencing judge failed to give any weight to evidence, he said, establishing that his prospects of rehabilitation were good, a complaint which was rejected.  Hulme J pointed out that the learned sentencing judge seemed not to have taken into account the loss suffered by the owner of the vehicle used as a ram.  
38Mr Neild points by way of comparison to the circumstances here, in which there is no evidence that the applicant was involved in any planning or theft of vehicles and the damage involved was not, in his submission, so substantial as to justify the sentencing judge's characterisation of the seriousness of the offence.
39In Forbes v R [2009] NSWCCA 292, an ATM machine containing about $54,500 was stolen and more than $16,000 damage caused to the arcade where it had occurred.  Forbes was charged with five offences comprising  an aggravated break and enter, with the larceny and stealing of motor vehicles that had been involved in the commission of the crime being included on a Form 1.  Forbes was also charged with one count of facilitating boat re-birthing contrary to s 154G Crimes Act.  He was given a discount of 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty.  He was sentenced on the breaking and entering offence to imprisonment for 6 years 8 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months and a balance of term of the same length.  Hidden J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum JJ agreed) considered at [61] that this was a ""serious offence of its kind.""  Forbes's appeal against sentence was dismissed. 
40Hidden J reviewed a number of cases involving ram-raids at commercial premises -
[54]  ... [The] ram-raid was an offence committed at commercial premises after hours, rather than a home invasion. ... [Counsel] referred us to five decisions of this Court in sentence appeals involving ram-raid offences, all of them committed at commercial premises: R v DBN [2005] NSWCCA 435, Douglas v R [2006] NSWCCA 94, R v Lenthall [2004] NSWCCA 248, R v Guthrie [2002] NSWCCA 77 and R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466. 
[55]  With the exception of DBN, all those cases involved pleas of guilty.  DBN was similar to the present case, in that a stolen vehicle was used and significant damage was caused to the premises and an ATM machine.  However, the principal offence charged was aggravated break and enter with intent to steal under s 113(2) of the Crimes Act, carrying the lesser maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.  Also charged on the indictment were two counts of malicious damage and deemed larceny of a motor vehicle. On the major charge the sentence was imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, and for the other charges shorter concurrent terms were imposed.
[56] However, the offender was also charged with unrelated serious offences on a separate indictment, to which he pleaded guilty.  Terms of imprisonment imposed for those offences were partly accumulated upon the sentence for the ram-raid, so as to produce an aggregate term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.  An appeal against all these sentences was dismissed.
[57] In Douglas, the charge was under s 112(2), with the deemed larceny of a motor vehicle taken into account on a Form 1. That applicant was a 20 year old offender who, although he had a criminal history and was on a bond at the time, impressed the sentencing judge as being genuinely remorseful and showed reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. His appeal against a sentence of 3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months was dismissed. In Lenthall the applicant was charged under s 113(2), with some relatively minor offences of dishonesty taken into account on a Form 1. His appeal was allowed, and his sentence was reduced to 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years. He was seen as an offender genuinely ""at the cross-roads"", and there was an issue of the relativity of his sentence to a much more lenient sentence passed upon a co-offender.
[58] Guthrie and Ceissman were both Crown appeals. In each case this Court allowed the appeal and substituted a sentence of imprisonment for 6 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years. In both cases offences were taken into account on a Form 1: in Guthrie's case, two offences of possessing a firearm without authorisation and in Ceissman's case, two minor offences of dishonesty. Both offenders had unfavourable criminal history, and Ceissman had been on parole at the time of the offence. 
[59] It will be noted that in three of the cases, DBN, Lenthall and Guthrie the ram-raid was charged under s 113(2). Moreover, in DBN the sentence passed for that offence was part of a complex of sentences for a series of offences, some of them wholly unrelated, and considerations of totality must have arisen. The most lenient sentences were those in Douglas and Lenthall, in which subjective considerations appear to have loomed large. No doubt, in passing sentence in Guthrie and Ceissman, the Court exercised the restraint appropriate when re-sentencing after a successful Crown appeal. 
[60] Importantly, in none of those cases were there the number and gravity of the Form 1 matters which had to be taken into account in the present case. In the context of emphasising the care with which sentencing statistics should be approached, Wood CJ at CL said in Lenthall at [47]:
""Additionally it is not to be overlooked that the comparison with the statistics is complicated where Form 1 offences have been taken into account, since that will require some increase in the sentence, for the reasons discussed in The Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518. The extent of the increase will vary according to the number and nature of the offences included in the Form 1.""
[61] It does not appear to me that these cases disclose a pattern of sentence such as might found a submission that the sentence for the applicant's ram-raid offence is manifestly excessive. Given the care with which the enterprise was planned and executed, the substantial sum of money stolen and the damage to the arcade, this was a serious offence of its kind. Having regard to the Form 1 offences, it appears to me that the sentence which his Honour passed was within the legitimate bounds of his sentencing discretion. 41In R v Reilly; R v Smith [2012] NSWCCA 166, the offenders appealed against sentences imposed when, having stolen a motor vehicle, they and a female co-offender reversed it through the front glass doors of a large store, smashing a display counter at the front of the store and stealing a substantial quantity of electronic equipment and a further two television screens from the back of the store, which were loaded into the sedan and driven away.  The sedan was set on fire and the stolen property divided amongst the three offenders.  The value of the property stolen amounted to slightly over $4000 and the damage occasioned to the store was almost $5600.  The vehicle, which was totally destroyed, was worth $1000.  Smith was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, and Reilly was sentenced for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.  Smith was 22 years old at the time of offending, coming from an Aboriginal family where the eldest males, including his father, condoned criminal behaviour and associated substance abuse.  He was one of 14 children who, since his teenage years, had a long-term pattern of polysubstance and alcohol abuse.  Despite this ""negative background"" and long criminal history, it was accepted he had continued to make positive attempts to address his offending behaviour.  There were some grounds for optimism in respect of rehabilitation.  At the time of the offences he was subject to suspended sentences and a bond.  Reilly was 24 years old at the time of the commission of the offence and of South Sea Islander origin.  At the time of his arrest he was abusing alcohol and drugs.  He had significant substance issues since the age of 13 and his neonatal abstinence syndrome and traumatic birth resulted in developmental delays with an undeveloped capacity for consequential thinking.  His prior criminal history included convictions for larceny for which he had been fined.  The sentencing judge considered that there were no significant aggravating features and the seriousness of the offence did not reach midrange, though the two matters on the Form 1 elevated the appropriate sentence.  The pleas of guilty were ""early and valuable"" but no discount was quantified.  Special circumstances were found.  This Court concluded, so far as Smith was concerned, that he had not received credit for prior custody attributable to the offence and the commencement date of the sentence was backdated but not otherwise varied.  Amongst Reilly's grounds of appeal was that he was sentenced to the same head sentence as Smith although his criminal history was very much less than Reilly and, furthermore, Smith was subject to conditional liberty when he offended.  This ground of appeal was upheld and the Court therefore did not need to consider whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.  The Court accordingly allowed Reilly's appeal and resentenced him to a head sentence of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months.  It appears it was assumed the sentencing judge had allowed a discount in the range of 20-25% so that the starting points, assuming a 25% discount, were 6 years and 8 months for Smith and 6 years for Reilly.  Basten JA, with whom Price and Campbell JJ agreed, said -
[37] In my opinion, a 'ram-raid' is a serious instance of an offence of break, enter and steal because of the inevitable destruction that is unleashed by the use of a motor vehicle to smash into commercial premises and the difficulty that store owners have protecting their property from such an offence. Both specific and general deterrence would normally play an important part in the sentencing task for a ram-raid offence. 
[38] Although the offence was not professionally planned, it was planned and well executed. A significant amount of property was stolen and the damage to the Target store was not inconsiderable. When the judge said there were no ""significant aggravating features"", his Honour overlooked Smith's conditional liberty, being the two suspended sentences of imprisonment for 18 months and the s 9 good behaviour bond to which he was subject at the time of the offending. His Honour's oversight was to Smith's advantage. Furthermore, there were the offences on the Form 1 that involved the theft and destruction by fire of the Commodore. Smith's previous record included two offences of aggravated break, enter and steal. Whilst these offences were not ram-raids, Smith's continuing disregard of the law called for added weight to be given to deterrence and protection of society, but his Honour confined Smith's record to the question of leniency. This also was to Smith's advantage.
...
[40] Although the offence in Forbes was well planned and the money stolen and property damage were greater than in the present appeal, Forbes subjective case was more favourable than that of Smith. Forbes was not on conditional liberty at the time of the offence and the sentencing judge considered that Forbes had good prospects of rehabilitation. Special circumstances were found justifying the substantial reduction in the length of the non-parole period. In any event, the undiscounted starting point of the sentence in Forbes was 8 years which is significantly more than the starting point of the present sentence. 
42His Honour described the review by Hidden J in Forbes as helpful: ibid at [41].  
43Leaving aside the ram-raid nature of the offence, Mr Neild submitted that there is little else which would justify the sentencing judge's assessment of its objective seriousness.  He submitted that the offence is otherwise a very commonplace kind of break, enter and steal offence with minimal planning resulting in a modest gain committed by drug addicts in order to feed their addiction.  As commercial premises, the feelings of invasion suffered by occupants whose home has been entered did not occur.  He argued that the manner of the break and the associated damage it occasioned were insufficient to move its seriousness out of the category in which it would otherwise fall and above the midrange of seriousness for a s 112(2) offence which, he (rightly) pointed out, must involve very much more serious circumstances such as breaking into a private home where residents might be expected to be present, stealing property of considerable sentimental or commercial value, involving a high degree of planning and, of considerable significance, very much more serious offences than property theft.  I agree that the significance of the standard non-parole period as a signpost or yardstick must be assessed in light of these considerations.  
44Aside from submitting that this Court would not accept that the applicant had shown the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust, bearing in mind the wide discretion reposed in sentencing judges, the Crown in this Court submitted that the applicant's focus on the starting point of the sentence before discounts was misconceived and cites R v Adzioski [2013] NSWCCA 69 per Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Slattery and Bellew JJ agreed) at [72] as authority for the contention, as I understand it, that the starting point is immaterial.  This is far from the case.  The relevant cases are as follows - 
45In Adzioski, Hoeben CJ at CL at [72] said - 
""It follows that to make out this ground, the applicant must satisfy the Court that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 - 371, Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [8] - [9].) The focus of the applicant's submission is the starting point of the sentence before the 25 percent discount. Such an approach deflects attention from the proper question (Graham v R [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [4], Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49). The question for this Court is whether the sentence actually imposed was unreasonable.""
46In Graham v R [2009] NSWCCA 212, Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) said at [40], [44] and [45] -
""[40] In any event for this ground of appeal to succeed, the focus needs to be on the sentence actually passed, rather than upon the starting point or notional sentence (SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19 at [40]; MacDonald v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 105 at [46] and Charlesworth v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [78]). I do not read the judgment of Simpson J in TYN v R [2009] NSWCCA 146 at [33] - [34] as saying anything to the contrary. In those paragraphs her Honour was saying no more than that it was legitimate when considering whether a sentence was manifestly excessive to have regard to the reasoning process which led up to it.
...
[44] In my opinion, the sentence imposed by his Honour of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years represents the bottom of the range of sentences which would adequately reflect the objective seriousness of this offence. To impose a lower sentence would be to go below that ""irreducible minimum sentence"" appropriate to this offence and would involve error as being manifestly inadequate.
[45] Even if I had concluded that the notional starting point for the head sentence was too high, it is clear that the sentence ultimately imposed not only fell within the permissible range of sentences for offences of this kind but was very much at the bottom of that range once the 50 percent discount was applied. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the sentence which his Honour imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.""
47In Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49, R A Hulme J at [63] said - 
""References to a ""notional starting point"" tend to deflect consideration from relevant matters and they have done so in this case. Hoeben J observed in Graham v R [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [40] that the focus should be on the sentence actually passed rather than on the starting point or notional sentence. An invitation to compare the ""notional starting point"" in this case with sentences actually passed in other cases by way of the statistics is to compare apples with oranges. Each of the 67 cases comprising the selection from the statistical database that was before the sentencing judge involved a plea of guilty. As a consequence, it could be expected that most, if not all, of those sentences were the result of a reduction of between 10 and 25 per cent. Counsel for the applicant acknowledged this in oral submissions, but maintained that the sentence actually passed was shown to be in ""the top 7% of cases"" (23.2.12 at T4.22).""
48In SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249, Buddin J (Simpson and  Howie JJ agreeing) said - 
""[40] Notwithstanding these features of the case, I accept the submission that the starting point or notional sentence for the first two offences, and particularly the first offence, was too high. Although as the authorities make plain, the quantity of drugs involved in any particular matter does not of itself determine the objective gravity of the offence, it is pertinent to deserve that the total quantity of drugs supplied as a result of the two offences was 4.5 grams, which is not in the scheme of things, a particularly large quantity. However, in assessing the contention that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, it is important to focus upon the sentences actually imposed rather than upon the starting point or notional sentence. As I have already remarked, the sentences were reduced by a combined discount of 62.5%. Not only did counsel for the applicant make no complaint about the extent of the discount but during the course of oral argument sought to justify it as being an appropriate exercise of the sentencing discretion.
...
[47] Howie J [in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92] made the following additional observations:
""As Latham J points out, the discount for assistance reflects a number of considerations that impact upon the sentence to be imposed upon the offender. One factor has traditionally been that a person giving assistance will normally be at risk within the gaol environment and, therefore, may need protection for a substantial part, if not all, of the term of the sentence. When this Court has expressed the view that the appropriate range for the plea of guilty and assistance is between 20 and 50 per cent, that range has been formulated on the basis that some reduction was due, not only to encourage others to give information to the authorities but also ""to compensate them for the more difficult conditions under which they will inevitably have to serve their sentences as a result of having given that information"", see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 250. ...
It seems to me that the courts should now acknowledge the reality of the situation and reduce the range of discount to reflect the fact that one of the bases of the discount is no longer generally applicable. In my opinion discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 per cent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. It should now be accepted that an offender who has provided assistance will not necessarily be disadvantaged in the prison system and, if the offender wishes to assert otherwise, he or she should lead evidence of that fact. (pars 3,5)""
...
[54] The applicant was clearly entitled, in the circumstances of the present case, to a substantial discount to reflect both the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and for his assistance to the authorities. I would not however characterise his as being an exceptional case. It was certainly not one in which in my opinion a combined discount exceeding 50% was called for. Accordingly, I have concluded that the discount which the sentencing judge allowed was unduly favourable to the applicant.
[55] Although I have concluded that the starting point for the sentences imposed in respect of the first two offences was too high, it is my view that the sentences ultimately imposed fell within the permissible range of penalty for offences of this kind once an appropriate combined discount (ie that is one not exceeding 50%) is allowed. Putting the matter another way, I have concluded that despite the fact that the sentencing exercise miscarried, no lesser sentences were warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).""
This is not to suggest that the starting point is immaterial but, rather, when it is too high, that will not dispose of the appeal where the discount is too great.  This is the point made by Simpson J (Spigelman CJ and James J agreeing) in TYN v R [2009] NSWCCA 146, at [33]-[34] - 
""[33] On behalf of the Crown it was argued that the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. Indeed it was not. But so to frame the question masks the proper approach to the inquiry. If (as is not challenged) the applicant was entitled to reductions of 25% and 33% attributable to her plea of guilty and her (considerable) assistance, then it may well be that a sentence which at first sight and unexplained by those considerations, appears to be within range and even lenient, is, in fact, not within range. The approach taken on behalf of the Crown risks undermining the function of sentence reductions in respect of those two important components. What it does is risk depriving an offender of the full benefit of reductions to which he or she is entitled. Here, the proper question is whether the starting point of 12 years would have been within or outside the appropriate range for this offender and this offence, absent the reduction for the plea of guilty and the assistance.
[34] I am aware that in R v SZ [2007] NSWCCA 19, and in Rutkowskyj v R [2008] NSWCCA 10, this Court has held that the focus in a sentence appeal must be the sentence actually imposed, rather than the notional starting point. But in each of these cases, it was held that the reduction allowed was excessive. Here, where it was not contended that the reduction was excessive, justice demands that the focus be on the starting point.""
49There can be no doubt, of course, that where a discount pursuant to s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 has been applied, it is of crucial importance to consider whether the starting point sentence was manifestly excessive.  This necessarily follows from the terms of s 23(1) - 
A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.
The penalty the court would ""otherwise impose"" is the starting point which may then be reduced in accordance with the section.  It must follow, as it seems to me, in a case of the present kind, where there is no dispute that the discount for assistance, including that applicable for the early plea, was correctly calculated by the sentencing judge that, if his Honour's starting point was manifestly excessive, the sentence must necessarily also be manifestly excessive.  Although, therefore, in a sense, it is correct that the fundamental question is whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances, the process of reasoning necessarily undertaken for that question to be answered must involve an assessment of whether the starting point was manifestly excessive.  Obversely, if the starting point was within the discretionary range, it must follow that, the discount being appropriate, the ultimate sentence cannot be manifestly excessive.  At the same time, it will, in some cases, be necessary to deal with the issue to which s 23(3) is directed, namely, the lesser penalty (necessarily less than that which would otherwise have been appropriate) is nevertheless, unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  
Conclusion
50In my view, with respect, the sentencing judge's starting point was, indeed, manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.  Accepting that other examples are not to be regarded as in any sense prescriptive, it seems to me that the instances cited above strongly support this conclusion.  In particular, with respect, the applicant's criminal culpability was not above midrange of objective seriousness for offences covered by s 112(2), allowing that this is a term which is impossible to precisely define and that, at all events, assessment of seriousness of an offence is very much a matter of evaluative judgment in respect of which reasonable minds can reasonably differ.  The evidence shows no more than minimal planning by the applicant, rather suggesting it was impulsive and opportunistic.  The premises were commercial rather than residential and the crime was committed at a time when it was, as Mr Neild submitted, highly unlikely that any person would be present at the pharmacy.  Although, in a sense, the offence was brazen, I cannot see how this renders it more serious than if the shop had been entered secretly; that damage of just under $50,000 was caused is, on the other hand, undoubtedly significant.  This is not so serious an offence, to my mind, as those which involve the theft of ATMs, which are the mark of professional criminals.  This crime was committed to obtain drugs - not for profit.
51Furthermore, the applicant's subjective case was a significant one: she suffered from a very problematic upbringing, one of the incidents of which was that she started to abuse drugs at the very early age of 12, with few personal resources enabling her to deal with her ensuing addiction and the other serious problems from which she suffered.  This is, of course, not to suggest that her crimes, let alone the present offence, were not fully intentional, but ordinary humanity (quite apart from authority: see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 (2 October 2013) requires these factors to be given substantial weight in the sentencing assessment.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she has shown real and substantial moves towards change in the approach she took to the offence, particularly by agreeing to give assistance to the authorities.  This signifies more than merely the utilitarian advantages to the public.
52It seems to me, therefore, with respect, that the starting point of 8 years imprisonment, taking into account the offences in the Form 1, was manifestly excessive and, consequently, even though when reduced by 50% a term of 4 years imprisonment resulted, that sentence is manifestly excessive also.  I would substitute a sentence of 5 years imprisonment which, when reduced by 50% would yield a term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.  In my opinion, although markedly less (ex hypothesi by 50%) than the sentence which would otherwise be appropriate, this penalty is not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  Applying the ratio prescribed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 yields a non-parole period of something less than 1 year and 11 months.  However, it is necessary to take into account that the appellant, as the sentencing judge noted, was in custody for just over 8 (mistakenly stated as 9) months in relation to the other offences (the sentences for which totalled 8 months) upon which the present offence is to be accumulated.  Applying the statutory ratio to the total sentence of 3 years 2 months would yield a non-parole period of about 2 years 4 months (rounded down).  Giving credit by way of special circumstances for the 8 months served to 13 July 2013 yields a non-parole period from that date of 1 year 8 months.  To my mind, this would result in an inadequate period on parole of only 10 months necessary to support the appellant's rehabilitation which is plainly in the public interest.  Accordingly, I would impose a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 14 July 2013.  Again, it seems to me that the overall sentence does not contravene s 23(3) of the Act.
Orders
53I propose the following orders - 
(i)   leave to appeal is granted;
(ii) appeal upheld;
(iii) sentence quashed and, in lieu thereof, a sentence of 2 years and 6 months be substituted, commencing on 14 July 2013, with a non-parole period of 1 year;
(iv) the appellant is to be immediately released on parole subject to the supervision prescribed by the regulations under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) for the period on parole.
54FULLERTON J:  I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Adams J and Leeming JA.  Having given consideration to the various matters to which their Honours referred in resolving to different views as to the ultimate disposition of the application for leave to appeal against the sentence, I agree with Leeming JA that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed.
55For my part, I can see no error in the sentencing judge's characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of the applicant's offending as above the mid range for offences committed in breach of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, or for the sentencing judge to focus upon ""ram raids"" as a species of offending against that section.  Using a vehicle as a ram to force entry to commercial premises with the intention of stealing from them has been recognised as a particular type of offending in breach of s 112(2) largely because of certain common features which, when they are present, serve as an indicator of objective seriousness: invariably a stolen vehicle is used and the offence committed in company; considerable property damage is frequently occasioned and property of not inconsiderable value taken.  In addition, while insurance is some measure a proprietor can take against loss, little can be done to protect against the risk of particular commercial premises being targeted.  In this case the pharmacy was targeted because of the expectation that there would be quantities of prescription drugs and cash available to be stolen quickly before an escape was effected in the vehicle used as the ram.
56I am unable to assess with any confidence the degree of planning in which this applicant participated with her co-offender in the ""ram raid"", save as to note that she was in the front passenger seat and the only offender to enter the premises.  A co-offender remained in the back seat.  I respectfully disagree with Adams J at [28] that the evidence is suggestive of her involvement being impulsive or opportunistic although I accept that there is a demonstrated link to her chronic drug use.
57As was pointed out in Forbes v R [2009] NSWCCA 292 at [61], there was no pattern of sentences as at the date of that judgment to found a submission of manifest excess (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54] and Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 305 ALR 323 at [28] and [41]).  The applicant did not take the Court to any cases since then that have suggested otherwise.  In my view, given the seriousness of the offending and the fact that the offence was committed when the applicant was on conditional liberty, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, after it was discounted by the combined discount of 50 per cent, has been shown to be manifestly excessive in the sense that it has been shown to be unreasonable or plainly unjust.

2704064,Application by Roseanne Beckett pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1773,"Judgment

1The Applicant has applied for an enquiry pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) into her convictions for maliciously wounding Barry Catt and for assaulting Barry Catt occasioning actual bodily harm. The application seeks the referral of the convictions to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

2The background to the application is set out in my judgment in Beckett v The State of New South Wales (No. 1) [2011] NSWSC 818. It may be summarised as follows.

3On 24 August 1989 the Plaintiff was arrested and charged in relation to a number of matters. On 14 May 1990 committal proceedings commenced in Taree Local Court in relation to the indictable offences. 

4On 27 July 1990 Magistrate Evans ordered the Plaintiff to stand trial in the Supreme Court in relation to a number of the allegations which subsequently formed the following counts in the indictment presented at the Plaintiff's trial:

Count 1: [Rock Incident]:

On 2 May 1988 at Taree maliciously did wound Barry Catt (s.35 Crimes Act 1900).

Count 2: [False Evidence About The Rock Incident]:

On 3 July 1989 at Taree in the Local Court before Mr G.P. O'Keefe, Magistrate, on an occasion when truth of the same was material, did knowingly and willingly falsely swear in substance, as follows, that is to say, that she, Roseanne Catt, at no time struck Barry Catt with a rock (s.327 Crimes Act 1900).

Count 3: [Swan's Crossing Incident]:

Between 2 March and 30 March 1989 at Swans Crossing maliciously did wound Barry Catt (s.35 Crimes Act 1900).

Count 4: [Cricket Bat Incident]:

On 5 May 1989 at Taree did assault Barry Catt thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm (s.59 Crimes Act 1900).

Count 5: [Drug Incident]:

Between 1 May and 31 July 1989 at Taree, maliciously did cause to be taken by Barry Catt a noxious thing, namely, lithium, and thereby did endanger the life of Barry Catt (s.39 Crimes Act 1900).

Count 6: [James Morris - RSL Club]:

On 28 July 1989 at Taree did solicit James Morris to murder Barry Catt (s.26 Crimes Act 1900).

Count 7: [Vernon Taylor-1 Cornwall Street, Taree]:

Between 15 July and 16 August 1989 at Taree did solicit Vernon Taylor to murder Barry Catt (s.26 Crimes Act 1900).

Count 9: [Pistol]:

On or about 24 August 1989 at Taree did have in her possession a pistol, namely, a Hopkins and Allen .32 calibre revolver, she then not being the holder of a licence for such pistol (s.25(l) Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973).

5In addition, Count 8 in the indictment presented at trial was this:

On or about 24 June 1989 at Taree did encourage Leslie O'Brien to murder Barry Catt (s.26 Crimes Act 1900).

On that matter the Magistrate did not commit the Plaintiff to stand her trial. Subsequently, however, the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an ex officio indictment in relation to that count which became Count 8 in the indictment. 

6The Plaintiff stood trial in relation to the said nine counts before her Honour Justice Mathews and a jury in the Supreme Court. The trial commenced on 7 May 1991. On 11 September 1991 the jury returned verdicts of guilty to counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9, and an alternative guilty verdict in relation to count 5. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty in relation to count 8. On 18 October 1991 the Plaintiff was sentenced to a total of 12 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 3 months.

7The Plaintiff appealed from her convictions and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court subsequently dismissed her appeal (R v Catt (1993) 68 A Crim R 189).

8In early 2001 the Plaintiff petitioned the Governor, pursuant to s 474B Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), seeking a review of her convictions on the eight (8) counts on which she had been found guilty. On 24 July 2001 the Attorney-General referred the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to section 474C(l)(b) of the Crimes Act.

9On 7 December 2001 the Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal. In considering the appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal, on 12 July 2002, ordered that the factual issues in the appeal be remitted to a judge of a court of trial, pursuant to section 12(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The matter was allocated to Davidson ADCJ for the determination of factual matters. His Honour delivered his findings on 27 July 2004.

10On 16 September 2004 the Plaintiff filed Amended Grounds of Appeal.

11On 17 August 2005 the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered judgment in the appeal: R v Catt [2005] NSWCCA 279. McClellan AJA (with whom Adams J agreed) said:

[232] I have come to the conclusion that the appeal in relation to counts 3 and 4 should be dismissed and the appeals in relation to counts 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9 upheld. 

[233] With respect to count 9 (unlicensed pistol) the sentence has already been served and an order for a new trial would not be appropriate. A verdict of acquittal should be entered. 

[234] However, with respect to the other matters the charges are serious and although I am satisfied the convictions should be quashed it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, and not this Court, to determine whether a new trial should take place. Although there is undoubtedly significant reasons (sic) why a new trial may be appropriate, not the least of which is to ensure that when significant charges are brought they are determined according to law, this must be balanced with the fact that fresh trials would occasion significant expense and it would be unlikely that any further term of imprisonment would be required to be served, even if convictions were entered on all charges. The appellant was released on bail on 6 August 2001, just over four months before her release on parole was due on 10 December 2001. 

[235] In the circumstances, the appellant should remain on bail pending the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether to proceed with any fresh trial. 

[236] I propose the following orders:

1. Uphold the appeal in relation to counts 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9 and quash each conviction. 

2. Enter a verdict of acquittal on count 9.

3. Order that there be a new trial in relation to counts 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. 

4. Dismiss the appeal in relation to counts 3 and 4.

5. The appellant's bail is to continue.

6. Reserve liberty to apply.

12On 22 September 2005 the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that there be no further proceedings against the Plaintiff on all the outstanding charges. On 26 September 2005 a form from the DPP headed ""Particulars of No Further Proceedings Submission to the Director"" (""the Particulars"") was prepared for forwarding to the Court of Criminal Appeal Registry. 

13As can be seen, although counts 3 and 4, the subject of the present application, were no-billed by the DPP, the Applicant seeks that the convictions be quashed.

14On 19 February 2007 the applicant petitioned the Governor for a review pursuant to s 474B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in respect of the convictions for counts 3 and 4. The petition was supported by an affidavit sworn by Tracey Anne Mairinger (nee Taylor) on 12 January 2007. The Governor declined the petition.

Legal principles

15The test to be applied in determining an application of this kind is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. 

16The principles to be applied in determining an application under s 78 were summarised by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 as follows:

[5] Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 has its origins in a legislative scheme which was an innovation in New South Wales - it is remedial legislation designed to overcome injustices that sometimes arise in the course of the administration of criminal justice: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW (2006) 66 NSWLR 151 at 154 [5], 155 [8]. An application under s.78 does not involve a judicial proceeding: s.79(4). In determining such an application, the Court performs an administrative act: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] 214 CLR 318 at 362 [124]. 

[6] The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18]. 

[7] Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore (2000) 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19]. 

[8] There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988, unreported at page 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at page 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at [9]. 

Some Other Features of the Jurisdiction

[9] The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result. 

[10] The jurisdiction which a judge is exercising under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is an administrative function which may be activated when the criminal justice system has run its course following trial and appeal and, in almost every case, where additional evidence has come to light which is said to raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence. The powers available under s.79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. They do not extend to a power to quash convictions or direct acquittals (as the Applicant sought in this case). 

[11] The nature of the jurisdiction under Part 7 involves some flexibility in the material which may be placed before a judge in support of an application for an order directing an inquiry or referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. To invoke the fresh evidence rule at the ss.78-79 stage (as the Crown submissions of 30 November 2006 suggested by reference to R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81 at 93-94) does not sit well with the function being performed. In decisions concerning applications under s.475, it was observed that the fresh evidence rule had no application: Application of Esposito at page 2; Application of Visser at page 3. 

[12] If the judge refers the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, however, that Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: s.86 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. On an appeal following referral, the test governing the reception of new and fresh evidence on appeal is applicable: R v Johns (2000) 110 A Crim R 149 at 151-153 [4]-[10], 165-169 [41]-[58]; R v Pollock [2005] NSWCCA 316 at [2]-[3], [24]ff. 

Facts

17In each case the facts are detailed in the judgment of McClellan AJA in the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

Count 3: The Swans Crossing incident

[31] The Crown alleged that on 12 March 1989 the appellant and Barry Catt went for a picnic together at Swans Crossing. At one stage during the picnic they were lying in their swimming costumes on a rug drinking stout when the conversation turned to Mary Warwick. Barry Catt gave evidence that the appellant then became very angry and started to drive a knife she was using to cut lemons through the rug. Barry Catt told her to stop, to which she said words to the effect of ""I'll fucking stab you too"" and proceeded to prod him twice with the knife and then drove the knife into his left side just below his ribs. He quickly walked off and approached a man who was having a barbecue some distance away. The Crown called this man, Garry Jeffrey, who gave evidence that he had given Barry Catt a t-shirt to put over his bleeding wound. Meanwhile the appellant having loaded up the car drove up to Barry Catt and told him to get in. He refused saying ""No, you will stab me again."" He then walked and hitchhiked home. Later that day the appellant bathed his wound and advised him it did not need stitching. The wound became infected. The Crown called evidence from Dr Goddard who came to the workshop as a customer and remembers Barry Catt showing him the wound. 

[32] The appellant denied inviting Barry Catt to a picnic at Swans Crossing and testified that Barry Catt followed her to Port Macquarie on the weekend this incident occurred. She claimed she was lying on the ground at Swans Crossing when Barry Catt approached her and started stabbing the rug. She put her foot out and he fell backwards or onto his side. The appellant in evidence would not concede that Barry Catt had any injury at all that day. If he did she claimed to know nothing about it. 

[33] At the trial more evidence was directed to what occurred the night before the Swans Crossing incident than to the incident itself. In particular the Crown alleged that the appellant had deliberately attempted to manipulate evidence which might otherwise be available for use against her and had attempted to persuade the proprietor of a motel, Janet Eslick, where she and Barry Catt had stayed on the previous night, 11 March, to say that she had stayed there alone. This was to support her version of events that she and Barry Catt had not gone to Swans Crossing together on 12 March, but rather that she had gone there alone and that he followed her and arrived unexpectedly. The appellant relied upon this additional evidence as showing that Barry Catt was unworthy of credibility and was being fed information by the police as to the details of the evidence during the course of the trial. In her remarks on sentence Mathews J said: 

""The jury's verdict indicates that it accepted Barry Catt's evidence, and also, presumably, that of the motel proprietor. This raises serious questions about the prisoner's attempts to manipulate evidence which she feared might be used against her. This is not a matter which can be used in aggravation of sentence, but it certainly deprives her of any leniency by reason of contrition or remorse.""

Count 4: The cricket bat / eucalyptus oil incident 

[34] The Crown alleged that on this occasion the appellant assaulted Barry Catt with a cricket bat. He gave evidence that at about 11 pm he was talking to some friends on the telephone in his office when the appellant intercepted the call by picking up the extension in the house. When she found out who it was he was talking to, she said ""I don't want you talking to that slut."" Barry Catt said he hung up on the appellant and continued talking. Within five minutes the appellant and his children appeared. The appellant grabbed the telephone. 

[35] The Crown led evidence from the caller, Jan O'Brien, of her recollection of the appellant's suddenly coming onto the telephone and starting to abuse her. The appellant said what a sick man Barry Catt was and put Tony and then Christopher Catt on the line to tell Jan O'Brien identical versions of what their father had done to them. After the telephone conversation the appellant grabbed the cricket bat from Christopher and in an underarm movement swung it at Barry Catt's head, hitting him under his right eye and saying ""I'll kill you, you cunt."" Barry Catt's eye began to bleed. At the time he was carrying a small bottle of eucalyptus oil which he was using for some medicinal purpose for his lips. He dropped the bottle, spilling the contents. He then left the premises and drove to a friend's house. 

[36] The Crown called evidence from Max French who remembered Barry Catt arriving one night with an injured eye. Barry Catt eventually returned home that night but was woken up in the early hours of the next morning by the appellant and the children who had broken into the office. The appellant struck him around the face, causing his injured eye to bleed again and then left. The appellant called the police who came to the premises, woke Barry Catt up and took him to the hospital and then the police station where he was charged with assault. He spent the weekend in the police cell and was not released until Monday afternoon over two days after his arrest. The police at this stage believed the appellant's story that Barry Catt had attacked the children and her and thrown the eucalyptus oil into Tony Catt's eyes. 

[37] The appellant denied intercepting telephone calls and said the telephone system between the house and the office did not enable her to do so. On her version of the incident, Christopher and Tony Catt went over to the office to get some supplies for homework, thinking Barry Catt was out. The appellant heard screaming and went over to the office and saw the two boys and Barry Catt fighting. Barry Catt said he was going to kill the boys. He picked up a bottle of eucalyptus oil off the desk, and threw it, catching Tony and her in the eye. They had blurred visions but struggled back to the house. The appellant then rang the hospital and tended to Tony's eyes. She denied ever seeing a cricket bat on that occasion. The children gave evidence supporting her version of the events. The police gave evidence locating a broken bottle on the patio. 

[38] Of this incident Mathews J said in her remarks on sentence: 

""This was the second occasion on which the prisoner made allegations of violence against her husband, notwithstanding that it was he who had sustained obvious physical injury in the altercation between them. There being no charge relating to this aspect of the matter, however, I can only use it as again indicating a lack of contrition or remorse following this assault with the cricket bat."" 

18In his judgment McClellan AJA (with whom Adams J agreed) said this in relation to these two counts:

Count 3 

[184] The Crown case in relation to count 3 was dependent on the evidence of Barry Catt and a number of other persons with no apparent connection with either Mr or Ms Catt. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the case presented by the Crown was influenced in any manner by the investigative method of Det Sgt Thomas. For these reasons Davidson ADCJ accepted the submission of the Crown that the Crown's case as to count 3 remained unaffected by any evidence given at the Section 12 hearing. 

[185] In my opinion, the Crown case on this count was strong. Nothing provided by way of evidence at the Section 12 hearing affects the credit of any Crown witness on this count. As Mathews J points out it is plain that having regard to the jury's verdict they accepted Barry Catt's evidence and that of the motel proprietor and completely rejected the appellant's version of the events. 

[186] To my mind, the position in relation to the third count (""the Swans Crossing Incident"") is significantly different from the position in relation to the other counts. There is no suggestion that Det Sgt Thomas brought pressure to bear on any witness in relation to this incident. The evidence of Garry Jeffrey as to the actions of the appellant and Mr Catt following the incident, including their conversation, provides powerful support for Barry Catt's account of the relevant events. Furthermore, the evidence of the appellant's attempts to persuade Janet Eslick to support her account of the events of the previous evening is a strong indication that her account of the whole sequence of events could not be accepted. I am satisfied that, notwithstanding the impact which the fresh evidence may otherwise have had on the credit of the appellant, there is no possibility that a jury would acquit on this count. 

[187] The appeal with respect to this count should be dismissed.

Count 4 

[188] The Crown case at the trial in relation to count 4 depended primarily on the evidence of Barry Catt together with evidence of telephone conversations which he had with others at about the time of the alleged assault. Critical to the Crown case was the allegation that the assault occurred on 5 May 1989, the alternative account being that the events were confined to the morning of the following day. 

[189] The evidence of Ms Jan O'Brien as to a conversation she had with Barry Catt in the evening of 5 May, which Barry Catt said triggered the incident, was also significant. Barry Catt's version was also supported by Mr French who he alleged he visited following the assault to avoid further incidents occurring. 

[190] Although the Crown case is now supported by the children who, gave a contrary version at the trial, which was rejected by the jury, I do not believe their evidence would add significantly to the weight of the Crown case. 

[191] There was no doubt that Mr Catt was injured above the eye. The defence case was that the injury was self inflicted and Mr Catt's story concocted to escape any difficulties from the release of the eucalyptus oil. The jury rejected this proposition. Smart AJ has carried out a detailed analysis of that evidence in relation to this count [54]-[59] and emphasises the role which the evidence of Mrs O'Brien must have played in the jury's analysis of the evidence. Critical to that analysis is the fact that there is no suggestion that Mrs O'Brien's evidence was influenced by Det Sgt Thomas and accordingly the jury's finding should not be disturbed. The essential question for the jury in relation to count 4 was whether to accept the evidence of Mrs O'Brien and Mr Catt or whether the appellant's account was sufficiently credible to raise a relevant doubt. They resolved those matters by accepting the prosecution evidence. 

[192] I am satisfied that the analysis undertaken by Smart AJ is appropriate and notwithstanding the evidence which is now available a jury acting rationally could not entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. 

[193] The appeal in relation to this count should be dismissed.

19In addition, Smart AJ said this:

Count 3 

[288] I agree that the conviction of the appellant on this count must stand. The Crown case on this count was overwhelming. Mrs Catt's evidence was unbelievable and wholly destructive of her credit. 

Count 4

[289] McClellan AJA has summarised the Crown case and evidence (paras [36] to [39]) and set out a passage from the remarks on sentence of Mathews J (para [40]). 

[290] The trial judge crystallised the issue thus (SU50):

""So the real question is, did Roseanne Catt assault him with a cricket bat as was described? ... the defence version is ... that it must have been self-inflicted because ... during the confrontation between them which, according to the defence, took place on the Saturday morning not the Friday night; nothing happened which could have accounted for that."" 

While the principal evidence in support of Count 4 was that of Barry Catt the evidence of Mrs J O'Brien and Mr French was important. Indeed, the evidence of Mrs J O'Brien provided considerable support for the Crown case and reflected adversely on the credit of Mrs Catt. 

[291] The trial judge records that counsel for the defence contended that Mrs O'Brien had nothing to do with this. The trial judge (SU53) pointed out that the jury may think she had quite a bit to do with it as she confirmed in a sense Barry Catt's version of what happened and the trial judge explained why and how it did so thus (SU53): 

""[Jan O'Brien's evidence] not only supports Barry Catt's version that there was this conversation (and indeed that is what started the confrontation in the first place) but it also supports the suggestion that Roseanne Catt and the children were there in that office on the Friday night at a time when they themselves said that they were in Cowan Road"" 

[292] In view of the importance of Mrs O'Brien's evidence I propose to refer briefly to the evidence which she gave at the trial. It appears that Mr Catt telephoned her after 11pm. She said that while she and Mr Catt were talking the appellant suddenly came onto the line and abused her. The abuse was couched in very coarse terms. The appellant said that Mr Catt was a sick man and enlarged on that theme. The appellant put Tony Catt and then Christopher Catt on the line to tell identical versions of what their father had done to them by way of sexual abuse. Mrs O'Brien did not believe what they asserted. 

[293] From Mrs O'Brien's evidence at the trial these matters emerge: 

(a) She had known Mr Catt for about 14 years as at 1991. 

(b) She and her husband had rented the cottage at 2 Cornwall Street, Taree for about 18 months, leaving about 20 October 1986. 

(c) She had been employed to do the housework at 1 Cornwall Street by Mr Catt and to assist in looking after the children. 

(d) Mr Catt and his de facto (Sharon Clarke) separated in September 1986. 

(e) When she made her statement on 12 October 1989 at Newcastle Police Station Sgt Thomas, Det Paget and her husband were there. Sgt Thomas interviewed her. She had not seen Sgt Thomas since 12 October 1989 except once at Court in Taree. They did not discuss this case. 

(f) She disliked Mrs Catt and had previously agreed in Court in December 1990 that she had a deep resentment of Mrs Catt in October 1986. 

(g) Since October 1986 she had kept in contact with Mr Catt. 

(h) At one stage (September/October 1986) Mr Catt alleged that Noel Jago was trying to kill him. 

(i) She had described Mr Catt as being in a ""zombie"" or drugged condition in about September/October 1986. 

[294] Mrs Catt was probably aware of Mrs O'Brien's attitude to her and relations between the two women were poor. The jury accepted the evidence of Mrs O'Brien and rejected the evidence of the appellant. Mrs O'Brien's hostility to Mrs Catt was manifest and must have been taken into account by the jury but they may well have thought that it was soundly based. With her knowledge of Mr Catt, the family and Mrs Catt she was in a good position to assess matters. Her evidence should not be discounted simply because she is a friend of Mr Catt. The evidence reveals that Mrs O'Brien was strong minded, with very definite views. She needed no prompting or influencing by Sgt Thomas. The evidence does not suggest that she was influenced by Sgt Thomas or that her evidence was corrupted by him. That is not a reasonable possibility. 

[295] Max French gave evidence that Mr Catt arrived one night with an injured eye. He was later taken to hospital by the police for treatment. 

[296] The Crown case before Davidson ADCJ was supported by the Catt children who gave a version contrary to that which they gave at Mrs Catt's trial. While the evidence of the Catt children cannot be ignored, it has to be viewed with great caution and scrutinised very carefully. It adds some strength to the Crown case. 

[297] The jury also accepted the evidence of Mr Barry Catt as to the incident. Combining the evidence at the trial with the fresh evidence, particularly that as to Mr Thomas' corrupting influence, there is no reasonable possibility of Mrs Catt being acquitted on this count. 

The Applicant's submissions

20The Applicant relied particularly on the role of Detective Sergeant Thomas and the Court of Criminal Appeal's conclusions about his involvement in all of the offences charged. The submissions said, without specific reference to what the Court of Criminal Appeal had said about these two counts, that the present application would demonstrate Detective Thomas' involvement in the charges arising out of the two incidents and his direct responsibility for their prosecution. In addition, it was submitted that there was fresh evidence in relation to the counts.

21Detective Thomas' involvement in the Swans Crossing incident as alleged by the Applicant can be summarised as follows:

(a) Barry Catt, the only witness to give direct evidence of the alleged stabbing, provided the information to Detective Thomas in his statement of 9 August 1989;

(b) About six months later Detective Thomas visited Garry Jeffrey, the main witness after the event, and asked him to give a statement about the incident. Detective Thomas prepared the statement which included an observation that Barry Catt visited Jeffrey at his workplace, a local service station, two weeks after the incident to discuss the matter;

(c) When Detective Thomas executed the search warrant and arrested the Applicant on 24 August 1989 he seized two knives, and alleged a Wilkinson sword black-handled implement was the knife used to stab Barry Catt. Although Barry Catt had said in his statement that the knife was used to open oysters, when he was shown the knife at the Davidson inquiry, Barry Catt said he did not recognise the knife. 

(d) Detective Thomas interviewed Dr Goddard. Dr Goddard told Detective Thomas that he attended Barry Catt's panel shop some eight days after the alleged stabbing to pay an account for repairs to his motor vehicle and Barry Catt asked him to look at the wound. However, Barry Catt told Detective Thomas that Dr Goddard visited the panel shop and looked at the wound a day after the incident.

22The Applicant submitted that Detective Thomas' involvement in the cricket bat/eucalyptus oil incident was as follows:

(a) After the Applicant was arrested and charged by Detective Thomas he conducted a Record of Interview with her. Detective Thomas put to the Applicant that she had struck her husband with the cricket bat and as a result he suffered an injury on his left little finger and a cut under his right eye which bled. Further, as a result of the blow striking his hand the bottle of eucalyptus oil that he was holding went into the air and spilled;

(b) Detective Thomas conspired to conflate two separate incidents. The first occurred on the night of 5 May 1989 when Barry Catt threatened to kill his children Christopher and Tony. The other incident occurred on the morning of 6 May 1989 when Barry Catt threw a bottle of eucalyptus oil at the Applicant, with the contents of the bottle going onto the Applicant and Tony Catt. 

(c) Detective Thomas took a statement from John Pearson on 12 September 1989. John Pearson was the husband of Barry Catt's ex-wife. The cricket bat said to have been used by the Applicant was alleged to have belonged to John Pearson who had left it with Barry Catt for safe keeping. 

(d) Detective Thomas also prepared a statement for Max French on 6 September 1989. Max French was the witness who claimed to have seen the injury to Barry Catt's eye. The Applicant alleges that Max French was a friend of Detective Thomas and Barry Catt. 

(e) Detective Thomas arranged and coordinated the execution of the search warrant on the Applicant's home at 1 Cornwall Street, Taree on 24 August 1989. 

23Implicit in the Applicant's submissions was the conspiracy said to have existed between Barry Catt, Detective Thomas, Detective Paget and Adrian Newell to harm the Applicant by false charges and false evidence. Although one aspect of the further evidence from Ms Strachan was said to demonstrate wrongdoing in this regard on Barry Catt's part, the Applicant's submissions were largely directed to wrongdoing on Detective Thomas' part and his involvement in the prosecution of all the charges including counts 3 and 4.

Further evidence

24Three witnesses are put forward by the Applicant with what is asserted to be fresh evidence. 

(1) Tracey Mairinger (formerly Taylor)

25In an affidavit by Tracey Mairinger she was said to have enjoyed a close, personal relationship with the Applicant and her family up until 1989 when she moved away from the Taree area. However, she gave evidence at the trial in support of the police case against the Applicant.

26The Applicant had a chance meeting with Ms Mairinger at Shellharbour on 10 August 2006. Subsequently Ms Mairinger provided an affidavit which provided an explanation about why she said that she gave false evidence at the Applicant's trial. The reason was that threats were made to her by Detective Thomas. She does not say which evidence was false.

27The affidavit went on to say:

[8] ... I now say that all the charges against Roseanne were false including attempted murder, possession of guns, attempted poisoning, solicit to murder and alleged assaults. I know this because I was involved with Roseanne and her family on a daily basis at the time and I saw nothing to justify the charges.

[9] I am aware of two outstanding convictions against Roseanne, one relating to an incident at Swans Crossing in March 1989, and the other relating to a cricket bat/eucalyptus oil incident on 5 May 1989. Although I recall an incident where Barry Catt threw eucalyptus oil, there was no suggestion at the time that Roseanne struck Barry Catt with a cricket bat. I can say that I never saw a cricket bat at either house in Cornwall Street. In relation to the allegation that Roseanne stabbed Barry Catt, I did not know about this charge until Roseanne's trial.

(2) Jeannie Strachan

28One of the significant witnesses at the trial was Marie Whalen. At the time 
the Applicant stood trial and went to prison, Ms Whalen was serving a sentence in prison for the manslaughter of her husband. Whilst in prison she met Jeannie Strachan and had a relationship with her. Following her release from prison in 1995 the Applicant asserts that Ms Whalen confided in Ms Strachan that she had conspired with Barry Catt, his friend Adrian Newell and Detective Thomas to give false evidence against the Applicant. Ms Whalen and Ms Strachan travelled to Taree together in 1995 and met Barry Catt.

29Ms Strachan has provided an affidavit sworn 26 May 2008 where she relevantly says this:

[5] In 1995, after Marie Whalen and I were released from prison, we went to Taree where we visited Barry Catt. Marie Whalen and Barry Catt were laughing about the way they had stitched up Roseanne by giving false evidence against her. Marie Whalen and Barry Catt also spoke about Detective Sergeant Peter Thomas and Adrian Newell fabricating evidence against Roseanne. Barry Catt said, 'All you need is a few people who owe you favours and you put a bit of pressure on them' or words to that effect.

[6] Barry Catt recounted how he and a friend had put lithium in his milk and then accused Roseanne of doing it. He spoke about how Detective Sergeant Peter Thomas got a cricket bat from Marie Whalen and then concocted a story that Roseanne had hit Barry Catt with the cricket bat. Barry Catt bragged about the way he had cut himself with an oyster knife and accused Roseanne of stabbing him. Barry Catt also said, 'I often do things like that to claim on my accident and injury insurance policy' or words to that effect.

[7] Barry Catt described Roseanne as a bitch and said he was on a restraining order for 18 months prior to her arrest. He said this meant he had to arrange for his mates to follow her around before her arrest. He said, 'Everyone who gave evidence against Roseanne at her trial were my mates or Peter Thomas' mates and they owed us favours' or words to that effect. Barry Catt also said, 'I had to get Roseanne because if I went down [on child sex charges] everybody else was going down with me' or words to that effect.

(3) Errol Taylor

30Errol Taylor was a friend of the Applicant who gave evidence on her behalf at her trial. He swore an affidavit on 2 May 2008 where he relevantly said:

[3] I gave evidence for Roseanne at her trial in 1991 and at the judicial inquiry into her convictions in 2003. I have always believed that she was the subject of a vendetta by Detective Sergeant Peter Thomas for reporting him to his superiors over allegations he was involved in fraudulent insurance claims and child pornography. In 1985, I conveyed information from Roseanne and her staff to the New South Wales Ombudsman about Taree police involvement in alleged paedophile activities.

[4] I was not asked any questions at Roseanne's trial or at the judicial inquiry into her convictions about an alleged stabbing incident at Swan's Crossing in March 1989, or an alleged assault with a cricket bat on 5 May 1989. I am now informed that there are two remaining convictions against Roseanne for these two incidents on the basis that it did not appear to the Court of Criminal Appeal that Detective Peter Thomas was involved in either incident.

[5] I believe that neither of these incidents occurred, and I say this because I was visiting Roseanne and her family in the first half of 1989 on a regular basis, and at no stage did anybody mention the incidents to me. Barry Catt talked incessantly about the past women in his life and how they tried to poison him and steal his assets. Had Barry Catt been stabbed by Roseanne, he would have told me about it and showed me the wound.

[6] In all the years I visited Roseanne and her family at 2 Cowan Road, Taree, 1 Cornwall Street, Taree, and 8 Cornwall Street, Taree, I have never observed a cricket bat. I am a cricket enthusiast and I would certainly have noticed a cricket bat if one was available in any of these premises. I would have picked up the cricket bat, looked at it and talked about it. I would have been a keen participant in any game of cricket, but I have never observed Roseanne's children or Barry Catt's children playing cricket.

[7] I was aware Roseanne had taken out a restraining order against Barry Catt in 1988 because of his violent and abusive behaviour. Also, I recall hearing about Barry Catt throwing eucalyptus oil in 1989, causing an injury to one of his children that required medical attention. There was no mention at the time of Roseanne striking Barry Catt with a cricket bat. I can say that I cannot imagine anybody striking Barry Catt without provoking a violent reaction.

Consideration

31Section 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act relevantly provides:

79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

...

(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).

32In his report Davidson ADCJ said this of Barry Catt:

[80] ...In light of the view which I have formed as to Mr Catt's 
credibility as a witness in the section 12 hearing, I do not accept his evidence unless supported by independent credible evidence from another source which I do accept.

33Davidson ADCJ in his report at [745] and [746] considered the evidence of Garry Jeffrey who was a significant witness in relation to count 3. Davidson ADCJ concluded:

There is no indication in the evidence that Mr Jeffrey was pressured into making a statement, or making any particular statement, by anyone.

34Davidson ADCJ referred also to two other witnesses who tended to corroborate Mr Jeffrey and Mr Catt. The first was Beverley Thompson who was with Mr Jeffrey at Swans Crossing. The second was Garry McGuire who met Mr Catt when Mr Catt was hitchhiking back to Taree. He noticed that Mr Catt was wearing a blue t-shirt, he was holding his side and blood was oozing from his shirt.
35In his conclusions concerning count 3 Davidson ADCJ said:

[760] Whatever conclusion might be drawn as to the integrity of Det Sgt Thomas arising out of fresh evidence given at the section 12 hearing, the Crown's case on Count 3 depended upon the evidence of Mr Catt and independent support given to it by witnesses such as Mr Jeffrey, Mr McGuire and Dr Goddard. There is no suggestion of any undue interference by the police with any of these witnesses.

36This is significant because, on the account given by the Applicant of this event, Mr Catt simply fell over onto his side but did not sustain an injury. Yet three other persons saw such an injury within a very short period of time afterwards. Nor was the credibility of the Applicant assisted by the evidence of Ms Eslick, the motel proprietor of the motel where the Applicant had stayed the previous night. The Applicant said that Mr Catt followed her, uninvited, to Swans Crossing, and that corroborated the Applicant's account of having stayed alone at the motel. Ms Eslick gave evidence that the Applicant had attempted to persuade her to give evidence that the Applicant had stayed alone at the motel when Mr Catt had also stayed with the Applicant. 

37McClellan AJA at [184] and [186] expressly made reference both to Barry Catt's evidence and to the issue of Detective Thomas' involvement in the Swans Creek incident. McClellan concluded that Detective Thomas did not bring pressure to bear on witnesses, and that there was sufficient other evidence to justify the conviction and corroborate Barry Catt's evidence. 

38Davidson ADCJ's conclusions in relation to count 4 was this:

[784] The jury had the evidence of Mr Catt supported by the evidence of Mr French and other witnesses. The only fresh material at the section 12 hearing supports the case for the Crown. The evidence of the Catt children is now consistent with the jury's verdict which implicitly involved a finding that the evidence given by them at the trial was untrue and a product of pressure from Ms Catt. It was open to the jury to reject the suggestion of a self-inflicted wound. The verdict on this count has not been challenged by any evidence given at the section 12 hearing.

39In relation to this count both McClellan AJA at [191] and Smart AJ at [294] and [297] examined Detective Thomas' involvement and rejected the notion that his corrupting influence weakened the strength of the other evidence against the Applicant. They both also concluded that the other witnesses supported Barry Catt's account of the incident.

40Those findings of Davidson ADCJ and the Court of Criminal Appeal mean that the issues of Barry Catt's credibility, Detective Thomas' involvement in these counts and the alleged conspiracy between them fall within sub-paras (3)(a)(i) and (iii) of s 79. 

41The issue of Detective Thomas' involvement in all counts was also the basis of the petition to the Governor in 2007. That issue, therefore, also falls within sub-para (3)(a)(ii).

42The Applicant did not seek special leave to appeal to the High Court against these conclusions of the Court of Criminal Appeal.

43It is necessary to see if the further evidence now put forward causes a doubt or unease or disquiet to justify a referral under the section.

(1) Tracey Mairinger 

44On the material supplied by the Applicant it is difficult to discern what the nature of the evidence was that was given by Ms Mairinger at the Applicant's trial. The submissions from the Attorney-General say that her evidence was to the effect that she was retained by the Applicant to cook meals for the Catt household and she, therefore, regularly attended the Catt home to do so. At the time Barry Catt was living across the road in his office.

45The submissions went on to say that her evidence was focused on two matters. First, she was persuaded by the Applicant to carry a concealed tape recorder and to try to confuse Barry Catt so that he would make admissions regarding abuse of his children. Secondly, she gave evidence about the contents of, and access to, the fridge in the office (concerned with the allegation that the Applicant had poisoned Barry Catt by contaminating drinks in the fridge).

46In his report Davidson ADCJ, when dealing with the evidence of Mr Newell, said that Mr Newell's evidence to the effect that the Applicant had made statements consistent with the Crown's case before and during her marriage to Mr Catt was supported by the evidence of a number of other witnesses who included the person then described as Tracey Taylor. Nothing in the report of Davidson ADCJ nor in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal suggests that this evidence was related directly or indirectly to the two incidents concerned. Indeed, Ms Mairinger says in her present affidavit that although she recalled an incident where Barry Catt threw eucalyptus oil there was no suggestion at the time that the Applicant struck Barry Catt with a cricket bat. Further, Ms Mairinger said that she did not know about the allegation that the Applicant stabbed Barry Catt until the Applicant's trial. 

47In those circumstances, it is difficult to understand how any statement now by Ms Mairinger that she gave false evidence at the trial is relevant to a consideration of the outstanding convictions on counts 3 and 4. 

48The statement in paragraph 8 of her affidavit that she was involved with the Applicant on a daily basis does not sit easily with evidence she gave in cross-examination at the trial to the applicant's counsel that she worked 5 days per week from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm and on Friday and Saturday nights from 6.00 pm to 11.00 pm. Nor is it surprising (but not helpful to the Applicant here) that Ms Mairinger did not know about the matters in counts 3 and 4 until the trial in 1991 because she was living in Queensland at the time.

49Finally, a comparison of her 2007 affidavit and the present one does not assist the Applicant because it raises credibility issues about Ms Mairinger. The following matters are noted. First, the 2007 affidavit said that ""two detectives"" arrived at her house in 1989 in Queensland. She said ""I remember one detective was called PAGET"". There is no mention of Detective Thomas. In her present affidavit she asserts that ""two detectives, Peter Thomas and Carl Paget"" arrived. Given that the 2007 affidavit was lodged in support of a petition to the Governor concerned with Detective Thomas' behaviour generally in the matter, it is significant that there is no mention of him by name in that affidavit.

50Secondly, she said ""Parts of the evidence I gave at the trial were not truthful"" without specifying which parts. In her present affidavit she said, ""Much of the evidence I gave was untrue"" without specifying the evidence referred to. Even if it was untrue, it is doubtful that it could have any effect on the convictions for counts 3 and 4.

51Thirdly, in the 2007 affidavit there is nothing at all about the incidents that resulted in counts 3 and 4. The present affidavit contains the material in paragraph 9 (set out at [27] above). What she says now can only have been information told to her by other persons. She had no direct knowledge of either event.

(2) Jeannie Strachan

52McClellan AJA dealt at length with the evidence of Marie Whalen but introduced his consideration of her evidence by saying this:

[122] ...Although her evidence was important in relation to some collateral issues she did not give evidence about any matter central to any of the charges. Her evidence was primarily concerned with the veracity of allegations against Barry Catt of sexual abuse of his children and the preparation and content of a statement which suggests that the allegations may be true. The allegation made by the Crown was that the appellant had sought to fabricate evidence in support of the sexual assault allegations. The issue was obviously of critical significance to the appellant's credit.

53McClellan AJA then set out at length the assessment by Davidson ADCJ of evidence relating to Ms Whalen given both by her and a number of other witnesses. McClellan AJA then set out Davidson ADCJ's conclusions with respect to the evidence of Ms Whalen. These conclusions relevantly are:

There is fresh evidence to support the conclusion which I draw that the evidence of Ms Whalen is so unreliable that she is not to be regarded as a witness whose evidence I accept on contested matters.

If that fresh evidence had been before the jury in the trial of Roseanne Catt there is a reasonable possibility that the jury may have rejected Ms Whalen's evidence either in whole or substantial part.

Acceptance of the evidence of Ms Whalen in whole or substantial part by the jury at the trial of Roseanne Catt is likely to have had seriously adverse repercussions to the case presented on behalf of Ms Catt on all contested issues at her trial.

54McClellan AJA then said this:

[128] I also agree with his Honour's conclusion that the acceptance of Ms Whalen by the jury is likely to have ""had seriously adverse repercussions to the case presented on behalf of Ms Catt on all contested issues at her trial"". Given that the allegation of sexual abuse by Mr Catt of his children was a central issue with respect to the appellant's credit it could hardly be otherwise.

55Notwithstanding the lengthy survey by Davidson ADCJ of evidence relating to Ms Whalen and the conclusions to which he came that were accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal, it was not considered that the evidence was relevant to counts 3 and 4 which stood or fell on the basis of the evidence given in relation to them.

56To the extent, therefore, that the effect of Ms Strachan's evidence is now that Marie Whalen agreed in 1995 that she had given false evidence against the Applicant, that is a matter that has already been dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In relation to counts 3 and 4 it was not thought to have any effect on the result on those counts. 

57The evidence Ms Strachan gives is only evidence that impugns Barry Catt's and Marie Whalen's credibility. It does not concern the events giving rise to counts 3 and 4. The contention that Mr Catt was party to a conspiracy to give false evidence against the applicant was canvassed at the trial, during the Davidson inquiry and subsequently in the Court of Criminal Appeal after that inquiry. Notwithstanding the unreliability of Ms Whalen's evidence generally and what was accepted in relation to the conspiracy said to involve Mr Catt and Detective Thomas, the Court of Criminal Appeal did not consider that counts 3 and 4 were affected by those matters. Nothing in Ms Strachan's affidavit casts any doubt on that conclusion.

58It is also to be noted that the detail of the cricket bat story in Ms Strachan's affidavit differs from the case presented by the Crown and which the applicant says was false. That case was that the bat used had been left by John Pearson with Mr Catt for safekeeping. According to Mr Strachan, Barry Catt did not embrace that story. Rather, he claimed that Detective Thomas obtained a cricket bat from Mr Whalen and then concocted the story that the Applicant hit him.

59That account tends to underline the point that Ms Strachan's evidence in her recent affidavit tends only to undermine Mr Catt's credibility. That lack of credibility was taken into account by Davidson ADCJ and subsequently by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Ms Strachan's evidence does not tend in any other way to support the Applicant's account of the events of 5/6 May 1989 involving the cricket bat. Nor did they undermine the evidence of Jan O'Brien which was, as Smart AJ makes clear at [291] to [293] of R v Catt, important corroborative evidence of Mr Catt's account of the events.

(c) Errol Taylor

60The evidence Mr Taylor gave at the trial concerned matters that went to the credibility of Mr Catt and Detective Thomas. He did not give evidence of matters concerned with the events that gave rise to counts 3 and 4. It is to be noted that he was called by the defence. It can be reasonably inferred that he had no evidence to give about these matters. Indeed, what is now contained in his affidavit, particularly paragraphs 5 and 6, leads strongly to the conclusion that he had no such evidence to give. What is contained in paragraph 5 would be entirely inadmissible in relation to counts 3 and 4. Mr Taylor's expectation of what he might have been told is simply not relevant.

61His statement in paragraph 6 proves nothing. There is no reason to infer, whether or not Mr Taylor is a cricket enthusiast, that he would have noticed a cricket bat if there was one in the house. That is dependent on so many variables as to be of no weight at all.

62Further, his evidence at the trial tends to show how removed he was from the events that gave rise to count 4 which (it is to be remembered) occurred on 5/6 May 1989. Despite saying that he went to Barry Catt's workshop once or twice in the early part of 1989, which he then changed to ""maybe up to as many as half a dozen"", he added that, 

After he was arrested for this child molesting business, I avoided him.

Barry Catt was arrested in early February 1989. In those circumstances, Mr Taylor was scarcely in a position to make any point about his ability to make observations concerning a cricket bat. In any event, a failure to observe a cricket bat did not mean that the applicant did not have access to one.

Conclusion

63Both the conclusions of Davidson ADCJ and the Court of Criminal Appeal were to the effect that, despite what had been demonstrated about Detective Thomas there was no evidence to suggest that his wrongdoing affected the evidence given in relation to counts 3 and 4. Further, there was sufficient independent evidence of Barry Catt to justify the convictions in relation to these offences. To the extent that the Applicant's submissions rely on these matters I consider that these matters have been more than adequately dealt with by Davidson ADCJ and the Court of Criminal Appeal for the reasons given earlier. There is no basis for a further reconsideration pursuant to s 79(3) beyond what has been said above.

64The only aspect of the further material now put forward that might constitute evidence that relates to these counts is the evidence from Ms Strachan that in 1995 Barry Catt and Marie Whalen discussed how they had set up the Applicant in relation to these two counts. That single statement does not cause me to have a doubt nor a sense of disquiet or unease about the convictions on these counts. As mentioned earlier, this evidence of Ms Strachan is simply evidence that throws further doubt on the credibility of Barry Catt and Ms Whalen. Both Davidson ADCJ and the Court of Criminal Appeal were not prepared to accept their evidence unless otherwise supported by evidence which was accepted. This evidence from Ms Strachan does not advance matters in that regard for the Applicant.

65It is doubtful that the statements by Ms Whalen and Barry Catt that they had concocted the stories involving counts 3 and 4 in a manner adverse to the Applicant can be regarded as statements against interest in a manner that might possibly lead to the acceptance of those statements as true notwithstanding that both persons are both otherwise entirely unreliable witnesses. 

66Even if those statements could possibly be accepted as true, there is no evidence, either before the Davidson inquiry, or put forward as part of the present application that provides even a prima facie foundation that the evidence of the independent witnesses in respect of those counts was not true. Ms Strachan's statement does not even suggest that those independent witnesses perjured themselves or were somehow influenced by Detective Thomas, Barry Catt, Marie Whalen or any other person. The highest the matter can be put is that Detective Thomas took statements from them. 

67This issue of influence or pressure has been dealt with both by Davidson ADCJ and the Court of Criminal Appeal adversely to the Applicant. Nothing in present evidence put forward justifies a departure from the Court of Criminal Appeal's conclusions in that regard. 

68It is not enough to say, as the Applicant does, that the whole of the evidence of Barry Catt and Detective Thomas is fraudulent and that one cannot look at the six charges where the convictions were overturned and quashed separately from counts 3 and 4. The distinction between those two groups of offences has been carefully analysed in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the distinction between them remains. As noted, no application for special leave was brought to challenge this conclusion.

69I do not consider that there is any doubt or question as to the Applicant's guilt on counts 3 and 4.

70I would refuse the application.

		17 December 2014",2014-12-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704066,Amos v R [2014] NSWCCA 302,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  The applicant, Luke Edward Amos, appeals against his conviction for the murder of Richard Thurman in February 2009.  The Crown case was that the applicant murdered the deceased on the night of 14 February 2009 by shooting him eight times with a .22 calibre semi-automatic rifle. 
2The applicant, together with his co-accused, Christopher Andrew Wiggins, was indicted before Hall J on 6 March 2012.  Both men pleaded not guilty to murder.  Wiggins was also charged in the alternative with being an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased. 
3On 11 April 2012, following a 19-day trial before Hall J and a jury of 12, the applicant was found guilty of murder.  Wiggins was found not guilty of any of the charges laid against him.  The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 28 years, with a non-parole period of 21 years.  
4A third person, Peter Rafter, pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years, with a non-parole period of 9 years.  Rafter gave evidence in the Crown case at trial.  The applicant also gave evidence at the trial.  Wiggins did not. 
5The applicant raises two grounds of appeal:  first, that there has been a miscarriage of justice by way of him being tried jointly with his co-accused, and secondly, that the manner in which he was cross-examined by counsel for the co-accused at the trial gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.  Trial counsel for the applicant did not make an application for a separate trial, therefore leave is required to argue the first ground of appeal in accordance with r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW).  Neither ground is confined to a question of law, and so leave is required for both:  Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(b).
Factual background6The deceased was involved in dealing moderate amounts of cannabis from his home in Ambarvale, near Campbelltown.  In 2008, Peter Rafter began supplying cannabis to the deceased, making a profit of approximately $1000 per pound.  In late 2008, Rafter obtained a supply of cannabis on credit from his supplier, which he supplied to the deceased on the basis that he would accept payment once it was sold.  A dispute regarding payment then ensued, with the deceased refusing to pay Rafter.  At trial, Rafter gave evidence that this led to threats from his supplier over payments due.  
7In response to these threats, Rafter approached an associate about obtaining firearms as a means of protection, and was introduced to the applicant, who supplied him with two rifles without ammunition.  Rafter gave evidence that he later spoke to the applicant about the threats, and the money owed, and that the applicant agreed to assist him to obtain his money from the deceased in return for which the applicant would receive $2,000.  
8On the evening of 14 February 2009, the applicant and Wiggins met at Rafter's residence.  The three men drove to a paddock behind the deceased's house.  Rafter and the applicant got out of the car, the applicant armed with a loaded rifle, fitted with a silencer, and walked towards the house.  Rafter entered the premises and he and the deceased discussed the money owing.  During this conversation, Rafter said that the deceased stood up and swore, at which point Rafter looked over his shoulder and saw the applicant pointing the rifle at the deceased, and heard seven or eight loud shots.  He then looked back to see the deceased lying on the lounge.  
9Rafter ran from the premises immediately afterwards.  Later that evening, Rafter and the applicant were driven back to the house by Wiggins, where all three men removed various items, including drugs, computer equipment, two guitars and a bum bag containing cash.  They returned to the applicant's residence and split the money they had stolen, some $4,500, between them, and agreed that would also split the proceeds of the cannabis taken from the deceased's house.  
10On 2 February 2010, following a police investigation, the applicant was arrested for the murder of the deceased.  He was refused bail and has been in custody since that date.  
Proposed ground one11The first proposed ground of appeal is in these terms:  
""A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the appellant being tried jointly with the co-accused Christopher Wiggins.""
12Prior to the commencement of the trial, an application for a separate hearing was made by Wiggins, which was refused by the primary judge.  Legal representatives for the applicant did not make an application.  On appeal the applicant submitted that ""[a] separate trial application ought to have been made and ought to have been granted"" in respect of the applicant, and that there was ""a positive injustice caused to the appellant [sic] in there being a joint trial"".  
13The basis for these submissions was said to be that the ERISP of Wiggins, which was in evidence at the trial, ""very substantially implicated"" the applicant in the murder of the deceased, and corroborated the evidence of Rafter about the applicant's presence at the crime scene so as to make it impossible for the jury to put Wiggins' ERISP out of their mind when considering the case against the applicant.  
14With respect to the ""positive injustice"" contended for by the applicant, the Crown submitted that it was incumbent upon the applicant to establish that the ""positive injustice occurred by reason only of the applicant having stood trial jointly with the co-accused Wiggins"".
15In addressing this issue, the starting point is the presumption that where co-offenders are alleged to be engaged in a joint criminal enterprise, they should be tried jointly:  R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [199]-[212] and the authorities there cited. 
16In Webb & Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41, Toohey J, with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed, said at 88-89 (citations omitted):
""There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused.
In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice or, put another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused.
In the present case adequate directions were given by the trial judge. It is true that Webb did not give evidence and was therefore not subject to cross-examination, though the jury heard his statements to the police implicating Hay. But, as King CJ observed:
'That is a common feature of a joint trial and does not ofitself render separate trials necessary.'""
17Early in his summing up to the jury, the primary judge gave the jury the following direction:
""the electronically recorded interview that the police conducted with [Wiggins] ... was submitted in the proceedings between the Crown and Mr Wiggins, not in the case of the Crown against the accused Mr Amos.
...
The account of events that [Wiggins] provided to police in the electronically recorded interview is evidence in his trial alone and, accordingly, you would not have regard to, or place any weight upon anything that Mr Wiggins said in the course of that interview for the purpose of making factual findings on issues in the case of the crown against Mr Amos."" 
18Furthermore, his Honour also made plain that the interview: 
""[did] not have the same status of sworn evidence or evidence given on affirmation ... there is no cross-examination of those answers given by Mr Wiggins ... It doesn't mean it has not value of course but it does mean that it has not been tested as evidence.""
19The primary judge gave clear directions to the jury in relation to this issue, about which no complaint is made in this appeal.  In addition, there is a well-established line of authority that appellate courts administering criminal justice may make the assumption that jurors approach their task conscientiously:  Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237 at [26]; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 at [269]; Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at [9].
20Even so, it remains to be determined whether, even despite the careful directions given by the primary judge, the risk remained that, by reason of Wiggins' ERISP being admitted into evidence at the trial, it ""turned a potential acquittal to a conviction"":  Madbuko v R [2011] A Crim R 249 at [32].  
21The applicant submits that because Wiggins' ERISP ""very substantially implicated the appellant but was completely exculpatory insofar as the co-accused was concerned"" the positive injustice arose because:
""It would have been impossible for the jury, when considering the case against the co-accused, to put that record of interview out of their mind when considering the case against the appellant.  This is particularly the case given that the main evidence relied upon by the Crown against the appellant was that of ... Rafter, a person who himself was criminally involved in the events."" 
22In this respect, the applicant relied on the decision of this Court in R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190.  In that case, the Court found error on the part of the trial judge in rejecting an application by the appellant that his trial be held separately from that of his brother and an alleged third co-offender.  The only substantial evidence against the appellant was that of two witnesses, neither of whom was regarded as credible.  In addition, there was evidence admitted in the case against one of the co-offenders which was incriminatory of the appellant.  
23In his judgment, Adams J said (Spigelman CJ and Hulme J agreeing) in relation to the evidence admitted in relation to the co-offender (at [39]):
""If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to 'positive injustice'. Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried.""
24The decision in Pham may readily be distinguished from the present case given that it involved the correctness or otherwise of the primary judge rejecting an application for a separate trial.  In this case, the relevant application was not made on behalf of the applicant (see further below).  
25More tellingly, in finding error on the part of the primary judge in Pham, Hulme J noted (at [8]) (emphasis added):
""Whether or not the jury could have put out of its mind when considering the case against the Appellant the recorded interview, inadmissible against him, there was no practicable way they could have assessed the credibility or reliability of the evidence of the two witnesses differently in the case against the Appellant than they had or would have done in the case against his brother. Thus in effect, the interview must have intruded into the case against the Appellant when it was not admissible against him. In reaching this conclusion, I do not disregard the judge's directions to the jury nor the commonly accepted view, which I share, that juries can and generally do, adhere to the directions they are given. But I do not believe that the jury could, in this case, separately form 2 assessments of the reliability of each of the Crown's principal witnesses, one assessment using the evidence of the interview and the other, by ignoring it."" 
26In Pham, the Court was also satisfied that the decision of the jury in relation to the appellant could only be explained as having been reached because they had taken into account inadmissible evidence.  
27That is not the case in this appeal.  Both the lesser culpability of Wiggins and the greater culpability of the applicant, and the different verdicts that were reached by the jury, may be explained by the evidence properly admitted in the trial of each offender.  
28At this point, it should be noted that Wiggins, Rafter and the applicant provided significantly different versions of the events of 14 February 2009, as follows. 
29In his ERISP, Wiggins admitted to driving the applicant and Rafter to Ambarvale on the evening of the murder, and said that he then parked in the car park of a nearby hotel.  He said that later that evening he picked up Rafter and the applicant, returned the trailer to the applicant's residence and went home.  He maintained that he did not know anything about the murder of the deceased until he read about it in the paper some two or three months later.
30Rafter gave evidence to the effect that he was present at the deceased's home when the murder took place, that the applicant had shot the deceased, that he and the applicant had not discussed shooting the deceased beforehand, and that he ""just wanted the money back"".  Rafter also maintained that when they returned to the house after the murder, Wiggins was present, and carried one of the guitars out of the house. 
31It was the applicant's case at trial that he had agreed that Rafter could borrow his trailer, that he had organised for Wiggins to drive it on the night of the murder, but that he was not present when the deceased was shot.
32In this Court, the applicant submitted that on the basis of the jury having acquitted Wiggins of all charges, but at the same time finding the applicant guilty of murder, the jury must have rejected the evidence of Rafter in respect of Wiggins, yet accepted it in respect of the applicant.  Further, the applicant submitted that this outcome could not have been reached unless the jury had taken into account the information provided by Wiggins in his ERISP that implicated the applicant in the murder of the deceased. 
33I cannot agree with this submission.  First, the evidence provided by Wiggins in his ERISP as to the movements of the applicant on the evening of the murder extended only as far as driving him to the vicinity of the deceased's residence in Ambarvale.  Given that the evidence of Wiggins was that he had never been present at the deceased's residence the ERISP could only ever provide relatively low level of corroboration with the evidence of Rafter in respect of the applicant.  Additionally, and as noted by the Crown, there were also matters in Wiggins' ERISP which contradicted the evidence given by Rafter, including that he did not drive the applicant and Rafter to the deceased's residence, that he had never been to the residence, and that he did not, along with the other two men, return to the applicant's residence after the murder and divide the proceeds of the robbery. 
34Secondly, the evidence given by Wiggins in his recorded interview was far from the only evidence implicating the applicant in the murder of the deceased.  There were two other witnesses whose evidence at the trial was more compellingly consistent with that of Rafter than the ERISP of Wiggins.  The first was Ms Natalie Webb, who commenced a relationship with the applicant in March 2009.  She gave evidence that only a week or two later, she had a conversation with the applicant, in which he told her that in the company of Rafter, he had shot a man in the head in Rosemeadow (which is the adjacent suburb to Ambarvale) in connection with a drug deal.  Ms Webb also gave evidence that ""[the applicant] said that [Rafter] threw up on the lawn"".  This directly corroborated with evidence given by Rafter during his examination-in-chief:
""Q. By that do you mean [the applicant] had the rifle up to his shoulder aiming it?A. Yes.
Q. And was it pointed towards Richard, was it?A. Yes, it was. 
Q. At around about that time you said you heard something.  What did you hear?A. 7 loud bangs, 7 maybe 8.
...
Q. And did you look back towards Richard?A. Yes.
Q. What did you see?A. Richard curled over the lounge.
...
Q. When this occurred what was your reaction?A. Like I said, I just jumped up and I was out of there ... and then I seen [the applicant] coming and I just kept on running. 
...
Q. What was the effect on you?A. I was scared. I was shocked.  Basically really no words could describe how I felt. 
Q. In relation to your - physically, did you do anything?A. I vomited - I spewed. I vomited.""
35The second witness who also gave evidence corroborating the version of events given by Rafter was a neighbour of the applicant, Mr Travis Reid.  Mr Reid gave evidence to the effect that in October 2009 he received a telephone call from the applicant asking him to pick up some items that were ""over the fence"".  Later that day he found three rifles lying just over the fence in his backyard, which he kept under his bed until his house was searched by the police on 25 November 2009.  On that same day, the applicant contacted police and claimed that the guns belonged to him (the ERISP of the applicant in which he made this admission, also on 25 November 2009, was tendered at the trial).  Upon forensic examination, the cartridge cases of one of the rifles found by the police on Mr Reid's property matched those found at the scene of the murder.
36True it is that the credibility of Rafter, Ms Webb and Mr Reid was called into question by counsel for both of the co-accused at trial.  Additionally, in the case of Mr Reid, the Crown successfully sought a ruling under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that he was an unfavourable witness, on the basis that he had made a prior inconsistent statement.  However the possibility of collusion was never put to any of the witnesses, there was no evidence adduced of that having occurred, and the trial judge issued separate warnings in respect of the evidence of each of Rafter, Ms Webb and Mr Reid.  
37Finally, the Crown tendered evidence at the trial of various telephone intercepts which also corroborated the version of events given by Rafter.  One of these was a phone call between the applicant and Rafter in September 2009, in which, during his recorded interview, the applicant admitted they were discussing the murder of the deceased.  
38Having regard to all that evidence, I am of the view that the information provided by Wiggins in his ERISP as to the involvement of the applicant in the murder is of minimal significance when compared to the evidence that was admissible in the case against the applicant.  A separate trial would not have excised the evidence most damaging to the applicant:  Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 at [257].
39For these reasons, I am unable to conclude that any ""positive injustice"" resulted from the applicant being tried jointly with Wiggins.  The directions given by the trial judge addressed the risk that the jury considered the ERISP of Wiggins in the trial of the applicant.  In any event, I am unpersuaded that the circumstances of the joint trial, and the evidence given by Wiggins in relation to the applicant, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.
40This conclusion is confirmed by the failure of counsel to make an application at trial.  The applicant did not make any submissions as to the reason for the failure to make an application for a separate trial, merely submitting that a ""separate trial application ought to have been made and ought to have been granted"". 
41The Crown submitted that because no evidence or submissions were directed to this issue by the applicant, and it was not possible to contend that there was error on the part of the trial judge, it should be taken that it was a deliberate forensic decision.  The Crown said that if this was the case, then leave to appeal under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused.  
42In R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA, Ipp JA addressed this issue in relation to grounds of appeal based on purported errors by a trial judge in his directions to the jury (at [98]-[99]):
""The existence of r 4 and s 99 imposes a duty on counsel to inform the trial judge of all points that arise from the summing up that reasonably could give rise to an appeal. It will not lightly be assumed that this duty has been breached. Rather, unless there is good reason to hold the contrary, it will be inferred that decisions not to raise such matters with the trial judge are taken for sound forensic reasons. No more need be said than to repeat and emphasise the remarks of Gleeson CJ in R v Sanderson (unreported, NSWCCA 18 July 1994) that:
'It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.'
In the present case, the appellant was represented by experienced counsel and it is apparent from the transcript of the trial that he conducted the appellant's defence in a thorough and competent way. The appellant gave no explanation for the omission to raise the points now taken ... ""
43In his review of the authorities in R v Button; R v Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159; 129 A Crim R 342 at [32]-[35], Heydon JA cited the following passage of Mahoney JA in R v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported):
""Not infrequently this Court is asked to act under r 4 when the reason why the defect was not dealt with at the trial has not been established and where it is at least possible that there were tactical reasons why it was not. It is not easy for the court on appeal to satisfy itself that the reason why the matter was not raised was error rather than choice. In such circumstances, the court should be slow to act under r 4.""
44The transcript of the reasons for the trial judge refusing the application for a separate trial by Wiggins was not reproduced in the appeal books, however it may confidently be inferred, absent any evidence or submission to the contrary, that counsel for the applicant was present, or at least aware that the application had been made.  (The applicant's submissions state that the application was heard on 17 February 2012, in advance of the trial.)  Additionally, early in the trial, there was at least one occasion on which counsel for Wiggins raised the issue of the joint trial and requested that the trial judge provide directions to the jury regarding the need to assess each case separately.  The trial judge reiterated this in his summing up to the jury.
45In light of these circumstances, and in the absence of any explanation or evidence being provided by the applicant to establish the reason for not making an application at the appropriate time, I am not satisfied that leave should be granted to raise this proposed ground of appeal.  Accordingly I would refuse leave to rely on proposed ground one.  However, even if leave were granted pursuant to r 4, this ground would fail in any event.  
Proposed Ground Two46The second proposed ground of appeal is in the following terms:
""A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the appellant being cross-examined about character by counsel for the co-accused without the leave of the court and in circumstances where what was put to the appellant in cross-examination was incorrect.""
47At trial, the applicant was cross-examined by counsel for Wiggins, and the following exchange occurred:
""Q. And that the whole point of using him [Wiggins] on this plan that you and Rafter had hatched over the last couple of days was that you two were unlicensed blokes, with criminal records, known to the police in the local area, correct?A. Not correct.
Q. Unlike Chris Wiggins, who hasn't got a criminal record and isn't a trouble maker and has a registered car and a licence, correct?A. Incorrect. 
Q. Doesn't own firearms or sell them to other people or doesn't deal in cannabis or other drugs, correct?A. That's correct.""
48Counsel representing the applicant at trial did not object to these questions during the cross-examination, however shortly afterwards he sought to raise the matter with the primary judge in the absence of the jury.  After expressing concern that character evidence had been raised by opposing counsel without leave, he sought a discharge of the jury.  He added the following:
"" ... section 112 of the Evidence Act states that an accused person must not be cross-examined about matters arising out of character of a kind referred to in this part unless the court gives leave.
So I would have thought that it would have been a matter which Mr Watts would have raised with your Honour prior to raising issues of character in cross-examination about the accused.  And I certainly would have opposed any such application.""  
49It was confirmed by the Crown that the applicant did not have a criminal record.  The primary judge stated:
""The question is whether or not this matter can be effectively dealt with by way of perhaps not only a concession by counsel who has put something that's according to your information not correct, that is there is no criminal record, but that it could be adequately dealt with by me emphasising to the jury that the question put a proposition which was factually incorrect and that they should proceed upon the basis that the accused does have a criminal record when we know he does not.
...
it is factually wrong and prejudicial to imply that he has a criminal record in circumstances in which he does not.""
50In relation to the reference in the question that the applicant was ""known to police in the local area"", his Honour went on to say:
"" ... that is also a prejudicial statement in the question and I'm not sure that there's any evidence in this trial to support that proposition either.""
51After the Crown and counsel for Wiggins accepted that the question was factually incorrect, and that counsel for Wiggins said that he wished to ""withdraw absolutely the suggestion that [the applicant] had a criminal record or [was] otherwise known to police"" the primary judge indicated that he did not propose to discharge the jury.  When the jury returned to the courtroom and cross-examination of the applicant resumed, counsel for the co-accused continued:
""Q. Mr Amos, you recall prior to the most recent adjournment I put to you that you had a criminal record and that you were known to the local police, and you denied that, do you recall that question and answer?A. Yes.
Q. I wish to state categorically now that I was wrong and I acknowledge that you do not have a criminal record and were not known to the police and I withdraw that question and proposition generally.""
52The primary judge then gave the following direction to the jury:
""On the matter Mr Watts has just raised with you ... the Crown accepts that the accused Mr Amos does not have a record of criminal convictions as the question that was put, and you have heard it stated by Mr Watts that he withdraws any suggestion that Mr Amos was known to local police.
It's important that we get these things right ... and that's why Mr Watts has properly withdrawn any suggestion and reference or statement made by him which would suggest to the contrary, so it's simply a matter of essential fairness ... ""
53All of this happened over a short period of time.  The questions about the applicant's criminal record and being known to local police were asked at transcript p 687.  The jury left the Court at p 689.  They returned and the true position was explained to them at p 700.
54On appeal it was submitted by the applicant that notwithstanding the fact that the error was almost immediately rectified, ""[n]othing could be done"" to cure the prejudicial effect of the questions, and the jury ought to have been discharged.  The applicant again noted that the cross-examination of the applicant as to his character without leave was impermissible, pursuant to ss 104 and 112 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  The applicant conceded that he had raised matters in his own evidence in chief that could have been ""deemed evidence of his bad character"".  However it was argued that this fact, in itself, meant that the error made in cross-examination by counsel for the co-accused was more damaging than it would otherwise have been.  
55In Crofts v R (1996) 186 CLR 427, Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated (at 440-441):
""No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript.
Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable?""
56There is nothing complex about what occurred between pages 687 and 700 of the transcript of day 16 of the trial.  The jury was told, shortly after a mistake had been made, that counsel for Wiggins had been mistaken and that the applicant had no criminal record and was not known to local police.  The barrister who made the mistake withdrew the questions and propositions in the presence of the jury, and the primary judge lent his authority to support the correction.  There is no reason to doubt that the jury understood what they were told.  As Hoeben CJ at CL said in Dia v R [2014] NSWCCA 9 (at [50]):
""The assumption that jurors understand and comply with directions of the trial judge has been emphasised on numerous occasions by this and other superior courts:  R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 at 603.""
57In my view, the way in which his Honour dealt with the problem was appropriate.  What occurred was regrettable, but the error was momentary, accidental and quickly rectified.  It did not give rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  Although there should be a grant of leave, this ground should be dismissed.  
58Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
1. In relation to ground one, the application for leave to appeal is refused. 2. In relation to ground two, grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.
59ADAMS J:  I agree with Leeming JA.
60BELLEW J:  I agree with Leeming JA.

		12 December 2014",2014-12-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704068,Beckett v R [2014] NSWCCA 305,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
The applicant was committed for trial on indictment in the District Court on the charge of perverting the course of justice pursuant to the Crimes Act 1900, s 319, or in the alternative with making false statement under oath pursuant to the Crimes Act, s 330. By notice of motion, the applicant sought that the indictment be quashed and that there be a permanent stay of the prosecution as an abuse of process. Sweeney DCJ dismissed the notice of motion. The applicant sought leave to appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F. 
The conduct the subject of the charges occurred during the course of a compelled interview of the applicant by investigators from the Office of State Revenue (OSR), pursuant to the Taxation Administration Act 1996, s 72. During the interview, the applicant provided copies of two cheques on which the issue dates had been altered, and knowingly made a false statement to the investigators. The applicant was charged by the OSR with various offences under the Taxation Administration Act. However, the prosecution was taken over by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who filed an indictment containing the two alternative charges under the Crimes Act. 
On appeal from Sweeney DCJ's judgment dismissing the notice of motion, five issues arose for determination. 
(1) Whether the proceedings were commenced and maintained mala fides;
(2) Whether the representations made by the applicant were made in ""the course of justice"" within the meaning of s 319; 
(3) Whether the Taxation Administration Act, s 72, abrogated the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination; 
(4) Whether the information obtained in the compelled interview could be used, including by way of evidence in criminal proceedings in proof of an offence under the Crimes Act;
(5) Whether the answers given by the applicant in the compelled interview were admissible as admissions pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995, s 90;
The Court allowed the appeal and ordered that count 1 on the indictment be permanently stayed. 
Issue (1): Mala fides
1. There is no requirement, under s 71 or otherwise, that evidence given or information obtained pursuant to a compulsory examination under s 72 be used only for the purposes of a prosecution under a taxation law: [52].
2. There was no abuse of process in the manner in which the interview was conducted. The applicant was not deceived or tricked into believing that she was not in any way liable to be exposed to other aspects of the criminal law by the OSR investigators: [53]-[54].
3. An inadvertent misstatement by an investigating officer to a witness is not, for that reason alone, improper for the purpose of the Evidence Act, s 138: [69]. 
Ridgeway v The Queen [1995] HCA 66; 184 CLR 19; Gedeon v R [2013] NSWCCA 257; 280 FLR 275; Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; 83 ALJR 494; R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82
Issue (2): ""Course of justice""
4. A ""course of justice"" for the purposes of the Crimes Act, s 319, does not commence until the jurisdiction of a court or competent judicial tribunal is invoked. 
R v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; 174 CLR 268; R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31; The Queen v OM [2011] NSWCCA 109; 212 A Crim R 293 (disapproved)
5. As the conduct engaged in by the applicant, if proved, occurred prior to the invocation of the jurisdiction of a court or competent judicial tribunal, it was incapable of constituting an offence under the Crimes Act, s 319. Count 1 of the indictment must accordingly be permanently stayed. 
Issue (3): Abrogation of the right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination
6. The privilege against self-incrimination is impliedly abrogated by the Taxation Administration Act, s 72. This follows from the general terms used to express the requirement to attend and answer questions, and the provision made in ss 82, 84 and 85 for disclosure to a wide range of persons and entities: [142]-[144]. Sorby v Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10, 152 CLR 281; R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42; A v Boulton [2004] FCAFC 101; 136 FCR 420 
Issue (4): Permissible use of information obtained in the compelled interview 
7. The disclosure of the information obtained in the compelled interview to the Crown Solicitor was permitted under the Legal Profession Act 2004, s 110(1)(e). The Crown Solicitor was acting as the agent of the OSR: [164]. 
 Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60; 158 CLR 500. 
8. The disclosure of the information obtained in the compelled interview to the Crown Solicitor was permitted under the Taxation Administration Act, s 82(d), being a disclosure made in accordance with the requirement imposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, s 17. 
Issue (5): Admissions
9. The false statements provided by the applicant were not ""admissions"" within the meaning of the Evidence Act, s 90. They were not ""representations"", but rather are the subject matter of the charges on the indictment. 
R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426, 104 A Crim R 306 (distinguished); R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442; 105 A Crim R 27 (distinguished).




			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  The applicant has been committed for trial on indictment in the District Court on the charge of perverting the course of justice pursuant to the Crimes Act 1900, s 319 (the offence).  She has also been charged, in the alternative, with the offence of making false statements under oath pursuant to the Crimes Act, s 330 (the alternative offence). 
2The conduct alleged to constitute the offence under s 319 occurred on 28 September 2010, when during the course of a tax investigation undertaken by the Office of State Revenue (OSR), the applicant provided to officers of the OSR copies of two cheques bearing the issue date of 26 September 2009, which were in fact issued on 27 September 2010, and knowingly made false statements to officers of the OSR.  The conduct alleged to constitute the alternative offence was the making of a false statement on 28 September 2010 relating to the two bank cheques. 
3By notice of motion dated 4 December 2013, the applicant sought orders that the indictment be quashed;  for a permanent stay of the prosecution as an abuse of process;  that the record of an interview conducted with her by officers of the OSR and a file note made by one of those officers be ruled inadmissible;  and that all records obtained by the OSR as a result of its taxation investigation into the practice of the applicant be ruled inadmissible.
4On 13 December 2013, Sweeney DCJ dismissed the notice of motion.  
Issues on the appeal
5The applicant seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F from the dismissal of the notice of motion.  The application for leave to appeal and the appeal have been heard concurrently.  The proposed appeal raised 15 grounds.  Ground 1 was a catchall ground that her Honour erred in not quashing the indictment or permanently staying the proceedings.  It does not require separate consideration.  Ground 2 was abandoned by the applicant in the course of oral argument.  The issues (defined broadly) raised by the remaining grounds were as follows: 
(1) Whether the proceedings were commenced and maintained mala fides:  grounds 4, 12, and 14.
(2) Whether the representations made by the applicant were made in ""the course of justice"" within the meaning of s 319:  grounds 3 and 13.
(3) Whether the Taxation Administration Act 1996, s 72 abrogated the right to silence and the right against self-incrimination:  ground 5.
(4) Whether the information obtained by compulsion pursuant to the Taxation Administration Act by the officers of OSR could be used, including by way of evidence in the criminal proceedings, by the prosecuting authority, in proof of an offence under the Crimes Act, s 319:  grounds 6, 7, 8 and 9.
(5) Whether the answers given by the applicant in the compelled interview of 28 September 2010 were admissible as admissions:  ground 10.
Background
6The applicant is a solicitor.  She was authorised by the OSR to use a scheme called Electronic Duties Returns (the EDR scheme) established under the Taxation Administration Act, s 37.  The scheme allows approved persons to assess duties electronically and to pay duty by periodic remittance.  Under the scheme, the applicant was approved to stamp transfers of real property using accountable stamps issued by the OSR.  The Directions for the EDR scheme published by the OSR in April 2007 included the following: 
""Settlement Policy
An approved person must have the duty payable available to them prior to processing transactions online. This is the case for all EDR transactions except those where the duty payable will be collected at settlement.""
7In July 2009, the applicant wrote to the OSR seeking that a transfer of a unit in Darling Point dated 1 December 2005 from a family trust to a beneficiary, Mr Lopresti, be stamped as requiring only nominal duty because it fell within the exemption in the Duties Act 1997, s 55(1)(b).  Mr Lopresti had been occupying the property as his principal place of residence.  In March 2010, the applicant was informed that the transfer did not qualify and that it was liable to ad valorem duty.
8On 11 June 2010, the applicant, utilising the EDR scheme, raised an online notice of assessment of duty payable for the property.  The assessment thus raised was for duty in the sum of $29,240 plus penalty interest of $17,416 calculated from the date of the transfer.  The applicant stamped the transfer.  
9The duty and interest, totalling $46,656.29, payable to the OSR by 17 June 2010, was not paid.  By letter dated 25 August 2010, received by the applicant on 10 September 2010, the OSR informed the applicant that her firm's approval to use the EDR scheme had been suspended as of 28 August 2010 due to the failure of her firm to make payment for the transaction processed on 11 June 2010.  The letter advised that interest was accruing on the amount outstanding and requested that payment be arranged within 14 days of the date of the letter.  The letter also stated that the applicant's reinstatement as an EDR-approved user would only be considered once the outstanding payment had been made and once written confirmation that she would meet all conditions as an EDR-approved user in the future was provided.  
10Subsequently, by letter dated 17 September 2010, the applicant was informed that a ""taxation investigation ('audit')"" was to be undertaken of her practice under the Taxation Administration Act and the Duties Act.  The letter advised that should any breaches of those Acts be found, prosecution action may be considered by the OSR.  The letter was signed by Paul Reid, a Senior Investigator at the OSR.
11On 21 September 2010, the applicant had a phone conversation with David Morse, a Senior Prosecutions Officer at the OSR.  Mr Morse's file note of that conversation recorded that the applicant stated that the bank had lost the two cheques she had drawn for payment of the stamp duty assessed on the transfer of the Darling Point unit.  Mr Morse requested that the applicant attend an interview on 28 September 2010 at the OSR office in Parramatta.
12Also on 21 September 2010, Mr Reid issued notices under the Taxation Administration Act, s 72 requiring the applicant to attend and give evidence on 28 September 2010 and to produce her files in relation to the transfer of the Darling Point unit.  The notice included the following statement:  
""The purpose of the examination is to determine if there have been any breaches pursuant to the Duties Act, 1997 and Taxation Administration Act, 1996.""  
13A notice to produce documents was issued on the same day, pursuant to the Taxation Administration Act, s 72.  That notice stated that:
""Failure to comply with this Notice is an offence under Section 72 of the Act and may make you liable to a penalty of up to 100 penalty units ($11,000).""  
14The interview on 28 September (the compelled interview) was conducted by Mr Reid and Mr Morse.  At the commencement of the interview, the applicant was informed of the procedures relating to the interview and was given certain warnings.  The terms of the advice and warnings are of particular relevance to the issues raised on the application.  Relevantly, the applicant was advised that ""any information or documentation obtained from this interview may be referred to the Crown Solicitor"".  She confirmed that there had been no threat, promise or inducement to take part in the interview apart from the serving of the s 72 notice.  The applicant also agreed that she had been provided with a copy of the Taxation Administration Act, ss 55, 56, 67, 68 and 72, and that she had read those sections and understood them.  Mr Reid then stated: 
""Mr Reid:  For the record, I advise you it's an offence to make a statement to a taxation officer knowing that the statement or information is false or misleading in a material particular. Do you understand?Ms Beckett:  Yes.
Mr Reid:  It is also an offence to refuse or fail, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the requirement to answer questions relevant to an investigation. You will now be cautioned:
You do not have to say or do anything that may tend to incriminate you, but anything you say or do may be used in evidence. Do you understand?""  
15The applicant produced the file for the transfer of the Darling Point property which contained photocopies of two bank cheques in favour of the OSR bearing the date 26 September 2009.  During the course of the compelled interview, the applicant acknowledged the liability for stamp duty and penalty interest in respect of the transfer of the Darling Point property.  She informed the OSR officers that she would arrange for a bank cheque in the sum of $27,240 to be couriered to the OSR the following day and that she would arrange for payment of $10,000 in part payment of the interest owing by forwarding a cheque drawn on her trust account the next afternoon or the following morning. 
16The essential allegation against the applicant upon which the charges are based is that the year date on the two cheques she contended had been drawn for payment of stamp duty had been altered from 2010 to 2009, so that by production of the photocopies of the cheques and in statements made to Mr Reid and Mr Morse, the applicant represented, contrary to the fact, that the cheques were available to her to pay the stamp duty payable on the property before she stamped the transfer document for that property.  This representation was of fundamental importance, because if the cheques were not available to pay the stamp duty prior to stamping the transfer, she would have been in breach of the EDR system.
17A notice was also served on Mr Lopresti pursuant to the Taxation Administration Act, s 72.  On 12 October 2010, Mr Reid and Mr Morse interviewed Mr Lopresti.  Prior to interview, Mr Lopresti was served with the same sections of that Act as the applicant. 
The indictment
18The matter was referred to the Crown Solicitor for advice and the applicant was subsequently charged on indictment with an offence under the Crimes Act, s 319, for producing the copies of the two cheques on which the date had been falsified, and for making false statements.  The indictment was laid by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The terms of the indictment were as follows: 
""On 29 May 2013, the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of Her Majesty charges that
BARBARA MARIA MARTHA BECKETT
1. On 28 September 2010, at Parramatta, in the State of New South Wales, did an act, namely, provided copies of two bank cheques purportedly issued on 26 September 2009 which were in fact issued on 27 September 2010, and made false statements which she knew to be false during an interview with investigators from the Office of State Revenue, thereby intending to pervert the course of justice.

The Taxation Administration Act 1996
20The long title to the Taxation Administration Act is ""[a]n Act to make general provision with respect to the administration and enforcement of the other taxation laws"".  ""Taxation laws"" are those specified in s 4 and include, relevantly, the Duties Act.  The Duties Act provides for the imposition of tax on various transactions, including on the transfer of land.  
21The Taxation Administration Act, s 7 states the purpose of the Act and its relationship with the other taxation laws.  It provides: 
""7 Purpose of Act and relationship with other taxation laws
(1) The purpose of this Act is to make general provision with respect to the administration and enforcement of the other taxation laws.
(2) The other taxation laws include provisions with respect to:(a) the imposition of tax and its payment, and(b) exceptions to and exemptions from liability to the tax, and(c) entitlements to refunds.""
22Sections 41, 42, 55, 56, 71, 72 and 125 of the Taxation Administration Act as at December 2011, being the date when the applicant was charged under ss 41, 42 and 55 of the Act provide, relevantly, as follows:
""41 Effect of approval

the conditions of the approval are binding on the agent and the taxpayer and the agent and the taxpayer are each guilty of an offence if any of the conditions is contravened in relation to that tax liability.
Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.
(3) However, if the provisions of a taxation law from which a taxpayer is exempted by an approval under this Division are complied with in relation to a tax liability, subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to the taxpayer or an agent of the taxpayer in relation to that tax liability.

(1) If:(a) an approval under this Division provides for an exemption from a requirement for the stamping of an instrument, and(b) the instrument is endorsed in accordance with the conditions of the approval,
the instrument is taken to be duly stamped but without affecting liability for the payment of tax in relation to the instrument under the relevant taxation law.
(2) A person who endorses an instrument otherwise than under and in accordance with an approval under this Division so as to suggest or imply that the instrument is properly so endorsed and as a result is taken to be duly stamped is guilty of an offence.

(4) If proceedings for an offence against a taxation law are taken before the Supreme Court, the Court may impose a penalty not exceeding the maximum penalty provided by the taxation law for the offence.""
23Reference should also be made to ss 67 and 68, copies of which the officers had provided to the applicant prior to the interview.  Those provisions provide for the delegation of the Chief Commissioner's powers and functions and for the appointment of authorised officers. 
Mala fides:  grounds 4, 12 and 14
24The applicant's challenge to the trial judge's finding that the proceedings were not affected by mala fides was brought on three bases.  The first was a general allegation of mala fides:  ground 4.  The second basis was that the trial judge erred in finding that ""the taxation investigator, Mr Reid, was 'mistaken in his recollection' when he put falsehoods in an interview with Mr Lopresti"":  ground 12.  The third basis was that her Honour erred in finding that the taxation investigators, Mr Reid and Mr Morse, did not have an intention to trick, deceive or mislead the applicant of what the applicant would expose herself to if she told untruths in the compelled interview of 28 September 2010:  ground 14.  Grounds 4 and 14 are conveniently dealt with together. 
First and third bases:  that the trial judge erred in finding that:  (a) the proceedings had not been commenced or maintained mala fides:  ground 4;  and (b) that the OSR officers did not have an intention to trick, deceive or mislead the applicant:  ground 14
25The first basis upon which the applicant alleged mala fides raises the question whether the prosecution brought against the applicant under the Crimes Act is an abuse of process in circumstances where the conduct alleged to constitute the offence under s 319, or alternatively under s 330, occurred during the course of a compelled interview under the Taxation Administration Act and in the absence of any warning other than in respect of offences under that Act.
26Sweeney DCJ rejected the applicant's contention that the Crown case was affected by mala fides.  The primary judge found that the compelled interview was conducted in accordance with s 71 of the Taxation Administration Act, only for the purposes of a taxation law, and in accordance with s 72, after notices under s 72 had been regularly issued.
27Her Honour also held that the earlier telephone conversation with Mr Morse on 21 September was not a compelled statement and that there was no impropriety in it.  In particular, her Honour held that it was not necessary that a caution be given to the applicant in that conversation as at that stage the investigation was in its early and exploratory stages.
28Her Honour found that:
""There is no evidence of any concealment, deliberate or otherwise, by the investigators of their intention during the interview to prosecute Ms Beckett for offences under the Crimes Act, as is asserted by the accused. There is no evidence that they had such an intention at that time. In fact the evidence is to the contrary.""
29After reviewing the evidence of Mr Morse, which her Honour accepted, she found that:
""... his contemplation of possible Crimes Act offences as distinct from possible breaches of the Taxation Administration Act provisions occurred after Ms Beckett's interview. There is not demonstrated any deception, trick or mala fides by Officers Reid and Morse in their conduct of the interview with Ms Beckett.""
30Her Honour found that the giving of a warning about the Taxation Administration Act, s 55 at the start of the applicant's interview did not constitute a representation that only that section would be resorted to in relation to the prosecution of false statements.  Sweeney DCJ found, after seeing both Mr Morse and Mr Reid give evidence and be cross-examined, that she could not discern:
""... [any] intention by them to trick, trap, deceive or mislead Ms Beckett in that way, or any intention to hold out the representation which is contended for by their reference to s 55.""
31Her Honour held that there was ""no evidence of mala fides or improper purpose by the tax officers of the Crown"".
32The essential challenge to her Honour's finding that the proceedings were not brought and maintained mala fides was that the OSR only had the power to investigate and prosecute breaches of taxation law.  The applicant contended that this limitation was to be found in the express terms of s 71 and s 72 of the Taxation Administration Act.  The applicant also relied upon the terms of s 7, which states the purpose of the Act.  The full terms of these provisions are set out above at [21] ff.  
33Sections 71 and 72 are contained in Pt 9 of the Act, entitled ""Tax officers, investigation and secrecy provisions"".  Div 2 of Pt 9 deals with ""Investigation"".  Section 71 provides that a function conferred under the division may be exercised only for the purposes of a taxation law.  Section 72 specifies the powers of the Chief Commissioner to require a person to provide information, including by the production of documents and by compelling persons to attend and give evidence on oath.  The applicant relied on s 72(2) in particular, which provides that if the requirement to provide information, attend and give evidence or to produce documents is to ""determine that person's tax liability"", that must be stated in the notice.  
34This submission, insofar as it was based on s 72(2), was directed, presumably, to the fact that in this case the applicant had no liability to pay duty on the Darling Point transfer.  Her obligation was to ensure payment of duty on that transfer if she processed it through the EDR scheme.  However, the submission misstates the effect of s 72 in general and s 72(2) in particular.  Section 72(2) imposes a requirement for a person to be notified in a notice given under the section, if they are being investigated in respect of their own taxation liability.  Section 72 does not in terms or by implication limit the OSR's investigative powers to a person's own tax liability.  
35However, the applicant's wider submission remains, namely that the powers of investigation under the Taxation Administration Act may only be used in relation to a taxation law.  On this submission, the OSR officers had no power to lay charges for an offence under some other law, so that the laying of charges against the applicant under the Crimes Act was not authorised.  The applicant pointed out that if the officers were investigating an offence under the Crimes Act, they had no power to compel her to attend and answer questions and produce documents under threat of punishment.  The applicant contended that the OSR officers had exceeded their powers by conducting a general investigation.  
36The applicant submitted that the legislature had made a clear policy determination to confine the prosecutorial function of authorised officers exercising coercive disclosure powers to breaches of the Taxation Administration Act, s 72(8) if disclosure was not made.  This was to be contrasted with the investigation of offences under the Crimes Act, where there was no power to compel a person to attend and answer questions or produce documents.  
37The applicant also pointed out that the legislature had differentiated in respect of the type of prosecution that may be brought.  An offence under a taxation law may be dealt with summarily in the Local Court or in the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction:  s 125(1).  The maximum penalty was 100 penalty points or the maximum penalty provided by the taxation law, whichever was the lower.  Pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the monetary equivalent of 100 penalty points is $11,000.  By contrast, the offence under s 319 with which the applicant is charged is an indictable offence and carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  The alternative charge under s 330 carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. 
38The applicant further submitted that it was apparent from the conduct of the authorised officers, in providing to her copies of sections of the Taxation Administration Act at the commencement of the record of interview, that they knew the limitations of their power.  At no time was the applicant provided with copies of the Crimes Act or warned that charges might be laid under the Crimes Act.  Likewise, the manner in which the interview was conducted, including the warning she was given that it was an offence to make a statement to a taxation officer knowing that the statement or information is false or misleading in a material particular, indicated that the OSR officers were proceeding only under the Taxation Administration Act.  In this regard, the applicant challenged Sweeney DCJ's finding, at 16, that the investigators did not conceal an intention to prosecute the applicant for offences under the Crimes Act:  see [28] above.  
39The applicant contended that the warning she was given (being the first of the warnings reproduced at [14] above), which reflected the language of s 55, was a warning that a breach of that section was an offence. It was not a warning in respect of any other offence and in particular was not a warning in relation to an offence under the Crimes Act, s 319.  The applicant submitted that the clear intention of the investigators in only giving her this warning was that if the applicant told any material untruth, she may expose herself to sanction under the Taxation Administration Act, s 55.  The applicant submitted that in preferring the counts on the indictment, instead of proceeding under s 55, the Crown has acted with 'mala fides'.  
40The applicant submitted, alternatively, that the investigators' intention in confining the warning to s 55 was to trick, deceive or mislead her into an understanding that any action against her would be under the Taxation Administration Act.  She contended that the investigators obtained an advantage in doing so because the applicant did not exercise her fundamental right to silence and/or against self-incrimination in answering the questions asked and in providing the material from her file.  More particularly, the applicant submitted that as she was questioned under compulsion, she had no right to silence and no privilege against incrimination.  Accordingly, the applicant challenges the primary judge's finding that the taxation investigators did not have an intention to trick, deceive or mislead the applicant as to what the applicant would expose herself to if she told untruths in the compelled taxation audit interview of 28 September 2010.
41The applicant further submitted that it was apparent from the transcript of the compelled interview that the focus of the OSR was on recovering the duty and penalty interest payable in respect of the transfer of the Darling Point property and that there was no attempt to conduct a general 'audit'.  The applicant referred to portions of the transcript of the interview which were directed to ascertaining from the applicant how and when she was going to attend to payment of the duty and interest owing on the transfer and in advising her that the OSR could look to her for indemnity if the monies were not otherwise forthcoming.
42The Crown submitted that the critical aspect of this case is that the offence under s 319 was committed during the interview conducted on 28 September, after the applicant was cautioned that she did not have to say anything that may tend to incriminate her but that anything she said may be used in evidence against her.  The Crown accepted that the purpose of the interview was to investigate the possible breach of the applicant's obligations under the EDR scheme, the Duties Act and/or the Taxation Administration Act.  The Crown submitted, however, that during the course of the interview, the applicant made the allegedly false statements and produced the photocopies of the cheques which, if proved, involved a criminal act of a different complexion.  The Crown also submitted that there is no evidentiary foundation for the applicant's submission that the investigator, in the manner in which they conducted themselves, exercised ""general investigative powers"".
43The Crown submitted that the decision whether to prosecute and on what basis was a matter solely within the prosecutor's discretion:  Magaming v R [2013] HCA 40; 87 ALJR 1060 at [20];  Elias v R [2013] HCA 31; 248 CLR 483 at [34]-[35], and that there was nothing that precluded the OSR from prosecuting the applicant for the offence for which she has been charged. 
44The Crown also submitted that the evidence did not support the applicant's contention that the OSR 'only' wanted to recover the outstanding duty and interest.  The Crown referred to the terms of the letter of 17 September 2010 and the s 72 notice, neither of which were confined to the Darling Point transfer but encompassed ""stamp duty transactions and dealings"" and ""possible breaches"" of the Duties Act and the Taxation Administration Act.  The Crown also referred to Mr Morse's questioning of the applicant, in which he stated:
""Today I'll be asking you questions in respect of a conveyancing transaction between DLC Investments Pty Limited, the vendor, and Pasquale Lopresti, the purchaser, in respect of the property at ... Darling Point ... plus I'll be asking you questions about your firm, being an electronic duties return client for the Office of State Revenue ...""
Consideration 
45It is appropriate in the first instance to consider the circumstances in which the court will permanently stay a prosecution.  
46The Court will only order a permanent stay of proceedings in an exceptional case.  In Jago v District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23, Mason CJ stated, at [34]:
""To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences' ..."" (citation omitted)
See also Gaudron J at [75]-[76].
47As I observed in Calleija v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 37; 223 A Crim R 391 at [29], Mason CJ considered that underlying the power of the court to grant a permanent stay was the court's inherent jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of its processes.
48The power of a court to grant a permanent stay was again considered by the High Court in Moti v The Queen [2011] HCA 50; 245 CLR 456 where French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ, identified three considerations necessary to have regard to before making a decision as to an abuse of process.  Only the third is of present relevance.  In that respect, their Honours observed, at [57]:
""The third basic proposition is that, as pointed out in the joint reasons of four members of this Court in Williams v Spautz, two fundamental policy considerations affect abuse of process in criminal proceedings. First, 'the public interest in the administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring that its processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike'. Secondly, 'unless the court protects its ability so to function in that way, its failure will lead to an erosion of public confidence by reason of concern that the court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice'. Public confidence in this context refers to the trust reposed constitutionally in the courts to protect the integrity and fairness of their processes. The concept of abuse of process extends to a use of the courts' processes in a way that is inconsistent with those fundamental requirements.""  (citations omitted)
See also R v R.W.O. [2002] NSWCCA 133 at [62]-[63];  Calleija at [28] ff. 
49In the present case, it was contended that the officers of the OSR may only exercise their functions for the purpose for which they were conferred, namely, for the purposes of a taxation law:  see Taxation Administration Act, s 71.  It followed on this submission that where information was obtained during the course of the exercise of the powers conferred by s 72, the only prosecution that could be brought as a result of information so obtained was a prosecution under a taxation Act. 
50This submission raises two issues.  First, what is the operation and effect of s 71?  And secondly, when a person engages in conduct during the course of an investigation under the Taxation Administration Act that not only constitutes a breach of a taxation Act but also a breach of some other Act, including the Crimes Act, do the provisions of the Taxation Administration Act constrain the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion such that any prosecution is confined to a breach of that Act or another taxation Act? 
51Section 71 is clear in its terms.  It provides that a function under Pt 9, Div 2 may only be exercised for the purposes of a taxation law.  One of the powers that the Chief Commissioner, by his authorised officers, has under Div 2 is the power to require a person to attend and give evidence.  That power, in accordance with s 71, may only be exercised for the purposes of a taxation law.  The notice issued to the applicant stated that the purpose of the examination was to determine if there had been any breach of the Duties Act and the Taxation Administration Act.  Accordingly, the requirement for the applicant to attend to give evidence was exercised for the purposes of a taxation law. 
52The question then arises whether any evidence given or information produced pursuant to a requirement to do so under s 72, can only be used for the purposes of a prosecution under a taxation law.  In my opinion, a prosecution is not so confined.  Section 71 relates to the exercise of a function under the Division.  The Commissioner has, as a function under s 72, the power to require a person to do certain things.  There is nothing in the wording of s 71, nor in the powers conferred by s 72, that prescribes or delimits what may be done with information that is obtained during the course of or as a result of the exercise of such powers.  Accordingly, I would reject ground 4.  
53The applicant also contended that there was an abuse of process in the manner in which the interview was conducted.  In my opinion, that contention should also be rejected.  Although prior to the interview the applicant's attention was only drawn to the provisions of the Taxation Administration Act, she was told, prior to any reference to the provisions of that Act, that any information or documentation obtained from the interview may be referred to the Crown solicitor.  The applicant was then warned in the terms of both s 55 and s 72 of the Act.  The applicant was also advised in terms that preserved her right against self-incrimination.  
54The applicant complains, however, that she was led to believe that her interview was only in relation to taxation matters and that she was not in any way liable to be exposed to other aspects of the criminal law.  She alleged that this was a deliberate trick or deceit by the OSR officers.  I do not agree.  The officers gave evidence before the trial judge to the contrary of this assertion and that evidence was accepted by her Honour.
55I would reject this ground of appeal.
Second basis:  interview with Mr Lopresti:  ground 12 
56The applicant seeks to have the record of interview of Mr Lopresti excluded as evidence in the trial on two principal bases.  The first was that the officers acted improperly in having Mr Lopresti attend for the interview.  The applicant submitted that there was no power to compel him to attend because the applicant had already acknowledged that duty and interest were payable and a timetable for payment of the outstanding amount had been agreed.  The second basis was that the officers of the OSR engaged in trickery and deceit in the course of that interview.  57The trial judge held that:
""... the investigation did not have to conclude when agreement was reached and a timetable agreed between the [applicant] and the [OSR] for payment of the duty and interest and the money was paid ...""  
58In coming to this conclusion, her Honour noted that there was nothing in the Taxation Administration Act that required the investigation to end once arrangements had been made for payment.  Her Honour also referred to the evidence of Mr Reid and Mr Morse that the investigation was not only for the purpose of having the duty paid but also to determine whether the applicant had committed any breaches of the Taxation Administration Act.  
59There was no error in her Honour's finding on this question.  As her Honour indicated, there was nothing in the Act that compelled the conclusion that the investigation was complete.  Nor was there anything in the transcript of the compelled interview that indicated that the investigation was complete.  Accordingly, this aspect of the applicant's submission should be rejected. 
60That leaves the second basis upon which the applicant contended that the transcript of Mr Lopresti should not be admissible, namely, that it was obtained by deceit and trickery.  During the course of the interview between the OSR officers and Mr Lopresti, Mr Reid asked Mr Lopresti questions as to whether he had given the applicant a cheque for $43,000 which the applicant said she had used to obtain two cheques for that sum for the stamp duty.  
61The questions that the applicant sought to have excluded from evidence were as follows:
""Q.  Listen to the date, the 20 - around about September 2009, see, you gave Barbara one cheque which was deposited into her trust account for $43,200 and from that trust account, she's gone down to two banks, one Westpac Sandy Bay and the other ANZ Bank Sandy Bay and got two different amounts, one for $27,240 and the other for $16,000, both cheques adding up to $43,200, both were in - allegedly in favour of OSR.  You don't know anything about those?A.  I can't - I can't answer the question - that question. I'm not aware of -- .
...
Q.  -- and the Lopresti Trust, might tell us a story that she's forwarded - you're forwarded her funds and that she's split those funds that add up to that $43,000 odd?A.  No.
Q.  And that that was for the payment of duty and that one of those has been presented by the bank and the other cheque has been lost?A.  No. I'm not aware of that. I wasn't aware that, you know, that's what had happened.""  
62In his cross-examination on the voir dire in the proceedings before the trial judge, Mr Reid accepted that the premise upon which these questions were framed, namely that information to that effect was provided by the applicant, was not correct.  He stated, however, that that was his recollection of her interview, albeit that he was mistaken in his recollection.  He also conceded that the questions had been formulated prior to the interview from the record of interview of the applicant.  Mr Morse also said that the questions for Mr Lopresti's interview had been formulated from the transcript of the applicant's interview and he did not correct the errors in the questions asked of Mr Lopresti.  
63Mr Reid's evidence in cross-examination was as follows:
""Q.  Recollection from where?A.  From Barbara Beckett's interview.
Q.  She never mentioned anything like that, did she?A.  No.
Q.  And you knew that when you put this question? A.  Well, I believed that to be the case when I put that question, that was my recollection.
Q.  You had her interview.A.  Yes, I did.
Q.  And not only that but you formulated questions well before the interview in relation to this matter.A.  Yes, I did.
Q.  And you look through the interview of hers prior to formulating those questions? A.  Yes.
Q.  And when you did you knew full well that she'd never said anything of the sort?A.  I've missed the context of the interview.
Q.  Well, you went further than that, didn't you?  The question is 'do you know any reason why your solicitor would tell you - us a story that you forwarded her funds'? A.  Yes, well, I've made a mistake in my recollection.
Q.  But you made a mistake twice, didn't you? A.  Yes.""  
64Sweeney DCJ rejected the applicant's contention that the questions put to Mr Lopresti were motivated by an intention to trick, trap, deceive or mislead him.  Sweeney DCJ accepted the evidence of Mr Reid.  Her Honour found that ""he did not make a knowingly false statement to Mr Lopresti to trap him in some way"" and placed significance on the fact ""that no evidence was obtained from Mr Lopresti by the impugned questions"".  
65The Crown submitted that, in an application under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F,  the applicant's challenges to the factual findings of the primary judge contained in grounds 12 and 14 must be judged according to whether the findings were reasonably open to the primary judge:  R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 and 723 per Gleeson CJ.  The Crown submitted that it was a matter for her Honour to accept or reject the evidence of Mr Reid that he had been mistaken and that the applicant had had failed to demonstrate that the finding was not reasonably open.  In this regard, the Crown also noted that the propositions put to Mr Lopresti were not surprising because it accorded with standard conveyancing practice and the applicant's account of the cheques was extremely vague, confusing and seemed to suggest that the cheques had been drawn at Mr Lopresti's direction.  
Consideration
66Her Honour was considering a question of admissibility of evidence.  Having found that the interview was properly conducted in the course of an investigation, the question became whether the evidence was otherwise improperly obtained or obtained as a result of some impropriety.  This raised the question of the application of the Evidence Act 1995, s 138.  That section provides that a court must not admit evidence that was obtained improperly or in consequence of an impropriety unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it.
67It is accepted that ""improper"", for the purposes of s 138, bears the meaning of conduct falling below ""the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement"":  see Ridgeway v The Queen [1995] HCA 66; 184 CLR 19 at 36;  Gedeon v R [2013] NSWCCA 257; 280 FLR 275 at [91].  It includes conduct which is not in accordance with truth or which is incorrect, inaccurate, erroneous or wrong, being the dictionary meaning of the words 'improper' and 'impropriety':  see Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; 83 ALJR 494 at [29];  Gedeon at [163].  See also R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82 where Howie J, at [19], considered that the legislature intended that the words be given their normal meaning.  (Cornwell was the subject of an appeal to the High Court, but not on this issue.)
68Her Honour did not refer to s 138 at this point of her reasons.  However, she had referred to the section earlier in her judgment, albeit when referring to the challenge made to the admissibility of the transcript of the applicant's evidence.  As I would understand her Honour's reasons, it was not necessary to conduct the evaluative and balancing exercise required by s 138, because she did not accept that the questions had been asked as a deliberate falsehood.  
69I see no error in this conclusion.  An inadvertent misstatement by an investigating officer to a witness is unlikely, for that reason alone, to be regarded as improper for the purpose of s 138:  Cornwell at [24] per Howie J.  In circumstances where her Honour had found that Mr Reid had not made a knowingly false statement to trap Mr Lopresti and it was not shown that her Honour erred in so finding, I am of the opinion that there was no basis for the operation of s 138 in respect of Mr Lopresti's evidence.  
70I would reject ground 14 of the appeal. 
Second issue:  course of justice/false swearing:  grounds 3 and 13
(i) Introduction 
71By ground 3 of the draft notice of appeal, the applicant contended that her Honour erred in finding that a ""course of justice"" had commenced during the interview with the applicant on 28 September 2010.  Ground 13 was a general pleading that the trial judge erred in finding that the admissible evidence was sufficient to satisfy a prima facie case and to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.  No separate submissions were advanced in support of ground 13. 
72The Crown case was that during the compelled interview the applicant had produced the falsely dated cheques and made false statements to the OSR officers so as to deflect the OSR officers from prosecuting her for breaches of ss 41 and 42 of the Taxation Administration Act (as at December 2010).  Those offences respectively involve the contravention of a person's conditions of approval under the EDR scheme and the endorsing of an instrument contrary to the conditions of approval under that scheme.  The question in issue before her Honour was whether there was a 'course of justice' within the meaning of s 319, that the applicant intended to pervert by engaging in that conduct:  see R v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; 174 CLR 268;  R v OM [2011] NSWCCA 109; 212 A Crim R 293.  
(ii) Primary judge's reasoning
73The trial judge approached this question by ""taking the evidence at its highest"", that is, by determining whether the evidence established the elements of the offence on a prima facie basis.  Her Honour concluded that the evidence upon which the Crown proposed to rely to establish this element of the offence, if accepted, was sufficient to establish a prima facie case that ""a course of justice existed during the interviews"" with the applicant for the purposes of s 319.  It is not clear whether the reference to ""interviews"" was a typographical error, or whether her Honour also meant to include the conversation with Mr Morse on 21 September 2010.  However, for the reasons which follow, nothing turns on this point.
74In coming to this conclusion, her Honour distinguished the position of conduct engaged in during the course of administrative and revenue collection systems by officers enforcing those systems:  see R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31, from the situation here, where the applicant had been warned ""of possible prosecution action as one aspect of the tax investigation that was being conducted"".  Her Honour considered, therefore, that it could be inferred that possible prosecution was in the applicant's contemplation when she attended for the compelled interview and produced her file containing the photocopied cheques upon which the date had been altered.  Sweeney DCJ also held that the evidence was capable of establishing a prima facie case in respect of the alternative count on the indictment that the applicant had made a false statement on oath knowing it to be false.
(iii) Submissions 
(a) Applicant's submissions
75The applicant submitted that the reason for the compelled interview was to recover the unpaid duty and interest.  Given that circumstance and the fact that arrangements were made at the interview for the payment of the duty, the investigation was properly characterised as administrative:  see Police v Zammitt [2007] SASC 37.  She contended that there was no evidence that at the time of the interview the officers were suspicious that offences had been committed under the Taxation Administration Act, ss 41 and 42 and that her conduct had been intended to deflect them from investigating those matters.  The applicant sought to gain support for this submission by reference to the fact that subsequent to her compelled interview the officers had interviewed Mr Lopresti to ascertain whether there had been a breach of those provisions.  
76The applicant also submitted that, contrary to the primary judge's finding, there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" that she contemplated court proceedings at the time of the interview.  The applicant also submitted there was no admissible evidence that she made any 'false statement'.  Hence, the Crown was relying on irrelevant and inadmissible evidence.  The applicant submitted, therefore, that the Crown case was ""foredoomed to fail"" and that both counts on the indictment should be quashed or permanently stayed:  Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; 177 CLR 378 at 392-3;  Ridgeway;  and Calleija at [35].
(b) Crown submissions 
77The Crown resisted the suggestion that the investigation conducted by the OSR officers was confined to recovering the outstanding duty and interest and rejected the contention that there was no evidence that prosecution was a possible outcome.  Both the letter of 17 September 2010 and the s 72 notice identified that the purpose of the investigation was to identify possible breaches of the Duties Act and the Taxation Administration Act and contained a warning that prosecution might be considered.  
78The Crown also submitted that it was not necessary that the applicant had it in contemplation that proceedings might be taken against her.  Rather, it was only necessary for the Crown to prove that there was evidence that an investigation into the transaction could lead to a prosecution for some offence:  see Rogerson per Mason CJ at 278.  In this regard, the Crown noted that the potential for curial proceedings is expressly provided for by the Taxation Administration Act, s 125 that deals with proceedings for offences against a ""taxation law"".  The Crown contended that whether or not to bring curial proceedings involved the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. 
Consideration
79The common law offence of perverting the course of justice has been described as the doing of an act which has a tendency and is intended to pervert the administration of justice:  see R v Vreones [1891] 1 QB 360 at 369 per Pollock B.  The question of what constituted the ""course of justice"" for the purposes of the common law offence of perverting the course of justice was considered by the High Court in Rogerson.  That case involved a charge of attempt to pervert the course of justice.  More particularly, the question was whether interference with police investigations was an aspect of the ""course of justice"" for the purposes of that offence.  
80The majority of the Justices of the High Court held that the ""course of justice"" did not commence until the jurisdiction of a court or competent judicial body was invoked:  Mason CJ at 276-277;  Brennan and Toohey JJ at 280, 283;  McHugh J at 303.  In criminal proceedings, that does not occur until the arrest of the person or a court attendance notice has been issued:  McHugh J at 303.  It followed, on the reasoning of each of their Honours, that investigations by police officers of actual or suspected crimes were not part of the course of justice for the purposes of common law offences concerned with perverting the course of justice:  Mason CJ at 276;  Brennan and Toohey JJ at 283.  As Mason CJ pointed out, adopting the language of Pollock B in Vreones at 369, ""the course of justice"" was ""synonymous with the expression 'the administration of justice'"".  His Honour further observed that ""in no relevant sense do the police administer justice"".  See also Brennan and Toohey JJ at 283;  Deane J at 293;  and McHugh J at 303, who observed that the ""investigation of an actual or suspected crime was not part of the 'course of justice'"". 
81The majority of the Court also distinguished between the substantive offence of pervert the course of justice and the offence of attempt.  Their Honours accepted that, unlike the position where the substantive offence was charged, it was well established that the offence of attempt to pervert the course of justice could be committed at a time when no curial proceedings were on foot.  Nor was it necessary that any particular curial proceedings be in the accused person's contemplation for the purpose of the offence of attempt to pervert the course of justice:  Deane J at 294;  McHugh J at 305.  It was enough for the offence of attempt to pervert the course of justice if there was conduct that had a tendency and was intended to frustrate or deflect the course of curial or tribunal proceedings that were ""imminent, probable or even possible"":  Mason CJ at 277;  see also Brennan and Toohey JJ at 280; 283;  Deane J at 293-294;  McHugh J at 301. 
82McHugh J, at 303, stressed that a false statement made to an officer of the law during an investigation of an actual, alleged or suspected offence was not by itself a common law misdemeanour (McHugh J's emphasis).  For the offence of attempt to pervert the course of justice, it was necessary that the false statement had a tendency to pervert the course of judicial proceedings and was made with the intention to do so:  McHugh J at 305.  His Honour further observed that a statement made before the commencement of judicial proceedings cannot amount to a contempt of those proceedings:  ""such a statement will be an attempt to pervert the course of justice if the relevant intent and tendency are present"". 
83McHugh J at 304, referred to the consequences of giving to the phrase ""course of justice"" a wider meaning: 
""... if, contrary to history and principle, this Court now declared that the common law misdemeanour of attempting to pervert the course of justice was established simply by the making of a wilfully false statement in relation to an alleged, actual or suspected crime, it is difficult to see how the offence could be limited to investigations by police officers. Many government officials, besides police officers, are today charged with the duty of investigating breaches of the law. Indeed, any wilfully false statement made to any person investigating whether curial proceedings should be instituted in respect of an actual or supposed civil or criminal wrong would also be arguably within the ambit of the offence. In the result, conduct which for hundreds of years had not been in breach of the criminal law would become so without legislative authority. Whether conduct which intentionally misleads police officers and other government officials should be punishable as an offence, and, if so, to what extent, must remain a matter for the legislature and not the courts.""
84Before leaving Rogerson, more detailed reference needs to be made to two passages in the joint judgment of Brennan and Toohey JJ.  The first passage occurs at 283, where their Honours expressly rejected the proposition that the course of justice commenced prior to the jurisdiction of a court or other competent judicial body was invoked.  Their Honours stated:
""The course of justice does not begin until the jurisdiction of some court or competent judicial authority is invoked.  As McHugh J. shows, there is no historical support for an extension of the 'course of justice' in the way which commended itself to the English Court of Appeal in Reg. v Selvage where it was said that 'a course of justice must have been embarked upon in the sense that proceedings of some kind are in being or are imminent or investigations what could or might bring proceedings about are in progress' ... Neither the police nor other investigative agencies administer justice in any relevant sense.""  
85In the second passage, at 284, their Honours observed that conduct calculated to mislead police during investigations may amount to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.  Their Honours continued, at 284:
""An act which has a tendency to deflect the police from prosecuting a criminal offence or instituting disciplinary proceedings before a judicial tribunal or from adducing evidence of the true facts is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice and, if done with intent to achieve that result, amounts to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.
...
The gravamen of the offence of an attempt to pervert the course of justice is an interference with the due exercise of jurisdiction by courts and other competent judicial authorities.  As the courts exercise their necessary and salutary jurisdiction to hear and determine charges of offences against the criminal law only when their jurisdiction is invoked, an act which has a tendency to deflect the police from invoking that jurisdiction when it is their duty to do so is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice.  Subject to a limited discretion not to prosecute, it is the duty of the police to prosecute when offences are committed.""  (emphasis added)
86The common law offence of pervert the course of justice has now been replaced by the offence under s 319 and is subject to the statutory definition of ""pervert the course of justice"" in s 312.  The offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years.  Those provisions were considered by this Court in Einfeld.  The conduct said to constitute the s 319 offence in that case was the making of a false statutory declaration in response to a penalty notice issued in respect of a traffic offence.  The Court of Criminal Appeal, constituted by Bell JA, Hulme and Latham JJ, observed that ss 312 and 319 were contained within Pt 7 of the Crimes Act entitled ""Public justice offences"".  The Court observed, at [65], that Pt 7 ""codified a part of the common law dealing with offences relating to the integrity of curial proceedings and criminal justice"".  
87Their Honours considered that the effect of Pt 7 was threefold.  First, it introduced a number of offences dealing with conduct that at common law had constituted the offences of perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice, for example, tampering with evidence:  s 317;  corruption of witnesses and jurors:  s 321;  and threatening or intimidating judges or witnesses:  s 322.  
88Secondly, Pt 7 introduced offences concerned with criminal investigation, for example, making an accusation intending a person to be the subject of investigation for an offence, knowing that person to be innocent of the offence:  s 314;  doing anything intending to hinder the investigation of a serious indictable offence committed by another person:  s 315;  and concealing a serious indictable offence.  The first two of the aforementioned offences carry a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment, while the last carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment.
89Thirdly, s 319, Pt 7 enacted the general offence of perverting the course of justice (see the Court's discussion at [66]-[68]).
90The Court, at [89], considered that the phrase ""the administration of the law"" in s 312 did not readily describe the role of the police in the investigation of crime.  Their Honours considered that Parliament would more aptly have used some other expression such as ""enforcement of the law"" or the ""investigation of crime"" had it intended to include within the offence created by s 319, conduct involving the obstruction or perversion of a police investigation if an offender did not have curial proceedings in contemplation at the time of engaging in the conduct in question.  The Court concluded that, having regard to the structure of Pt 7, particularly the exactitude with which ss 315 and 316 relating to serious indictable criminal offences were drafted, police investigations did not fall within the meaning of ""the course of justice"" for the purpose of the offence of perverting the course of justice.  As their Honours observed, at [89]: 
""It would seem anomalous, given the provision for these specific offences involving conduct intended to obstruct the police in the investigation of serious crime, if the Court were to construe s 319, by reason of the definition in s 312, as including any conduct intended to obstruct the police in the discharge of any function involving, applying or enforcing any law of the State.""
91Relevantly for the purposes of this case, which involved a taxation  investigation by the public officials of the OSR, the Court, by reference to the point made by McHugh J in Rogerson at 304 (set out above at [83]) stated, at [90]: 
""We do not see how the expression 'the administration of the law' could be interpreted to apply to the police investigation of crime without also applying to the activities of other public officials whose functions include applying and enforcing the laws of the State. A wilfully false statement made to a State Revenue Transit Protection Officer about the circumstances in which a weekly bus pass was lost would on such an interpretation of the provision be a perversion of the course of justice punishable by a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment.""
92The Court concluded, at [99], that the expression ""the administration of the law"" in s 312 meant ""the administration of the civil and criminal law by courts and tribunals"".  In effect, the Court accepted that the expression bore the same meaning as was given to the phrase ""course of justice"" in Rogerson.  In stating this conclusion, the Court again emphasised that in codifying public justice offences, the legislature had carefully defined offences and ranked them in order of relative seriousness, reflected in the maximum penalties prescribed.  Most of the offences in Pt 7 may be dealt with summarily, in which case the maximum penalty is 2 years:  see Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s 260.  However, an offence under s 319 may not be dealt with summarily.  This caused the Court to observe, at [98], that Parliament had reserved the offence under s 319 ""as among the most serious of the public justice offences"".  Their Honours noted: 
""Notable is the absence in Pt 7 of an offence or offences dealing, in terms, with the obstruction of public officials or government bodies in the administration of the law.""
93In OM, this Court confirmed, at [48], that the scope of the statutory offence created by s 319 does not differ in relevant respects from the scope of the common law offence of pervert the course of justice, so that the relevant parameters of the statutory offence were those identified in Rogerson in respect of the common law offence.  So much may be accepted.  However, their Honours' conclusion in OM, which picked up certain of the language used by Brennan and Toohey JJ extracted above, calls for critical examination.
94In OM, the respondent was charged with the offence under the Crimes Act, s 195(1)(a) of intentionally damaging property and with two offences under s 319.  The alleged facts, which were relevantly straightforward, commenced with a road rage incident.  A car cut in front of a taxi, whereupon the driver of the taxi sounded the taxi's horn.  Further on at a set of lights, at which both the car and the taxi had stopped, the respondent got out of the car, went up to the taxi and struck the driver's side window causing it to shatter.  The respondent ran back to the car, which drove off.  The passenger in the taxi recorded the registration number of the car and the police were called. 
95The car was registered in the name of a Mr Ullah who, on inquiry by the police, advised that his daughter was the driver of the car on the day in question.  Mr Ullah informed his daughter of the police inquiry.  The daughter rang the respondent and asked him about the malicious damage to the taxi that the police were asking about.  The respondent told Ms Ullah to tell the police that another person was in the car with her.  Ms Ullah subsequently attended the police station and gave a statement in which she said that she was the driver on the day and that another person, Mr Sundarjee, was with her.  She claimed that she was unaware of any damage to the taxi.  Some months later, Ms Ullah admitted to the police that the respondent had been with her and that the respondent had smashed the window.
96Mr Sundarjee was questioned by the police about two weeks after the incident.  Prior to his police interview, the respondent had contacted Mr Sundarjee and also told him to give a false statement to the police.  Mr Sundarjee gave the false account to the police and maintained that account in a later conversation with the police.  Subsequently, he too admitted to the police that his statement was false and that he had been encouraged by the respondent to make the false statement. 
97Six months later, the respondent was charged with the damage to property offence and the two offences under s 319.  An application was made at his trial that the defendant had no case to answer in respect of the s 319 offences, on the basis that an offence under s 319 did not lie where the conduct alleged to constitute the perversion of the course of justice occurred during a police investigation, prior to an arrest or charge being laid.  The trial judge ruled that the conduct, if proved, could not amount to an offence under the section. 
98On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Court reviewed the decisions in Rogerson and Einfeld.  Whealy JA, who wrote the principal judgment, referred to those passages in Rogerson which pointed out that the ""course of justice"" for the purposes of the s 319 offence did not commence until the jurisdiction of the Court had been invoked.  His Honour, at [46], quoted that part of McHugh J's statement where his Honour noted that a statement before the commencement of proceedings will be an attempt if the relevant intent and tendency are present.  Whealy JA, at [47], then stated that McHugh J, at 307, expressed a qualification to that statement.  According to Whealy JA, the qualification was contained in the following passage from the judgment of McHugh J at 307:
""Unless the prosecution proves that the course of justice as a continuing process has been perverted or proves facts which show that an identifiable person has committed an identifiable crime, it is difficult to see how the prosecution can prove that the conduct of the accused interfered with the course of justice ... Leaving aside the continuous process cases, proof of the offence will require evidence that the accused has engaged in conduct which prevented or might have prevented the prosecution of a particular offence or that the accused has engaged in conduct which had the tendency to change or did change evidence which would otherwise have been put before a judicial tribunal or which had the tendency to prevent or did prevent evidence from being put before that tribunal. If the evidence does not establish what proceedings would have been commenced or what proceedings were interfered with, the conduct of the accused cannot be shown to have the tendency to pervert the course of justice ... It is not enough that the conduct of the accused has misled an investigation into whether a person has committed any offence against the law.""
99Having quoted from that passage, Whealy JA posed the question whether the primary judge had fallen into error in refusing the no case application.  As noted above, his Honour accepted that the parameters of the offence under s 319 were those stated in Rogerson.  His Honour referred to the observations of the Court in Einfeld at [89] referred to above at [90].  His Honour concluded, at [49]:
""In other words, if the Crown, in the present matter, could establish that the respondent's actions were intended to deflect the police from prosecuting him for the criminal offence that he had allegedly committed, or from adducing evidence of the true facts relating to the alleged offence, the prosecution was clearly capable of being maintained. The fact that no judicial proceedings had been commenced at the time when the respondent spoke to Ms Ullah and Mr Sundarjee, did not preclude the finding of a prima facie case. Nor would it preclude a subsequent determination by a jury that, subject to proof of all the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, that each offence had been committed. Had his Honour quashed the two counts in the indictment, as he indicated he was contemplating doing, there is no doubt that this court would have been entitled to make an order pursuant to section 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act , setting the orders aside. Similarly, had his Honour made an order staying the proceedings, there is no doubt that this court would have been entitled to make an order pursuant to section 5F(2), setting the stay order aside.""  (emphasis added)
100It will be immediately apparent that the reference by his Honour to proof of the respondent's actions being ""intended to deflect the police from prosecuting him for the criminal offence that he had allegedly committed"", or ""from adducing evidence of the true facts relating to the alleged offence, the prosecution was clearly capable of being maintained"", reflects the language of Brennan and Toohey JJ, set out above at [85].  However, those comments were made in the context of considering proof of the offence of attempt to pervert the course of justice, not in respect of the offence of pervert the course of justice.  As already noted, the High Court was unanimous in Rogerson that the substantive offence was not available where the impugned conduct occurred prior to the jurisdiction of a court or competent judicial authority being invoked. 
101Whealy JA, as I understand his Honour's judgment, derived support for the conclusion reached at [49] from what he considered to be a qualification made by McHugh J in Rogerson at 307 to the clear statements otherwise made that the ""course of justice"" did not commence until the court's jurisdiction had been invoked.  In my opinion, the passage from McHugh J's judgment at 307 did not carry the qualifying implication or effect ascribed to it by Whealy JA.  McHugh J's reasoning in Rogerson leading to this passage relevantly commenced at 304.  His Honour, in that part of his judgment, was dealing with the common law misdemeanour of attempting to pervert the course of justice.  His Honour expressly stated as part of that reasoning, at 305:
""Although a statement made before the commencement of judicial proceedings cannot amount to a contempt of those proceedings, such a statement will be an attempt to pervert the course of justice if the relevant intent and tendency are present."" 
102McHugh J continued by examining the manner in which:
""[i]n this respect, the law relating to contempt and the law relating to perverting the course of justice have gone separate ways."" 
103It follows, in my opinion, with respect to his Honour Whealy JA and the members of the Court who agreed with him, that the passage in McHugh J's judgment in Rogerson does not support the reasoning at [49] of OM.  Nor do the other judgments in Rogerson support Whealy JA's reasoning at [49].  The judgments of Mason CJ and Brennan and Toohey JJ and of McHugh J were clear.  The ""course of justice"" for the purposes of the substantive offence required that the curial process had been commenced, so that the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal had been invoked.  Acts preceding the commencement of a curial process, if the relevant intent and tendency were proved, amounted to the offence of attempt to pervert the course of justice, itself a common law misdemeanour.
104Although Sweeney DCJ referred to this Court's decision in Einfeld, it is apparent that the reasoning of the Court in OM formed an essential basis of her Honour's reasoning.  Thus, her Honour stated, at 25:
""In the way the Crown characterises its case, that the accused, by the production of the altered photocopy cheques in her file and making false statements that the cheques were available to her before she stamped the transfer, acted to deflect the investigators from prosecuting her for breaches of ss 41 and 42 Taxation Administration Act, the alleged conduct falls within the conduct held by the High Court in Rogerson and the Court of Criminal Appeal in OM, in the extracts I have referred to above, to be an act which tends to pervert the course of justice, such that the Crown is able to establish beyond reasonable doubt the element of court 1 that there was a course of justice in existence at the time of the interview of [the applicant].""
105In my opinion, her Honour's reasoning replicated the error I consider was made by this Court in OM that I have sought to explain at [103] above.  If I am correct in this view, her Honour erred, at 25-26, in finding that because possible prosecution action had been expressly adverted to by the officers of the OSR at the time of the interview so that it could be inferred that prosecution was in the contemplation of the accused when she attended for interview, the Crown could establish that a ""course of justice"" existed during the interviews. 
106The question of what constitutes an offence against s 319 has recently been considered by the Court of Appeal in Cunneen v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWCA 421.  Hoeben CJ at CL also considered the question in his first instance decision in that case:  Cunneen v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWSC 1571.  
107Bathurst CJ, at [10], stated that it was clear that ""merely interfering with a police investigation will not constitute the offence [of pervert the course of justice under s 319]"".  His Honour then referred to the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ in Rogerson at 277-278 and to the statement of Brennan and Toohey JJ at 283-284:  see above at [80].  Bathurst CJ then observed, at [12]: 
""It is important to note the emphasis placed by each of their Honours on the fact that the conduct is intended to frustrate or deflect the course of a criminal or tribunal proceeding (in the case of Mason CJ) or of impairing the Court's capacity to do justice in the actual circumstances of the case (in the case of Brennan and Toohey JJ).""
108Basten JA referred both to the statement of Mason CJ in Rogerson at 277-278 as well as to the passage in Einfeld at [89].  His Honour considered that it was important that the passage at [89] not be taken out of context.  His Honour then stated, at [88]: 
""The 'course of justice' is thus the proceeding before a court or judicial tribunal; to deflect such a proceeding even before it has been commenced may constitute perverting the course of justice. A police investigation does not itself fall within 'the course of justice' but the effect of deflecting a police investigation may be to deflect the course of justice. In this sense, the statement from Einfeld at [89] (set out above and relied upon by the applicants) is strictly correct, although, abstracted from its context, it could be misread.""
109Basten JA observed, at [89], that Einfeld was not concerned with the common law offence with which Rogerson dealt and commented that the Court in Einfeld did not hold that deflecting a police investigation could not amount to perverting the course of justice.  His Honour then, at [90], referred to the Court's conclusion in Einfeld that the expression ""the administration of the law"" differs little, if at all, from the expression the ""course of justice"" as explained in Rogerson at [99].  His Honour considered that in Cunneen it was likely that the police would seek to test the third applicant after the accident to determine her blood alcohol level and if above the prescribed minimum it was likely that a court attendance notice would issue.  His Honour stated, at [90]: 
""To act with intent to prevent that outcome would be to attempt to pervert the course of justice (and, if the attempt succeeded to commit the substantive offence).""
110It is not necessary to consider the parenthesised portion of this observation.  In the present case, the applicant's alleged statements to the officers of the OSR and her production of the backdated cheques did not constitute an offence under s 319 for the reasons I have given.  I do not consider that the observations of the Court in Appeal in Cunneen require any different conclusion. 
111The conduct engaged in by the applicant, if proved by admissible evidence, occurring as it did prior to the invocation of the jurisdiction of a court or competent judicial tribunal, could not constitute the offence with which the applicant was charged in count 1 on the indictment.  That count on the indictment should therefore be permanently stayed.  
Alternative charge 
112The Crown submitted that if, contrary to the finding of the primary judge, the Court was of the view that there was no ""course of justice"" within the meaning of s 319, it proposed to pursue the prosecution of the alternative charge under count 2 for the offence of making false statements under oath pursuant to the Crimes Act, s 330.  In that regard, the primary judge held that, taken at its highest, the evidence was capable of establishing a prima facie case in respect of that count.  
113The applicant submitted that as count 2 was charged as a back-up offence to a charge which is fundamentally flawed, the Crown should not be permitted, in the proper administration of justice, to prosecute count 2.  The applicant did not advance any submissions to support her position other than her reliance on the other grounds of appeal to which it is now necessary to turn.  
Issue 3:  abrogation of the right to silence and right against self-incrimination:  ground 5
114The trial judge accepted the Crown submission that although the applicant had been cautioned that she did not have to incriminate herself, the privilege against self-incrimination was necessarily impliedly abrogated by   the terms of s 72.  In this regard, her Honour considered that the statutory provisions considered in A v Boulton [2004] FCAFC 101; 136 FCR 420 were analogous to the provisions of the Taxation Administration Act.  Her Honour rejected the applicant's submission that Baff v New South Wales Commissioner of Police [2013] NSWSC 1205 was applicable and also considered that High Court's decisions in X7 v ACC [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92 and Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196, upon which the applicant had also relied, were not of assistance. 
115In considering that A v Boulton was analogous, her Honour observed, at 17-18:  
""I have considered Baff and Boulton. I consider the latter more applicable to the issues under consideration here. By reference to Boulton and the authorities considered therein, on the types of statutory provisions considered there, analogous to the Taxation Administration Act provisions, I am of the view having regard to the purpose of the examination power in s 72, in the context of the purpose of the Taxation Administration Act, and the general terms in which s 72 expresses the obligation to comply with the requirements of the section, including giving evidence, that in order that the purpose of an examination not be defeated, the privilege against self incrimination has by necessary implication been abrogated by s 72. Therefore, the questioning of Ms Beckett has not been demonstrated in any way to have been unlawful and the statements she made in response to questioning were not unlawfully obtained."" 
Submissions
116The applicant submitted that Parliament has not, in the express words of s 72 or by necessary implication, abrogated the fundamental right to silence, nor the right against self-incrimination, such as to allow the authorities to use the material obtained under compulsion to prosecute the applicant under the Crimes Act.  Integral to that submission was that the applicant would have been afforded those fundamental rights had her conduct been investigated under the Crimes Act.  
117The Crown's primary position was that there was no error in the trial judge's finding that the privilege against incrimination was abrogated in circumstances where the applicant, in the course of being interviewed, committed an offence of a different complexion from that the subject of the compellable enquiry.  The Crown submitted alternatively, and in any event, that the applicant had waived her right to silence in circumstances where she had participated in the interview after she had been cautioned. 
118In support of this submission, the Crown submitted that the relevant principles to apply in determining whether the right to silence or the right against self-incrimination had been abrogated by the legislation were as follows.  First, it is within the power of the legislature to abrogate the common law principles relating to answering incriminating questions:  Sorby v Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10, 152 CLR 281;  Lee (2013) at [125].  Secondly, a legislative purpose may involve a public interest that cannot be pursued without some impairment of a private right or immunity.  In that case, the legislature may be required to strike a balance between those competing interests:  Lee (2013) at [126].  Thirdly, legislation will not be construed as abrogating fundamental rights or important common law rights, privileges or immunities in the absence of clear words or necessary implication:  Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486 at 495;  X7 at [21], [86], [158];  Lee (2013) at [29], [126].  Fourthly, there is a long history of legislation, such as that governing examinations in bankruptcy and under corporations legislation, which abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination:  Hamilton v Oades at 494;  R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42; 232 A Crim R 249 at [79].
119The Crown further submitted that there is a consistent line of authority to the effect that the principles concerning the privilege against self-incrimination in the context of compelled examinations apply differently where the examinee has not yet been charged with an offence.  Thus, in A v Boulton (approved on appeal:  [2004] FCFAFC 101; 136 FCR 420 and cited with approval in Seller; McCarthy at [82]), Weinberg J, at [145], noted that in the absence of a curial process (commenced by charging), the use of coercive powers of examination pursuant to statute would not generally be described as having a tendency to interfere with the due administration of justice.  
120The Crown submitted that in this case, the provisions of s 82 of the Taxation Administration Act, allowing for the disclosure of information to a wide range of persons and entities, including the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, envisaged the use of material, that had been obtained by compulsion, in criminal proceedings for an offence and so, by necessary implication, the privilege against self-incrimination had been abrogated.  
121If the obligation to answer questions and produce documents in s 72 was subject to a privilege against self-incrimination, the Crown submitted that the purpose of the examination, being the enforcement of taxation laws, may be defeated in many cases.  The Crown also relied on the fact that the ""reasonable excuse"" defence to a failure to answer a question posed by an investigating officer in the Taxation Administration Act, s 78(1)(c), applies only to questions asked in accordance with s 76 (which confers a power on an authorised officer to require a person to answer questions after entering into premises) and not s 72:  cf Sorby at 295, 310-311;  A v Boulton at [62]). 
Consideration
122It is well established that the privilege against incrimination may be abrogated by clear statutory intendment:  Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63; 7 CLR 277 at 304;  Coco v R [1994] HCA 15; 179 CLR 427.  This has recently been confirmed in the High Court in X7;  Lee (2013);  and Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 656.  Kiefel J pointed out in X7 at [158] that the intention must be expressed with ""irresistible clearness""  Her Honour continued:
""It will usually require that it be manifest from the statute in question that the legislature has directed its attention to the question whether to so abrogate or restrict and has determined to do so."" 
123It is also accepted that fundamental privileges may be abrogated by necessary implication:  see Sorby at 289-290 per Gibbs CJ;  Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ at 309;  Hamilton v Oades at 495 where Mason CJ observed that the notion of abrogation by necessary implication ""imports a high degree of certainty"";  Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd & Anor v ACCC [2002] HCA 49; 213 CLR 543 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 570;  McHugh J at 572.  
124In Sorby, the Court was concerned with whether certain amending provisions of the Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth) applied retrospectively so as to be applicable to Royal Commissions commenced prior to the amendment and if so the constitutional validity of the amending legislation.  There was also a question as to whether the privilege against self-incrimination had been abrogated by the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1950 (Qld).  Under that legislation, a person who refused to answer questions asked by the Commission was guilty of contempt of the Commission:  s 9(2)(ii).  However, a person was not to be punished if there was a reasonable excuse for not answering:  s 10(4).  Section 14(2) of the Act provided that incriminating answers could not be used in evidence in civil or criminal proceedings.  Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ, in concluding that the Act did not abrogate the privilege, stated, at 310-311: 
""What purpose is the sub-section intended to serve if it is not to protect the witness from the consequences of abrogation of the privilege? When a legislature abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination it often gives compensatory protection to the witness by providing, as s. 14(2) does, that an answer shall not be admissible in civil and criminal proceedings other than in proceedings for contempt or for an offence under the Act .... If ... the sub-section had stood alone in the context of an Act which imposed an obligation on a witness to answer all relevant questions, there might well be substance in the submission that its presence was consistent only with a legislative intention to abrogate the privilege. However, the sub-section does not stand alone in the State Act. The context furnishes provisions in s. 10(4) and s. 14(1)(ii) which protect a witness in respect both of a refusal to answer questions and to produce documents if he has a reasonable excuse. There is no sufficient indication in the Act that a witness is not entitled to that protection if the reason for his refusal is a well-grounded claim to the privilege against self-incrimination. Accordingly, in our opinion, the State Act does not abrogate the privilege.""
125Gibbs CJ, at 300, was of the same opinion, having regard to the protection afforded by the ""reasonable excuse provision"".  However, his Honour's approach to the determination of the question was different in that he also referred to his view expressed, at 295, in relation to the Royal Commissions Act that ""[t]o provide that answers may not be used in evidence is not to reveal clearly an intention that the privilege should be unavailable"".  
126A v Boulton involved judicial review of a decision to examine a person under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth).  The applicant sought declaratory relief to the effect that he was entitled to rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination during the examination.  At first instance, A v Boulton [2004] FCA 56, Wienberg J held that the privilege had been abrogated and refused the relief sought.  His Honour considered that the test to be applied in determining whether the privilege against self-incrimination had been impliedly abrogated was as stated by the High Court in Daniels Corporation International per McHugh J at [39], namely: 
""... courts do not read general words in a statute as taking away rights, privileges and immunities that the common law or the general law classifies as fundamental unless the context or subject matter of the statute points irresistibly to that conclusion.""
127His Honour also rejected the submission that the principle in Hammond v Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188 should be extended to persons about to be charged.  In Hammond, Gibbs CJ stated, at 198, that there was a ""real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with"" if a person is required, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he or she is guilty of an offence.  His Honour concluded that the privilege against self-incrimination had, by necessary implication, been waived. 
128An appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court was dismissed:  A v Boulton [2004] FCAFC 101; 136 FCR 420.  Kenny J, with whom Beaumont and Dowsett JJ agreed, cited the test stated by the plurality in Daniels Corporation International at [11], which is to the same effect as the test stated by McHugh J above.  In the terms used by the plurality: 
""It is now well settled that statutory provisions are not to be construed as abrogating important common law rights, privileges and immunities in the absence of clear words or a necessary implication to that effect. That rule, the expression of which in this Court can be traced to Potter v Minahan, was the foundation for the decision in Baker v Campbell.""  (citations omitted)
129The Court concluded that the privilege had been abrogated, notwithstanding that the Australian Crime Commission Act, s 30(5) provided that if an examinee made a claim in respect of an answer, the answer could not be used in proceedings against them.  As Kenny J observed, at [58], the obligation to answer questions was expressed in general terms and that the purpose of the examination would be defeated if subject to the privilege.  Her Honour stated, at [65], that the provision of the use immunity in s 30(5) gave a ""very clear indication"" of a legislative intent to abrogate the privilege.  This was so notwithstanding that the availability of the use immunity was circumscribed by the requirement in subs (4) that privilege be claimed prior to answering the question.
130The decision in A v Boulton both at first instance and on appeal was cited with approval by this Court in Seller; McCarthy at [81].  The respondents in that case were compulsorily examined by the Australian Crime Commission prior to charges being laid.  The matters upon which they were examined were relevant to the offences with which they were ultimately charged and the Australian Crime Commission provided the transcripts of their evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The respondents sought, and Garling J in the Supreme Court granted, a stay of the proceedings on the indictments laid against each on the basis that disclosure of the transcripts to the Director of Public Prosecutions meant that their right to a fair trial had been compromised. The Director successfully appealed against those orders.  
131Seller; McCarthy also concerned the Australian Crime Commission Act.  In addition to the provisions of s 30, considered in A v Boulton, the Court was concerned with s 25A of the Act, which made provision for the conduct of an examination under the Act.  Section 25A(9) provided that a direction may be made that evidence given in the examination was not to be published or was only to be published to such persons as the examiner specified.  The examiner was required to give a direction for non-publication or limited publication under subs (9) if the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person who had been or who may be charged with an offence.  
132Directions had been made whereby some of the material obtained at the examination was provided to the prosecuting authorities.  Bathurst CJ (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing) held, at [80], that, by necessary implication, there had been an abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination, including the privilege against indirect or derivative self-incrimination.  
133The Chief Justice noted, at [101]-[104], that whilst the purpose of s 25A was to preserve the right to a fair trial, the section would not prohibit all derivative use of the material.  His Honour drew a distinction between the use of information obtained in the course of an examination to obtain admissible evidence and the use of information that disclosed defences or which tended to support the proposed charges.  While his Honour considered that the former use was not such as to prejudice a fair trial, he considered that use of the information in this latter way would be contrary to the principle stated by Gibbs CJ in Sorby ""that the onus was on the Crown to prove its case and that the prosecution must prove it without reliance on incriminating answers"":  see also Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 74; 178 CLR 477.
134Bathurst CJ considered, at [103], that s 25A would not preclude the Australian Crime Commission from carrying out the investigatory function imposed on it by the Act.  His Honour emphasised, at [106], that whether the dissemination of material would prejudice a fair trial would depend upon the nature of the material disseminated, the function of the person or body to whom the material was disseminated and, in some cases, the timing of the dissemination.  
135As I have indicated, the applicant relied on Baff v New South Wales Commissioner of Police.  Mr Baff, a police officer, had been given a notice to attend for a non-criminal investigation relating to an allegation that he used unreasonable force and disobeyed a reasonable direction during the course of his police duties.  The legislation under consideration was the Police Act 1990 (NSW), s 201 and the Police Regulations 2008 (NSW), cl 8.  Section 201 provided that an officer who neglected or refused to obey any lawful order was guilty of an offence.  Clause 8 required a police officer to comply strictly with the Police Act and with all lawful orders from those in authority over them.  Mr Baff had taken an oath of service required of police officers upon appointment to the service and had signed a document stating that he would comply with the Police ""Code of Conduct"", which included a provision that an officer would comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by a person in authority. 
136The question in issue was whether the privilege against self-incrimination had been impliedly abrogated by these provisions.  Adamson J held, at [111], that the common law privilege against self-incrimination (including the wider privilege not to answer any questions) was a substantive right available to a person suspected of but not charged with an offence.  Her Honour concluded that the privilege had not been abrogated by the legislation or the regulations.  There is nothing in Baff which is of particular assistance in this case.  Adamson J correctly applied the principles of statutory interpretation to the legislation under consideration.  The trial judge in this case was not in error in failing to apply it. 
137The trial judge in the present case rejected X7 and Lee (2013) as being of assistance.  Those cases were not directly concerned with the question whether the privilege against self-incrimination had been impliedly abrogated.  Rather, they were concerned with whether it was lawful for an authority to compulsorily examine persons in respect of matters with which they had been charged.  Reference should also be made to Lee (2014), which was decided after her Honour's decision in this matter.  In Lee (2014), the question arose as to the use that can be made of information obtained in the course of a compelled interview in circumstances where the person interviewed had not been charged with any offences.  Again, it was not in issue whether the privilege against self-incrimination had been abrogated.  
138In the present case, there is a question as to whether the transcript of the compelled interview is admissible even if the privilege against self-incrimination has been abrogated.  Accordingly, it will be necessary to return to those cases.  It is convenient at this point, however, to note that, in determining whether the transcripts can be used, regard will need to be had to two further factors.  The first is that the applicant was given a caution.  The second is that the offences on the indictment which are the subject of the issues before the court arose out of the false answers she allegedly gave in the compelled interview.  
Has the privilege been abrogated?
139In determining whether the privilege has been abrogated, it is necessary to return to the legislation.  The provisions of the Taxation Administration Act, ss 7, 71 and 72 are set out above at [21].  In brief, the purpose of the Act is to make provision for the administration and enforcement of taxation laws:  s 7.  Functions conferred by the Act may only be exercised only for the purpose of a taxation law:  s 71.  Section 72 then confers on the Chief Commissioner power to require information, the production of documents and the like:  s 72.  Relevantly for the purposes of this case, power is vested in the Commissioner by s 72 to require a person by notice to provide information and to attend to give evidence including on oath.  A person given a notice must comply with it.  A penalty is provided for non-compliance:  s 72(8).  There is no provision such as is found in other legislation that a person is not excused from answering on the ground of self-incrimination:  see, for example, the Companies (New South Wales) Code, s 541(12), considered in Hamilton v Oades.  Nor is there any use immunity in the Taxation Administration Act whereby incriminating answers may not be used in evidence against the person.  
140Part 9, Div 3, ss 81-85A of the Taxation Administration Act provides for the secrecy of information obtained under the compellable provisions of s 72.  There are, however, significant exceptions.  Pursuant to s 81, a tax officer must not disclose information obtained under or in relation to the administration of a taxation law, except as permitted by the Division.  Section 82 provides for disclosure to specified persons and entities, including: 
""82 Permitted disclosures - to particular persons
A tax officer may disclose information obtained under or in relation to the administration of a taxation law:
...
(b) in connection with the administration or execution of the following laws (including for the purpose of any legal proceedings arising out of any of those laws or a report of any such proceedings):
(i) a taxation law,(ii) the First Home Owner Grant Act 2000 or a corresponding law of another State or a Territory,(iii) the Unclaimed Money Act 1995,(iv) a recognised revenue law,(v) the Fines Act 1996,(vi) the Regional Relocation Grants (Skills Incentive) Act 2011, 
...
(d) in accordance with a requirement imposed, or authorisation conferred, by or under an Act, or
...
(h) to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, or a member of the Australian Federal Police designated by the Commissioner, for the purpose of enforcing a law of the Commonwealth that creates an offence, or
...
(k) to any of the following persons or a person authorised by any of the following persons:
(i) the Ombudsman,(ii) the State Records Authority of New South Wales,(iii) the Australian Statistician,(iv) the Auditor-General,(v) the Valuer-General,(vi) a member of the Public Service acting in the execution or administration of the Regional Development Act 2004, or(vii) the WorkCover Authority,(viii) the Legal Services Commissioner, a member of the Law Society Council, an investigator appointed under section 267 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 or an external examiner appointed under Division 4 of Part 3.1 of that Act,(ix) the Head of a Department of the Public Service or the holder of a statutory office if the information relates to land, including its description, ownership and value,(x) the Hardship Review Board constituted under Division 5 of Part 10 or a member of that Board,(xi) the Director-General of the Department of Education and Communities,(xia) the Director-General of the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services,(xii) (Repealed)(xiii) the Director-General of the Department of Transport, for the purposes of administration of the Parking Space Levy Act 2009,(xiv) the Commissioner of Police,(xv) the Commissioner for Vocational Training,(xvi) the Independent Commission Against Corruption,(xvii) the Commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW or the Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service ...""
141As can be seen from the range of Acts referred to in para (b), the disclosure permitted under para (d), where some other Act authorises or requires the disclosure and the disparate persons and entities to whom disclosure may be made, there is no homogeneity in the persons to whom disclosure may be made and no discernible cohesive purpose in permitting disclosure to be made.  However, it is apparent that disclosure can be made to persons concerned with the investigation of criminal conduct.  It will be necessary to return to the provisions of s 82, and subs (d) in particular, in relation to the consideration of grounds 6-9.  
142Despite the wide range of persons and circumstances in which disclosure may be made under s 82, s 84 places a restriction on the disclosure that may so be made.  It provides that a person must not disclose any information obtained from a tax officer in accordance with Pt 9, unless the disclosure is made with the consent of the Chief Commissioner, or so as to enable the person to exercise a function conferred on the person by law for the purpose of the enforcement of law or protecting the public revenue.
143Section 83 provides that the Chief Commissioner may disclose information obtained under or in relation to the administration of a taxation law, unless that information will, or is likely to, directly or indirectly identify a particular taxpayer or disclose matters concerning the personal affairs of the taxpayer.  In accordance with the principles of statutory construction, the general provision made in s 83 does not restrict the particular disclosure that may be made under s 82. 
144Section 85 places restrictions on disclosure to a court in the following terms:
""85 Further restrictions on disclosure
(1) A person who is or was a tax officer is not required to disclose or produce in any court any information obtained under or in relation to the administration of a taxation law except:
(a) if it is necessary to do so for the purposes of the administration or execution of a taxation law, or(b) if the requirement is made for the purposes of enabling a person who is specified for the time being to be an authorised recipient to exercise a function conferred or imposed on the person by law.
(2) In this section:
authorised recipient means a person to whom information may be disclosed under section 82.""
145Section 85A relates to disclosure under other laws.  It provides:
""85A Disclosures under other laws
(1) This Division does not prevent the disclosure of information obtained under or in relation to the administration of a non-taxation law, in the exercise of functions conferred or imposed by or under that law, even if those functions are exercised in conjunction with functions exercised under a taxation law.(2) However, this section does not authorise the disclosure of any such information in contravention of the non-taxation law under which the functions are exercised.
(3) In this section:
non-taxation law means any law of this State that is not a taxation law.""
146In my opinion, the privilege against self-incrimination has been impliedly abrogated by the provisions of the Taxation Administration Act.  First, the requirement upon a person to attend and answer questions is stated in general terms.  This was the very circumstance in which the majority in Sorby stated, at 310-311, that the legislation ""was consistent only with a legislative intention to abrogate the privilege"".  Further, there was no compensatory use immunity of which the majority spoke in Sorby.  
147Secondly, the Act, in ss 82 and 84, makes provision for disclosure to a wide range of persons and entities including law enforcement authorities for the purpose of law enforcement, not confined to the enforcement of laws protecting revenue.  
148Thirdly, whilst s 85 is expressed in terms of a restriction on disclosure, it permits, by way of exception, a tax officer to disclose information obtained under, relevantly, s 72, to a court, if the disclosure is for the purpose of enabling a person specified in s 82 to exercise a function conferred or imposed on the person by law.  Thus, a police officer prosecuting an offence (including offences other than taxation offences) could subpoena the transcript of a compelled interview.  
149Accordingly, the taxation officers were entitled to question the applicant and the applicant was required to answer questions, notwithstanding that the answers might incriminate her.  
Use that could be made of the information obtained in the compelled interview:  grounds 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10
Trial judge's reasons 
150Sweeney DCJ rejected the applicant's contention that the disclosure of information and material obtained in the course of its investigation to the Crown Solicitor and Director of Public Prosecutions and its production in court was prohibited by the Taxation Administration Act, ss 82 and 85.  Sweeney DCJ held:
""I am satisfied that s 82(b) permitted the Office of State Revenue officers to disclose the material obtained in the course of their investigation to the Crown Solicitor, to the DPP and to this court for the purpose of any legal proceedings arising out of the administration of a tax law, which must include consideration of whether to commence such proceedings and acts ancillary to the preparation and conduct of such proceedings, such as these proceedings."" 
151Her Honour observed:
""I note that s 82(b)'s terms do not place a limit on 'any legal proceedings arising out of a taxation law' and therefore do not preclude these proceedings under the Crimes Act from its application. Section 82(b) does not say 'legal proceedings for a breach of a taxation law' and should not be read as so limited. Had the Parliament, giving consideration to the secrecy requirements necessary for the relevant taxation laws, wished to so limit the disclosure of information, it could have said so, but it did not. Section 85 does not say that tax officers are not permitted to disclose or produce relevant information in court. It says they are not required to. That secrecy provision is in my view, directed differently and for a different purpose. Section 85 must be read together with s 82, they coexisting in the same division. Section 85 does not restrict the ability of tax officers to disclose relevantly obtained information to a court for the purpose of legal proceedings such as these arising out of a taxation law. Therefore, the disclosure by the Office of State Revenue of the information and material obtained in its investigation of Ms Beckett and her legal practice was not unlawful.""
Applicant's submissions
152The applicant submitted that Sweeney DCJ erred in construing the secrecy provisions of the Taxation Administration Act and finding that material obtained in the compelled interview could be distributed to authorities who were not authorised to receive the material under the Taxation Administration Act.  The applicant submitted that ss 82 and 85 of the Taxation Administration Act exhaustively list the permitted disclosures and that the Crown Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions are not included in the list of persons to whom disclosure may be made.  The applicant submitted that the investigators had breached the Taxation Administration Act in disclosing the product of their investigation to the Crown Solicitor and Director of Public Prosecutions for the purpose of this criminal investigation. 
153The applicant submitted that, contrary to the findings of the trial judge, Parliament has placed a limitation on who could receive compelled material under the Taxation Administration Act and that the regime of the Act is limited to taxation law and does not have general application.  The applicant submitted that the purpose of this limitation is that for any proceedings to be preferred against a citizen, other than a proceeding under the Taxation Administration Act, it is required to be conducted by a proper independent authority such as the Police.  The applicant submitted that this is a reflection of the views expressed by McHugh J in Rogerson and the Court of Criminal Appeal in Einfeld.
Crown submissions
154The Crown submitted that these grounds of appeal must fail for a number of reasons.  The Crown pointed out that the OSR had retained the Crown Solicitor for the purposes of advice, as was authorised by the Legal Profession Act 2004, s 110.  That section provides that the Crown Solicitor may, in his or her official capacity, act as solicitor for an officer or employee of the Public Service or any other service of the State of New South Wales or of a body established by an Act or other law of New South Wales:  s 110(1)(e). 
155The Crown contended that the provision of information to the Crown Solicitor by the OSR pursuant to a retainer for legal advice is not a ""disclosure"" within the meaning of the Taxation Administration Act.  It noted that a solicitor retained by a client is the client's agent and is bound by the same obligations of confidentiality and privilege as bind the client.  In this regard, the relationship between the Crown Solicitor and the government client bears the same characteristics as between a private solicitor and client:  Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60; 158 CLR 500. 
156The Crown further submitted that, in this case, the disclosure of information to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the OSR was made pursuant to a request under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, s 17(2), compliance with which is compulsory, and thus fell within s 82(d) as a disclosure made ""in accordance with a required imposed, or an authorisation conferred, by or under an Act"".
157The Crown next submitted, as the primary judge found, that the disclosure was not prohibited because it was made for the purpose of obtaining advice in relation to the institution of legal proceedings arising out of a taxation law:  s 82(b).  In this regard, the Crown submitted that the prosecution of criminal conduct committed in the course of an investigation of breaches of a taxation law, and for the purpose of thwarting that investigation, is properly characterised as such a proceeding.
158Finally, the Crown submitted that the applicant's submission that all non-Taxation Administration Act proceedings are to be preferred by the New South Wales Police rather than the OSR should be rejected.  The Crown referred to the Criminal Procedure Act, s 14 which allows a prosecution to be instituted by any person unless the right is expressly conferred on a specified person, a limitation which is not applicable for breaches of the Crimes Act, ss 319 and 330.  
Consideration
159In my opinion, the applicant's submission advanced in support of grounds 6-9 should be rejected.  Whilst under s 71 a function conferred by the investigation provisions of Div 2, including s 72, may only be exercised for the purposes of a taxation law, the information which is obtained as a result of such an investigation may be disclosed to the persons and for the purposes identified in s 82.  This has already been discussed above at [140]-[141].  
160The further point should be made that whilst the provision of information to certain of the persons and entities specified in s 82 is restricted to a particular purpose:  see subparas (ix) and (xiii), there is no similar restraint in respect of the provision of information to the other persons and entities identified, including the Commissioner of Police, although the use that those persons and entities could make of the information would be constrained by the legislation  which governs their functions.  This would also be the case in respect of material provided pursuant to s 82(d), which is expressed in general terms. 
161At this point it is necessary to return to some history and to some further legislative provisions.  
162In December 2011, acting in his official capacity, Mr Morse, pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act, s 14, laid charges against the applicant in the Local Court by way of court attendance notices.  The charges were laid pursuant to the Taxation Administration Act alleging breaches of ss 41(2), 42(2) and 55(b) of that Act.  A charge of perverting the course of justice under the Crimes Act, s 319 was also laid.  The laying of the charges by Mr Morse was authorised by the Criminal Procedure Act, s 14.
163On 12 March 2013, the applicant was committed for trial in the District Court on the s 319 offence.  The Criminal Procedure Act, s 8(1) provides, relevantly, that all indictable offences are ""punishable by information (to be called an indictment) in ... the District Court ... in the name of ... the Director of Public Prosecutions"".
164On 15 March 2013, the applicant and the OSR were informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions had, pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, s 9, taken over the prosecution in the matter.  Section 9 provides:
""9 Taking over prosecutions or proceedings
(1) If a prosecution or proceeding in respect of an offence (whether it is an indictable offence or a summary offence) has been instituted by a person other than the Director, the Director may take over the matter and:
(a) carry on the prosecution or proceeding ...
...
(4) If the Director takes over a matter under this section:
(a) the Director shall, as from the time when the Director complies with section 10 (1) in relation to the matter, be deemed to be the prosecutor in connection with the prosecution or proceeding concerned, and(b) the Director may decline to proceed further in the prosecution or to carry the proceeding further ...""
165The Director of Public Prosecutions Act, s 17 provides:
""17 Provision of information to Director
(1) If a prosecution for an offence has been instituted by a person other than the Director and:
(a) the Director informs the person that the Director is considering taking over the prosecution,(b) the Director takes over the prosecution, or(c) the person considers that the Director should take over the prosecution,
the person shall furnish to the Director the relevant information or material.
(2) The relevant information or material is:
(a) a full report of the circumstances of the matter,(b) a copy of the statements of any witnesses,(c) each material document in the possession of the person, and(d) such other information or material as the Director requires.""
166On 21 June 2013, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed the indictment containing the two alternative charges under the Crimes Act in the District Court.  According to the Crown's submissions, the Taxation Administration Act offences were referred to the District Court as backup or related charges pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act, s 166, although no reference was otherwise made to those charges in the application before the Court.  The applicant was arraigned on the indictment on 9 December 2013 and pleaded not guilty to both charges on the indictment.  
167I have referred above to the circumstances in which a tax officer may disclose information obtained as a result of an examination under s 72.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is not named as a person or entity to whom disclosure may be made.  However, as the Crown correctly submitted, the information was provided to the Crown Solicitor for the purposes of obtaining legal advice in relation to the prosecution of the applicant as is permitted by the Legal Profession Act, s 110(1)(e).  In so acting, the Crown Solicitor was acting as the agent of the OSR:  see Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney & Northern Land Council.  The provision of information to the Crown Solicitor in those circumstances was not prohibited by s 81.  
168I also accept the Crown submission that disclosure to the Director of Public Prosecutions was authorised by s 82(d), being a disclosure made ""in accordance with a requirement imposed, or an authorisation conferred, by or under an Act"" namely, the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, s 17, set out above at [165].  It is sufficient to note that if the Director takes over a prosecution the person who instituted the prosecution is required to furnish the relevant information and material documents it has in its possession. 
Admissions:  grounds 10 and 11
Primary judge's reasoning
169The primary judge found that the compelled interview of the applicant was admissible pursuant to the Evidence Act, ss 55 and 58 because it contained statements relied on by the Crown to prove both offences and were clearly relevant to those offences.  Her Honour also found that the evidence was not otherwise excluded by the Evidence Act.  In this regard, her Honour's primary view was that the Evidence Act, s 90 did not apply to exclude the interview and its contents because the statements made in the interview were ""not admissions but are primary evidence relied on by the Crown as proof of the offences charged"".  Section 90 only relates to admissions. 
170In the alternative, Sweeney DCJ held that if any of the statements in the compelled interview were admissions, she would not exclude them under the Evidence Act, s 90.  According to her Honour: 
""... the decision in Attallah would seem to preclude the use of the interview in the trial being considered unfair to [the applicant] simply because it was obtained pursuant to the coercive power in s 72 Taxation Administration Act.""  (at 21)
171Sweeney DCJ stated that she did not consider DPP v Attallah [2001] NSWCA 171:
""... is restricted to the specific statutory provision in [the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988] under consideration therein, as [the applicant] contended, or to the situation there that the compulsory requirement to answer and the prosecution for false evidence both arose under the provisions of the same act, [the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act]. The principle cannot be so narrowly confined in my view."" 
Relevant legislation
172The Evidence Act, s 90 provides:
""90 Discretion to exclude admissions
In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:
(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.""
173The Dictionary of the Evidence Act states:
""admission means a previous representation that is:
(a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding), and(b) adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding.""
Applicant's submissions
174In respect of ground 10, the applicant submitted that the primary judge erred in finding that the allegedly stated falsehoods were not admissions, having erroneously adopted a semantic distinction between an admission and ""primary evidence"".  The applicant contended that the evidence relied on by the Crown were admissions by the applicant against interest.  The applicant submitted that the courts have taken a broad view of the term ""admission"", extending it to facts inferred from words or conduct:  R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426, 104 A Crim R 306 at 317;  R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442; 105 A Crim R 27 at 42;  R v Adam [1999] NSWCCA 189; 106 A Crim R 510.  The applicant submitted that if the statements were not admissions against interest then this material was irrelevant and not probative of any issue in any trial of the applicant. 
175In respect of ground 11, the applicant submitted that the primary judge erred in her interpretation and application of the principle in Attallah.  The applicant submitted that the issue in Attallah was whether compelled evidence given before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) could be used in a prosecution under the Independent Commissions Against Corruption Act 1988, s 87.  The applicant accepted that whilst material obtained under compulsion may be used for the purposes of charges brought under the enabling Act, it cannot be used for the purposes of charges under other Acts.  In this regard, the applicant submitted that on a correct application of Attallah to this case, the compelled record of interview could be used by authorities for a prosecution under the Taxation Administration Act but not for a prosecution under the Crimes Act.
Crown's submissions
176The Crown submitted that the primary judge's characterisation of the statements as primary evidence and not as admissions was correct.  The Crown submitted that the false documents and the statements made in the interview are the conduct the subject of the charge.  The Crown submitted that just as CCTV footage of an offence is not regarded as an ""admission"", the applicant's acts and statements were not ""representations"" in the manner used in the Evidence Act.  The Crown contended that to treat them as an ""admission"" would distort the meaning of both those words:  see R v G [2005] NSWCCA 291 at [19] ff.
177The Crown submitted that if the conduct and statements were capable of being admissions, the primary judge did not err in in the exercise of her discretion in refusing to exclude the evidence under s 90 because the circumstances did not make it unfair to use the evidence.  The Crown emphasised that the applicant is a solicitor, that she was cautioned, that she was told that she may be referred to the Crown Solicitor, that it was an offence to give false or misleading information, and that she did not exercise her right to silence.  The Crown submitted that, as was the case in R v Frangulis [2006] NSWCCA 363 and Higgins v R [2007] NSWCCA 56, there was no evidence that the applicant was led to believe that what she said in the interview could not be used against her. 
178The Crown also submitted that Attallah is authority for the proposition that where there is a statutory scheme which permits questioning under compulsion and in the same statute makes provision for prosecution for false statements made during that questioning, s 90 will not operate in the absence of some unfairness other than the operation of the statutory scheme.  The Crown also submitted that a difference in the choice of charge cannot of itself give rise to the type of unfairness to which s 90 is directed.
Consideration
179In my opinion, there was no error in her Honour's characterisation of the statements made by the applicant in the course of the compelled interview, that the two bank cheques were available to her for payment of stamp duty prior to the generation of the notice of assessment of stamp duty, as the primary evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely.  Those statements were allegedly false statements as to when she had obtained the cheques and are the subject matter of the charge on the second count in the indictment.  The authorities to which the applicant referred all involved statements made by an accused person charged with an offence that did not involve the falsity of the statement itself.  Rather, the statements made were said to be exculpatory, and therefore to constitute a consciousness of guilt of the offence charged.  
180Horton provides an example.  The appellant in that case was convicted of murdering the deceased by stabbing him in the chest.  The principal issue concerned the intent of the appellant, who was heavily intoxicated with alcohol.  The police constable who had attended the scene of the crime gave evidence that, when he asked the appellant what had happened, she had replied that the deceased ""fell on the knife"".  That statement was not recorded.  The Crown relied upon that evidence to show that, despite the quantity of alcohol that had been consumed, the appellant was not particularly affected by it as she was capable of furnishing an exculpatory statement and so was functioning cognitively. 
181The issue on appeal was whether the statement ought to have been excluded under the Crimes Act, s 424A(2) which provided that evidence of an admission was not admissible without a tape recording of that admission or an adoption of that admission in a later interview, unless the prosecution could establish a reasonable excuse as to why such a tape recording could not be made.  That raised the question whether the statement made to the police constable was an ""admission"". 
182Wood CJ at CL, with whom Sully and Ireland JJ agreed, looked to the meaning of ""admission"" in the Evidence Act, which he considered to be cognate with the meaning of ""admission"" in the Crimes Act.  His Honour noted that the definition in the dictionary to the Evidence Act was wide enough to include any form of representation, whether by conduct or by oral or written statement, so long as it was adverse to the maker's interest in the outcome of the proceedings.  His Honour also resisted a narrow construction of the expression on the basis that the provision was protective legislation.  His Honour therefore concluded that the term ""admission"" included exculpatory statements that may turn out to be harmful for the defence, and accordingly that the evidence of the appellant's statement to police should not have been admitted.  The Court quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial.  See also Esposito at 458 per Wood CJ at CL, James and Adams JJ agreeing on this point.  
183Esposito also involved a murder charge and also concerned statements that were relied upon as ""constituting an implied admission of guilt, even though they were on their face exculpatory"".  The appellant was charged with the murder of the deceased.  The Crown case was that the appellant, in the company of two other men, stabbed the deceased while committing a robbery.  At issue in the trial was the appellant's ability to form the relevant intention given her consumption of a large quantity of drugs.  The appellant gave a statement to the police in which she denied being in Kings Cross at about the time of the stabbing or to knowing anything about it.  The answers were relied upon as admissions by conduct, in that by providing an exculpatory account for the night's events, she had lied and displayed a consciousness of guilt.  
184Both Horton and Esposito are an example of the principle stated in Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 where Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ had held, at 210, that:
""Although guilt must ultimately be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, an alleged admission constituted by the telling of a lie may be considered together with the other evidence and for that purpose does not have to be proved to any particular standard of proof.""
See also R v Taylor (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 18 April 1995) per Hunt CJ at CL;  R v Dellapatrona (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 150;  R v Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 181;  R v Small (1994) 33 NSWLR 575 at 596. 
185The Crown referred to authorities of this Court where the principle in Edwards has been applied.  It is not necessary to discuss that line of authority, which involved the application of the principle to the particular facts.  This case is different, as I have explained, in that the applicant's allegedly false statements are the subject of the charge itself.  
186As I have concluded that the statements made by the applicant which are the subject of the charge were not admissions, it is not necessary to determine whether her Honour erred in her interpretation of the decision in Attallah which her Honour only considered should it be found that the statements made by the applicant which are the subject of the charge were not admissions.  I would only make the observation that I am of the opinion that it is apparent from the wide range of persons to whom information obtained in the course of a compelled investigation under the Taxation Administration Act may be disclosed, that should an 'admission' be made in the course thereof it would not necessarily be inadmissible in proceedings for a different offence. 
187I would reject grounds 10 and 11. 
Conclusion 
188In the result, I consider the charge laid under s 319 should be permanently stayed but that the appeal should otherwise be dismissed.  Accordingly, I propose the following orders.  
(1) Grant leave to appeal;  
(2) Order that count 1 on the indictment be permanently stayed;  
(3) Otherwise dismiss the appeal.

		12 December 2014",2014-12-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704077,R v Colin Maxwell Farrow [2014] NSWSC 1781,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: By Motion, notice of which was filed and served on 30 October 2014, the accused, Colin Maxwell Farrow (the applicant) applies for an order that the trial allocated to me for hearing be heard by a judge alone and not by jury. The Crown opposes that course. 
2The applicant is charged with murder, said to have been committed at Wollongong on 11 April 2013. 
3The applicant relies upon the affidavit of Joanne Harris, solicitor. The trial is due to commence on 2 February 2015. 
4The affidavit states that the sole issue for determination at trial is limited to whether the applicant has available to him a defence of mental illness. There are psychiatric reports filed and upon which each of the Crown and the applicant relies. 
5The applicant relies upon four reports of Dr Westmore dated 16 September 2013, 29 March 2014, 23 August 2014 and 15 November 2014. The Crown relies upon the reports of Professor Greenberg dated 26 April 2014 and 7 September 2014. 
6It is necessary to set out the facts as the Crown alleges them, at least in summary form, for the purpose of revealing the nature of the trial and the evidence that may need to be adduced. 
Facts
7In the early afternoon of Thursday 11 April 2013, members of the public called the police reporting a motor vehicle being driven erratically in the Tarrawanna area. The vehicle was described and its behaviour described. 
8Shortly after the calls were received, a witness took a number of photographs of a male who exited the car after mounting a nature strip, entering a grass reserve and careering down a grass hill stopping just before the creek. 
9Police attended, viewed the photographs and the vehicle, which was locked and secured. The front passenger tyre of the vehicle had disintegrated. 
10At about 5.20pm on 11 April 2013, police attended at the address of the owner of the vehicle. On arrival, a neighbour approached the police with concerns for the welfare of the resident, because she had not collected her son from school that afternoon. 
11While at the address, police observed a red substance, believed to be blood, on the carpet outside the unit and in common areas. Police forced entry into the unit with the assistance of fire brigade personnel that had been contacted. Inside the residence police observed further amounts of red substance believed to be blood and what looked like drag marks. 
12Police then returned to the reserve and the motor vehicle, opened the boot of the motor vehicle and found the naked body of a deceased female. It was wrapped in bedding linen. The female's hands were bound at the rear; she was gagged with gaffe tape and tied up with rope. The victim had multiple stab wounds, predominately around the chest and neck area, and her head was covered with a pair of boxer shorts. 
13Police identified the victim by use of finger prints and, on examination of the interior of the vehicle located a mobile phone that was later identified as belonging to the applicant. Police also discovered a pick and shovel on the backseat of the vehicle and a number of bags containing various items. The applicant purchased the pick and shovel from Bunning's Warehouse in Wollongong earlier that day. 
14The applicant and the deceased were known to each other, having been introduced by mutual friends some 6 to 9 months earlier. Apparently, the applicant and another visited the deceased to obtain drugs. 
15The evidence establishes a link between the applicant and the gaffe tape, electrical tape and rope similar to or identical to the items used on the deceased and other equipment found in the motor vehicle. Evidence also establishes that the applicant had sought to withdraw money from his bank account but there were insufficient funds. 
16Within a couple of days of the discovery of the body, police executed a search warrant on the premises at which the applicant resided and discovered in a common area, downstairs from the room occupied, what they believed to be trail of blood. In the room rented by the applicant, police located various documents bearing the applicant's name with sharpening stone, further lengths of gaffe tape, various knives and other implements. 
17Also located in the room occupied by the applicant was a handwritten note, containing details of what police suggest are three different person, one of which is the deceased, with notations suggesting the advantages and disadvantages of causing harm to each or all of them. There was also a handwritten list of items being mask, gaffe tape, gloves, pliers, garbage bags, hacksaw and blades, spades/entrenching tool and a bottle of ammonia. The list finishes off with ""Be THOROUGH, Be METHODICAL and most of all, BE CAREFUL"".
18The aforesaid list and note are, it is said by the Crown, matters that go to pre-meditation and planning by the accused. 
19The accused was arrested on 17 April 2013. 
20The affidavit of Ms Harris, read on the Motion, and uncontested, attests to the fact that the only issue in the proceedings and the sole issue for determination at trial is whether the applicant has available to him a defence of mental illness. 
21As earlier noted, there is a difference of opinion between the experts. Dr Westmore, I am informed, has significant availability issues associated with the trial, which availability issues are not of his own making and relate to certain health issues. It is unnecessary to detail the health aspects of which the Court has been informed. 
22The Crown, most appropriately and reasonably, made it clear that they would, in any jury trial, accommodate those availability questions. The attitude of the Crown is to be commended and applauded. It is necessary for me to determine the matter on the basis of principle. 
Principles to be Applied
23An application of this kind is governed by the provision of s 132(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act is in the following terms:
""s 132 Orders for trial by Judge alone 
(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a trial by judge order)
(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.
(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.
(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.
(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.
(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.
(7) The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that:
(a) there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and
(b) the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.""
24As stated earlier, the Crown does not agree to the applicant being tried by judge alone, as a consequence of which the Court must consider whether ""it is in the interests of justice"" for the trial to be conducted by judge alone. The principles were discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; (2012) 217 A Crim R 1 (see also R v King [2013] NSWSC 448; (2013) 228 A Crim R 406; R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661; R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124; R v Villalon [2013] NSWSC 1516; R v McKnight [2014] NSWSC 398; and R v Gittany [2013] NSWSC 1503).
25In R v Gittany, McCallum J summarised the principles in the following passage:
""[5] Section 132(5) provides:
(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the Court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.
[6] In the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; (2012) A Crim R 1, McClellan CJ at CL expressed the view (at [96]) that s 131 does not have the effect of creating a presumption that a criminal trial should be with a jury, casting a burden of proof on an accused person to establish otherwise. The extent to which those particular remarks carried the agreement of the other two members of the court is unclear. Each agreed with his Honour that the primary judge had fallen into error but preferred to express no concluded view as to 'the wider issues raised by the question of whether a trial should be by jury or by judge alone': at [117] per Hidden J; at [122] per Hislop J.
[7] In a short statement of additional remarks, Hidden J thought it unhelpful to speak about presumption or an onus, noting that the scheme of the statute is to require the accused to raise material leading to the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to depart from that mode of trial. His Honour also noted that, whilst the institution of trial by jury has historically been for the protection of the accused, the statute recognises that there is a community interest in trial by jury which in a particular case might override the accused's preference for a judge alone trial. In that context, his Honour adopted the remarks of Chesterman JA in R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317 at [81] that an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone 'for the asking'.
[8] However, in R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124, a unanimous Court of Criminal Appeal cited the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Belghar at [96] as authority for the proposition that 'the interplay of ss 131 and 132 should not be regarded as creating a presumption in favour of trial by jury which must be rebutted before an order for trial by judge alone may be made': per Barr AJ at [42]; Macfarlan JA and Campbell J agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively; and see R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [52] per Latham J. Accordingly, that must now be taken to be a binding statement of principle.
[9] It is acknowledged that the accused does bear an evidentiary burden: see Stanley at [42] and Dean at [52].""
26As is made clear from the foregoing, the provisions of s 132(4) relating to the considerations of the ""interests of justice"" are qualified by the consideration that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards including reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. 
27None of the issues for determination in this trial require aspects of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness or issues of that kind. Nevertheless, the Crown submits that an examination of the expert reports shows that the determination of the mental illness defence will depend not only on the reconciliation of or preference for one or more of the experts, but the determination of the genuineness or disingenuous of the applicant's purported psychiatric symptoms. 
Consideration
28There is no doubt that a judge alone trial will be more expeditiously determined (at least measured by the time taken to adduce the evidence) than would be the determination of a jury. At the moment there are potentially 155 witnesses of the Crown. 
29If the matter were to proceed by judge alone, it is likely that most, if not all, of the evidence relating to objective facts can be adduced by the calling of no more than 10 witnesses. Such a process is unlikely if the matter were to be conducted as a jury trial. 
30Nevertheless, the importance of the jury in the finalisation of and determination of criminal guilt is an important factor. I do not suggest that judge alone trials must be exceptional, but a jury trial not only involves a degree of finality recognised by the law, it also involves the involvement of the community in the determination of criminal conduct. That latter aspect is important to the interests of justice and the administration of justice. That factor must be weighed into the equation in an issue of this kind. 
31The objective facts (i.e. the facts other than the issues related to the mental health of the applicant) involve a number of matters that create issues in the jury trial. First, it involves an extremely violent and seemingly confronting offence, even by murder standards. 
32Secondly, it involves evidence as to the use of drugs and the process of dealing in drugs by the applicant and the deceased. 
33Thirdly, one of the defences of the applicant (as it applies to the previously mentioned note), which remains a matter even on the issue of mental illness, is the prior criminal conduct of the accused and his tendency and life as a ""thief"". 
34All of the foregoing are matters that are and will be the subject of jury trials from time to time. Further, most of the foregoing are matters that may be the subject of a criminal trial, even if they were all to combine in one trial, as is the case in these proceedings. 
35The question of the duration of the trial, while a matter for the administration of justice, in my view ought not, by itself, be given great weight in the balance or weighing exercise that must be involved in determining the issues under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Otherwise, all trials would be by judge alone. 
36Notoriously, a jury trial takes longer because counsel cannot assume an experience in the issues to be tried that can be assumed when the matter is being dealt with by judge alone. 
37As the Crown correctly asserts, the question of whether the applicant is, in this case, genuine in his statement of symptoms is a matter in which juries are invariably involved in criminal trials. It is not a matter which peculiarly, or even preferably, should be determined by a trial judge.  
38Nevertheless, it seems that the most crucial issue to be determined is the resolution of the different opinions expressed by the expert witnesses. While that may be determined on the basis of a finding of disingenuousness in the applicant; it may not.
39In a matter such as this, where the crucial matter is the mental illness of the applicant and there is competing expert evidence involving, to some extent, acceptance of the genuineness of the symptoms, a jury verdict will not provide the basis for the finding of guilt, if guilt were to be found, which may, itself, in a case such as this, render the process unfair to the applicant and otherwise than in the interests of justice. 
40Of itself, such a factor would not satisfy me that a judge alone trial should be conducted. However, where the issue may fall to be determined on the basis of which of two experts is to be preferred and one of those experts, even with the cooperation of the Crown, will have serious availability issues and may, if common experience can be utilised, be under some serious inconvenience during the giving of evidence, there is a real danger that the jury will determine the matter not on the basis of the expert evidence, but on the basis of the ability of one or other of the experts to give evidence that is more compelling or convincing in an irrelevant sense. 
41My preference, in criminal trials, is for guilt to be determined by a jury and not by a judge sitting alone. Nevertheless, in the circumstances of these proceedings, which include the fact that no issue is to be determined, other than the mental illness of the applicant, and the indisposition of the expert witness qualified by the applicant I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the matter be heard by judge alone. While some aspects of the factual issues may require the application of objective community standards, I do not, as a consequence thereof, refuse to make an order of the kind required by that satisfaction. 
42The Court makes the following orders and directions:
(1)The trial of Colin Maxwell Farrow on the charge of murdering Linda Jane Stevens be heard and determined by judge alone, pursuant to the terms of s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986;
(2)The Crown and counsel for the accused confer as to the most convenient course for adducing evidence of facts not to be controverted in the course of the proceedings;
(3)The trial of Colin Maxwell Farrow, for the aforesaid charge, be heard commencing 10am 3 February 2015;
(4)The parties have liberty to apply on 3 days' notice.

2704078,Lu v R [2014] NSWCCA 307,"Judgment
1PRICE J: I agree with McCallum J. 
2McCALLUM J:  Eric Lu seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court after he was found guilty by a jury of 21 counts of cheating or defrauding being a director of a company contrary to s 176A of the Crimes Act 1900.  The applicant was arraigned on an indictment that contained 22 counts contrary to that section but one was the subject of a verdict of not guilty by direction.  The indictment also contained one count of obtaining money by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Act of which the applicant was also found guilty.
3The offences contrary to s 176A carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.  The offence contrary to s 178BA carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.  No standard non-parole period was prescribed in respect of either offence.    
4The offences were committed over a period of more than 3 years.  There were 11 separate victims.  As noted by the sentencing judge, the amounts defrauded ranged from $8,000 (count 20) to $300,000 (count 4).  However, the victim of the charge relating to $8,000 was defrauded a total of $207,845 (counts 19 and 20) while the victim of the $300,000 fraud was defrauded a total of $385,000 (counts 3 and 4).  The total amount defrauded in the s 176A offences was almost $2.163 million.  One of the victims lost two houses he had purchased with a compensation payout received after a serious car accident.  One was an elderly man who lost his life savings and had to go on an old age pension.  One lost the property he bought with what remained of his assets after a divorce.  As a result of the divorce he had become severely depressed and was on a disability pension.  Another elderly couple, parents of eight children, lost all the property they owned and had to postpone their retirement.
5The circumstances of the offences were summarised comprehensively by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence.  The following is taken verbatim from those remarks:
""In 2004, the offender, with three others as directors, started a group which was called the Dollar Group Pty Limited.  Initially, the main business activity was that of a mortgage loan broker. During the trial, this side of the business became known as the ""mortgage side of the Dollar Group business"".  The offender was the principal and driving force of the Dollar Group at its commencement.
In 2005 the Dollar Group was in financial difficulty. The evidence indicated that it was earning virtually no money.  The original investors/directors had determined that it was not a viable concern.  A number of them left.
As a way of expanding the business, the offender introduced what became known as, ""The investment side"", of the Dollar Group business.  The offender began promoting to potential clients, the idea that they could invest money through the Dollar Group with ""Perpetual"".  Neither the offender nor Dollar Group had any investment relationship with Perpetual.  The purported relationship between clients, the Dollar Group and ""Perpetual"" was a fiction created by the offender.
The offender supervised the creation of ""investment forms"", ""investment guides"", ""prior disclosure type documents"", which all contained multiple references to Perpetual.  He would hand these to would-be investors with the intention of convincing them that their investment through the Dollar Group would be into Perpetual.  The purpose was clearly to suggest to the investors that the investment that they were making was a ""blue chip"" investment; that it was a guaranteed investment and that it was an investment with a long established and reputable financial institution.  Therefore there was no possibility that the investment would fail or that they - that is the investors -  would lose their money.
The offender dealt with these investment clients predominantly himself although administrative matters were occasionally dealt with by other people in the group.  He negotiated interest rates, terms and amounts.  He had the relevant documentation for the investment signed by the client and he arranged the transfer of funds into specific accounts which he nominated.  
The offender relied on his personal relationship with the clients, on his sales expertise and on the trust that they reposed in him to persuade them to invest significant sums of money.  Often these moneys were their life savings, their retirement funds and essentially their ""nest eggs"".
When the investments were not handed over in cash (as was the case in count 16, 17, 18 and 20), they were handed over by cheque or a bank transfer.  All of these ended up in five accounts controlled by the offender. While one of these accounts was a Dollar Group account (in count 3) the other four accounts were personal accounts (either in the offender's name, that is in counts 1,2, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21 and 22) or his then girlfriend or de facto wife's name, namely count 11.
The moneys received were not forwarded to Perpetual or invested in any way in any associated entity with Perpetual.  The moneys were dispersed at the direction of the offender for various private purposes and to continue the Dollar Group entity.  Initially, out of these moneys received came periodic payments of ""interest"" to clients and the return of investment capital.  In this way the offender operated a scheme dependent on its very existence on the creation of new investments to fund the interest payments on existing investments and to return capital where promised. Schemes of this nature are known as ""Ponzi schemes"".  They rely on a continuing sham enterprise where what should be the return on capital, is in fact capital from other investors.  This, ""investment scheme"", ran into difficulties in 2007 and collapsed altogether in 2008.
Where there were difficulties with arrangements or payments or lack of payments, the offender constantly re-assured the investors that everything was ok and that there must be something wrong at the other end of the scheme.  He knew full well that it was his scheme which was not operating.  He knew that it had nothing to do with external entities and everything to do with his own arrangements.  He continued, as has been indicated, in 2008 to promote the scheme long after it became obvious that it was failing.""
6The offence of obtaining money by deception (count 23) was based on the applicant's sale of his Mercedes car for $30,000.  The applicant deceived his uncle into believing that he owned the vehicle and that it was not subject to finance.  It was repossessed from the uncle by a finance company.
7The applicant was born in Vietnam.  His family fled from that country by boat when he was very young.  He came to Australia when he was eight.  He found it difficult to adjust because of his different cultural background and the fact that he did not speak English.
8The applicant had previously worked with the Commonwealth Bank.  He had a prior conviction for dishonesty from his time as an employee of the bank. 
9The sentencing judge took into account the fact that the applicant was assaulted in 2008 as a result of the present offences. There was evidence before the judge that the applicant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of that assault.  
10The judge imposed an aggregate sentence in respect of all of the offences, as allowed under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  As required under s 53A(2) of the Act, his Honour indicated the sentences that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed, as follows:  
As to counts 15 and 20, a sentence of 18 months each;
As to count 23 (the offence of obtaining money by deception), a sentence of 2 years;
As to counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 22, a sentence of 2 years and 6 months;
As to counts 6, 10, 13, 19 and 21, a sentence of 3 years;
For count 4, a sentence of 4 years.
11The differences between the indicative sentences appear primarily to reflect the amount defrauded.
12On the basis of the applicant's physical impairments and his post-traumatic stress disorder, the judge made a finding of special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory ratio of the non-parole period and the balance of term.   After considering the issue of totality and the need for accumulation, the judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.  
13The first ground of appeal is:
""The sentencing judge erred by finding that the applicant's abuse of a position of trust was an aggravating feature of the section 176A offences.""
14This ground relates to 21 counts (excluding count 23).  
15The applicant relied on the following remarks of the sentencing judge (at ROS 9.8 and 11.2):
""He abused his position of trust in the Dollar Group, he held himself out as I have indicated as a person with expertise and then defrauded the people who came to him to rely upon his expertise. They reposed trust in him, he abused that trust. I find that to be an aggravating feature.
There is significant public interest in firstly generally deterring persons who are in a position of trust, particularly when they are custodians of other peoples' money.  It is important to demonstrate to them that they must behave honestly, and act as true trustees of that money.""
16It is clear from those remarks that his Honour regarded an element of abuse of a position of trust in relation to the victims as an aggravating factor of the kind referred to in s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  In my respectful opinion, his Honour's approach to that issue was entirely correct.
17As contended on behalf of the applicant, the establishment of an aggravating factor of abusing a position of trust requires more than the fact that the victim trusted the offender in the ordinary sense of that word: cf R v Suleman [2009] NSWCCA 70 at [18] to [28] per Howie J; McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop CJ agreeing.  The abuse of ""a position of trust"" invites consideration of the character of the relationship between the offender and the victim rather than the subjective state of mind of the victim.
18The applicant relied upon the fact that it is an element of the section 176A offence that the offender was a director of the company.  Section 176A (now repealed) provided:
""Whosever, being a director, officer, or member of any body corporate or public company, cheats or defrauds, or does or omits to do any act with intent to cheat or defraud, the body corporate or company or any person in his or her dealings with the body corporate or company shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years.""
19The burden of the submission was that the element of trust relied upon by the sentencing judge as an aggravating factor was an element of the offence.  The applicant sought to derive support for that submission from the decision of this Court in R v Martin [2005] NSWCCA 190.  In that case, the offender was sentenced for the offence of being a trustee fraudulently disposing of property contrary to s 172 of the Crimes Act.  The Court held that the sentencing judge had erred by having additional regard, as an aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(k), to the fact that the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim.
20I do not think that decision governs the issue raised in the present case. In Martin, there was plainly a complete overlap between the element of the offence (being a trustee) and the aggravating factor relied upon by the sentencing judge.  The present case is more complex.  At the proceedings on sentence, the Crown Prosecutor noted that the applicant was using the ""prestige and status"" of the body corporate to persuade clients to invest.  In particular, the prospectuses and product disclosure statements were provided not on behalf of Mr Lu as a person but by him as a principal of the company.  In my view, that aspect of the relationship between the applicant and the victims is properly understood as being comprehended within the applicant's role as a director of the company, and therefore not properly regarded as an aggravating factor.
21However, not all company directors accept other peoples' money for the purpose of investment.  That was the essence of the position of trust abused in the present case.  As noted by the learned sentencing judge, the applicant was not ""simply selling widgets"".  He held himself out as a financial advisor and received money on trust in the sense in which that term is used in the context of fiduciary relationships.  I do not mean to suggest that that is the only sense in which the word ""trust"" is used in the phrase ""a position of trust"" in s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, but in my view it is plainly one.  The abuse of a position of trust in the present case, over and above the fact of the applicant's being a director of the company, was the fact that he held himself out as a financial advisor and was entrusted with other peoples' money on the strength of the representations he made in that capacity.  In my view, his relationship with the victims falls squarely within the kind of relationship considered in R v Martin at [40] (referred to by Howie J in Suleman at [25]):
""With respect to general fraud or dishonesty offences, where breach of trust is not an essential element of the offence, common law sentencing principles have recognised that abuse of a position of trust, where it exists on the facts of a particular case, is an aggravating factor on sentence. Examples of this include the following: 
(a)  larceny as a servant contrary to s.156 Crimes Act 1900 by a senior accounts clerk: R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330; 
(b) fraudulently omitting to account contrary to s.178A Crimes Act 1900 by a real estate agent: R v Woodman [2001] NSWCCA 310 at paragraphs 14-15; 
(c)  making false accounting entries contrary to s.158 Crimes Act 1900 and using a false instrument to the prejudice of another contrary to s.300 Crimes Act 1900 by a bank employee: R v El-Rashid (CCA(NSW), 7 April 1995, BC9504681 at page 4); 
(d)  defrauding the Commonwealth Bank contrary to s.29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) by a bank loans manager: R v Chaloner (1990) 49 A Crim R 370 at 375; and 
(e)  offences by a solicitor comprising forging of documents contrary to s.67B Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s.29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), forging and uttering bills and notes contrary to s.273 Crimes Act 1900, fraudulent misappropriation contrary to s.178A Crimes Act 1900: R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 436. 
In cases such as these, where breach of trust is not an element of the offence, there is scope for s.21A(2)(k) to permit a court to have ""additional regard"" to the abuse of a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim as an aggravating factor on sentence. This reflects the position at common law.""
22In my view ground 1 must be rejected.
23Ground 2 is:
The aggregate sentence and the aggregate non-parole period is manifestly excessive.
24That this was an extremely serious course of offending cannot be doubted.  The thrust of the submission on this ground was that the penalty exceeds ""available comparative sentences"".  The Crown correctly responded by observing that previous cases do not establish the ""available range"":  Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2 at [28].  No issue was taken (or could be taken) with his Honour's indicative sentences.  Once the appropriateness of the individual sentences indicated by his Honour is acknowledged, in my view the suggestion that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive must fail.  
25The orders I propose are:
(1)That leave to appeal be allowed.
(2)That the appeal be dismissed.
26R A HULME J: I agree with McCallum J.

		31 December 2014",2014-12-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704081,R v James; James v R [2014] NSWCCA 311,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  There are two matters before the Court arising out of the sentencing of Mr James on a charge of being an accessory after the fact to an aggravated robbery.  The first appeal was brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5DA(1).  That section confers a right of appeal to this Court ""against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking.""
2In the second matter, the offender sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed for that offence.  The offender was sentenced on 26 November 2013.  The alleged failure to comply with the undertaking was said to have occurred on 13 May 2014 when the offender ""declined to give evidence"" against a co-accused.  The Director's appeal was lodged promptly on 20 May 2014.  The offender's application for leave to appeal against sentence (mistitled ""Notice of Appeal"") was only filed on 20 November 2014, that is, less than two weeks before the hearing in this Court.  The delay in filing the application for leave to appeal was not explained, but counsel advised the Court that relevant extensions of time had been granted and that the last had not expired.  That may be accepted.
3The principal ground of the offender's appeal was that the sentencing judge erred by commencing his calculation with ""the notional starting point of the sentence as five years being the maximum penalty for the offence.""  The Crown Prosecutor presented (understandably) little more than token resistance to this ground.  Where a person is serving a non-parole period of 20 months and there is a simple challenge to the sentence, the administration of justice requires that the appeal be listed promptly. 
4The difficulty was resolved in the present case because the Court was able to deal at the hearing with both the Director's appeal and the application by the offender.  Orders were made which resulted in the offender being entitled to immediate release on parole.  Reasons were reserved.
5I agree with the reasons given by McCallum J both with respect to the Director's appeal and with respect to the offender's application.  The following observations concern the unsatisfactory statutory provision with respect to the circumstances addressed in s 5DA.
Section 5DA - failure to fulfil undertaking6Section 5DA was inserted in the Criminal Appeal Act by an amendment in May 1992: Criminal Legislation (Amendment) Act 1992 (NSW), Sch 3(2).  It was, no doubt, at least in part a response to the express recognition in recent decisions of this Court that an offender may obtain leniency on the ground that he or she cooperated with law enforcement authorities and, further, had indicated a willingness to cooperate in the future: see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243; R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220.  (The difficulties which can arise in giving effect to these principles were noted in Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 88 ALJR at [30] by French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ.)  In Regina v O'Brien (Court of Criminal Appeal, 10 June 1993, unreported), Gleeson CJ stated:
""A practical difficulty that arises from time to time concerns cases in which offenders, in return for offers to co-operate with law enforcement authorities, have received reduced sentences on that account, and have subsequently failed to comply with their undertakings.  In some circumstances where the offer of future assistance has been an offer to give evidence, and an offender has actually or constructively refused to give evidence when the occasion arose, the offender might expose himself to charges of contempt of court, or of perjury.  More commonly, however, the problem has arisen in the context of attempts by the prosecuting authorities to have this Court intervene to correct or adjust the original sentence so that it reflects the sentence that would have been imposed if the offer of assistance had not been made. In such cases difficult questions have arisen as to the conditions which must be satisfied before the Court may intervene.  It was in an endeavour to meet those difficulties that s 5DA was enacted.""
7After noting that the power conferred by s 5DA(2) was discretionary, Gleeson CJ noted that ""problems may arise as to the exercise of the discretion"", for example, where an offender refuses to cooperate because of duress.  He continued:
""The purpose of s 5DA is not punitive.  The purpose is to enable this Court in an appropriate case, and to an appropriate extent, to intervene to adjust or correct a sentence where the sentencing process can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, to have miscarried by reason of the circumstances set out in the section.""
8Read in context, the comment that the section was not ""punitive"" should be understood as meaning that the offender was not to be punished for submitting to duress.  Put neutrally, the offender has, by his or her own conduct, become disentitled to a benefit which had been conferred on the basis of a future contingency which has not come to pass.  The public interest pursuant to which the benefit was conferred has been lost, but the offender was under no obligation, it may be assumed, to act in the public interest.  
9In another sense, however, the effect of intervention by the Court is undoubtedly punitive: in circumstances where a discount of up to 25% may be granted for assistance to authorities, some or all of which may relate to future assistance, the failure to fulfil an undertaking may result in a significant extension of a custodial sentence.  This may be highly relevant in circumstances where there is a factual dispute as to whether the power in s 5DA is engaged.  The offender submitted that the Director needed to prove non-fulfilment to the criminal standard.
10The attraction to an offender of the benefit which may be obtained by proffering assistance to law enforcement authorities, combined with the very real possibility that the assistance will not ultimately be forthcoming, has resulted over the last 22 years in a significant number of cases in which s 5DA has been invoked by the Director.  There have, however, been very few cases in which there has been a factual dispute as to whether the section was engaged.
11Broadly speaking, factual disputes may arise at four points, namely:
(a)whether an undertaking has been given;(b)the content of the undertaking;(c)the discount given for the undertaking, and(d)whether the undertaking has not been fulfilled.
12The first two disputes will often arise together.  An issue which arose in O'Brien was whether an undertaking needed to be in written form: the Court held that it did not.  If there is no written undertaking, there may well be disputes as to whether an undertaking has in fact been given, and as to the related issue, namely its content.  Although there may be some expectation that further assistance will be forthcoming (by giving evidence against co-offenders), either no undertaking had been given or not one as to the content of which the Court could be satisfied: Regina v Stavropoulos [2007] NSWCCA 333.  In the course of giving the principal reasons in that case Hall J, at [57], set out the terms of a commonly used form of undertaking.  It is common practice now for an undertaking to be given in writing, although that may not always occur.
13So far as the third issue is concerned, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) expressly requires that a court imposing a lesser sentence on account of assistance to authorities must state, where a discount is given for both past and promised future assistance, the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason: s 23(4)(c).  Absent such an indication, in a case where the undertaking has not been fulfilled, this Court is significantly hampered in determining by what amount the sentence should be increased.
14As explained by McCallum J, this case turned on the ability of the Director to prove the fourth factual element, namely that the undertaking had not been fulfilled.  The procedure for varying a sentence, pursuant to s 5DA, is fraught with difficulties where such an issue requires resolution.  Some difficulties arise at the factual level: this Court is an inappropriate forum for the determination of factual disputes.  The procedure appears to have worked in the past because there have been few factual disputes and certainly none, so far as this Court or the parties are aware, as to whether there has been a failure to honour the undertaking.  On one view, which the Court was not prepared to entertain, the dispute as to the telephone conversation between two prosecution officers and the offender could only be resolved by each of three people giving oral evidence and being cross-examined.
15The second kind of difficulty is one of a principled nature.  Because the consequence of failing to give an undertaking may be a significant increase in the offender's penalty, it is unsatisfactory that both factual and discretionary issues should be dealt with for the first time in this Court, from which there is no right of appeal.  Indeed, as most cases will involve no issue of general principle, there is no real likelihood of any challenge to the order made by this Court: cf Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 35A.
Non-publication order16At the outset of the hearing of the appeal the Court made an order suppressing publication of the identity of the offender.  Given the circumstances as to the trial of the co-offender and the order for the release of the offender on parole, the Court cannot be satisfied that such an order remains reasonably necessary, as required by the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), ss 7 and 8.  Accordingly the order made on 3 December 2014 should be revoked.
17McCALLUM J:  On 26 November 2013, Dean James was sentenced for an offence of being an accessory after the fact to an aggravated robbery.  The sentence was reduced by 25 per cent for assistance to law enforcement authorities, as allowed under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The reduction appears to have reflected both past assistance and an undertaking to give assistance in the future.  
18On 3 December 2014, the Court heard two appeals against that decision.  One was an appeal by the Crown under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the ground that the offender failed to fulfil the undertaking as to future assistance.  The second was an appeal brought by the offender against the original sentence.  For convenience, I will refer to the offender as the applicant.
19At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court made orders determining both appeals, reserving its reasons.  The orders were:
(2)That the Crown appeal be dismissed.
(3)That leave to appeal be granted to the applicant and that his appeal be allowed.
(4)That the sentence passed at first instance be quashed and, in substitution therefor, that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 19 November 2013 and expiring on 18 November 2014 and a balance of term of 6 months expiring on 18 May 2015.
(5)That the applicant be released on parole immediately. 
20These are my reasons for joining in the making of those orders.
21At the proceedings on sentence, the Crown relied on a written statement of facts which may be summarised as follows.  At about 2am on 24 May 2013 the victim, Jason Terry, drove to a service station at Warners Bay.  The applicant and his co-offender, Sean O'Brien, arrived shortly afterwards.  The applicant spoke to the victim near the petrol bowsers. They shared a cigarette and the applicant offered to sell some drugs to the victim.  The victim agreed and they arranged to meet at a nearby parking lot.  At the meeting point, the applicant got into the victim's car, sitting in the front passenger seat. The co-offender stayed in the applicant's car with the applicant's two dogs.  
22The applicant and the victim spoke for 10 to 15 minutes.  The conversation was ""of a personal and intimate nature"".  The co-offender approached the car, opened the door and began to repeatedly punch the victim to the head and face.  He held an object to the victim's neck and repeatedly said 'Give me your money'. The victim did not see the object, as it was dark, but thought it was a knife.  The applicant then grabbed the victim around the neck, pulling him back towards himself. The victim felt like he was being suffocated. The co-offender continued to assault the victim repeatedly, punching him to the face and body and screaming at him to give him money.  The victim tried to hold onto his wallet, which was in his back pants pocket, and begged the offenders to leave him alone and let him go home.  They responded ""We're going to slash your tyres and if you go to the police we'll come after you"" (the statement of facts does not specify which offender made that statement).
23The applicant kept saying to the victim not to go to the police. He then slashed the rear left tyre of the car. The offenders left in the applicant's car having taken sunglasses, a gold chain, a packet of cigarettes, a bag of clothing and the victim's car key with them.  The victim walked home where he woke his mother and informed her of the assault. He then went to hospital.  
24The offenders were identified a few days later on CCTV footage seized by police. When approached by police the applicant made admissions to being present while the co-offender robbed a man and named the co-offender.  He also gave approval for police to search his property. He agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview during which he made ""full and frank admissions"" to assisting the co-offender to leave the scene of the robbery.  
25In a later interview, the applicant told police that, during the assault, he attempted to protect the victim from the co-offender by pulling him towards himself.  He admitted to grabbing the victim around the throat but said it was in an effort to cover him up whilst he was being punched by the co-offender. He said the gold chain which was around the victim's neck had previously broken and the co-offender must have grabbed it.  The applicant told police that he was scared the victim would report the incident and that he would be sent to gaol. As a result he told the victim not to go to the police. He took the victim's car keys and punctured the left rear tyre to stop the victim from being able to go to the police. He told police the co-offender threw the victim's car key away.  The applicant said that he and the co-offender then left and went to the premises of a local drug dealer where they sold the gold chain in exchange for drugs.  He admitted to police that he had been drinking prior to the incident and had also taken some drugs.  The applicant told police that it was never his intention to rob the victim. He admitted that he assisted the co-offender to leave as he was scared the victim would report the incident to police.  The victim suffered minor cuts and bruising to his face and neck and bruising and ongoing pain to his right leg.
26The applicant was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the aggravated robbery committed by the co-offender.  The circumstance of aggravation was the infliction of actual bodily harm.  The aggravated robbery carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years: s 95 of the Crimes Act 1900.  As an accessory after the fact to that offence, the applicant was liable to imprisonment for a maximum of 5 years: s 350 of the Act.
27The applicant was arrested on 28 May 2013.  At that time, he was on parole, having been released on parole on 28 February 2013.  Following his arrest, he was refused bail and remained in custody until he was sentenced.  On 27 June 2013 the parole order was revoked, requiring the applicant to serve the balance of term of his earlier sentence until 29 November 2013.
28The sentence proceedings came before Maiden DCJ on 19 November 2013.  The applicant had legal representation arranged for that day but terminated the retainer of both the barrister and the solicitor on the morning of the hearing.  The hearing proceeded with the applicant being unrepresented.
29The material before the sentencing judge included a report from Mr Constable, a psychologist who had been treating the applicant for a number of years for anxiety and depression against a background of sexual abuse at a Catholic boys' home as a child.  The report recorded the applicant's belief, with which the psychologist agreed, that the applicant had turned to drugs as a way of coping with the sexual abuse.  The judge accepted that evidence.  
30There was also a report initially prepared for the Drug Court by a registered nurse employed in the Drug Court programme.  The report spoke favourably of the applicant's engagement with that programme, stating that although he struggled with abstinence, ""his honesty and motivation was high"" and that he engaged in counselling ""with good insight and eagerness to participate in his recovery"".  His participation in the programme was terminated, not due to non-compliance but to his ""inability to consent to a treatment variation"" after the health team suggested fulltime residential rehabilitation.  The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant has ""considerable skills and the support of persons around him"" but noted that it was his drug dependence which had led to the criminal behaviour for which he stood to be sentenced.
31The applicant has an extremely lengthy criminal record reflecting his long-term addiction to drugs.  
32On the strength of the material put forward on behalf of the applicant, the judge found that he had ""a very difficult upbringing"".  As to the circumstances of the offence, the judge accepted that the applicant had acted so as to protect the victim from further harm from the co-offender.       
33The Crown did not submit that the applicant's offending fell within the worst category of offences of that kind.  The sentencing judge nonetheless imposed a sentence which started at the maximum penalty of 5 years.  The judge then allowed a discount of 25% for the plea entered in the Local Court and 25% for assistance to authorities, giving a total term of 30 months.  As to the discount for assistance to authorities, his Honour did not differentiate between past and future assistance: cf s 23(4)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  In determining the level of discounts to be allowed, and their combined effect, the judge did not refer to any of the statutory provisions or to any authorities in this Court on the subject.  He simply accepted concessions made by the Crown.  
34The judge found that there were special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the balance of term based on the fact that the applicant's period in custody would be difficult due to his decision to give evidence against his co-offender.  On that basis, his Honour specified a non-parole period of 20 months.  The sentence was fixed to commence on 19 November 2013 (the date of the sentence hearing), which allowed concurrency of only 11 days with the balance of term to be served for the previous sentence after the parole order was revoked.  That is not relied upon as a separate ground of appeal by the applicant but is noted in support of a ground of appeal that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  In the result, it was not necessary for this Court to consider that ground.     
35The trial of the co-offender commenced on 12 May 2014.  The victim gave evidence on that day.  The Crown had attempted to have the applicant brought to court to give evidence the following day but was informed by the court that the applicant would be attending only by video-link.  After an unsuccessful attempt to confer with the applicant by video-link, the Crown ultimately spoke to him by telephone at 9.20am on the day on which he was due to give evidence.  The conversation was not recorded electronically.  The only evidence before this Court as to what was said is a typed version of the solicitor's handwritten notes of the conversation.  The handwritten notes were not in evidence before this Court.  The typed notes are annexed to affidavits filed within the last month.  There is no evidence to suggest that they were provided to the applicant at any earlier point in time for his review or consideration.  
36On their face, the notes are an incomplete account of the conversation.  The applicant does not accept their accuracy and has sworn an affidavit setting out his recollection of the conversation where it differs relevantly from that recorded in the notes.  He denies that he did not intend to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking.  
37Taking the notes at face value, it may be accepted that they provide some evidence that the applicant was reluctant to give evidence and that he was warning the Crown that there was more to the story than was reflected in the version recorded by police.  At no point, however, is he recorded as having made any unequivocal statement refusing to give evidence or refusing to give evidence in accordance with his statements to police.  When pressed on that issue, the Crown relied upon two statements recorded in the notes, as follows:
""You are better off not calling meI will smash you out of the water"".
And, later,
""I am going to buckle your case"".  
38The applicant disputed the accuracy of the notes as to those statements.  It is necessary to put his version in context.  The applicant said that he had wanted to speak with the prosecutor earlier and that he and his wife had made many attempts to contact the office of the DPP to that end.  He was upset that the prosecutor who called him on the day of the trial was not aware of that.  He said to the prosecutor:
""There are things concerning the victim and myself knowing each other prior to the incident and that my co-accused knows it all.""
39His recollection of the first statement set out above was that he said words to the effect: 
""you are better off not calling me.What Sean and the defence know will smash you out of the water"".  
40He denied saying the words:
""I am going to buckle your case.""
He says his words were:
""It will buckle your case"".  
41The applicant's account reveals a real possibility that at least parts of the conversation were misheard, misunderstood or wrongly transcribed in significant respects.  Even disregarding his evidence, it is clear that the notes give an incomplete account of the conversation.  Further, even if the words spoken were precisely as recorded by the solicitor, this Court is in no position to assess the significance of the particular statements relied upon by the Crown.  The Crown has not directed any submissions to a comparison of what was said during the telephone conference with the evidence the applicant had undertaken to give.  The appeal rests on the contention that the remarks set out above in themselves establish a failure to fulfil the undertaking to give evidence in accordance with the applicant's statements to police.  
42The Crown relies on an affidavit sworn by the trial advocate stating that, after the telephone conversation, he ""formed the view that the [applicant] did not intend to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking and decided not to call him as a witness in the prosecution"".  That view is irrelevant to the issue raised by this appeal, which is whether it is established that the applicant failed to fulfil his undertaking.
43At the proceedings on sentence, the applicant gave evidence verifying his statements to police referred to in the undertaking.  Nothing in the notes of the conversation with the applicant on the morning of the hearing provides any basis for concluding that the applicant was going to resile from that version of events if called as a witness in the trial.  There is simply no basis on which this Court can determine what he would have said in evidence (had he been called) and whether that evidence would have fulfilled his undertaking.  As already noted, the applicant denies in his affidavit relied upon in the appeal that he did not intend to give evidence.  He states that he accepts that he gave the undertaking and that at all times he intended to honour it.  He notes, correctly, that he is not in a position to comment on the trial advocate's decision not to call him as a witness.  
44The victim's evidence in the trial did not identify either offender in clear terms.  At the very least, the applicant could have given evidence as to his presence at the relevant time and as to the identity of the co-offender, linking them to the victim's evidence as to what occurred.
45The trial advocate did not tell the trial judge that the applicant had refused to give evidence. At no stage was the applicant in fact called to give evidence, whether in the absence or the presence of the jury.  In the appeal, the Crown accepted that the applicant could have been called in the trial, at least on a voir dire.  He frankly acknowledged that the decision not to do so was due to impracticalities (specifically, a difficulty establishing an audio-visual link). 
46The power of this Court under s 5DA to vary a sentence that the sentencing judge reduced because of an undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities is enlivened only if the Court is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking.  Plainly, the Act contemplates that this Court must reach a state of being actually satisfied of that fact.  The Crown accepted that the Court would have to be ""comfortably satisfied"" of that fact.  For my part, I consider it to be a matter which, by parity of reasoning with the decision of the High Court in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54, would have to be established beyond reasonable doubt but it is not necessary to determine that issue in the present appeal.  For the reasons I have explained, on either approach, I am not satisfied that the applicant failed to fulfil his undertaking.  On the strength of that conclusion, it followed that the Crown appeal had to be dismissed.
47As to the applicant's appeal, the first ground is:
His Honour erred by nominating the notional starting point as five years being the maximum penalty for the offence.
48In my view, this ground is clearly made out.  The Crown did not submit that the applicant's conduct was within the worst category and the judge made no finding to that effect.  His Honour said:
Because of the nature of the seriousness of the offence of robbery which this matter applies to, the court must find that it is of a high level of seriousness and thus the court is of the view based upon the lengthy history of the offender that the court should impose a maximum term of 5 years.
49Those remarks suggest that the decision to start at the maximum was informed by two considerations: the seriousness of the offence committed by the co-offender and the applicant's criminal record.  The seriousness of the robbery was undoubtedly relevant but was not determinative of the seriousness of the applicant's offending, especially in the face of his Honour's finding that the applicant acted so as to protect the victim from further harm from the co-offender.
50Further, the judge had made a number of findings that were capable of mitigating the sentence.  I accept that his Honour was not obliged to reduce the sentence on that account but a decision not to do so warranted explanation.  It is possible that, although the judge recorded the maximum penalty of 5 years at the outset of his remarks, he overlooked that factor in stating the starting point of 5 years.  On any analysis, in my view it was wrong to start at that point.
51The second ground of appeal is:
His Honour erred in the manner in which he used the offender's criminal record.
52As already stated, having referred to the seriousness of the offence to which the applicant was an accessory after the fact, the judge said ""thus the court is of the view based upon the lengthy history of the applicant that the court should impose a maximum term of 5 years"".  Whilst it is not entirely clear from those remarks what relevance his Honour attributed to the criminal record, they suggest an approach inconsistent with authority.  His Honour appears to have relied upon the prior convictions to impose a sentence greater than the range appropriate to the particular offence, which his Honour assessed as being of ""a high level of seriousness"", without finding that it was of the highest (worst) level of seriousness.
53From the same remarks, it can be concluded that the judge did not take into account the subjective mitigating factors found in favour of the applicant, which is the basis of ground 3 in the appeal.
54In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that error has been established and that the applicant's appeal must be allowed.  It is necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh: Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 313 ALR 451 at [43].
55The seriousness of the applicant's criminality lay in the fact that, knowing the co-offender had assaulted the victim by punching him repeatedly in the head and demanding money, he assisted the co-offender to flee by slashing a tyre of the victim's car and driving the co-offender away from the scene.  It was undoubtedly a serious offence but it was by no means the worst case.
56An assessment of the subjective case is difficult.  The applicant's criminal history and the ongoing challenge he evidently faces resisting the insidious call of addictive drugs do not augur well for his prospects of rehabilitation, as reflected by his experience with the Drug Court programme.  However, the force of that consideration is tempered to some degree by the fact that his use of drugs in the first place reflects the devastating impact of childhood sexual assaults at the hands of a Catholic brother entrusted with his care at a tender age.
57As already noted, the judge fixed the sentence to commence on the date of the sentence hearing.  That was notwithstanding the fact that the Crown had suggested an earlier starting date of 9 October 2013, the date on which the plea was entered in the Local Court.
58The applicant tried to make a submission to the judge that the sentence should start earlier (so as to allow greater concurrence) but the judge interrupted him, accusing him of being unable to answer the question and telling him not to say anything further.  In fact, it is clear from the transcript that the applicant was about to address the issue of concurrency appropriately, submitting that, whilst on parole (before his arrest) he had been undertaking a TAFE course and ""going really well"".  He has expanded upon that evidence in an affidavit sworn in the appeal and relied upon on the issue of re-sentence.   
59In all the circumstances, I consider that a sentence of three years is warranted.  
60The Crown did not take issue with the two discounts allowed by the sentencing judge.  In light of my conclusion that the applicant did not fail to fulfil the undertaking, I consider it appropriate to allow the same discounts, giving a sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months.  The applicant has already served that period since the date on which he was sentenced.  Had the appeal been heard earlier, the Court would have been required to direct his release on parole at the expiration of that period: see s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Accordingly, upon the determination of his appeal, he was entitled to be released on parole immediately.
61Those were my reasons for joining in the orders set out above. I agree with Basten JA that the non-publication order should be revoked. 
62R A HULME J:  I agree with McCallum J.

		19 December 2014",2014-12-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704083,Pasoski v R [2014] NSWCCA 309,"Judgment
1MEAGHER JA: On 4 May 2012 the applicant was found guilty of two counts of assaulting the complainant occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (counts 1 and 2).  Those physical assaults occurred on 31 October and 1 November 2010 at premises at Bexley where the applicant and complainant lived with their two daughters.  Their relationship commenced in 2003 and at the time of the alleged offences those children were aged one and three.
2The applicant was also found guilty of five counts of having sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act (counts 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).  Those five offences were alleged to have happened in the early hours of the morning of 10 November 2010 from about 2 am and to have involved penile vaginal intercourse.
3On 17 August 2012 the trial judge (Murrell DCJ, as her Honour then was) imposed, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the seven offences which commenced on 4 May 2012 and ends on 3 November 2017, with a non-parole period expiring on 3 February 2015; being a sentence of five years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and nine months.
4On 15 August 2014 the applicant filed an appeal from the convictions and application for leave to appeal from the sentence.  He also filed an application under s 10(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for an extension of the three month period in which, in accordance with rule 3B(2) of the Criminal Appeal Rules, that notice of appeal and the application for leave should have been given.  Although the application for extension of time is not opposed, the affidavit in support of it is less than satisfactory.  It says that instructions to appeal both the convictions and sentence were received on 7 August 2014 and asserts that the delay in doing so was ""not associated with the appellant"".  The only reason provided which might explain why that is so is that due to ""administrative errors of the District Court ... the list of trial exhibits and other trial material is not located on the Court file"".  The affidavit does not indicate what material may have been available and when it became available.  Nor does it explain the circumstances in which the applicant came to give instructions to consider the bringing of an appeal or why those instructions could not have been secured earlier.
5The discretionary power to extend the time limit for bringing the appeal is to be exercised having regard to the interests of justice in this case.  The matters to be taken into account include the length of the delay, the reasons for it, and the applicant's prospects of success:  Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 88 ALJR 947 at [30], [31], [33].  In the absence of any objection to the form of the evidence relied upon and any contrary submission from the Crown, I proceed on the basis that the delay in commencing these appeal proceedings was not due to any fault on the part of the applicant.  In circumstances where one of the conviction grounds of appeal is conceded and the other two grounds are fairly arguable and in the absence of any unexplained delay or other particular matter identified by the Crown as bearing on the question of leave, in my view the interests of justice require that the time for bringing the appeal proceedings be extended to 16 August 2014.
Grounds of appeal
6The applicant relies upon the following grounds:
""CONVICTION:
Ground 1: When directing the jury that it could return majority verdicts in relation to counts 7 and 8, her Honour failed to comply with the requirements of s. 55F(2)(b) Jury Act 1977.
Ground 2: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission of the so-called context evidence.
Ground 3: Her Honour erred in failing to instruct the jury as to the manner in which the so-called context evidence could properly be used.
SENTENCE:
Ground 1: Her Honour erred in concluding that the offences were aggravated by the fact that they occurred within the conjugal home.
Ground 2: A lesser sentence is warranted in law.""
7Conviction grounds 2 and 3 concern the conduct of the trial.  The applicant accepts that rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to them because objection was not taken to the admission of the evidence referred to or to the trial judge's directions with respect to the use which could be made of that evidence. Before addressing these grounds, which require a detailed consideration of the way in which the trial was conducted, as well as the circumstances in which the relevant ""context"" evidence was admitted, it is convenient to deal shortly with conviction ground 1 which is conceded by the Crown.
Conviction Appeal - Ground 1: When directing the jury that it could return majority verdicts in relation to counts 7 and 8, the primary judge failed to comply with the requirements of s 55F(2)(b) of the Jury Act 1977
8Section 55F of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) relevantly provides:
""55F (1) This section applies in respect of a verdict in criminal proceedings where the jury consists of not less than 11 persons.
(2) A majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings if: 
(a) a unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than 8 hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings, and 
(b) the court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation.""
9On the third day of their deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge advising that they had reached a unanimous decision on five of the seven charges and that, because they were split on the remaining two charges, it was unlikely that a unanimous decision would be reached on the remaining charges in a timely manner, if at all.  By that time the jury had been deliberating for at least ten hours.  After discussion, the parties agreed in the trial judge's view that a Black direction urging the jury to continue to attempt to reach a unanimous verdict on those charges was not required (Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; 179 CLR 44), and that instead a majority verdict direction should be given.  The trial judge then took the jury's unanimous guilty verdicts on five of the seven charges (counts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) and proceeded immediately to give a majority verdict direction.  Her Honour did not, before doing so, examine any juror on oath and accordingly was not and could not have been satisfied in accordance with s 55F(2)(b).
10The result was that one of the pre-conditions to the exercise of the power to permit the return of majority verdicts on those charges was not satisfied.  It follows that the applicant did not receive a trial according to law in relation to counts 7 and 8 and that accordingly there was a miscarriage of justice requiring that the convictions in relation to them be quashed.  See RJS v R [2007] NSWCCA 241; 173 A Crim R 100 at [16] (Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Harrison JJ agreeing).
11It also follows that the aggregate sentence passed under s 53A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act must be reassessed, unless all of the applicant's remaining convictions are quashed.
Conviction Appeal - Ground 2: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission of the so-called context evidence
Conviction Appeal - Ground 3: Her Honour erred in failing to instruct the jury as to the manner in which the so-called context evidence could properly be used
The ""so-called context evidence""
12This evidence concerned aspects of the relationship between the complainant and the applicant.  It was not evidence of any earlier uncharged sexual or other assaults.  The subject matter of the evidence, as identified in the trial judge's summing-up, was:
The applicant requiring that Joanne, a friend of the complainant to whom she had lent monies to be repaid over time, repay those monies immediately.The applicant pressuring the complainant to change her employment because he did not like her working where she would spend a significant amount of time on the road or working with a lot of men.The applicant badmouthing to the complainant, two of her girlfriends by calling them ""sluts"".The applicant trying to limit the complainant's circle of friends and cutting her off from friends, in circumstances where her own family lived in New Zealand.The applicant pressuring the complainant not to attend a play group with her young children.The applicant trying to dictate to the complainant the supermarket where she could shop.The applicant checking up on the complainant at work by telephoning her multiple times each day.The applicant checking up on the complainant when she was out of the house by insisting that she keep her phone on her at all times so that he could contact her.The applicant telling the complainant what to wear and how to do her hair and make-up when going out of the house.
The Crown and defence cases
13The Crown case was summarised in its written submissions on appeal:
""The complainant and the applicant were in a domestic relationship and they had two children together.  They had a difficult relationship and the applicant was very controlling towards the complainant.  On 31 October 2010 they had an argument and he kicked her in the back of her legs. [Count 1] The following morning he slapped her face and she fell to the ground. [Count 2] In the early hours of the morning of 10 November the applicant got into bed with the complainant.  He had sexual intercourse with her without her consent.  He then left the room and went down stairs.  He returned another four times and had sexual intercourse with her without her consent on each occasion."" [Counts 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8]
14The complainant's evidence as to the second assault alleged to have occurred on 1 November 2010 was to the following effect:
""The applicant did not sleep in the house [on the night of 31 October].  He returned the next morning while the complainant was bathing the children.  He was drunk.  The complainant swore at him and told him to go away.  He slapped her face.  She told him not to hit her as he was scaring the girls.  The girls were crying.  He pushed her to the ground.  The complainant got up and pushed the applicant on the stairs.  He stumbled.  She took the girls into the bedroom.  She locked the bedroom door and pushed the bed against the door.  The complainant had an injury on the right side of her lip and it was swollen inside her lip.""
15Her evidence as to the five remaining offences was as follows:
""The complainant tried to speak to the applicant about what happened on 31 October 2010.  She asked him not to hit her again. He said that they never get time together. She said that he always goes out and he should spend more time with them, for example going to the park. The applicant said that they never got time to themselves and so they planned to go out on 6 November 2010, as a celebration for the complainant's upcoming birthday. The applicant's mother looked after their children. They went to a hotel called The Intersection. They were meant to go out for dinner first but in the end they just went for drinks. On 8 November, the complainant's birthday, she took the children to Brighton Beach. They got home from the beach in the afternoon. On 8 and 9 November the complainant worked from 5:00-10:00pm. When she returned from work on 9 November at 10:20pm the applicant was sitting in the lounge drinking alcohol. She said 'I'm tired. I'm going to make a cup of tea and go to bed'. He said 'I've organised for the girls to be with Mum so I can spend time with you. Come outside and have a cigarette with me'. The complainant said that she did not want to as she wanted to go to bed. She did not make any tea. She went upstairs and got ready for bed. She put on 3/4 pyjama pants and went to sleep.
In the early hours of the morning, around 2:00am the applicant opened the door of the bedroom and got into bed behind the complainant. He was holding her. She said 'I don't want to have sex'. He tried to pull off her pants. He said 'You never want to have sex'. She said 'Why don't you go back and have sex with the person that you've been out with all night, that you go out with all night.' He said 'I don't have sex with other people'.  He pulled down her pants and put his penis in her vagina. She told him that her back was sore from sunburn. He said 'I'm about to cum, so just let me cum.' He then ejaculated [Count 4]. He left the room and the complainant stayed in bed. She did not put her clothes back on. She went back to sleep. Later that morning the applicant returned to the bedroom. The complainant was lying in the same position. She said that she did not want to have sex and he had penile vaginal intercourse with her again [Count 5].  He ejaculated inside her and then he left the room. The applicant returned a third time. The complainant could not recall if she said anything to him this time. He had intercourse with her and ejaculated [Count 6]. He left the room again. He returned a fourth time. The complainant said 'I don't want to have sex, this is uncomfortable'. The applicant had sexual intercourse with her [Count 7]. He then returned a fifth time. The complainant said 'I don't want to have sex with you... it really hurts me and you don't care that I'm telling you not to have sex with me, this is like rape.' The applicant said 'You never want to have sex with me'. He proceeded to have intercourse with her again [Count 8]. The complainant went into the lounge room early that morning and saw pornographic DVDs scattered around the room.""
16The applicant's case, again as summarised by the Crown in its written submissions on appeal, was:
""The applicant did not physically injure the complainant at any point in time.  He did not have sexual intercourse with her without her consent.  She was physically violent towards him during their relationship.""
17Specifically, in relation to the second of the charged assaults the applicant said that the complainant received the bump on her lip as she was hitting him.  He tried to block her.  He denied that he struck her, pushed her to the ground or kicked her as part of the incident on the stairs.  He did not have intercourse with her in the early hours of 10 November.  He had watched television and then gone to bed in the spare room some time before midnight.  The next morning around 7 to 8 am they did have consensual intercourse.
The admission of the evidence
18The tender of the context evidence was not objected to. The trial in April and May 2012 was a re-trial after an earlier trial in September 2011 had miscarried.  The Crown proposed, as is permitted by s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), the tender of the record of the evidence given by the complainant at the earlier trial.  The applicant's counsel objected to various parts of that record.  Those objections were dealt with in a voir dire held on 18 and 19 April 2012.  The outcome was that all of the evidence which was objected to was rejected.
19Early in the voir dire the following exchange occurred between the trial judge and the applicant's counsel:
""BUCKMAN: Firstly if I can indicate this to your Honour. In general terms the objections fall into two categories.  Firstly there are a number of - in one category there are number of things said by the complainant which in my submission are prejudicial comments which should come out.  If I could just keep it as general as that at this stage.  The second category relates to evidence of other acts, so to speak.  Evidence being given about other acts which the accused was not charged with.
HER HONOUR: So this is tendered as context evidence?
BUCKMAN: Context evidence yes and it is that evidence that's effectively objected to.""
20The Crown agreed to the editing out of the complainant's evidence in the first category.  That evidence was identified in what became exhibit VD3 on the voir dire.  The tender of evidence in the second category was pressed by the Crown.  Grounds 2 and 3 are not directed to that evidence but to evidence that was not identified at this time as the ""context"" evidence to which objection was taken.
21In relation to that second category, the following further exchange occurred:
""HER HONOUR: ... But if we're talking about as a general proposition the admission of context evidence, as a general approach I would have thought that normally context evidence is important but it should be led relatively briefly in a relatively un-colourful way, that would be a general comment.  I mean, clearly it would look rather weird if all of a sudden after being together for six years or whatever, on 31 October over the ensuing two weeks there were a couple of incidents of a very unpleasant nature, that would look a bit strange.  So therefore it could be important to show a history but without going into too much unduly prejudicial detail in that regard. That would be a general approach that I possibly would take.  Are you seeking to exclude all the context evidence Mr Buckman?
BUCKMAN: Yes your Honour.  It might assist your Honour if I told you in terms of the exhibit that I tendered on the voir dire, the transcript references, the references that relate to the context evidence.""
22Counsel then took the Court to exhibit VD4 on the voir dire.  By doing so he made clear that his earlier reference to ""all the context evidence"" was only to the evidence specified in this exhibit. The trial judge then asked the Crown to ""identify with some particularity"" the purpose for which that evidence was tendered:
""CROWN PROSECUTOR:  For [the] very reason your Honour that I articulated a moment ago that the allegations take place in the context of a long term relationship. And they would sound implausible if they didn't have the context of the fact that this was a relationship that wasn't a rosy relationship, that there was inherent problems which dated back some years.
HER HONOUR:  You mean inherent problems with physical and sexual violence?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes your Honour, yes.  So the Crown says that the context evidence removes the implausibility that might otherwise be attributed to the complainant's account of the assaults if they were thought to be isolated incidents."" 
23In support of its submission that the evidence was relevant to the extent of removing implausibility that might otherwise be attributed to the complainant's account, the Crown referred to the decision of this Court in Leonard v R [2006] NSWCCA 267; 67 NSWLR 545.  In that appeal, there was an issue as to the admissibility, in relation to charges of sexual assault on a child under 16 years, of evidence of a sexual relationship between the complainant and accused that went beyond the acts charged.  At [49], Hodgson JA observed that in such a case evidence of that kind might be relevant in three different ways, only one of which would involve its use as tendency or propensity evidence.
24The first involved its use as ""relationship"" evidence to remove implausibility that might attach to a complainant's account of what otherwise would be seen as isolated incidents.  The previous occurrence of incidents similar to those charged could explain a complainant's apparent lack of complaint about or surprise as to the accused's conduct in relation to the offences charged.  In HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334 at [6] Gleeson CJ cited R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 as a case in which evidence was admitted for that purpose.  The evidence addresses questions that might be taken naturally to arise in the minds of the jury as to matters which, if left unanswered, may be expected to reflect adversely and unfairly upon a complainant.  As Gleeson CJ also observed in HML v The Queen at [6], by doing so, it bears upon the assessment of the probability of the existence of facts directly in issue (Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 55) by assisting the evaluation of the complainant's account of the facts constituting the elements of the offences charged. Similar observations were made in Roach v The Queen [2011] HCA 12; 242 CLR 610 at [42] (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) and BBH v The Queen [2012] HCA 9; 245 CLR 499 at [146] - [150] (Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
25The Crown initially relied upon the evidence identified in exhibit VD4 as relationship evidence in the sense described above.  It did not tender it as supporting an inference that the applicant had physically or sexually assaulted the complainant in the past and therefore was, by reason of that conduct, more likely to have done so on the occasions charged.  That was the third of the ways identified by Hodgson JA in which such evidence might be relevant and plainly would involve its use as tendency or propensity evidence.
26The evidence in exhibit VD4 was directed to two earlier events.  The first was an incident said to have occurred at an earlier undefined time when the applicant had assaulted the complainant and locked her on the balcony of their home unit.  The trial judge expressed reservations as to its admissibility given its lack of proximity in time to the charged offences and to the lack of sufficient similarity between that event and the charged incidents.  Ultimately the Crown did not press the tender of evidence concerning this incident.
27The second event was said to have happened in June 2007, shortly after the caesarean birth of the complainant's first daughter.  Her evidence was that the applicant had sexual intercourse with her against her wishes, she having told him that she did not want to do so due to the caesarean wound and medical advice that she should desist from intercourse for a period of six to 12 weeks.  The admissibility of that evidence was contested and the evidence rejected for short reasons given by the trial judge on 18 April 2012.
28The purpose of the tender of this evidence was not initially identified by the Crown as one which attracted the operation of the tendency rule (Evidence Act, ss 97, 101) and the trial judge did not approach the question as to its exclusion by reference to ss 135 or 137 (the latter of which requires the Court in a criminal proceeding to refuse to admit evidence adduced by the Crown if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused).  Instead, the applicant's objection to the evidence was described by the trial judge as involving an application under s 306I(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act to exclude parts of the complainant's original evidence which was sought to be tendered on the re-trial.  That description was not accurate.  Sub-section 306I(5) did not provide the basis for determining the admissibility of that evidence.
29The question whether the record or any of the statements in it was inadmissible, or should be excluded, other than for reason that the evidence was not to be given orally at the new trial (see s 306I(3), (4) and (6)) remained to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act.  That is made explicit by s 306I(6) which permits the Court to give directions ""requiring the record to be altered or edited for the purpose of removing any statements that would not be admissible if the original evidence of the complainant had been given orally before the court hearing the new trial proceedings"".  Subsection s 306I(5) is directed to the position after specific questions of admissibility have been addressed and permits the Court to decline to admit a record of the original evidence if the accused would be unfairly disadvantaged by the admission of that record having regard to, among other things, the effect of having edited any inadmissible evidence from that record.
30There is no issue on appeal as to the correctness of the trial judge's ruling rejecting that evidence.  However, her Honour's reasons remain relevant in the present context because they show that the parties and the Court were conscious that evidence tendered to explain the context in which the alleged offences occurred might, depending on its content, be relied on or used for a tendency purpose.
31After noting in her reasons that the evidence was ""prejudicial, not only because it concerns uncharged acts, but also because of the very unpleasant circumstance that the alleged sexual intercourse without consent occurred contrary to medical advice"" the trial judge continued:
""4. The question that comes to the fore is whether the admission of the evidence will strongly operate to reduce what would otherwise be implausibility concerning the allegations the subject of the charges.  The first point to make is that the allegations the subject of the charges are not, to my mind, inherently implausible.  It is not inherently implausible that, following an argument or difficulties in a relationship, a male partner may force himself upon the female partner. ...
5. The Crown very fairly and correctly pointed out that the real point of the evidence of events in mid-2007 was not so much a contextual purpose, but rather a tendency purpose.  The material really shows an inclination or tendency of the accused to go ahead and force himself sexually upon his partner regardless of her viewpoint.  No tendency notice was served in the proceedings.  Nor, as I understand it, in the original proceedings. ... the fact that the evidence is more in the nature of tendency evidence than contextual evidence serves to highlight the prejudice that would attach to the material if it was tendered as contextual evidence.""
The course of the trial
32In its opening address, the Crown described the relationship between the applicant and complainant as one in which there had been ""good times but there also were some times that were not so good"" and that the respondent's position was that she ""thought that he was rather controlling and dominating"", directing attention to the complainant's state of mind.  When describing the first of the alleged sexual assaults, the Crown told the jury:
""She indicated to him that she didn't want to have intercourse for a number of reasons.  The state of play within their relationship, in the incidents that had been leading up to this particular night and also the fact that her back was quite sunburnt and she did not want to have that causing her pain.  So she told the accused that she didn't want to have intercourse."" 
33The substance of the ""so-called context evidence"" was not summarised or elaborated upon in the Crown's opening.  Nevertheless, it was apparent that the Crown was relying upon it only as showing that the relationship was an unhappy one from the complainant's perspective so as to make more plausible her evidence that she did not consent to having sexual intercourse with the applicant on the five occasions in question.
34The complainant was cross examined at some length about that evidence and the applicant's alleged controlling behaviour.  It was put that much of the evidence was not true and that in fact the applicant did not seek to control her conduct or prevent her access to friends in the ways suggested.  Further facts about the relationship were led in cross examination that were said to contradict the complexion that the complainant sought to place on the relevant events.  In that way counsel for the applicant used the relationship evidence as a basis for attacking the complainant's reliability and credibility.  In his evidence in chief, the applicant said that he had not engaged in much of the behaviour alleged.  He also described occasions when the complainant was physically violent towards him, including that of the second alleged assault on 1 November 2010.  In cross examination he denied that he had engaged in controlling behaviour towards the complainant.
35In its closing address the Crown commented on the ""wealth of evidence in terms of the background of the relationship between"" the complainant and applicant:
""You might think, goodness there was a lot of evidence about doctors and playgroups and hair and makeup, what's the point of that?  I suppose in explaining to you the point of it is if the Crown had just got [the complainant] in the witness box and said, tell us about the events that happened in the early hours of the morning of 10 November 2010 and she said, look you know Jimmy came and I had a sore back and he had intercourse with me without consent five times you might think that it was quite a strange thing to then go to the police and complain of them.
In that way, the law allows the circumstances which support the counts to go before the jury.  If I could just briefly remind you what the Crown says are some of the important circumstances which underpin or go to explain this what by all accounts was a very troubled relationship.""
36Reference was then made to the detail of some of that evidence.  The Crown continued:
""[The complainant] said that the marriage or the relationship did have some good times, she conceded that but if you look at the facts here is a young girl who doesn't have her parents, cut off from her friends, she's dependent for her accommodation, she's living in a house owned by the accused's parents. She's got these two little girls and you might think that the control idea of the accused dominating her is really a very real one for her. That's in a way, the Crown says, if you look at those reasons that's the background it's not a happy relationship it's one dominated by the accused.
Not only is she dominated by the psychological reasons the Crown says there's a very physical element of the domination as well.""
37At this point, the Crown was using the evidence to justify a conclusion that, from the complainant's perspective, the relationship was not a happy one so as to make more plausible her version of the events and in particular her evidence that she had not consented to sexual intercourse.  No reference was made to any other ways in which that evidence might be used by the jury.  Specifically, the Crown did not suggest that it indicated a propensity of the applicant to commit physical or sexual assaults on the complainant.38In his closing argument, counsel for the applicant also spent some time addressing the context evidence.  In doing so, he accepted that the relevance of the evidence was, as identified by the Crown, that it explained ""the actions of the complainant"".  He said:
""A lot about the history of the relationship between these two parties and the reason why you've heard that as the Crown has fairly pointed out to you is because the Crown says that you're entitled to if you accept that evidence use it to put into context the allegations of assault and sexual assault.
For example why the complainant didn't physically resist when she was being sexually assaulted.  So that evidence has been led, the Crown would say put the offences that the Crown says have been committed here into some sort of contextual background to explain the actions of the complainant of these alleged offences."" 
39Counsel's primary submission was that the jury should not accept the complainant's evidence as to these various matters.    It was said that if the jury did not accept that evidence, it should question the reliability of the complainant's evidence as to the alleged offences.  It was also suggested that the complainant's evidence as to those matters was fabricated or exaggerated so as to justify her false version of events in the early hours of 10 November.  Counsel submitted:
""But again there's a context evidence that explains a lack of resistance on her part physically or is it the case of vice versa.  In other words she needs to explain why she didn't struggle or resist or lock the door or whatever, so she's come up with this context evidence to try and explain how controlling he was because she knows that's going to explain why she didn't lock the door and she needs to come up with something to effectively back up her false story.""
40It is convenient to pause at this point to note what the position was in relation to the evidence that is the subject of grounds 2 and 3.  First, that evidence was not of sexual or other assaults against the complainant on earlier occasions.  It was not similar fact evidence or evidence of conduct of the applicant which disclosed some reason or motive or explanation suggesting a propensity to assault the complainant physically or sexually so as to give rise to a likelihood of his having committed the acts in question.  It was not suggested to the jury that the evidence had that character or quality and in my view it was not likely to be seen in that way by jurors bringing their common sense and life experience to bear when evaluating it.  Secondly, it was evidence given by the complainant in a trial where the principal question for the jury was whether it should accept her evidence as to what had occurred.  In no sense was there any risk that the evidence would provide, indirectly, any independent corroboration of her evidence as to the commission of the alleged acts.
41Thirdly, the applicant's counsel did not object to the tender of the evidence.  The submission on appeal, although made faintly, that his counsel intended to do so by agreeing to the trial judge's proposition that he was ""seeking to exclude all the context evidence"" must be rejected for the reason referred to earlier.  Fourthly, the applicant's case made by cross examination of the complainant and by his own evidence was that the evidence of controlling behaviour was exaggerated or fabricated to back up her story, also false, as to the physical and sexual assaults having occurred.  The evidence and that cross examination was relied upon as part of the challenge to the complainant's credibility and reliability.  Fifthly, neither party in its closing address invited the jury expressly or implicitly to use the evidence as showing conduct indicating a propensity or disposition of the applicant to commit offences of the kind charged.  Finally, the evidence was relevant to a fact in issue because it bore on the jury's assessment of the complainant's evidence as to consent.  Although its relevance could have been made clearer to the jury, this was reasonably apparent from the various references to it in the course of the trial.  By the cross examination of the complainant, the evidence was also made relevant to her credibility, and therefore to the assessment of her version of the critical events.
42Against this background, the trial judge gave the following directions in relation to the relevant evidence:
""The Crown relies upon this evidence only for one purpose.  And that is to put the complainant's allegations concerning the offences in November 2010 into a realistic context.  The Crown says that, if that evidence was not there, you would be asking yourselves, well, why would the accused throw his weight around in this horrible manner with the complainant completely out of the blue, when they had been in an apparently normal relationship for the previous six years, or whatever it was?  But the Crown says that - so this evidence shows that in fact there had been a relationship of unequal power of control over a period of six years, and it was in that context that these incidents occurred.
Members of the jury, you will have to consider the evidence that the Crown called in support of this proposition that there were a number of incidents that the Crown said evidenced controlling behaviour or domineering behaviour or the exertion of power, and you will have to decide whether you accept that evidence, and the interpretation that you place upon that material, if you do accept it.""
And later:
""Members of the jury, even if there was a background of controlling behaviour, that background only provides a context and it is not evidence that any of the alleged offences actually occurred. It could only be used to put the complainant's allegations into a realistic context.""
Should leave to appeal be granted?
43The applicant requires leave to appeal because of the absence of any objection to the admission of the evidence and the absence of any request for a further direction in relation to its use.  That makes it necessary to consider whether by either or both of grounds 2 and 3 the applicant is able to show that he lost a real chance of acquittal so that a miscarriage of justice has occurred: see Carney v R [2011] NSWCCA 223; 217 A Crim R 201 at [67], [69] (Whealy JA, James and Hoeben JJ) and ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148] (Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ agreeing).
44The applicant submits that there was error in the admission of the evidence, because it was not relevant and was prejudicial.  He also submits that when directing the jury the trial judge erred in failing to identify precise issues to which the evidence was directed (see Norman v R [2012] NSWCCA 230 at [29] (Macfarlan JA, Price and McCallum JJ agreeing) and cases cited there) and, more significantly, in failing to make clear that it could not be used as establishing any tendency on the part of the applicant to commit offences of the type charged.
45The trial judge did not err in admitting the evidence.  It was not objected to and was relevant as making more plausible the complainant's evidence as to the absence of her consent to the acts of sexual intercourse.  As tendered, it did not announce itself as evidence which the jury might use to engage in any tendency or propensity reasoning.  Nor did the Crown identify that as a purpose for which it was tendered.  In those circumstances, there was no occasion for the trial judge to consider, at the point of admission of the evidence, the operation of the tendency rule (Evidence Act, ss 95, 97, 101) or whether although relevant it should or must be excluded because it was unfairly prejudicial (Evidence Act, ss 135, 137).
46At the same time the applicant's counsel had the opportunity to consider its admissibility in circumstances where he is to be taken to have appreciated that there was an entitlement to object to it.  That entitlement was exercised in relation to the evidence identified in exhibit VD4.  The fact that no objection was taken, in circumstances where objection had been taken to other evidence as being prejudicial because it might invite propensity reasoning, is a strong indication that at that early point in the trial counsel saw no injustice or error in its admission to support the plausibility of the complainant's version of events:  see R v Germakian [2007] NSWCCA 373; 70 NSWLR 467 at [11], [12] (Giles JA, Hulme and Hislop JJ); ARS v R at [148] (Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ agreeing); and FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182; 224 A Crim R 82 at [72] (RA Hulme J, McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreeing).  For these reasons it is not shown that any miscarriage of justice occurred by reason alone of the admission of the evidence.
47The more troubling question is whether the trial judge erred in not sufficiently directing the jury as to the limited use which they could make of the evidence.  On behalf of the applicant it is said that it was not sufficient or helpful to say (twice) that the evidence was relied on to put the complainant's allegations ""into a realistic context"".  The jury should have been told of the particular issue or issues to which the evidence was directed; for example, the issue of consent and the plausibility of the complainant having said 'no' to the applicant's sexual advances on the five occasions charged.  It is also said that the direction (and particularly the formulation of the question that the jury might ask itself as being ""why would the accused throw his weight around in this horrible manner"") verged on an invitation to the jury to employ propensity reasoning.  That reference, which might have been taken as being to the whole of the course of conduct rather than to the second assault, directed attention to the applicant's conduct and a possible explanation for it rather than to the complainant's conduct.
48However, the possible effect of that reference has to be assessed in the context of the trial and the way in which it had been conducted, taking account of the other directions given to the jury and the nature of the evidence.  The directions given made clear that the evidence was only relied upon and could only be relied upon as showing that the context in which the charged events occurred did not involve an ""apparently normal relationship"".  It was also made clear that it was not evidence that any of the alleged offences had actually occurred.  Up to this point there had been no suggestion in the final addresses, or by the trial judge in the summing up, that this evidence could be relied upon as making it more likely that the applicant would have acted as alleged.  The evidence was not of conduct involving physical or sexual assaults on the complainant.  The subject matter of the evidence is summarised at [12] above.  None of the respects in which the applicant was said to have been controlling suggested a propensity of the applicant physically or sexually to impose his will on the complainant.  
49Taking account of these matters, I am not satisfied that in the face of this direction there arose a real risk that the jury might employ propensity reasoning and misuse this relationship evidence.  That was not a use suggested or referred to by the Crown or accused.  Although the jury might have proceeded on the basis that they were not restricted in their use of evidence by the arguments formulated by the parties, the nature of this evidence was such that it did not reveal any relevant tendency or propensity of the applicant. For that reason it would not have been evaluated as bearing on the likelihood that the applicant committed the acts in question.  That question was to be answered primarily by an assessment of the complainant's credibility and reliability.  
50Accordingly I do not consider that it was necessary for the trial judge to give any further or other directions about the use of the evidence.  I am fortified in this conclusion by the absence of any complaint about the directions on this evidence.  That fact is usually to be taken as a reliable indicator that in the atmosphere of the trial counsel saw no injustice or error in what was said.  There is nothing in what happened in this trial to suggest that that inference should not be drawn, particularly when the question of the use of other evidence for a propensity purpose had been addressed at some length at the commencement of the trial.
51For these reasons I am not satisfied that grounds 2 and 3 reveal any error on the part of the trial judge which resulted in the applicant having lost a real chance of acquittal.  That being so, it is not shown that a miscarriage of justice occurred and leave to appeal on those grounds should be refused.
Sentence appeal - Ground 1: Her Honour erred in concluding that the offences were aggravated by the fact that they occurred within the conjugal home
Sentence appeal - Ground 2: A lesser sentence is warranted in law
52Because the convictions on counts 7 and 8 should be quashed and those convictions were taken into account by the sentencing judge when imposing the aggregate sentence, it is necessary for this Court to address the question of sentence again.
53By sentencing ground 1 the applicant also contends, correctly in my view, that the sentencing judge erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that the offences were committed in the complainant's home.  That her Honour did so is not in question.  In the remarks on sentence at [12] it was stated:
""The Court needs to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  There are no factors that are of enormous significance to which I have not referred.  I refer to the presence of the children at the time of the assaults.  I have also referred to the fact that all offences occurred within the home of the victim.  That is a less compelling aggravating factor where the home is also the home of the offender.  Although, one cannot detract from the proposition that any victim is entitled to feel safe in her own home and particularly in her own bed.""  
54The fact that the offences took place in the complainant's home was not an aggravating factor in circumstances where the applicant and the complainant resided together at the relevant time: EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199; 79 NSWLR 740 at [79] (RA Hulme J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing).
55In the face of these errors it is necessary to address the question of the appropriate sentence for the five remaining offences.  The provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act require this Court to exercise that discretion again taking into account the relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to forming its own judgment as to the aggregate sentence that should have been passed:  per Spigelman CJ in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [19] which was expressly approved in Kentwell v The Queen at [40], [42] (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ).
56I agree, for the reasons given by the sentencing judge, that the first assault (count 1) was not objectively serious and that the second was more serious because of the nature of the applicant's conduct and the presence of the young children.  The maximum available penalty for those offences was five years imprisonment with no standard non-parole period.
57The three sexual assault offences occurred over a short period and were part of a single course of conduct that commenced in the early hours of 10 November 2010.  Those offences were not associated with any physical threats or injury or gratuitous humiliation and involved sexual intercourse without consent between parties to an on-going albeit at times unhappy relationship.  
58The sentencing judge found that the complainant suffered a great deal as a consequence of the offences.  Nevertheless, viewed objectively they are, as the applicant submits, well below a mid-range of objective seriousness. The maximum penalty for each is 14 years imprisonment with a seven year standard non-parole period.
59There are other factors to be taken into account.  They include that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation, that his prior criminal history was of a minor nature and that there is no particular need shown for specific deterrence.  However, general deterrence remains a significant factor.  It is also relevant, as the sentencing judge found, that the sentence would result in the applicant's first time in custody and, because of his somewhat immature personality, result in a need for long term assistance both with rehabilitation and in dealing with release.  
60In the circumstances it is my view that a lesser sentence than was passed by the sentencing judge is warranted in law.  That sentence is an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the five offences commencing on 4 May 2012 and ending on 4 April 2017 with a non-parole period expiring on 18 October 2014.  This involves an aggregate sentence of four years, eleven months, with a non-parole period of two years and five and one-half months.  In setting the non-parole period I have taken into account the applicant's need for the long term rehabilitation assistance referred to above. 
61The sentence that I would have imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence is one month for the first assault (count 1), five months for the second assault (count 2) - the sentences being served concurrently - and four years with a non-parole period for each of the remaining offences (counts 4, 5, and 6) of two years, again taking account of the special circumstances referred to above.
Proposed orders
62I have considered whether the miscarriage of justice in relation to counts 7 and 8 can be remedied more adequately by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the Court is empowered to make: Criminal Appeal Act, s 8.  Under s 6(2), if it allows an appeal against conviction, the Court may quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal subject to ""the special provisions"" of that Act, which include s 8: see the discussion in ST v R [2010] NSWCCA 5 at [2] - [4] per Basten JA.  This is not a case in which the evidence presented to the jury in relation to those counts was insufficient to support a conviction.  See, for example, Andrews v The Queen [1968] HCA 84; 126 CLR 198 at 211. Therefore, the discretionary power to order a new trial is engaged.  There are however several factors militating against the holding of a new trial.  First, the non-parole period for the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant in relation to all of the charged offences has almost expired.  Any sentence imposed if the applicant were convicted of the additional two counts is most unlikely to involve any further term of imprisonment taking into account the sentence already served.  Secondly, the two offences were part of a single course of conduct.  The applicant has already been convicted and sentenced in relation to most of that conduct.  However, in any new trial the evidence would have to address the whole of that conduct, and probably the earlier physical assaults, in order to explain the circumstances in which counts 7 and 8 are alleged to have occurred.  The applicant would have to deal with those circumstances and, if he maintains his denial of those counts, to give evidence as to circumstances of which he has already been convicted.  Thirdly, the complainant's interests are not likely to be advanced by her having to be cross examined for a third time on the same events.  Finally, as the applicant has been substantially dealt with in relation to the events of November 2010 there is no significant public interest in ensuring that the remaining counts be dealt with at a properly conducted trial
63Ordinarily the decision whether or not to continue a prosecution is for the executive and not the courts: Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; 201 CLR 603 at [103], [104] (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ); and Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; 210 CLR 285 at [23] (Gaudron and Hayne JJ) and [135] (Callinan J).  However, in this case I am satisfied for reason of the matters referred to above that the miscarriage of justice resulting in the quashing of counts 7 and 8 is not more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by an order directing a judgment and verdict of acquittal on those counts.  Accordingly I propose that order be made. I also note that the effect of the aggregate sentence that I propose in relation to counts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 is that the applicant became eligible for parole on 18 October 2014.
64The orders I propose are:
1. Extend to 16 August 2014 the time for the giving of notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal in respect of the convictions and sentence.
2. Grant leave to appeal in relation to conviction ground 1.
3. Quash the convictions on counts 7 and 8.
4. Direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered on counts 7 and 8.
5. Leave to appeal refused in relation to conviction grounds 2 and 3.
6. Grant leave to appeal in relation to sentencing grounds 1 and 2.
7. Quash the aggregate sentence of imprisonment for five years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and nine months.
8. Sentence the applicant/appellant to an aggregate term of imprisonment for four years and eleven months with a non-parole period of two years and five and a half months ending on 18 October 2014 and to date from 4 May 2012.
65HIDDEN J:  I agree with Meagher JA.
66RS HULME AJ:  I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Meagher JA in this matter.
67I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and generally with his Honour's reasons.

2704091,Morgan v R [2014] NSWCCA 284,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with Fullerton J.

2ADAMS J: I agree with Fullerton J.

3FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence imposed in the District Court in May 2013 pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) after he adhered to pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court to nine counts of break, enter and steal laid contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Each offence attracted a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 

4In the appointment of the indicative sentence on the first count, sixteen further offences were taken into account on a Form 1. They included: 
(a)thirteen further offences of break, enter and steal; 
(b)one offence of break and enter with intent; 
(c)one offence of possession of 0.44 grams of methylamphetamine; and
(d)one offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. 

5The nine break, enter and steal offences on the indictment, and the thirteen further offences on the Form 1, were committed between December 2011 and February 2012 when the applicant broke into private homes across suburban Sydney and stole cash, jewellery, laptop computers, phones, cameras, Xboxes, and iPods. None of the offences was committed in company. Each involved preplanning to some degree.

6The total value of the property stolen in respect of the nine counts on the indictment was estimated at $200,000. The value of the property the subject of the thirteen offences on the Form 1 was estimated at $105,000. 

7A significant amount of stolen property was recovered when search warrants were executed on the applicant's arrest. There was no evidence as to the differential between the value of the property stolen and the value of the property recovered. There was also a large quantity of property seized under warrant not identified as stolen property. That property, together with 35 items sold by the applicant at six pawn shops between 29 November 2011 and 17 January 2012, was the subject of the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime on the Form 1. 

8On the date of the sentence proceedings, the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of possessing child abuse material contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act on a separate indictment. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. It was dealt with in the imposition of the aggregate sentence. 

9The child abuse material comprised a total of 780 still images and 41 videos found on two computers seized on the applicant's arrest. One of the computers had been stolen on 6 January 2012. An examination of that computer revealed that the applicant had recently accessed a number of the files containing the child abuse material that had been downloaded by him. All but one of the still images on that computer fell within category 1 of the CETS scale and most of the videos within category 1 or 2 of that scale. Category 2 relates to non-penetrative sexual activity between children or masturbation by a child not involving an adult. Of the seven videos in category 4, at least one of 30 minutes in length, all contained explicit, serious and repeated penetrative sexual abuse of children. 

The sentences 

10After applying a discount of 25 per cent for each of the break, enter and steal offences and a 10 per cent discount for the plea of guilty to possession of the child abuse material (as to which there is no challenge) the following sentences, referable to their sequence numbers and in descending order of length, were indicated:

(a)possession of child abuse material - 18 months; 

(b)break, enter and steal, sequence 1, taking into account 16 matters on the Form 1 - 5 years; 

(c)break, enter and steal, sequence 7 - 4 years; 

(d)break, enter and steal, sequence 6 - 45 months; 

(e)break, enter and steal, sequences 10 and 18 - 39 months; and

(f)break, enter and steal, sequences 9,11, 13 and 17 - 33 months. 

11After a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 11 years was imposed with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months. The sentence dated from 29 April 2012 to account for the applicant's pre-sentence custody. The sentence was ordered to be served concurrently with a sentence imposed on 25 May 2012 in the Local Court for a number of driving offences committed in February 2012.

The break, enter and steal offences

12The facts with respect to the multiple break, enter and steal offences were also detailed in the sentencing reasons referable to their sequence numbers. It is sufficient for present purposes to deal with them in a summary way.

The Hunters Hill offence (sequence 1) 

13At about 1.40pm on 16 February 2012, the applicant drove to Milling Street, Hunters Hill, in a Suzuki Swift. He jemmied open the rear door of the house to gain entry. This entry activated a security alarm and alerted a neighbour who observed the applicant open the rear door of the premises. Once inside the applicant attempted to disable the security alarm by cutting the wires. He ransacked a number of rooms and stole a quantity of jewellery.

14The owner of the premises arrived home at about 1.48pm, having been notified that the alarm had been activated. He confronted the applicant. After a short struggle with the owner the applicant broke the glass window at the front of the house and escaped through it, sustaining cuts in the process.

15At about 3pm the same day, police located the Suzuki Swift in the carpark of the block of units where the applicant lived. When they searched the vehicle they located a significant amount of the property stolen from Milling Street together with property stolen from other premises at Park Road, Hunters Hill. (This was one of the offences on the Form 1.) Police also located a small amount of methylamphetamine (0.44 grams) inside the applicant's vehicle. 

16Police arrested the applicant later that day and charged him with the break, enter and steal of the property at Milling Street. A sample was taken from the applicant at that time for the purposes of DNA analysis. 

17Consequent upon his arrest police executed a search warrant at the applicant's residence where 601 items of stolen property (or property reasonably suspected of being stolen) were seized. Police executed a further search warrant at the applicant's residence on a later date during which a further 673 items were seized. 

The Oatlands offence (sequence 6)

18On 8 December 2011, the applicant broke into a residence at Cumbrae Place, Oatlands some time between 8.40am and 9.55pm and ransacked two rooms stealing jewellery, laptops, an iPod, moneyboxes and a game console. The property was valued at $49,449. 

19A neighbour saw the applicant walking beside the house on the day of the offence and provided the police with a description. The neighbour also reported the registration number of a Falcon parked nearby registered in the applicant's name. Five items seized under warrant from the applicant's home were identified by the owners as property stolen from them. 

The Epping offence (sequence 7)

20On 13 December 2011, the applicant broke into a residence at High Street, Epping some time between 7.30am and 10.40pm. He ransacked six rooms stealing jewellery, cameras and camera-related equipment and gaming items. The property was valued at $82,000. One of the cameras, identified by its serial number, was recovered from the applicant's home during the execution of the search warrant. The owner was unable to identify any of the other items stolen from her home amongst those seized under warrant. 

The Dundas offence (sequence 9)

21On 6 January 2012, the applicant broke into a residence at Rock Farm Avenue, Dundas some time between 10am and 10.45am. He ransacked five rooms and stole jewellery, two computers, three cameras, an iPad and an iPhone. This property was valued at $3,670.

22One of the computers was later found at the applicant's home during the execution of a search warrant onto which the applicant had downloaded the child abuse material the subject of the s 91H(2) offence. The owners identified thirteen items that had been stolen from their home amongst the items seized under warrant.

The Roseville offence (sequence 10)

23On 14 January 2012, the applicant broke into a residence at Belgium Avenue, Roseville. He ransacked five rooms and stole a quantity of jewellery valued at $27,960. He left behind a screwdriver. It had the applicant's DNA on the handle. The owner was not able to identify any of the property stolen from her home amongst the items seized under warrant.

The Beecroft offence (sequence 11)

24On 13 January 2012, the applicant broke into a residence at Copeland Road, Beecroft between 8.30am and 6.30pm. He ransacked seven rooms stealing $1,500 in cash, two computers, three iPods and two watches. The property was valued at $8,200. 

25The applicant left behind a glove which was also later used for DNA matching. The owners were unable to identify any of the property stolen from their home amongst the items seized under warrant, but were able to identify a watch which the applicant had pawned. It had been on-sold prior to the applicant's arrest.

The North Rocks offence (sequence 13)

26On 30 January 2012, the applicant broke into a residence at Speers Road, North Rocks some time between 8.00am and 8.20am. 

27During the commission of the offence, the owner returned home and confronted the applicant who claimed that he was in the wrong house. The owner saw that the applicant was holding a black computer bag and when challenged, the applicant ran from the premises. The owner pursued him. The applicant dropped the computer bag and made good his escape. The bag contained a laptop, a mobile phone and NZ$80. The property stolen (and recovered) was valued at $1,450. 

The West Pennant Hills offence (sequence 17)

28On 3 February 2012, the applicant broke into a residence at Aitkin Road, West Pennant Hills some time between 5.30pm and 10pm. He stole a quantity of jewellery and US$15. The applicant's DNA was on a torch left at the premises.

29The owners were not able to identify any of the property stolen from their home from amongst the items recovered during the execution of the search warrant.

The Cherrybrook offence (sequence 18)

30On 3 February 2012, the applicant broke into a residence at Tamarisk Crescent, Cherrybrook some time between 9.15am and 2pm. He ransacked every room and stole a quantity of jewellery, a camera, a handbag, perfume and some lottery tickets. The stolen property on this occasion was valued at $20,000. 

31The applicant left behind a glove, which police used to connect him to this offence via DNA profiling. 

32The owners identified 31 items stolen from their home from amongst the property seized under warrant. 

The Form 1 offences (taken into account on the Hunters Hill offence) 

33Each of the thirteen offences on the Form 1 were break, enter and steal offences of a similar nature to those on the indictment. They all involved the applicant breaking and entering suburban homes from which jewellery, cash and electronic devices were stolen, only a small proportion of which was recovered. Some items were able to be traced to a pawnshop from where they were on-sold.

34Two of the offences of the Form 1 involved offences committed on the same day as the offending the subject of sequence 1 - the day the applicant was arrested. In one offence, unique collectable Commonwealth minted coins and some jewellery was stolen valued at $5,000. The coins were recovered from the Suzuki Swift the applicant was driving on his arrest. A further fourteen items were identified by their owners when they viewed the property seized under warrant from the applicant's home. The remaining eleven break, enter and steal offences were committed during the preceding four weeks with multiple offences committed on some days.

The applicant's subjective circumstances 

35The applicant did not give evidence on sentence. His subjective circumstances were presented in the form of a comprehensive report from Ms Durkin, a forensic psychiatrist. The sentencing judge did not refer to the detail of the report. 

36His Honour sentenced the applicant on the basis that, apart from a substance abuse problem and a gambling problem, there were no other mental health or mental health-related issues, and no credible evidence that at the time of the offences the applicant was unaware of what he was doing or the consequences of his conduct. There was no suggestion that his judgment was impaired and no basis to conclude that at the time of any of the offences his moral culpability was reduced. 

37His Honour was satisfied that the applicant was motivated to fund his substance abuse and gambling problems which, in the conventional way, explains but does not excuse his offending. He also observed that despite there being no evidence that the applicant had participated in any rehabilitation programs in custody as at the date of sentence, he was satisfied that the applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and not reoffending.

38His Honour found that although the offending for which the applicant was to be sentenced was what he described as the applicant's ""first foray into crime"", and that it spanned a relatively short period of time, it nonetheless impacted on multiple victims. His Honour observed that the property stolen included jewellery that would likely be of sentimental value and electronic equipment, also likely to contain photographs of similar value and/or to record sensitive or private information. He also noted that a victim of a break and enter can experience feelings of unease when at home alone or returning home after an absence and in some cases those feelings can survive in the long term. His Honour accepted that although every home broken into was ransacked, there was no evidence that the applicant inflicted any wanton damage or vandalism.

39It was not submitted on the appeal that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the applicant's subjective circumstances, or that he overlooked any feature which might operate in mitigation of sentence. Rather, counsel submitted that the applicant's subjective case was a factor which distinguished him from other offenders in comparable cases involving multiple offences of break, enter and steal. In order to give that submission consideration, it is necessary to set out the applicant's subjective circumstances in some greater detail.

40The applicant was aged almost 29 at the date of sentence. Save for the driving offences committed in February 2012 (one of which involved driving dangerously during a police pursuit attracting a term of imprisonment of 12 months with an 8 month non-parole period), he had no criminal record. There was no evidence that he had the disadvantage of a dysfunctional upbringing. In the history given to Ms Durkin, it is obvious that he was the only child in a stable and positive home environment. The applicant described himself as a well adjusted child without behavioural or psychological issues. It would appear that he remained close to his parents throughout his adolescence and into his adulthood which eventually manifested in some incapacity to separate and forge independence from them and some social isolation in other spheres of his life. His parents remain supportive of him. 

41The applicant reported above average academic performance during primary school and progressing thereafter into secondary school until regular truanting in Year 11 required him to repeat that year's schooling. It would appear that it was at this time that the applicant was accepted into a peer group who were involved in drug use. He reported engaging in drug abusing behaviour to facilitate his acceptance into the peer group. 

42The applicant completed Year 12 after which he commenced work in the real estate industry. He continued in that vocation for some years before taking up a position in recruitment where he remained for a further three years. In the three years prior to entering custody he worked as an account manager ultimately progressing to a sales manager. He reported that it was that role which provided him with significant autonomy and that he began using and abusing drugs on a daily basis and gambling with regularity. While his winnings from time to time appear to have triggered a further deterioration in his functioning by facilitating his access to stimulant drugs, in particular ""ice"", which, in turn, became a feature of his gambling problem as he sought out those activities whilst affected under its stimulant effect. He progressed to the point where he was gambling on a daily basis and losing large amounts of money. This then triggered what was described as his use of ""less conservative pornographic materials"", ultimately culminating in his possession of the child abuse material for which he was sentenced. As his drug dependence intensified, he required additional sources of income to support his dependence. He apparently rationalised his actions at that time on the basis that the victims he stole from would be insured. With hindsight he accepted the significant detrimental effect of his behaviour on those people. 

The appeal

43At the hearing of the appeal, the sole ground of appeal was the contention that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive

44The aggregate sentence necessarily comprehended the sentence indicated for the child abuse material. Given the quite separate and distinct offending comprehended by that charge, the indicated sentence must have been notionally accumulated, to some degree, on the nine break, enter and steal offences the subject of a separate indictment. The focus of the submissions of both counsel was, however, on that part of the aggregate sentence which must be taken to account for the break, enter and steal offences. It appeared to be common ground that, in the application of totality principles, it was that offending which occupied his Honour' primary attention and to which, in a practical sense, the length of the aggregate sentence must be attributed. 

45The applicant submitted that on a review of a number of relevantly comparable cases where sentences for multiple break, enter and steal offences were the subject of consideration by this Court, a review amplified by the sentencing statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission, the sentence imposed in this case, is what counsel described as an ""outlier"", which I take to mean a sentence so far in excess of past sentences as to result in a sentence that is ""unreasonable and plainly unjust"". 

46The applicant's counsel accepted the limitations on the use that can be made of extrinsic material when challenging a sentence as manifestly excessive on appeal (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]). He also acknowledged that neither sentencing statistics nor past sentencing decisions fix a range within which sentence might or should fall or that sentences imposed in other cases dictate whether a sentence under challenge is beyond the exercise of a permissible sentencing discretion (see Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 305 ALR 323 at [28] and [41]). He maintained the submission however that when the whole of the circumstances that have informed sentences imposed in the past for comparable offending are examined, and where a sentence under challenge is not relevantly distinguishable on its facts and a markedly more severe sentence is imposed, then the past sentences may properly be used as a measure to assist an appellate court to decide whether a sentence said to be manifestly excessive is shown to be ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". 

47Accepting that to be a principled approach, the question remains whether the applicant has made good his challenge to the aggregate sentence imposed in this case as manifestly excessive. Counsel acknowledged that the question is not whether this Court would have imposed an aggregate sentence of the length of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge but, rather, whether the aggregate sentence imposed in this case, a sentence which I accept is at the upper limit of a notional range, was so excessive as to amount to error. 

48The applicant submitted that despite the sustained and repeated nature of the offending and the sheer quantity and estimated value of the property that was stolen, the degree of notional accumulation between the break, enter and steal offences has exceeded the exercise of a sound sentencing discretion having regard to the applicant's subjective circumstances and, in particular, the fact that he had no prior criminal record which ought to have afforded him some leniency which was not reflected in the aggregate sentence imposed.

49In two of three cases to which particular reference was made (Watts v R [2007] NSWCCA 153 and Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189), sentences were imposed by this Court on re-sentence in accordance with the approach in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 with the actual extent of accumulation between the individual sentences revealed in the sentencing order. In the third case (Hernandez v R [2013] NSWCCA 51), sentence was imposed pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, coincidentally by the same sentencing judge who imposed the aggregate sentence on this applicant. 

50The insertion of s 53A by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010 (NSW) was not intended to alter the application of totality principles. Rather, it is a procedural provision designed to simplify the sentencing process where an offender is to be sentenced for multiple offences and to render the sentencing exercise more transparent by requiring a sentence for each offence to be indicated by the sentencing judge before a single aggregate sentence is pronounced. The same principled approach to questions of accumulation and concurrency in the exercise of the sentencing discretion in fixing an aggregate sentence in conformity with totality principles obtains under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as it did under the previous sentencing regime where an effective sentence was the result of the appointment of different commencement dates for individual sentences. 

51Although a far larger cohort of cases was extracted in a schedule attached to the submissions of the applicant's counsel, the greater majority of which are not relevantly comparable and only some of which were the subject of elaboration in submissions of both counsel, it is necessary to refer to only three.

52In Watts, the offender pleaded guilty to eleven offences contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act, three offences contrary to s 113(1) and asked for 23 further offences to be taken into account. At first instance, he was sentenced to imprisonment for an effective term of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. On appeal, he was re-sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Unlike the applicant, the offender had an uncertain and occasionally violent upbringing, and a psychologist opined that he had depression and anxiety. He had made suicide attempts and was addicted to heroin. The Court allowed the sentence appeal because the value of the goods stolen by the offender (estimated at $83,000) was ""modest"" by comparison with the value of goods stolen by the offender in Danuca v R [2005] NSWCCA 45 (estimated at $785,000), and because Harrison J (with whom Giles JA and Hidden J agreed) was satisfied that an ""extremely unfortunate combination of factors influenced the applicant to commit the offences with which he was charged and to which he pleaded guilty"" (at [60]). In addition to Danuca, Harrison J also considered the cases of R v Lay [2006] NSWCCA 45 and R v Johnson [1999] NSWCCA 431, the offenders in both cases being young (20 years old and 22 years old respectively), both were addicted to drugs and had significant criminal histories. In those cases, involving 19 offences with 12 offences taken into account on a Form 1, and 7 offences with 14 offences taken into account on Form 1 respectively, effective sentences of 5 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, and 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, were imposed after orders for partial accumulation. 

53In Lewins, the offender pleaded guilty to four offences contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act and sentenced, at first instance, to imprisonment for an effective term of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. On appeal, the offender was re-sentenced to imprisonment for an effective term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. The offender was a professional thief and had a criminal record for offences of dishonesty dating from when he was aged 11. He had served a period of imprisonment for armed robbery. He had used drugs from an early age and was addicted to amphetamines for three years in his late teens. He was also addicted to gambling. The appeal was allowed on parity grounds. The co-offender, sentenced for the same offences in addition to 68 matters taken into account on a Form 1, was sentenced to an effective term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 12 months.

54In Hernandez, the offender pleaded guilty to seven offences contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act, one offence contrary to s 113(1) and one offence contrary to s 308E(1), and asked for ten further offences to be taken into account on a Form 1. Property valued at a total of $136,351 was stolen. The offender cut cables to disarm alarms and CCTV cameras in commercial premises before drilling or cutting into safes to access cash. He had prior convictions in the USA, including three offences of break, enter and steal and one of possessing burglary tools. The offender was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years. The offender gave evidence at the sentence proceedings that he committed the offences because he had accrued gambling debts and threats had been made to his wife. The sentence appeal was dismissed, there being no error in the process of accumulation that must have been undertaken by the sentencing judge by which the aggregate sentence was arrived at. Significantly for the present purposes, the Court said:

""[43] This Court has observed on a number of occasions (R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at 486; Murray v R [2013] NSWCCA 12) that questions of accumulation and totality are matters primarily within the discretion of the sentencing judge and this Court will be reluctant to intervene. Intervention can occur only on one of the well known bases for interference with a discretionary exercise: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.

[44] None of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced contain overlapping factual elements. That comment does not refer to the theoretical elements but to the factual circumstances of the commission of each offence.

[45] In other words, each offence was separate and no part of one offence overlapped with the other, except in relation to the offence of impairing electronic communications, which is ordinarily an aspect of the commission of certain types of break, enter and steal. All of the offences of break and enter (either with intent to steal or to steal) were committed on separate occasions and involved separate victims.

...

[49] Moreover, for a total of seven sentences of break, enter and steal, one sentence of break, enter with intent to steal and one sentence for impair electronic communications, which have maximum sentences of 14 years, 10 years and 10 years respectively, a total sentence in aggregate of 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years has been imposed. I reiterate that there were 10 further offences taken into account on a Form 1, which, in the sentences to which they were relevant, emphasise the need for deterrence.

[50] I accept that none of the offences are in the worst category. The applicant is not a person who has no criminal history and, as a consequence of that, he is not entitled to the leniency afforded a first offender. Nor is the applicant a person who has not before spent time in a penal institution.

[51] Notwithstanding the finding by the sentencing judge, with which I do not cavil, that the applicant has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, the history of the applicant and the circumstances of the offending show that specific and general deterrence are significant factors. Yet, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence on the applicant for nine offences, taking account of a further 10 on a Form 1, which is less than the maximum sentence for one break, enter and steal.

[52] In terms of totality of the sentence imposed, the extent of the accumulation and concurrency were not outside of the range available to his Honour in the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion. For this reason this ground of appeal also fails.""

55The Crown submitted that despite the applicant's favourable subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge was entitled to regard the objective gravity of the totality of the offending as overwhelming the leniency that might otherwise have been afforded the applicant in the appointment of an aggregate sentence. She further submitted that the sentence ultimately imposed, including the fact that a finding of special circumstances resulted in a significant variation to the statutory ratio under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, has not been shown to have exceeded his Honour's legitimate sentencing discretion or that the authorities referred to compel that conclusion. 

56Although no complaint is made about the individual sentences (as indicated), the Crown submitted the fact that they so readily withstood scrutiny provides strong support for rejecting the challenge to the aggregate sentence as ""unreasonable"" and ""plainly unjust"". 

57I am not persuaded that the applicant has made good his challenge to the aggregate sentence as an ""outlier"" or that the notional accumulation inherent in the appointment of the aggregate sentence, although a severe sentence, has breached totality principles.

58The order I propose is as follows:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

2704101,Livsey v Australian National Car Parks Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 232,"Judgment

Introduction

1Jacqueline Livsey hit her head on a lowering boom gate when leaving a car park operated by Australian National Car Parks Pty Ltd (""National Car Parks""). She claims damages for negligence.

Events

2At about 10am on 6 June 2012 Ms Livsey drove to the car park operated by National Car Parks at the Henry Lawson Centre in Penrith. It was raining as she turned into the car park entrance. A friend, Karen MacDonnell, was a passenger. Ms Livsey took a ticket that resulted in the boom gate lifting, allowing her to drive into the car park. She parked the car and proceeded to walk back across the car park driveway where she had entered the car park, and across the driveway where cars exited the car park. She had no umbrella. As she walked across the exit lane, Ms MacDonnell called out to warn of the descending boom gate, but to no avail. Ms Livsey's head came into contact with the boom gate. 

3Her purpose in going to Penrith was to attend the courthouse in support of the daughter of Ms MacDonnell who had a matter in court. After the incident Ms Livsey and Ms MacDonnell proceeded across Henry St to the courthouse opposite the car park.

4Although Ms Livsey felt the contact to her head, she did not immediately realize her head had come into contact with the boom gate. Ms MacDonnell informed her of this. Ms Livsey took some Panadol, sat in court for a short while, felt unwell and left the court. She bought some food but felt sick after a bite so she journeyed home.

5At about 7.30pm that evening Ms Livsey attended Westmead Hospital. The hospital records indicated she complained of vomiting from 12 noon, a headache and pain on the top of her skull. No bleeding, fracture or subluxation was detected. A CT scan was normal. After resting in the corridor, no hospital bed was available at about 4am and she went home.

6Ms Livsey has had a prior history of headaches but since the injury she complains that they have become more frequent and more severe. Ms Livsey also has had a past history of lower back pain. She was not working at the time of the accident, being on workers compensation benefits for a pre-existing back complaint. She also complained of hand numbness and urinary incontinence although an expert neurologist retained by her was unable to attribute these conditions to the accident. Nor was the neurologist able to attribute any diminished capacity for work or any care requirement to the accident. 

7She currently works at Hornsby TAFE for about 15 hours per week. She doubted she could work more hours because of migraines, her numbness and her back problems. She has four children, two at home aged 16 and 17 and two older children aged 22 and 24, one of whom assists her with the garden, some heavy lifting and domestic tasks.

8Ms Livsey's memory of the events was limited. She could not remember driving through the boom gate, whether she saw the exit boom gate and whether she collected a ticket at the boom gate. She said, ""My memory is shot"". 

9The boom gate is operated on an automatic mechanism. The presence of a car triggers the ticket mechanism, which is activated to produce a ticket when a button is pressed. When the ticket is collected, the entry boom gate rises to allow entry to the car. On exit, the presence of the car again triggers the operation of the machine. Insertion of the ticket (and if necessary payment of the fee) causes the boom gate to rise to allow exit. Once the car has left the area the boom gate lowers again. 

10No other person had ever reported to National Car Parks that they had been struck by this boom gate. Vladimir Kovalenko, the Area Operations Manager of National Car Parks, said that while working on boom gate mechanisms, his head had many times been struck by a boom gate, ""not this one"", but he had suffered no injury. A boom gate is designed to ""go back up"" if it touches something on descent, as it did when it contacted Mr Kovalenko.

11The car park contained a pedestrian walkway around it, and a pedestrian walkway through the centre of the car park.

Analysis

12It is apparent that Ms Livsey proceeded to exit the car park not via the pedestrian walkways through and surrounding the car park but by using the roadway where the vehicles exit. The presence of the boom gates was obvious to her as she entered the car park, and although she may not have given them particular attention, their presence on exiting the car park was likewise obvious.

13I am not persuaded that any further warning sign would have alerted her to the presence of the boom gate any more than her having to stop, press a button, take a ticket, and seeing the entry boom gate rise had already done.

14Sections 5F, 5G, 5H and 5I of the Civil Liability Act 2002 are as follows:

""Division 4 Assumption of risk

5F Meaning of 'obvious risk'

(1) For the purposes of this Division, an obvious risk to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person.
(2) Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge.
(3) A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring.
(4) A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable.

5G Injured persons presumed to be aware of obvious risks

(1) In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, a person who suffers harm is presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm if it was an obvious risk, unless the person proves on the balance of probabilities that he or she was not aware of the risk.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person is aware of a risk if the person is aware of the type or kind of risk, even if the person is not aware of the precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence of the risk.

5H No proactive duty to warn of obvious risk

(1) A person (the defendant) does not owe a duty of care to another person (the plaintiff) to warn of an obvious risk to the plaintiff.
(2) This section does not apply if:

(a) the plaintiff has requested advice or information about the risk from the defendant, or
(b) the defendant is required by a written law to warn the plaintiff of the risk, or
(c) the defendant is a professional and the risk is a risk of the death of or personal injury to the plaintiff from the provision of a professional service by the defendant.
(3) Subsection (2) does not give rise to a presumption of a duty to warn of a risk in the circumstances referred to in that subsection.

5I No liability for materialisation of inherent risk

(1) A person is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another person as a result of the materialisation of an inherent risk.
(2) An inherent risk is a risk of something occurring that cannot be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill.
(3) This section does not operate to exclude liability in connection with a duty to warn of a risk.""

15Assuming, in the present case, that the lowering boom gate constituted a risk of harm, then the risk of contact with a lowering boom gate was obvious to a reasonable person and thus Ms Livsey is presumed to be aware of it (under s 5G(1)). Because it was an obvious risk, National Car Parks did not owe her a duty to warn of it, pursuant to s 5H(1). 

16Further, I was not persuaded that Ms Livsey had proved that she was unaware of the risk. She was not aided by her poor memory. She must have noted the boom gate's presence when she entered and must have been aware of the raising and lowering of the boom gate, as was her friend, Ms MacDonnell. That she overlooked that she was in close proximity to the boom gate immediately before it struck her is insufficient to persuade me that she was unaware of the risk, bearing in mind the provision of s 5G(2).

17No particular significance is attached in the Civil Liability Act 2002 to being aware of the risk. While it may be seem relevant to a duty to warn, it is not a factor in the exclusion of that duty under s 5H(1).

18Similarly, there seems to me to be an inherent risk of contact with boom gates that operate automatically, unless pedestrians are precluded from accessing the boom gates. However, access cannot be precluded since a pedestrian cannot be precluded from taking the route a car would take to the exit. Thus, liability would appear to be excluded under s 5I.

19There was no evidence of malfunction by the boom gate and no prior injuries.

20Ms Livsey relied upon an expert report of Ian Burn, a civil engineer. Mr Burn gave evidence that:

""The layout of the car park...was conducive to pedestrians exiting the car park via the vehicle entry and exit lanes due to the location and nature of landscaping used to separate the car park from Henry Street"". 

21Mr Burn suggested a painted pedestrian route.

22Although the car laneways provided a way for pedestrians to exit the car park, in my view this was not a result of some defect in the layout of the car park. The car park did have a raised, painted pedestrian walkway through its centre, as well as pedestrian walkways around it. Moreover, the car laneways were obvious because of the painted arrows indicating the entrance and exit, and because Ms Livsey had just entered the car park. The car laneways may have provided a slightly more direct route, to exit the car park from the place Ms Livsey had parked to the courthouse where Ms Livsey desired to go, than did the pedestrian walkways. Yet that is not sufficient in my view to cause reasonable pedestrians to use that route, given the markings and obvious boom gates. If someone like Ms Livsey chose to walk where the cars travelled, by their entry they had just been alerted to the boom gates and could take steps to avoid them.

23Ms Livsey submits that part of the exit lane for cars should have been devoted exclusively to pedestrian usage. Yet this would result in an obvious danger, bringing cars and pedestrians into close proximity. It would also leave pedestrians in closer proximity to the boom gate. Accordingly, it would not reduce but rather tend to increase the risk of contact with the boom gate. 

24There was no evidence of the cost or the ability of National Car Parks as manager (but not owner of the land) to implement this change to the car park arrangements, or even to cause the owner to implement the change. 

25There is also nothing in this proposal by Mr Burns to indicate that it would have made any difference to Ms Livsey. She decided to walk across the car exit to exit the car park on a wet day. There is no evidence to indicate that a nearby path would have made a difference to her direction of travel, and I do not accept that it would. 

26A complaint was also made about the length of the boom gate, although the significance of this was not pressed. If it were shorter, it may have been less noticeable and might also have encouraged more pedestrians to use the exit without substantially lessening the risk of contact. It would thereby create an added risk of harm, in addition to that resulting from the increased proximity between cars and pedestrians.

27There was evidence that a contract existed between Ms Livsey and National Car Parks. The entry showed a sign indicating ""CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARKING"", although the conditions in evidence were not legible. Another sign indicated the charges for parking, and perhaps other conditions. Neither party sought to rely on the contract, although it seems to me to be relevant to the question of the nature of the duty owed. Nevertheless, the parties were content for me to decide the matter as if no contract existed between the parties, or if one did, it did not impact on liability in negligence. 

28In my view, Ms Livsey has not established any negligence by National Car Parks since there was no malfunction in the boom gate's operation. The primary claim for liability was based on the car park arrangement, but there is no evidence that National Car Parks owned the site or had the capacity to make changes to the layout. In any event, I do not find that there is any negligence in the layout of the site. 

29The requirements of ss 5B, 5D and 5E of the Civil Liability Act 2002 are as follows:

""5B General principles

(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:

(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and
(b) the risk was not insignificant, and
(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.
(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):

(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,
(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,
(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,
(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.

...

Division 3 Causation

5D General principles

(1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements:

(a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and
(b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person's liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).
(2) In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.
(3) If it is relevant to the determination of factual causation to determine what the person who suffered harm would have done if the negligent person had not been negligent:

(a) the matter is to be determined subjectively in the light of all relevant circumstances, subject to paragraph (b), and
(b) any statement made by the person after suffering the harm about what he or she would have done is inadmissible except to the extent (if any) that the statement is against his or her interest.
(4) For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.

5E Onus of proof

In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, the plaintiff always bears the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, any fact relevant to the issue of causation.""

30These provisions raise the question of whether the lowering boom gate constituted a risk of harm.

31Although the risk of contact with the boom gates is foreseeable, it is difficult to identify a risk of harm - or a not insignificant risk of harm - if the boom gate rises upon contact. Contact is not sufficient for harm. Mr Kovalenko's experiences indicate that without more evidence I should not accept that the boom gate is capable of causing harm. Apart from the limited evidence of Ms Livsey, there is no evidence that the boom gate descends with such force as to cause injury.

32Nor do I find that a reasonable person would take the precaution of installing another pedestrian walkway close to the vehicular exit under s 5B(1)(c) and s 5B(2) of the Act. This would involve the installation of another walkway parallel to and in close proximity to an existing pedestrian walkway, thus involving significant costs with little utility in reducing the risk of harm or in pedestrian walking distance.

33Further, and related to this, I was not persuaded that there was any damage suffered by Ms Livsey. There was some evidence that her headaches increased, but there was no evidence to indicate how relatively minor contact with the boom gate could cause this. I am not persuaded that it did. 

34It follows that I could not conclude that Ms Livsey's injury amounted to 15% or more of a most extreme case, and so damages for non-economic loss would be unavailable. Nor is Ms Livsey's claim for economic loss or need for care persuasive. She was not working before the accident although she now is. Ms Livsey was asked what had changed domestically, and she referred to her two children at home, aged 16 and 17, ""basically have to do a lot of things more for themselves"". However, Ms Livsey cooks and does grocery shopping and the children, she said, ""they can't really do things the best but they do help"". An older son assists her to make the beds and clean the bathroom, and they vacuum the stairs. But ""they have always been helpful"" she says. Any additional home assistance provided by her children is not shown to be attributable to her increased headaches and I am not satisfied that the six hours per week for six months threshold required for voluntary care under s 15(3) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 has been met.

Orders

35In accordance with these reasons, I order:
(1)Judgment for the defendant.
(2)The plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs.

INTRODUCTION

1THE COURT: In early November 2005 nine men were arrested in Sydney and charged with a variety of terrorism-related offences, laid under the Criminal Code (Cth) (""the Code""). In May 2007 all nine were arraigned in the Supreme Court on an indictment that alleged, against each, conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The trial was fixed to commence in late February 2008. Before a jury could be empanelled, eight months of pre-trial procedures took place, before Whealy J (as he then was). His Honour delivered many interlocutory judgments on procedural and evidentiary issues. 

2On 12 September 2008 Mazen Touma, one of the nine, pleaded guilty to four counts on a new indictment presented against him. The charges were:


acquisition of substantial quantities of firearm ammunition in preparation for a terrorist act or acts (this appears to have been charged under s 101.6 of the Code);
attempt to make one or more improvised explosive device(s) in preparation for a terrorist act or acts (this also appears to be a charge under s 101.6 of the Code);
two counts of possession of certain items connected with preparation for a terrorist act or acts, knowing of that connection (s 101.4 of the Code).

The dates of the offences coincided with the dates of the conspiracy alleged against all nine.

The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director"") accepted the pleas in substitution for the conspiracy count on the original indictment. On 24 October 2008 Touma was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months: Regina (C'Wealth) v Touma [2008] NSWSC 1475.

3On 24 October 2008 Mirsad Mulahalilovic, another of the nine, pleaded guilty to a single charge of possession of a small quantity of firearm ammunition which was connected with the preparation for a terrorist act or acts, being reckless as to the connection (s 101.4(2) of the Code). The Director accepted this plea in substitution for the original indictment. On 30 January 2009 Mulahalilovic was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months: Regina (C'Wealth) v Mulahalilovic [2009] NSWSC 1010.

4On 3 November 2008, Omar Baladjam, also one of the nine charged, pleaded guilty to four counts on an indictment. The counts were similar to those to which Touma pleaded guilty. On 7 April 2009 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 14 years: Regina (C'Wealth) v Baladjam (NSWSC, Whealy J, 7 April 2009, unreported).

5A fourth of the nine men, Khaled Sharrouf, was initially found unfit to be tried. An order was made for his separate trial. Subsequently, he was found fit to be tried, and, on 3 August 2009, entered a plea of guilty to a count of possession of items connected with the preparation for a terrorism act, knowing of that connection. On 24 September 2009 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 11 months and 7 days: Regina (C'Wealth) v Sharrouf [2009] NSWSC 1002. The Director accepted the plea as concluding the charges against Sharrouf.

6On 3 November 2008 a jury was empanelled for the trial of the five remaining accused men, the present appellants: Mohamed Ali Elomar, Abdul Rakib Hasan, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho and Mohammed Omar Jamal. Since Whealy J was satisfied of the matters required by s 19(2) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), a jury of 15 was empanelled. With the exception of Khaled Cheikho and Moustafa Cheikho, when referring to any appellant individually, we will use his surname only.

7The trial proceeded over the following 11 months. On 16 October 2009 the jury returned verdicts of guilty of the charge of conspiracy against each appellant. On 15 February 2010 Whealy J sentenced the appellants as follows:

Elomar: imprisonment for 28 years with a non-parole period of 21 years; 

Hasan: imprisonment for 26 years with a non-parole period of 19 years and 6 months;

Khaled Cheikho: imprisonment for 27 years with a non-parole period of 20 years and 3 months; 

Moustafa Cheikho: imprisonment for 26 years with a non-parole period of 19 years and 6 months;

Jamal: imprisonment for 23 years with a non-parole period of 17 years and 3 months: see R v Elomar; R v Hasan; R v Cheikho; R v Cheikho; R v Jamal [2010] NSWSC 10; 264 ALR 759 (""RoS""). 

8Except for the sentence imposed on Jamal, each sentence was specified to commence on 8 November 2005, the day the appellants were arrested. The sentence imposed on Jamal was specified to commence on 21 December 2005. 

9Each appellant now appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence.

10The charge of conspiracy to do an act or acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts stems from a combination of s 101.6 and s 11.5 of the Code. Section 101.6 appears in Pt 5.3 of the Code, which carries the heading ""Terrorism"" and contains a detailed regime of provisions concerning offences of that nature. Section 101.6 provides as follows:

""101.6 Other acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts

(1) A person commits an offence if the person does any act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act. 
Penalty: Imprisonment for life. 

(2) A person commits an offence under subsection (1) even if: 
(a) a terrorist act does not occur; or 
(b) the person's act is not done in preparation for, or planning, a specific terrorist act; or 
(c) the person's act is done in preparation for, or planning, more than one terrorist act. 

(3) Section 15.4 (extended geographical jurisdiction - category D) applies to an offence against subsection (1).""

11 A ""terrorist act"" is defined in s 100.1 in the following way:

""terrorist act means an action or threat of action where: 

(a) the action falls within subsection (2) and does not fall within subsection (3); and 
(b) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; and 
(c) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of: 
(i) coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country, or of part of a State, Territory or foreign country; or 
(ii) intimidating the public or a section of the public."" 

Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) provide:

""(2) Action falls within this subsection if it: 

(a) causes serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
(b) causes serious damage to property; or 
(c) causes a person's death; or 
(d) endangers a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or 
(e) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public; or 
(f) seriously interferes with, seriously disrupts, or destroys, an electronic system including, but not limited to: 
(i) an information system; or 
(ii) a telecommunications system; or 
(iii) a financial system; or 
(iv) a system used for the delivery of essential government services; or 
(v) a system used for, or by, an essential public utility; or 
(vi) a system used for, or by, a transport system.""

(3) Action falls within this subsection if it: 

(a) is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action; and 
(b) is not intended: 
(i) to cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
(ii) to cause a person's death; or 
(iii) to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or 
(iv) to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.

(4) In this Division: 

(a) a reference to any person or property is a reference to any person or property wherever situated, within or outside Australia; and 
(b) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other than Australia.""

12 Section 11.5 provides as follows:

""11.5 Conspiracy 

(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed. 
Note: Penalty units are defined in section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 . 

(2) For the person to be guilty: 

(a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and 
(b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and 
(c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement. 

(2A) Subsection (2) has effect subject to subsection (7A). 

(3) A person may be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence even if: 

(a) committing the offence is impossible; or 
(b) the only other party to the agreement is a body corporate; or 
(c) each other party to the agreement is at least one of the following: 
(i) a person who is not criminally responsible; 
(ii) a person for whose benefit or protection the offence exists; or 
(d) subject to paragraph (4)(a), all other parties to the agreement have been acquitted of the conspiracy. 

(4) A person cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence if: 

(a) all other parties to the agreement have been acquitted of the conspiracy and a finding of guilt would be inconsistent with their acquittal; or 
(b) he or she is a person for whose benefit or protection the offence exists. 

(5) A person cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence if, before the commission of an overt act pursuant to the agreement, the person: 

(a) withdrew from the agreement; and 
(b) took all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence. 

(6) A court may dismiss a charge of conspiracy if it thinks that the interests of justice require it to do so. 

(7) Any defences, procedures, limitations or qualifying provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence. 

(7A) Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence. 

(8) Proceedings for an offence of conspiracy must not be commenced without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, a person may be arrested for, charged with, or remanded in custody or on bail in connection with, an offence of conspiracy before the necessary consent has been given.""

The indictment

13The indictment was in the following terms:

""The Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, who prosecutes in this behalf for Her Majesty, charges on 3 November 2008 that

Mohamed ELOMAR, Abdul Rhakib HASAN, Khaled CHEIKHO, Moustafa CHEIKHO, and Mohammed Omar JAMAL

Between about 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and with Omar Baladjam, Mazen Touma, Khaled Sharrouf, Mirsad Mulahalilovic, and divers others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act (or acts).

Particulars of the terrorist act (or acts)

The terrorist act (or acts) was (or were) to involve an action or threat of action involving the detonation of one or more explosive devices or the use of firearms or both that was (or were) to be done or threatened:

a) With the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; and

b) With the intention of:

i. Coercing, or influencing by intimidation the Government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country or a part of a State, Territory or foreign country; or

ii. intimidating the public or a section of the public; and

c) In circumstances where the action, if carried out, would:

ii. Cause serious damage to property; and/or

iii. Cause a person's death; and/or

iv. Endanger a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; and/or

vi. Create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public; and

d) In circumstances where the action to be done or threatened would not be advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action, or alternatively would not be advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action of a kind not intended to:

ii. Cause a person's death; or

iii. Endanger a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or

iv. Create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.""

14It will be observed that the indictment specifically named Baladjam, Touma, Sharrouf and Mulahalilovic as members of the conspiracy, as well as ""divers others"".

15Each appellant has filed an individual Notice of Appeal against conviction, and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. A good proportion of the grounds they have pleaded are common to all, or some, of the appellants. In many cases, the appellants have adopted grounds framed by others. There remain, however, some grounds relied upon by only one, or a small number, of appellants.

An overview of the Crown case

16Although it will be necessary, in due course, to refer to parts of the evidence in more detail, the Crown case may, in the first instance, be stated with relative brevity. What follows is drawn largely from the sentencing remarks of Whealy J on 15 February 2010: see RoS. The Crown case was as follows.

17Each of the appellants is, or perceives himself to be, a devout adherent of the Muslim faith. Each could properly be called a fundamentalist or extremist. Over a period that commenced no later than 4 May 2005, each appellant agreed with each other appellant, and with others, to take steps towards an act (or acts) of terrorism. The conspiracy came to an end on 8 November 2005 with the arrest of all appellants. On that day Jamal was arrested but released, and re-arrested on 21 December 2005.

18The object of the conspiracy was to equip the appellants with the knowledge for, or to enable, a terrorist act or acts to be carried out in Australia. The purpose was to instil terror and panic in the Australian community, and to force the Australian government to change its alliances and foreign policies. The terrorist act(s) contemplated involved the detonation of one or more explosive devices, or the use of firearms, or both.

19Included in the Crown case was evidence that before the commencement date specified in the indictment, Moustafa Cheikho attended a militarist Islamic training camp in Pakistan. Objection was taken on behalf of all appellants to the admission of the evidence. The Crown sought to lead the evidence against all accused. On 15 April 2008, Whealy J ruled that the evidence would be admitted against Moustafa Cheikho: Regina (C'Wealth) v Baladjam [No 7] [2008] NSWSC 756.

20As a consequence of that ruling, applications were made on behalf of Hasan and Elomar for separate trials. On 30 September 2008, Whealy J rejected the applications: Regina (C'Wealth) v Baladjam [No 49] [2008] NSWSC 1468.

21During the course of the conspiracy, the appellants communicated extensively with one another and with others, often by telephone, and sometimes using coded language. Each of the appellants undertook various tasks. It is not necessary, for present purposes, to identify the precise activities of each appellant. It is sufficient to say that they amassed an armoury of firearms (some of them authorised by appropriate licences), together with large volumes of ammunition. They purchased laboratory equipment. They collected (usually, but not always, electronically) a considerable library of literature containing instructions on the manufacture of explosives, and the detonation of various improvised explosive devices. Much of this literature was in the Arabic language. They obtained a large number of mobile telephones, almost always (if not always) in false names. They purchased chemicals and other materials suitable for use in the manufacture and detonation of explosives. They were in possession (again, usually electronically) of a very large quantity of extremist literature, advocating the pursuit of ""Jihad"" (or ""holy war"") and expressing propagandist fundamentalist Islamic beliefs.

22The appellants were under suspicion, and were the subject of surveillance, for some months prior to their arrest. Many of their conversations were recorded pursuant to warrants issued under the Surveillances Devices Act 2007 (NSW), or the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth). 

23On two occasions, in March and April 2005, some of the appellants travelled to remote bushland areas of NSW, where they camped for two to three days. (The Crown was not able to establish that these trips were for the purpose of ""training"" in terrorist activities; rather, the Crown contented itself with describing the camps as ""bonding sessions"".)

24At least by the closing stages of the conspiracy, the appellants were aware that they were under suspicion. Indeed, from June 2005, search warrants were executed on the premises of many, if not all, of the suspects, and on various motor vehicles.

25Even before then, the appellants engaged in evasive and concealment activities. The acquisition of mobile telephones in false names was one instance of such behaviour. Another was making travel arrangements under false names. 

26It was not the Crown case that the conspirators had identified a specific target, nor even a specific method of achieving their objective. No precise terrorist act had been selected; nor had any precise perpetrator or perpetrators been nominated. The conspiracy, when brought to an end with the arrest of the participants, was still in the planning stages. That, no doubt, explains why the conspiracy alleged was formulated by reference to s 101.6 of the Code (that is, preparation for terrorist activity).

27It was the Crown case that the appellants were associated with another group of Islamic fundamentalists operating in Victoria. This group was also under suspicion, and subject to surveillance. That surveillance also included interception of telephone communications, and the use of listening devices. It was not the Crown case that this group was part of the conspiracy alleged against the appellants. The Crown relied on the evidence of the association in order to establish the state of mind, and the thinking, of the appellants in conducting themselves as they did. This evidence came to be known as ""the Melbourne evidence""; it is the subject of some considerable controversy, and will be referred to in more detail below.

28The leader of the Melbourne group, on the Crown case, was a well known Islamic cleric named Abu Nacer Benbrika (""Benbrika""). Another prominent member of the group was Aimen Joud (""Joud""). The evidence in the Crown case included the recording of a conversation on 23 February 2005, to which Benbrika and Sharrouf were parties. Benbrika is recorded as advocating that, in the cause of Jihad, it was necessary that Muslim adherents ""do maximum damage"" to the lives and the property of non-believers or the enemies of Islam. This came to be known as ""the maximum damage conversation"" and plays a significant role in the appeal.

29Although four (Touma, Mulahalilovic, Baladjam and Sharrouf) of the nine men initially arrested and charged were dealt with separately (see [2]-[5] above), it remained the Crown case that they were part of the conspiracy alleged against the appellants. That had some evidentiary implications. Evidence of their overt acts was admissible against the appellants. 

Some relevant procedural chronology

30On a date or dates that we are unable to ascertain, the Director provided to the then accused a document entitled ""Crown Case Statement"", and another entitled ""Summary of Overt Acts"". The former was said to contain an overview of the evidence upon which the Crown then intended to rely at trial. It did not purport to be ""an exhaustive summary"" and was said to be subject to change and possible amplification. The latter was expressed to be intended to be read in conjunction with the Crown Case Statement.

31 The principal issues at trial were:

During the relevant period,

(1) Did a conspiracy of the kind alleged by the Crown exist? 

(2) If it did, was each offender a participant in that conspiracy? 

The defence raised by each appellant was that, even if such a conspiracy were in existence, which was denied, he was not a party to it. Others may have been, but he was not. 

32Pre-trial proceedings with respect to the charges against the present appellants began in February 2008. Over the following eight months, Whealy J disposed of numerous interlocutory applications and resolved numerous evidentiary issues. At this time, not only the present appellants, but also Touma, Mulahalilovic, Baladjam and Sharrouf were subject to the indictment. It was only after the completion of the pre-trial procedures that they took the various courses they did.

33On 5 February 2008 a trial commenced in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne before Bongiorno J. Twelve men were charged with offences against Pt 5.3 of the Code. One of the men was Benbrika. Another was Joud. The Crown opening in the trial attracted a considerable degree of media attention.

34In February 2008 applications were made on behalf of all of the present appellants. The first application was made to Bongiorno J, by intervention in the Melbourne proceedings on 20 February. The appellants sought orders restraining publication of certain evidence anticipated in the Melbourne trial, particularly the names of any of the present appellants who might be mentioned in the Melbourne trial; the concern was with any such evidence that might link any of the appellants with Benbrika. After hearing argument, Bongiorno J refused the application, but suppressed publication of details of the application until further order: R v Benbrika (Ruling No 19) [2008] VSC 48.

35The second application was made to Whealy J on 25 February 2008. Again, the appellants sought orders restricting publication of any evidence in the Melbourne trial that might identify the appellants. They sought a specific order prohibiting publication of any reference to Benbrika other than by the pseudonym ""C"" or ""Mr C"". On behalf of Jamal only, a temporary stay of the trial was sought.

36The application was supported by an affidavit affirmed by the solicitor representing Mulahalilovic and Khaled Cheikho, but, for the purpose of the application, representing all the then accused. Annexed to the affidavit was a large quantity of media material, taken from the internet, and from print and electronic media outlets. The print materials included newspapers circulating in Sydney.

37The media material presented reported the proceedings in the Melbourne trial, with extensive reference to the lengthy opening in the trial given by the Crown prosecutor. It included:

""The leader of a Melbourne-based terrorist group told his members they should kill 1000 non-believers to try to force the withdrawal of Australian troops from Iraq, a court has heard. Among targets discussed to inflict maximum casualties were railway stations or football grounds, the Victorian Supreme Court was told today.""

Later in the report, the Melbourne accused were named. Benbrika was identified as the ""leader and director"" of the terrorist group.

38In another report, it was said that the Crown alleged that the organisation, led by Benbrika, was ""stockpiling a vast library of extremism material"". Other reports were to similar effect. One began:

""Just weeks out from the 2004 Federal election a Melbourne man urged his Muslim spiritual leader to facilitate a terrorist attack on an Australian target before the poll, a court heard today.""

Some of the material contained photographs of Benbrika. He is somewhat distinctive in appearance.

39Whealy J took a similar course to that taken by Bongiorno J. He declined to make the orders sought, but prohibited publication of details of the application. He declined to stay the trial: R (Cth) v Baladjam; R (Cth) v Cheikho; R (Cth) v Cheikho; R (Cth) v Elomar; R (Cth) v Hasan ; R (Cth) v Jamal; R (Cth) v Mulahalilovic ; R (Cth) v Sharrouf; R (Cth) v Touma [2008] NSWSC 714; 270 ALR 92. 

40In March 2008, relying on s 11.5(6) of the Code, all accused sought orders dismissing the charge of conspiracy. On 18 March, Whealy J rejected the applications: R (Cth) v Baladjam; R (Cth) v Cheikho; R (Cth) v Cheikho; R (Cth) v Elomar; R (Cth) v Hasan ; R (Cth) v Jamal; R (Cth) v Mulahalilovic ; R (Cth) v Sharrouf; R (Cth) v Touma (No 4) [2008] NSWSC 726; 270 ALR 106. Several of the accused sought leave, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), to appeal against that decision. Leave to appeal was refused: R v B [2008] NSWCCA 85; 76 NSWLR 533.

41In May 2008, as part of the pre-trial procedures, counsel for all appellants sought the exclusion of the Melbourne evidence, challenging its relevance and relying on s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), pursuant to which, in a criminal trial, evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown must be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Reliance was placed upon further reporting of the evidence in the Melbourne trial, including reports of evidence that three of the Melbourne accused had travelled to Sydney to take part in a ""training camp""; reports of evidence that the 2005 AFL Grand Final was nominated as the original bombing target of the Melbourne group; and reports of evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"". 

42In a lengthy judgment, dated 28 May 2008, Whealy J determined that the evidence would be admitted: Regina (C'Wealth) v Baladjam [No 19] [2008] NSWSC 1441. He made particular reference to evidence of an interview with Benbrika broadcast on the ABC television current affairs programme, ""the 7.30 Report"". A suggestion that the transcript of the interview be read, rather than showing Benbrika's face, was opposed by the Crown on the grounds that assessment of his demeanour was important, and was not ultimately adopted. Ultimately, by agreement between the parties, throughout the trial Benbrika was referred to as ""Sheikh Bakr"" (a name he did, at times, use), and the other members of the Melbourne group by their first names only. 

43In August 2008, senior counsel for Elomar, supported by counsel for all other accused, renewed the application for exclusion of the Melbourne evidence, and some other evidence of conversations involving one or more of the accused. These conversations were, generally, conversations that could be interpreted as signifying extremist attitudes and views held by the accused. Also subject of the application was evidence of the contents of computers and other material found in the possession of the accused.

44For the purpose of determining that application, Whealy J was provided with three folders of evidentiary material. This consisted of transcripts of recorded conversations in which the various accused had participated, and also of the computer material.

45On 26 August 2008, Whealy J again determined that the evidence would be admitted: R (Cth) v Baladjam; R (Cth) v Cheikho; R (Cth) v Cheikho; R (Cth) v Elomar; R (Cth) v Hasan ; R (Cth) v Jamal; R (Cth) v Mulahalilovic ; R (Cth) v Sharrouf; R (Cth) v Touma (No 38) [2008] NSWSC 1458; 270 ALR 187.

46In due course, it will be necessary to deal in more detail with what is encompassed in ""the Melbourne evidence"".

47On 15 and 16 September 2008, verdicts were delivered in the Melbourne trial. Seven of the 12 accused, including Benbrika, were convicted of the offence of knowingly being members of a terrorist organisation (s 102.3 of the Code). Some of the accused were also convicted of other (Pt 5.3 of the Code) offences. The convictions attracted further media attention. At this time, a jury for the trial of the appellants had not been empanelled. 

48In October 2008, objection was taken on behalf of all accused to the admission of some of the so-called ""extremist material"" found to be in their possession. On 2 October Whealy J ruled that the majority of the material would be admitted, with some exclusions and modifications: Regina (C'Wealth) v Baladjam & Ors [No 50] (NSWSC, Whealy J, 2 October 2008, unreported). 

49On 9 October 2008 the appellants sought various non-publication orders. The orders sought were directed, not to the Crown, but to the media generally. Various media outlets were represented at the hearing. Specifically, the appellants sought an order prohibiting publication of evidence tending to connect the Melbourne proceedings with the trial of the appellants; an order prohibiting further publication of the 7.30 Report interview; an order prohibiting publication of any photograph or image of Benbrika; and an order prohibiting publication of the application or its hearing.

50Ultimately, Whealy J made orders in the following terms:

""i. that there be no publication of any information tending to connect criminal proceedings in Victoria against Benbrika [and the other Melbourne accused], information or evidence revealed therein, and (a) the proceedings in this Court [against the original nine accused], and (b) [against the present appellants].

ii. no further publication for the duration of the trial in this Court ... of the interview between Abdul Nacer Benbrika and the ABC on 4 August 2005 or any part thereof.

iii. for the duration of any such trial in this Court as aforesaid, no further publication of any photograph or image, drawing or representation of Abdul Nacer Benbrika taken from the said interview or derived in any way from it. 

iv. no publication of this application, this hearing or of the orders made pursuant to this hearing."": Regina (C'Wealth) v Baladjam & Ors [No 59] (NSWSC, Whealy J, 10 November 2008, unreported)

51Between 27 October and 3 November 2008 a jury was empanelled in the Supreme Court for the trial of the appellants. Each appellant entered a plea of not guilty. The Crown opened the case to the jury over a period of 5 days. Counsel for all appellants made opening statements to the jury. They made clear that the vast majority of the prosecution evidence was not in dispute. What was in dispute was what inferences could properly be drawn from the evidence - that is, whether it could properly be held to establish participation in a conspiracy of the kind alleged.

52On 26 November 2008 - that is, about four weeks into the trial - the jury sent a note to the judge. The note expressed concerns about two incidents that had taken place during the previous week. The first incident involved four jurors, who said that they had been followed to the car park they used. The second involved one juror, who believed that she had been observed in her car by a woman, who made notes in a notepad, and made a telephone call. The inference was clear, that the jurors suspected that the woman was making a note of their car registration or other details. The note identified a woman who wore a headscarf and who they had seen in the public gallery of the court.

53Whealy J brought this note to the attention of all counsel, in private chambers. The discussion in chambers was taken down by a court reporter, transcribed, and became part of the trial transcript. As was apparent from the note, the woman had been a regular attender at the trial, in the public gallery. During the discussion in chambers it emerged that she was a niece of Elomar, and had been consulted from time to time during the trial by Elomar's solicitor. The jury may have been able to observe this interaction, and deduce that she was associated with at least one of the then accused.

54Whealy J referred the note to the attention of police for enquiries to be made. Senior counsel appearing for Moustafa Cheikho indicated that his instructions were to apply for a discharge of the jury. 

55On the return of the jury to the court, Whealy J directed them at some length concerning the incidents. He told the jury that there was ""not the slightest suggestion that this incident had anything to do with the accused"" and reminded them, forcefully, that they were to judge the trial impartially and on the evidence heard in the court. Later on the same day all appellants joined Moustafa Cheikho in seeking discharge of the jury. Whealy J heard argument from counsel. Still later in the day, the Crown prosecutor indicated that he had received instructions from the Director not to oppose the application for discharge.

56Notwithstanding the position taken by the Director, Whealy J declined to discharge the jury: Regina (C'Wealth) v Elomar [No 4] [2008] NSWSC 1444. Thereafter, he made arrangements for the jury to be conveyed to and from the court by bus. This episode is the subject of one of the grounds of appeal and will be considered in more detail below.

57On 3 February 2009 Bongiorno J sentenced those convicted in the Melbourne trial. The sentences attracted a degree of media attention.

58On 11 February 2009 all appellants applied for discharge of the jury. These applications were based upon what was called ""large scale publicity"" following the sentencing of the Melbourne accused. On 6 March 2009, Whealy J refused the application: Regina (C'Wealth) v Elomar [No 12] [2009] NSWSC 448.

59The trial proceeded. Of the appellants, only Hasan gave oral evidence. On 11 September 2009, during the course of the summing up, application was made on behalf of four of the accused for discharge of the jury. The basis for the application was that it had been widely reported in the media that a terrorist bombing had taken place in Mumbai, India, and there were reports of terrorist activity in Britain. On 21 September, Whealy J refused the application: Regina (C'Wealth) v Elomar [No 27] [2009] NSWSC 985. Verdicts of guilty were returned on 16 October 2009. The appellants were sentenced on 15 February 2010: see RoS.

The evidence in the Crown case

60As indicated by the opening statements of all counsel, a considerable proportion of the evidence relied upon as establishing the conspiracy was not in dispute. What was in dispute was the motivation of the appellants in undertaking their activities. The Crown sought to prove that, in the case of each appellant, by a very large quantity of circumstantial evidence.

61The appellants were under surveillance over a considerable period of time. Listening devices, authorised pursuant to relevant legislation, and telephone intercepts, similarly authorised, produced a large volume of evidence. As mentioned above, search warrants were executed in June, July and August 2005 on the homes of various of the alleged participants. Further search warrants were executed at the homes of all appellants on the day of their arrest, 8 November 2005.

62The Crown set out to prove that the motivation of each appellant was to engage in an act or acts of terrorism by proving that each held extremist, fundamentalist, Islamic beliefs, and was committed to ""Jihad"". ""Jihad"" is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as (in Islam) a ""spiritual struggle, efforts made in the cause of God; at the personal level, a struggle to be righteous and follow in God's path; at the community level, a struggle or holy war in support of Islam against unbelievers"".

63Two principal ways in which the Crown sought to prove the state of mind of the appellants were through extremist literature found, on execution of search warrants, to be in their possession, some of it in hard copy, the majority in electronic form, and through statements out of their own mouths, in the recorded conversations. The execution of search warrants produced vast amounts of material that may properly be called ""extremist"". One controversial aspect of the evidence by which the Crown sought to demonstrate the motivation of the appellants was the discrete body of evidence known as ""the Melbourne evidence"". This will be outlined in more detail below.

64It is now necessary to set out the Crown case in more detail. Before coming to that task, we make the following observation. The logistics of these appeals were, as were the logistics of the trial, formidable. The Court therefore required the Crown to provide a summary of material evidence advanced at trial, and the appellants to respond by identifying any areas of dispute, and any material relevant to the grounds of appeal said to have been omitted from the Crown summary. In what follows we have relied heavily upon the Crown document, in the light of the responses of the appellants.

65The evidence presented on behalf of the Crown fell into a number of categories, as indicated below:

(i)physical conduct of the appellants, and of others alleged to be involved in the conspiracy;

(ii)possession by the appellants (and others) of extremist Islamic literature;

(iii)possession of training and instructional literature;

(iv)possession by the appellants (and others) of instructional material relevant to the manufacture and use of explosive devices;

(v)acquisition and possession of chemicals and other items suitable for use in the manufacture and detonation of explosive devices;

(vi)acquisition and possession of firearms and ammunition;

(vii)acquisition, possession and use of numerous mobile telephones registered in false names;

(viii)association by the appellants with each other (and with others);

(ix)use of concealment and counter-surveillance techniques;

(x)the Melbourne evidence.

By this categorisation, we do not intend to suggest that any item of evidence fits into only one category. The categories are not mutually exclusive. As is the case with most filing systems, much of the evidence could rationally be placed into more than one category. The categorisation has been adopted as a convenient method of setting out the Crown evidence.

66In reviewing the evidence in the Crown case, it will be convenient to refer also, as briefly as possible, to any admissibility or procedural issues that arose concerning that evidence. This will be done with particular attention to those issues that arise in the appeals. 

Category (i): Physical conduct of the appellants, and of others alleged to have been involved in the conspiracy 

67The physical activities relied upon by the Crown overlapped, but were not co-extensive with, the overt acts particularised as acts undertaken in furtherance of the conspiracy relied upon by the Crown in the Summary of Overt Acts. Some pre-dated the commencement date alleged in the indictment. Others were not said by the Crown to have been undertaken in furtherance of the conspiracy, but had other evidentiary value, as will become apparent. This evidence included the following:


the attendance, in 2001, of Moustafa Cheikho at a ""training camp"" in Pakistan; 
the purchase by Hasan on two occasions in 2004, of more than 15 topographical maps, containing topographical data concerning Sydney and a large geographical area to the north, south and west of Sydney;
inquiries, by Hasan, about four-wheel drive motoring books;
the purchases, also by Hasan in 2004 and 2005, of a large quantity of camping equipment, including heavy duty backpacks, bed rolls and other items, which he told a shop assistant were for a training camp for Islamic youth with which he was involved;
attendance by some of the appellants at two ""bonding camps"" in March and April 2005 (see Category (viii) below). 

It is necessary to say more about the first of these, the attendance by Moustafa Cheikho at a training camp in Pakistan. The evidence showed that, in 2001, Moustafa Cheikho travelled to Pakistan for the purpose of attending a ""training camp"" conducted by an Islamic religious organisation called Lashkar-e-Taiba (""LeT""). LeT had a military operation, the origins of which lay in opposition to the Indian occupation of Kashmir. 

68The evidence concerning Moustafa Cheikho's attendance at the LeT camp was given by an American citizen (of Korean origin), Yong Ki Kwon, who gave evidence by audio visual link from the United States. Kwon had himself been charged in America with offences, and had initially been sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years and 6 months. A series of reductions granted by reason of his assistance to American and other authorities eventually brought his sentence down to one of 38 months. 

69Kwon had attended the LeT camp in late 2001. The camp was situated in a number of locations. Kwon described the training as involving three steps. The first, of about 12 days, involved familiarisation with weapons; the second, of 30 to 33 days, consisted of ""commando training"", including camouflage, reconnaissance, field manoeuvres, target shooting, external communication devices, ambush tactics, and ""repelling and rope crossing"". Kwon did not identify the third stage of training (although it appears that, in committal proceedings, he had said that the third stage was for people who were committed to ""going into Kashmir"").

70On Kwon's description of the routine at the camp, it is apparent that there was some emphasis on training for physical fitness. There were regular prayers, and in the evenings religious discussions. There were mosques at each geographical location of the camp.

71Some care was taken to ensure that participants did not know the full names of other participants. What were called ""Abu"" names, meaning ""father of ..."", were used. This was a traditional means of protecting the identities of individuals involved in ""jihad-type activity"".

72From photographs, Kwon identified Moustafa Cheikho as an Australian, using the name ""Abu Asad"", who had participated in the training camp. Kwon did not claim that Moustafa Cheikho attended the camp in the same intake as he. His evidence was that Moustafa Cheikho arrived at the camp as he (Kwon) was completing stage 2. However, they were in the same vicinity for physical training, meals, and prayers, and had conversations with each other. They were two of a small number of English speakers in the camp. Kwon said that Moustafa Cheikho told him that he was from Australia, that he had a reference letter from a sheikh to gain entry to the camp, and that, on completion of training, he intended to return to Australia. Kwon said that he observed Moustafa Cheikho engaging in physical training, and, on one occasion, cleaning an AK-47.

73In November 2003 Kwon was interviewed by an Australian security agent and by Federal Bureau of Investigation (USA) (""FBI"") Special Agent Wade Ammerman. In the course of the interview with the Australian agent he was shown an array of 12 photographs, from which he identified a photograph of Moustafa Cheikho as the person he knew as ""Abu Asad"". He said that in one conversation with ""Abu Asad"", Kwon had asked if ""Abu Asad"" was going on to Kashmir after training, but that ""Abu Asad"" said that he was not; he intended to return to Australia. Kwon did not ask why ""Abu Asad"" was undertaking the training if that were his intention.

74Kwon's evidence identifying Moustafa Cheikho as the ""Abu Asad"" with whom he had come into contact at the camp was, in cross-examination, challenged. He accepted that, although he had been interviewed by officers of the FBI prior to his interview by the Australian security organisation, he had not mentioned the presence of an Australian at the camp.

75There was unchallenged evidence that Moustafa Cheikho had, on 27 September 2001, travelled to Malaysia. He said in his outgoing passenger card that the country in which he intended to spend the most time was Bangladesh. He returned to Australia on 22 January 2002, from Singapore. On his incoming passenger card he said that the country in which he had spent the most time while away was Pakistan.

76In one of the many pre-trial hearings, objection was taken on behalf of all appellants to the admission of this evidence. The Crown prosecutor indicated that it intended to use the evidence in two ways: first, directly against Moustafa Cheikho as evidence supporting inferences that (i) he had entered into the agreement the subject of the alleged conspiracy (s 11.5(2)(a) of the Code); (ii) that he did so intentionally (s 11.5(2) of the Code); and (iii) that he intended that an offence or offences would be committed (s 11.5(2)(b) of the Code).

77The second way in which the Crown sought to use the evidence was against the appellants, as evidence that Moustafa Cheikho's training in Pakistan constituted an ""available resource"" to the conspiracy the Crown alleged. It may be assumed that this depended upon evidence, also proposed to be led, showing association between Moustafa Cheikho and the other appellants.

78In a pre-trial judgment delivered on 15 April 2008, Whealy J ruled that the evidence would be admitted only against Moustafa Cheikho: Baladjam [No 7].

Category (ii): Possession by the appellants (and others) of extremist Islamic literature

79The evidence indicated that all appellants were in possession, either electronically or in hard copy, of literature of various kinds, some of which might be called ""extremist"" or ""jihadist"". Moreover there was a large degree of commonality in what they possessed; that is, material in the possession of one appellant was also in the possession of other appellants and other alleged conspirators. The Crown divided this material into sub-categories: 

(a)""Jihad"" documents and images;

(b)documents relating to martyrdom;

(c)documents and images about insurgencies in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq and Kashmir;

(d)documents about Sharia law and Western legal and political systems;

(e)documents critical of the United States and Israel;

(f)documents and images about the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September 2001;

(g)training and instructional documents and images;

(h)manuals on explosives and other relevant topics.

In these reasons, it is possible only to give a relatively brief sample of the nature of the extremist Islamic material. It was voluminous. Where we extract quotations from the documents, we will reproduce the spelling used in the particular document, although there are variations in the spelling of some words.

Sub-category (a): ""Jihad"" documents and images

80These documents had titles such as:


""The World is Divided into Two Camps..."";
""Fundamental Concepts Regarding Al-Jihad"";
""Defence of the Muslim Lands"";
""Jihad - The Forgotten Obligation"";
""Notes on Jihad"";
""The Book of Jihad"" (two separate documents bore this title).

81The ""two camps"" mentioned in the first of these were identified as ""The Camp of Imaam (Belief) and The Camp of Kufr (Disbelief)"" - that is, belief or disbelief in Islam. This passage was attributed to Sheikh Osama bin Laden. The document goes on to assert:

""Those who are in the camp of Imaam and carry the Haqq (absolute truth) must come out with it and confront the Baatil (falsehood). Only then will the Haqq become Haqq and prevail even if the Kuffar hate it."" 

82The ""Fundamental Concepts Regarding Al-Jihad"" was a lengthy publication, that included sections endorsing the permissibility of assassinating disbelievers, and that ""martyrdom is not sought for its own sake, rather it is to make the religion dominant"". 

83The ""Defence of the Muslim Lands"" documents distinguished between ""offensive Jihad"", which it defined as "" where the enemy is attacked in their own territory"" and ""defensive Jihad"", defined as ""expelling the Kuffar from our land"", which was said to be ""a compulsory duty upon all"".

84In one ""Book of Jihad"" it was asserted ""whosoever dies without participating in an expedition (Jihad) nor having the intention to do so; dies on a branch of hypocrisy"".

Sub-category (b): Documents relating to martyrdom

85The documents relating to martyrdom included:


""Verdict Regarding the Permissibility of Martyrdom Operations"";
""Female Suicide Bombers for God"";
""Martyrs"";
""The Building Blocks of Nations"";
""The Virtues of Martyrdom"";
""The Islamic Ruling on the Permissibility of Self-Sacrificial Operations - Suicide, or Martyrdom?"".

86The first of these contains the following:

""The pestering Jews are the gatherers of all the shameful defects and the collectors of the aggravations and the evils and they are the harshest of Allah against Al-Islam and its people. He, the Most High said: Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and those who are Al-Mushrikan ... And Allah has made compulsory the fighting against them and making Jihad against them so that the Word of Allah is the highest and the word of those who disbelieve is the lowest ... He, the Most High said: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (ie Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued ...""

87The ""Female Suicide Bombers for God"" appears to be an article published in an Israeli political journal and examines a particular attack by a female suicide bomber, mentions another earlier attack by women and questions whether this constituted a ""turning point"" in the policy of fundamentalist terrorist organisations.

88The document entitled ""Martyrs: The Building Blocks of Nations"" contained the following paragraph:

""The life of the Muslim Ummah is solely dependent on the ink of its scholars and the blood of its martyrs. What is more beautiful than the writing of the Ummah's history with both the ink of a scholar and his blood, such that the map of Islamic history becomes coloured with two lines: one of them black, and that is what the scholar wrote with the ink of his pen; and the other one red, and that is what the martyr wrote with his blood. And something more beautiful than this is when the blood is one and the pen is one, so that the hand of the scholar which expends the ink and moves the pen, is the same as the hand which expends its blood and moves the Ummah. The extent to which the number of martyred scholars increases is the extent to which nations are delivered from their slumber, rescued from their decline and awoken from their sleep.""

89The document entitled ""The Virtues of Martyrdom"" contained a summary, as follows:

""1) Noble objectives require enormous sacrifices. 

2) Sacrificing one's soul is the ultimate sacrifice.

3) The status of the martyr and the virtues of martyrdom.

4) Examples of martyrs from among the companions of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam.

5) Examples of contemporary martyrs.

6) A call to support the Muslims in Palestine and a stern warning against forsaking them.

7) The deceitful Western Media and its twisting of facts.""

Sub-category (c): Documents and images about insurgencies in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq and Kashmir

90This sub-category included documents with the following titles:


""Our Goal is to Restore Peace and Establish a Pure and Clean Islamic State in Afghanistan"";
""Interview: With Commander Abu Abdel Aziz 'Barbaros' (Bosnia);
Interview with Ameer: Arabi Barayev"";
""At-Tibyaan Publications - Sheikh Al-Zarqawi To Sheikh Bin Laden"";
""The Amir of the Mujahideen Party: The People of Kashmir Are Determined to Continue The Jihad Regardless of The Price"";
There were also many ""Jihad Videos"".

91The interview with Commander Abu Abdul Aziz began with an introduction that contained the following:

""FOLLOWING its tradition of discussing (issues) with Ulema (scholars), students of (legal Islamic) knowledge and reformers, we present before the hands of the dear readers this interview. It is with one of the forerunners of Jihad in this era ... It is no doubt that Jihad has become in these days a grave accusation not only in the Arab and Western media, but also in the minds of many within the rank and file of the youth of Revivalist Islam. Their views and legal rulings are confused because of unclear experiments, and sometimes phony symbols.

Jihad remains (an authentic expression of Islam) for the people of (Islamic religious and legal) knowledge and the people of Jihad (And al-Jihad); those who know the (legal) conditions of Jihad in the Qur'an, Sunnals and the understanding of the pious generations (as-Salay as-Sadh) ...""

92A document associated with the ""Jihad Videos"" included the following:

""The following are some selected Jihad songs [nasheed] that are Islamically valid ...

Come listen to what Islamic songs are like, these ones that can move you to tears ... These are not some lullaby songs which talk about Allah's creations, or pink and yellow butterflies. Rather, these nasheed talk about real things, like Jihad, which differentiates the Believers from the Hypocrites ...

The first line in this nasheed translates to: 'We used to own this world for centuries ...' [and then look what happened to us when we forgot Jihad].""

93The At-Tibyaan Publications document (a statement by Sheikh Abu Mesa'ab Al Zarqawi to Osama bin Laden) contained the following:

""I want to assure you that we are keeping our covenant with Allah, our Jihad on the path of Allah will continue and we will sacrifice everything we have including our lives, in order for the religion of Allah to become the law of the land. We have made up our minds, we have chosen our option, we have raised the banner of Jihad, we have sharpened our swords, and we have decided to ride our spears to glory and honor.""

Sub-category (d): Documents about Sharia law and Western legal and political systems

94This sub-category included documents with the following titles:


""Supporters of Shareeah - The Battle of Badr"";
""The Islamic Standard"";
""Ruling on fighting apostate governments"";
""At-Tibyaan Publications - The Ruling on the One Who Insults the Prophet of Allaah"";
""The Need for Allah's Laws"";
""Discussion on the understanding of the methodology to establish the Islamic state"".

95The document entitled ""The Ruling on the One Who Insults the Prophet of Allah"" identified as ""the first issue"" the following:

""That Whoever - be it Muslim or kafir - Swears at the Prophet, Then It Is Obligatory to Execute Him."" 

The text that follows quotes ""one of the Great Imams"" as saying:

""The Muslims have formed consensus upon that whoever swears at Allah, or swears at His Messenger or rejects anything from that which Allah Azza Wa Jall Revealed or kills a Prophet from the Prophets of Allah 'Azza Wa Jall, that he is a Kafir due to that, even if he accepts everything that Allah Revealed.""

96The document entitled (in Arabic) ""The Need for Allah's Laws"" referred to ""universal need for justice and safety for all the inhabitants, human and non-human, on this planet"" and to nuclear testing, the death of soldiers in unnecessary wars, and pollution from poisonous chemicals from industrial sites, and said:

""Surely, our Lord and Creator has not left us without a solution to these problems. Of all the problems that exist, our Maker and Creator is showing us the Need for Shari'a, which is a universal panacea that will meet the needs for all that are crying out for justice. Others stood up in the face of evil and grasped the banner of jihaad. This action indeed proved fruitful and brought success to these groups who propagated this idea ... 

A portion of the brothers striving in jihaad, although well meaning, have forgotten about the jihaad that exists back home ... The priority for us now is to fight the other apostates and hypocrites first, then to deal with the unbelievers after that. But what has happened is that there is a concentration on the unbelievers, which leads to the exclusion of the apostate in our own house. Certainly, a burglar inside a house is more dangerous than outside, as Allah I cautions us, 

'And fight those near to you from the Kuffar (unbelievers)' ...

...

This is why it is so important to get these societies inflamed with the fire of jihaad. Allah I commands us to uphold this great principle ...

'So fight in the cause of Allah. You are only responsible for yourself, and incite the believers so that Allah may protect you from the evil of those that are kuffar.'

...

The medicine needed for this clean up is what Allah I proclaimed in this ayah, 

'And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (Shirk, oppression or absence of Shari'a) and the religion in totality is for Allah'.""

97In a document on the ""Discussion on the understanding of the methodology to establish the Islamic state"" it is asserted that:

""2) We have been ordered to establish the Islamic State. This is proven by various evidences ...

3) This obligation is known to befFard a keyfayah, and thus if neglected, those capable of carry out the work required to achieve the obligation, become sinful.""

Sub-category (e): Documents critical of the United States and Israel

98We mention only one of these documents in detail. In a document entitled ""The Exposition Regarding the Disbelief of the One that Assists the Americans"", the following appears:

""Statistically, it [the United States] is the most populace in whore houses, homosexuality, lesbianism, nude bars, pregnancies out of wedlock, children born out of wedlock, incest, crimes of character, television stations of moral deprivation, consumption of alcohol, clubs of frivolous activities, gambling, dancing, and various forms of corruption...

● It contains more than twenty million (20,000,000) sexual deviants [homosexual men and women].

● More than five thousand (5,000) children are bought and purchased there every year.

● Approximately one -third (1/3) of all children born there are conceived out of wedlock (children of fornication).

● Out of every twenty people (20) in America, there is one person kidnapped.

● More than fifteen million (15,000,000) babies have been killed there due to legalized abortion.

● The city San Francisco is considered the capitol (sic) of homosexuality and they (homosexuals) represent one-fourth of the voters in the city.

● There are more than one hundred million alcoholics there (100,000,000).

● The alcohol producing companies there produce of alcohol what reaches the value of twenty-four billion dollars ($24,000,000,000).""

Sub-category (f): Documents and images about the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September 2001

99In one of the documents in this sub-category, the perpetrators of the attacks were described as:

""... those nineteen heroes - our brothers - who by the shedding of their blood wrote a new page in the history of Amerika: one of rejection by the Muslims of Amerikan arrogance and tyranny, one which expressed their pride in their own Way of Life, one of honour, and one which manifested their striving to avenge the Muslims and all who are oppressed.""

100In another, it was said:

""And for the first time in modern history, the Muslims were proactive makers of great events, not reactive and effected by events!

The greatness of this event is apparent in five ways:

The first: It returned Islaam back into confrontation and in war with the Kuffar, after nationalism, patriotism, and interests were the main driving force for wars and conflicts. So it brought out the christain crusading enmity from the hidden to the open, and from strength into action. 

The second way: It made clear the great role of Jihaad in changing the global balances.

The third way: It ended the thought of using the nation states in politics and in declaring peace or war, because the leadership of this conflict is in the hand of those who have no nationalist affiliation ...

The fourth way: It ended the era of America striking whoever it wishes from the Muslims without being punished, for ever Allaah Willing.

The fifth way: It is the beginning of the fall of the 'New World Order' idea, which America will sadly miss in a short number of years. It is also the beginning of the complete collapse of America, Allaah Willing.""

101There was a great deal more in the same vein. 

102There was another sub-category of material to which we will refer as inflammatory material, intended to instil fear and hatred of modern civilisation, values and culture. Some showed dead or injured Muslim civilians and soldiers, ""designed to evoke sympathy and distress from Muslim viewers"": [46] RoS. Some contained ""slogans"" and other material relevant to terrorist attacks in the United States of America on 11 September 2001. This material was apparently designed to evoke admiration for those who had carried out the attacks. Some contained images of high profile identities (for example, Osama Bin Laden). This appears to have been designed to encourage viewers to commit to Islamic Jihad. Some of the material depicted military conflict, showing Americans and their allies being killed or wounded in combat. Some material depicted Muslim prisoners being badly mistreated or manhandled by their captors.

103Some of this material showed the execution of hostages or prisoners by Mujahideen. (""Mujahideen"" is a term used to denote ""freedom fighters"".) This material was described by Whealy J as ""particularly brutal, distressing and graphic"": [48] RoS). Of these, his Honour observed:

""It is impossible to imagine that any civilised person could watch these videos. So disturbing were they that none of the executions was shown to the jury. The preliminaries to the execution of a Korean prisoner in one video were shown but without audio content. That was the extent of it. Otherwise the jury were simply given a written description of the videos and their contents ...""

Some of this material ""comprised miscellaneous extreme exhortations"". There was more, but it is not necessary to go into further detail.

Sub-category (g): Training and instructional documents and images 

104These documents dealt with military training and equipment, marksmanship, field techniques, ""mission preparation"", sniper sustainment training, cover, concealment and camouflage, fighting positions, combat intelligence and counter-intelligence. One was entitled ""What we can learn from Al-Queda"". (The introduction to this article indicates that it was prepared in order to equip potential targets of terrorism to deal with such a threat.)

Sub-category (h): Manuals on explosives and other relevant topics 

105These documents included ""Special course in manufacturing explosives - for the fighting religious group proclaiming the truth until God's will prevails"". Others contained detailed instructions (or ""recipes"") for the manufacture of explosive devices.

106The purpose of the tender of this evidentiary material was twofold. First, it was intended to throw light on the individual states of mind (and therefore motivation and intention) of each appellant. Second, there was a high degree of commonality with respect to the possession of the individual items: many of the videos, compact discs or other items were found in the possession of three, four, or in some cases all five, of the appellants. This was relied upon to contribute to proof of the agreement necessary to establish the conspiracy.

107Not all documents were in the possession of all appellants, or all alleged conspirators. It is unnecessary to identify precisely which appellant had possession of, or access to, any particular document. There was a significant degree of commonality, in that all documents were in the possession of a number of appellants and other alleged conspirators, and there was also a commonality of theme.

Category (iii): Possession of training and instructional literature

108The documents under this category included material on such topics as:


field techniques;
camouflage;
mission preparation; 
operation; 
communication; 
sniper sustainment training;
combat intelligence and counter intelligence;
survival; 
evasion; 
resistance; and 
escape.

109One document opens with the paragraph:

""Generally the military training ought to be acquired by every healthy Muslim. Even the disabled Muslim could perform various military duties, due to the modern method of warfare. Specifically, each and every member of the Jihaad Movements and organisations, must obtain the highest standard of military training and ought to acquire first hand experience of actual combat. After this necessary training they ought to serve whichever section they are assigned.""

Category (iv): Possession of instructional material relevant to the manufacture and use of explosive devices

110Included in this material were:


""Introduction to Explosives"";
""The Terrorist's Handbook"";
""Black Powder Salutes"".

These documents contained a great deal of technical information concerning the manufacture of explosives, the use of explosives, storage and other information. The ""Introduction to Explosives"" and ""The Terrorist's Handbook"" were found to be in the possession of only Khaled Cheikho. 

111On 25 May 2005 a publication entitled ""The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bagadin Part 2"" was saved to a USB stick belonging to Elomar. The USB was located in a study in Elomar's home when the search warrant was executed on 27 June 2005. On 19 August 2005, at the request of Elomar's niece, the USB stick was returned. It was again seized on 8 November 2005 when the appellants were arrested. On examination, it was discovered that ""The Illustrated Encyclopaedia"" had been deleted on the day of its return, 19 August. No other document on the USB had been deleted. 

112There was other material relevant to this sub-category. On 3 March 2005 a spreadsheet from a webpage entitled ""Kalashnikov AK-47"" was downloaded to Khaled Cheikho's hard drive. On 28 May 2005 a document entitled ""Explosives.html...blackpowdersalutes"" was downloaded to a computer in Khaled Cheikho's premises. On 24 September 2005 Moustafa Cheikho, using the name ""Shenkero"" bid on eBay for, and won, a DVD entitled ""Navy-Seal Combat training"". Three days later, on 27 September, Moustafa Cheikho bid on eBay for, and won, a DVD entitled ""Sniper lessons Commando Para-army SAS SBS recce"".

Category (v): Acquisition and possession (and attempted acquisition and possession) of chemicals and other items suitable for use in the manufacture and detonation of explosive devices

113There was a significant amount of evidence of the appellants obtaining, or seeking to obtain, various chemicals and other items associated with the manufacture of explosive devices. Some of this evidence is itemised below:


on 11 August 2004 Hasan's wife, Shahida Steele, telephoned a commercial entity in Victoria called Haines Educational Pty Ltd (""Haines""). Haines supplied laboratory and other equipment for use in science lessons. Their stock was listed on the internet. Ms Steele ordered a catalogue that included listings for laboratory equipment. She told the Haines representative to whom she spoke that she was a ""home schooler"" without access to the internet and asked for a catalogue (at primary school level) to be sent to her;


on 9 April 2005 Touma attempted to make a pipe bomb. He was recorded speaking on the telephone to George Lord. He made another attempt on 25 April, and was again recorded speaking to Lord;


on 2 June 2005 a handwritten order was placed by facsimile with Haines for a list of items from Haines' secondary science catalogue. The order was sent from a facsimile machine in a pharmacy at Sayers Road, Hoppers Crossing, Victoria. The significance of that address was that it was close to the home of a member of the Melbourne group. On 15 June a telephone call was made to Haines from a public telephone at Sharp Street, Hoppers Crossing. A few minutes later a call was made from the same public telephone to a mobile service registered in the name of ""Anfony Kommito""; 


a handwritten list of laboratory equipment similar to that sent to Haines by facsimile was located during the execution of a search warrant at the home of Joud on 22 June 2005; 


between 9 and 13 June 2005 Moustafa Chiekho purchased 24 x 400ml bottles of 6 per cent strength hydrogen peroxide at a pharmacy in Menai. He gave the name ""George"", and used a telephone service registered in the name ""George Andrew""; 


on 18 August 2005 24 x 400ml bottles of hydrogen peroxide were found in the execution of a search warrant at Sharrouf's house; 


on 26 July 2005 Hasan purchased laboratory equipment from a business called New Directions, a company that sold aromatherapy and related products, and also sold a small range of laboratory equipment. Hasan paid the invoice, amounting to more than $900, in cash; 


on 22 September 2005 Baladjam purchased three bottles of 6 per cent hydrogen peroxide at a pharmacy at Toongabbie, and another three bottles at a pharmacy at Pendle Hill;


on 28 September 2005, Jamal ordered 20 litres of methylated spirits, 50 litres of hydrochloric acid, 25 kilograms of citric acid and 20 litres of glycerine from a company called ""Chemical Cleaning Solutions"" in Campsie. He gave as a contact telephone number a service registered to ""George Markis"". The total cost was over $700. On being asked what he wanted the materials for, Jamal said that his uncle had a cleaning company, but that he did not know its name. The proprietor of Chemical Cleaning Solutions told Jamal that he would need to know the name of the cleaning company for his records, when the goods were collected. Jamal paid $150 deposit. Although the proprietor called twice to advise that the order had arrived, he was unable to make contact with Jamal;


on the same day (28 September) Hasan and Jamal ordered from a business and paid for a quantity of sulphuric acid and distilled water. On 13 October Jamal, in company with another man, collected the distilled water and paid for the sulphuric acid. Jamal, with another man, attended the business and then Autoquip to collect the sulphuric acid, but did not ultimately take it;


on the same day Hasan ordered 44 litres of acetone from Peter's Hardware at Greenacre, and paid a $110 deposit. He gave his name as ""Adam"". In October, using the name ""George"", Jamal inquired about the order. On 22 October Hasan collected four cans that had been purchased;


on 7 October 2005 Sharrouf was observed apparently stealing batteries and six alarm clocks from a variety store. Khaled Cheikho and Touma were with him;


in mid to late October 2005, Hasan, using the name ""Adam"" made enquiries of a hardware store at Padstow about the purchase of large quantities of methylated spirits and acetone. He told the proprietor that he wanted the sulphuric acid for a friend who dealt in second hand batteries. He gave a telephone number which was one digit different from one of the telephones registered in false names (see below) and which did not appear to have a connection. He paid a deposit of $100, and the balance on 1 November. By 5 November the proprietor was aware that police were interested in ""Adam"", and that the store was under video surveillance. Hasan attempted to collect the items, but departed before doing so. This was because the proprietor told him to take delivery of the goods from the front of the store. Hasan insisted on taking them from the back of the store;


on 24 October 2005 Baladjam made telephone calls to two different battery manufacturing and repair companies. On each occasion he introduced himself as ""Jeff"". To the first company he represented himself as conducting market research, and enquired about quantities of sulphuric acid and suppliers. To the second company, which he telephoned twice, he asked about pricing of sulphuric acid;


on 31 October 2005 Baladjam telephoned Autoquip at Condell Park to enquire about the transport of 30 x 15 litre drums. He used the telephone service registered to ""Jeffrey Leydon"". He then called another company, ""Courier One"". He said that he operated a battery manufacturing company, and needed to have about 30 x 15 litre drums delivered. He was told that the company did not have a sufficiently large truck, and he asked about any alternatives;


on 1 November 2005 Baladjam drove past Autoquip three times in the space of less than an hour. He made a telephone call from a public telephone to a courier company, and enquired about the cost of collection from Blacktown, and delivery to Ingleburn, of 10 to 15 x 10 litre drums of liquid;


on 3 November 2005 Elomar, Moustafa Cheikho and Sharrouf attended a hardware store at Bankstown purchased 2 rolls of aluminium insulation tape and Sabco containers. Moustafa Cheikho purchased two rolls of aluminium insulation tape. Elomar drove from the hardware store to a nearby discount store where he purchased five plastic containers;


on the same day Mulahalilovic purchased six metre PVC piping, two PVC push on caps, red priming fluid and cement solvent from a Bankstown hardware store;


on 4 November 2005 Baladjam purchased Teflon sealing tape from a discount store in Green Valley;


on 4 November 2005 Baladjam and Mulahalilovic purchased nine PVC pipes and end caps from a hardware store at Belmore;


on 6 November 2005 a 40 channel UHT radio two pack was purchased from an electronics store. On the same day Baladjam's wife purchased 6 x 150mm end caps from a hardware store in Casula.

Category (vi): Acquisition and possession of firearms and ammunition

114 Some of the evidence of the appellants acquiring and possessing firearms and ammunition is itemised below: 


between January and May 2005 Elomar purchased 10,000 rounds of 7.62 x .39mm ammunition and 2 Leupold VXIII scopes from a Horsley Park gun shop;


between April and June 2005, Touma arranged for the purchase of more than 8,000 rounds of 7.62 x .39mm ammunition;


on 3 June 2005 Touma and Baladjam took possession of 7,500 or 8,000 rounds of 7.62 x .39mm ammunition;


on 19 July 2005 Baladjam and another man (Hamdan) attended the Condell Park firearms range. Baladjam enquired about purchasing two cases (20,000 rounds) of ammunition of the same size as before;


on 1 August 2005 Touma made arrangements for the purchase of an unspecified quantity of ammunition from George Lord;


on 19 August 2005 Mulahalilovic purchased a quantity of 7.62 x .39mm ammunition at a cost of $433;


on 8 September 2005 Baladjam purchased a conversion kit for a Beretta pistol from a Horsley Park gun shop. The conversion kit converted a 9mm Beretta into a .22 calibre, allowing it to fire .22 ammunition;


on 25 October 2005 Baladjam attended the Condell Park shooting range. The following day he and Mulahalilovic went to the Horsley Park gun shop; 


on 28 October 2005 Baladjam purchased 900 rounds of ammunition from a Beverly Hills firearms company, and a backpack from a variety store;


on 2 November 2005 Baladjam purchased another 300 rounds of ammunition from a Terrey Hills firearms store.

Category (vii): Acquisition, possession and use of numerous mobile telephones registered in false names

115Between January and October 2005 mobile telephones were activated in false names as follows:






in the name of


 7 January:

Sarah Saavri


 31 January:

Mark Johnson


 26 February:

Eviki Soto


 1 April:

Andrew Scott


 2 April:

Adam Sharp


 7 June:

Adam Gaty



George Andrews


 22 August:

Mark Jenkins


 3 September:

John Pham


 13 September:

Jeffrey Leydon


 28 September:

George Markis


 18 October:

Tom Clincley

116The evidence showed that the Sarah Saavri number was answered by Jamal on 12 October 2005; the Adam Sharp number was used by Hasan on 15 May 2005; the Mark Jenkins and John Pham numbers were used by Elomar; the Jeffrey Leydon number was used by Baladjam; the George Markis number was used by Hasan and Jamal; and the Tom Clincley number was used by Khaled Cheikho.

117In addition, a telephone registered in the false name of Anfony Kommitto was used to call Joud, and was used by Hasan on 27 August 2005. 

Category (viii): Association by the appellants with each other (and with others)

118There were many instances of evidence in which two or more of the appellants or other alleged conspirators had associated with one another. The following is a sample of evidence showing somewhat more intensive association.

119On 28 December 2004, Elomar, Hasan and Touma were trail bike riding together in bushland in Sydney. 

120Of more significance, perhaps, two ""camping"" trips, involving various of the appellants and other alleged conspirators and members of the Melbourne group, took place in close temporal proximity, in remote regions of NSW. In each case, there are features of the event that are of more significance than demonstrating mere association.

121Between 16 and 18 March 2005 Hasan, Sharrouf and Khaled Cheikho joined Fadi Sayadi, Joud and Raad (all members of the Melbourne group) at a camping site at a property called Curranyalpa. Curranyalpa is part of a property in the remote southwest of NSW, available to rent for fishing, hunting, camping and four-wheel drive enthusiast parties. The booking was made by a person who gave his name as ""Adam George"", and who said that he wanted to take his father and uncles on a fishing trip. Despite requests by the owner of the property, the party failed to complete the required paperwork. Examination of the property after their occupation produced, inter alia, a number of spent cartridges of varying calibres.

122The second camping trip took place between 12 and 14 April 2005, at a property called Mulga Creek Station, in the south of NSW. Again, the booking was made in a false name (Andrew Scott), via the mobile telephone registered in that name. Present at the camp were Elomar, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Hasan and Touma, together with others. Again, despite requests, the requisite paperwork was not completed. Again, subsequent examination produced spent cartridges and evidence of shooting.

123On 9 October 2005, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Hasan, Jamal and Sharrouf drove from Lakemba to Sutton Forest.

124On 7 November 2005 (the day before the appellants were arrested) Elomar, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Sharrouf and Touma gathered outside the office of a solicitor in Bankstown. Later that afternoon they all met again at Elomar's house.

Category (ix): Use of concealment and counter-surveillance techniques

125The registration and use of mobile telephones in false names was one example of a concealment technique. There were many instances of telephone conversations which the Crown alleged were conducted in guarded language, or in code. Khaled Cheikho and others made inquiries about sophisticated closed circuit television security cameras.

126When stopped by police at Sutton Forest, on their return from a trip to Melbourne to visit the Melbourne group, Moustafa Cheikho and others told police they had taken a trip to Canberra.

Category (x): ""the Melbourne evidence""

127We have mentioned above the discrete body of evidence that came to be known as ""the Melbourne evidence"". In the outline of this category of evidence, there will be some inevitable repetition of matters that have been the subject of previous reference.

128During at least the last three months of 2004 a number of men in Melbourne had been under surveillance, suspected of preparing for terrorist acts. These included Benbrika (Sheikh Bakr). Also included in the group were Joud, Fadi Sayadi, Ahmed Raad, and Izzydeen Atik. These individuals were referred to collectively as ""the Melbourne group"". It was the Crown case that Benbrika was the leader of the Melbourne group and that he was an Islamist who had publicly declared his support for militant or violent Jihad. The Crown proposed, by demonstrating close and regular contact between the appellants and their Sydney associates and members of the Melbourne group, particularly Benbrika, to establish a link between the extreme views and policies of the Melbourne group and the views and policies of the appellants. 

129During the period of the surveillance, various of the present appellants were in contact, in various ways, with Benbrika and others of the Melbourne group. We will not refer to the whole of that evidence. A sample will suffice.

130Late in August 2004, Hasan, Elomar and Moustafa Cheikho travelled to Melbourne and met, inter alia, with Benbrika. They returned to Sydney by car on 30 August. Shortly after midnight, they were stopped by NSW police and questioned. Moustafa Cheikho told police that they had been to Canberra, looking to buy a boat. This was false.

131On 6 December 2004 Benbrika travelled to Sydney by air, having booked in a false name. Joud, Raad and Sayadi drove to Sydney. After visiting a camping store, the men spent the afternoon at Sharrouf's house, with Hasan present. There was other contact between Benbrika and one or more of the appellants.

132On 23 February 2005, Hasan and Sharrouf travelled to Melbourne to meet with Benbrika. Their conversations on that day were recorded, pursuant to warrants issued under the relevant Victorian legislation. The conversations recorded commenced at about 7.50pm. There are five separate but successive transcripts of the conversation, although it appears that Benbrika and Sharrouf were continuously in one another's company for the whole of the evening. Also present throughout was another male who is unidentified. Later in the evening Joud joined the group. It may be gleaned from the recordings of the early stages of the evening that the four were downloading and printing material from an electronic device. The material appears to be drawn from a document entitled ""A Guide for the Mujahideen"". Another document referred to was entitled ""Martyrdom Operations"". The following extract is from a transcript of the conversation, which was before the jury as an aide memoire.

133At a very late stage in the evening, Benbrika is recorded in the following terms:

""Abu Bakr, blessed is he by Allah, he said I mean, about the Zakat if they, if they don't give just a little bit, I will fight them. Yes. 'If they prohibited me from [inaudible] that they practised I would've fought them' any small thing I will fight them. Yeah, this is to show you the importance of the Shari'ah. If you say, oh, it's alright, it's alright, the Shari'ah will die. That's why we need to revive these kinds of things. Especially now the best thing now is to be as a Mujahadid prepared. Has - everyone has to prepare himself. Or to die or to be jailed Allah knows best. I don't want this kind of life. Give that to them. But we have to be careful. If we want to die for jihad we do maximum damage, maximum damage. Damage their buildings with everything, and damage their lives, just to show them. That's what we waiting for. You be careful [inaudible] trust no one. The only one you trust is [inaudible] advise your brother [inaudible]. Because it's a responsibility. You make them, you make the brothers in danger [inaudible] even if it's you [inaudible]. He shouldn't know nothing about [inaudible]. If we see that we are [inaudible] in need we try to convince the brothers. One day, the main thing is the [inaudible] this is a problem. [Inaudible] I'm waiting anytime to, for them to come."" (italics added for emphasis; the bold print is in the original and indicates that the words were spoken in Arabic)

At this point, the transcript records, Sharrouf asked: ""Why?"". Benbrika is recorded as replying:

""Because I [inaudible] I never let anyone come to my house and I know that they, ah, they wanna talk to me but I never let them.""

The transcriber has indicated that ""Zakat"" translates as ""alms tax""; ""Shari'ah"" translates as ""Islamic law""; ""Mujahadid"" translates as ""freedom fighter"".

134This is the conversation that, during the trial, came to be known as ""the maximum damage conversation"". 

135In March 2005, Hasan, Sharrouf, Khaled Cheikho and Elomar joined Joud and Raad at the Curranyalpa camp, where firearms were discharged (see [121] above) and some experiments with explosives were conducted.

136On 4 May 2005, Elomar, Hasan and Sharrouf travelled to Melbourne where they met Benbrika, Joud and Saad at Benbrika's home. Their communications were recorded by a listening device. One of the matters discussed was the purchase of science and laboratory equipment from the Haines catalogue.

137On 26 July 2005 Benbrika travelled to Sydney, where he stayed at Sharrouf's home. He returned to Melbourne the following day, accompanied by Jamal.

138On 31 July 2005 Benbrika again travelled to Sydney by air; accompanied by Jamal. They were picked up at the airport by Sharrouf.

139On 4 August 2005, Benbrika took part in a televised interview on an ABC current affairs program, the 7.30 Report. This appears to have been prompted by the execution of a search warrant.

140Benbrika told the interviewer, Nick McKenzie, that he was from Algeria, but had lived in Australia since 1989. He said that he considered himself better off in Australia because, unlike in Algeria, he had freedom to practise his religion. He expressed a fear, however, that the situation would become worse for Muslims in Australia. This was because of the foreign policies of the United States of America, Australia and the then president of the United States, George W Bush.

141Benbrika was asked a number of questions about his views of the legitimacy of the use of terrorist bombs. It might be thought that his answers were somewhat evasive. The following is a sample of the questions he was asked and the answers he gave during the interview as they appear in the transcript:

""Q. Do you support the right of Australians to go and be involved in Jihad?
A. According to my religion this question has to be asked first to John Howard. Why John Howard is helping America? There must be a link and John Howard himself he knows the answer. You may find many Muslims fighting in Iraq or in Afghanistan which is because they believe they are brothers as John Howard is helping Bush in his war and then the people they do the same. 

Q. So you say that while Australia and John Howard is supporting America in places like Iraq it's okay for Muslims from Australia to go to Iraq and help other Muslims fighting against the US and Australia there?
A. According to my religion Jihad is a part of my religion and what you have to understand that everyone who fights for the sake of Allah the first - when he dies the first drop of blood that comes from him out, all his sin would be forgiven. That's one. Second, when he will die he will not be asked in his grave. Number three, he will be married with 72, which called in our religion holy women, see those women which you see in the whole of the world it's nothing. We call them (indistinct) thing. The women in the (indistinct) in the Paradise are something special. They got so special beauty and then if you would like to have those women you need to pay. That's why when somebody wants to get married as a normal you know he has to buy gold for his wife, he has to buy you know and you see in the room a new bathroom any new. That's why if somebody wants to die for the sake of Allah he knows what he's doing. His life is nothing comparing what Allah is promising to him.

...

Q. What happens if a young Muslim here thinks that Allah has told him to do something like blow up a bus and they go and do that. Do you think that is the wrong thing to happen here?
A. This is very sensitive question. I can't give you the answer, the reason why this Muslim who wants to do this kind of job, I not, I can't give you the answer, not because the answer is difficult just because I need to know what he wants to do ... According to his action I can't tell you this is correct or this is wrong. 

[Benbrika was asked a number of times about killing 'innocent people'; on each occasion he replied that killing innocent people was forbidden by the Islamic religion.]

... 

Q. And what would you like to say? What do you think you were saying - what would you like to say freely to your students? What are you not being allowed to say?
A. I said to my students and to every Muslim here in Australia or and even in the whole world I advise them to fear Allah and actually now in this situation it's gonna be worse for them. Before there was Afghanistan, now Afghanistan has been attacked. Okay, why John, why Bush would attack Afghanistan. According to him he want Osama bin Laden. Fair enough you want to kill him. Now Taliban said to him now prove us that Osama did it. Second, when you prove us Osama bin Laden needs to be judged according to Islamic law, not to your law. Because if anyone, any Muslim seeks a judgment for other than his law, which is Islamic, he is not any more the Muslim.

...

[When asked whether Muslims living in Australia should respect Australian law, Benbrika gave, as an example of Australian law that should not be binding on Muslims, family law, which he said was against the Islamic religion.]

Q. You mentioned Osama bin Laden before, what do you think of Osama bin Laden?
A. Osama bin Laden, he's a great man. Osama bin Laden was a great man before the 11th of September which they said he did it and until now nobody knows who did it ... Osama bin Laden was praising who did it. That's why the American even themselves they couldn't prove Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden according to his speech, he was praising the people who did it. It doesn't mean - that's why until now nobody can say that Osama did it or not.""

142Benbrika reiterated that it had not been proved that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September 2001, and that Osama bin Laden was ""a great man"".

143Towards the end of the interview, the following exchange was recorded:

""Q. So you think it's acceptable to curse Jews, as you put it?
A. To curse anyone, anyone that Allah cursed him we have to curse him. This is the meaning of religion. The meaning of Islam is to submit yourself, yourself to Allah. This is the meaning of Islam, submitting yourself to your laws.

...

Q. But isn't it important in Australia where we have freedom of expression, freedom of religion, the freedom that allows you to speak freely that we accept other religions?
A. According to my religion, here I don't accept all other religion except the religion of Islam. 

Q. Isn't there a danger in you pushing that view that you will incite, you will encourage other people to attack Jews, attack Christians here in Australia?
A. No, this is your understanding. This is your understanding. 

Q. What is your understanding?
A. I am telling you that my religion doesn't tolerate other religion, it doesn't tolerate. The only one law which needs to spread can be here, anywhere else it has to be Islam. 

Q. What do you say to people who say to you if you choose to live in Australia you should abide and respect by Australian laws, which expressly say that we have to let other people of religions live side by side respect them and not to express anything bad or hate against them?
A. A hundred per cent this is very bad. This is very bad.

144Benbrika telephoned Sharrouf to alert him to the programme and to warn him to watch it. Sharrouf made arrangements for the programme to be videotaped and spread the word of the programme, calling, among others, Elomar. It was the Crown case that this interview had been recorded and discussed by several of the appellants.

145Between 11 and 15 August 2005 Benbrika was again in Sydney. He was picked up at the airport by Sharrouf. At other times he was driven by Hasan. He was observed in the company of Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Hasan, Jamal and Sharrouf.

146On 31 October 2005 Benbrika again flew to Sydney. He was picked up at the airport by Moustafa Cheikho and Sharrouf.

147In addition to the evidence of face to face meetings with Benbrika, there was also evidence of extensive and regular telephone contact between him and members of the Sydney group, and between Joud and members of the Sydney group. Frequently, the telephone contact was made by the use of the mobile telephones registered in false names, or by the use of public telephones (even where the initiator of the call was known to have access to a mobile service). Frequently, also, the participants in the conversations used coded language.

148Another aspect of the Melbourne evidence arose from the execution, on 17 September 2004, of a search warrant at Joud's home in Hopper's Crossing, Victoria. Located during that search, in electronic form, were documents entitled ""The Terrorist's Handbook"" and the ""White Resistance Manual"". The former contained instructions for purchasing explosives and propellants, ""explosives recipes"", and sections on the use of explosives. The latter contained instructions, with diagrams on the storage of weapons and ammunition. Noteworthy in this context, were references to the use of PVC pipes and ""slip on type end caps"", and PVC cement - items that had been obtained by several of the appellants.

149There was also evidence from which it could comfortably be inferred that there was a level of sharing of material, both in hard copy and in electronic form, between members of the Melbourne group and the appellants.

150The Crown case in respect of Benbrika and the Melbourne evidence was that the appellants, or some of them, were taking spiritual guidance from Benbrika, and that he wielded significant influence on their thinking and on their conduct. The Melbourne evidence including the evidence of the 7.30 Report interview was tendered in order to demonstrate the nature of that influence, and therefore as relevant to the states of mind of the appellants. More specifically, it was tendered as an item of circumstantial evidence that threw light on the purpose of the appellants in acquiring firearms, ammunition and materials capable of being used in the manufacture of explosives. 

151It will be seen that many of the individual items of evidence, taken in isolation, could have no apparent sinister connotations. It was by the interlocking of various items of evidence that the Crown sought to establish the conspiracy, and the intent of the appellants. For example, items of hardware purchased were frequently ordinary everyday items. However, such items were identified in the explosives manufacturing material as useful or necessary for the manufacture. Conversations recorded on listening devices and telephone intercepts threw light on other activities of the appellants.


THE APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION

Grounds of appeal

152Although there is a good degree of commonality in the grounds of appeal filed on behalf of the various appellants, there are some variations in the language in which the grounds are framed, and there are some grounds that are specific to one only (or more) of the appellants. For the most part, with respect to the grounds that are common, it will be convenient to refer to them as numbered in the Notice of Appeal filed on behalf of Hasan. 

153Grounds 1, 2 and 3 of Hasan's notice of appeal are as follows:

""1. In a context where the trial judge had admitted into evidence footage of 'The 7.30 Report' interview with Abdul Nasser Benbrika ('Benbrika') over objection, the trial miscarried by reason of large scale publicity concerning 'the Melbourne proceedings'. Further, his Honour erred in not discharging the jury following application to do so made on 11 February 2009.

2. The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the listening device recording of 23 February 2005 in which Benbrika is heard speaking of a plan to do 'maximum damage'. 

3. The trial judge erred, (and the trial thereafter miscarried), in declining to discharge the jury after the 'car park' incident.""

These grounds are replicated, although differently numbered, in each Notice of Appeal.

154Ground 4 of Hasan's Notice of Appeal is:

""4.(a) The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of Yong Ki Kwon and his identification by photo array of Moustafa Cheikho as a person he knew as Abu Asad with whom he had trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba camp in Pakistan in 2001.

(b) Having admitted evidence concerning Moustafa Cheikho's attendance at a Lashkar-e-Taiba camp against Moustafa Cheikho, the trial judge erred in his refusal to thereafter grant separate trials for the other accused persons including the appellant.""

This ground is replicated (differently numbered) in the Notices of Appeal of Khaled Cheikho, Jamal and Elomar.

155 The evidence concerning the LeT camp is the subject of the grounds numbered 1 and 2 in the Notice of Appeal of Moustafa Cheikho, which are pleaded as follows:

""GROUND 1 His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of Yong Ki Kwon. In particular:

a) His Honour erred in finding that Kwon's evidence established the training extended 'well beyond' military training;

b) His Honour erred in concluding that the evidence was relevant otherwise than for the purpose of tendency or bad character reasoning;

c) His Honour erred in his assessment of the probative value and unfair prejudicial effect of Kwon's evidence;

d) His Honour erred in concluding that the identification evidence should not be excluded under s 137 [of the Evidence Act 1995].

GROUND 2 The directions to the jury regarding the evidence of Kwon were inadequate.""

156Grounds 5, 6 and 7 in Hasan's Notice of Appeal are as follows:

""5. The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence images and footage of gruesome media material. In particular his Honour erred by failing to limit the quantity and nature of the material. He further also erred in failing to make the orders sought which effectively (and it is submitted appropriately) would have constrained the manner in which this material was presented to the jury.

6. The trial judge failed to direct adequately and erred in his directions as to how the jury might use the gruesome media material referred to in Ground 5.

7. The appellant reserves the unsuccessful ground of appeal identified in the appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 based on the alleged duplicity in the indictment: see B and Ors v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 85.""

Each of these grounds is replicated in each other Notice of Appeal.

157Ground 8 in Hasan's Notice of Appeal is:

""8. The trial miscarried as a result of the joint conduct of a conspiracy trial in combination with the events and asserted errors the subject matter of Grounds 1 to 2 and 4 to 6, above.""

This ground is replicated in the Notices of Appeal filed on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho, Jamal and Elomar.

158Jamal's Notice of Appeal against conviction is identical with that of Hasan's. 

159Both Khaled Cheikho and Elomar plead grounds of appeal that the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence (Grounds 1 and 4 respectively). In Khaled Cheikho's Notice of Appeal that ground is particularised as follows:

""i. The evidence was not capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was a party to any alleged conspiracy, or, 

ii. Alternatively, the Crown was unable to exclude the reasonable possibility that more than one conspiracy existed during the period alleged in the indictment.""

160Khaled Cheikho pleads the following additional grounds of appeal numbered as follows:

""2. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the Crown prosecutor's submissions that:

i. the appellant was complicit in the acquisition of ammunition by the alleged co-conspirator Mazen Touma, 

ii. the appellant's role in the alleged conspiracy was one of leadership, even though these inferences were not available on the evidence and were highly prejudicial;

3. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the Crown prosecutor's use of rhetorical question during his closing address, which had the effect of, firstly, inviting the jury to speculate and, secondly, impermissibly shifting the burden of proof;

4. His Honour erred in refusing to dismiss the charge of conspiracy in accordance with s 11.5(6) of the Criminal Code (C'th);

5. His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to lead evidence of so-called extremist material

i. in the absence of a tendency notice, as required by s 97(1) Evidence Act 1995; and

ii. in circumstances where the probative value of the evidence did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect, as required by s 101(2) Evidence Act 1995; 

6. His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that it had to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was [a] member of the conspiracy at the time of the commission of the overt act, found by the jury to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement, as required by s 11.5(2)(c) of the Criminal Code (C'th).""

161On behalf of Elomar the following additional grounds are pleaded:

""Ground 1 His Honour erred in admitting into evidence that category of evidence referred to in the trial as the 'Melbourne evidence'"".

Ground 2 His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the acts and declarations of the alleged co-conspirators which were not in furtherance of the conspiracy.

Ground 3 His Honour's directions with respect to characteristics 3 and 4 were unfair and unbalanced and constitute a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 4 The verdict of the jury is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.""

162The reference in Ground 3 to ""characteristics 3 and 4"" was a reference to s 100.1(3) of the Code, which provides as follows:

""100.1(3) Action falls within this subsection if it: 

(a) is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action; and 
(b) is not intended: 
(i) to cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
(ii) to cause a person's death; or 
(iii) to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or 
(iv) to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public."" 

(Sub-section (3) is an exclusionary provision. If an action falls within any of the categories mentioned, it does not come within the definition of ""terrorist act"". This will be considered below.)

163In the context of the grounds of appeal, it is apposite (because the issue arises more than once) to note the following. Section 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act is the statutory authorisation for appeals against conviction of criminal offences. Section 5(1) provides:

""5 Right of appeal in criminal cases

(1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court: 
(a) against the person's conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone, and
(b) with the leave of the court, or upon the certificate of the judge of the court of trial that it is a fit case for appeal against the person's conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal, and
(c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person's conviction.""

Section 6 sets out the basis on which this Court may act on an appeal. Section 6 provides:

""6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases

(1) The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

(2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under section 5(1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.

(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""

164The grounds upon which this Court must allow an appeal are, therefore:

(i)that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable;

(ii) that the verdict of the jury cannot be supported having regard to the evidence;

(iii) that there was a wrong decision on any question of law;

(iv) that there was a miscarriage of justice.

165Rulings on questions of procedure, and rulings on the admissibility of evidence, are decisions of law, and may be challenged as errors of law under the third of the specified grounds. To the extent that a ruling is said to be erroneous, that issue must be determined in the light of the circumstances that existed, and were known, at the time of the ruling. It cannot be said that a ruling involved error of law by reason of events or circumstances that arise subsequently.

166In this case, many rulings on the admissibility of evidence were made before the jury trial commenced. A jury trial is frequently fluid; circumstances change, subsequent events may cast a different light on evidence quite properly ruled to have been admissible. Those changed circumstances do not render an earlier ruling erroneous in law. They may indicate that, by reason (for example) of changed circumstances, an earlier ruling has given rise to a miscarriage of justice - the fourth of the specified grounds.

167It is important that those framing grounds of appeal focus upon whether they assert error in a particular ruling (whether on evidence, or procedure); or whether they assert that, in the changing and evolving circumstances of the trial, an otherwise correct and proper ruling can be shown to have caused a miscarriage of justice. The two grounds are separate and distinct.

168In respect of more than one of the grounds of appeal pleaded in this case, the submissions in support have not adequately delineated between the two.

Grounds 1 and 2 (Hasan), Ground 1 (Elomar): ""the Melbourne evidence""

169These grounds concern the Melbourne evidence, both as a whole, and with respect to one specific aspect. The nature of the Melbourne evidence has been set out above at [127]-[151]. It will be recalled that, at trial, all appellants sought the exclusion of the Melbourne evidence. Whealy J declined to exclude it: Baladjam [No 19]. 

170Two aspects of the Melbourne evidence call for specific mention. One was the television interview with Benbrika, broadcast on the 7.30 Report on 4 August 2005. The content of the interview is set out in more detail at [141]-[143] above.

171The second aspect to be mentioned specifically is the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"", also set out in more detail above at [133]. This evidence is not only part of the Melbourne evidence as a whole, it is also, separately, the subject of Ground 2 of Hasan's appeal, and of specific grounds in each other Notice of Appeal.

172All of this evidence was the subject of pre-trial rulings, and was determined to be admissible in the circumstances as they were known at that time: Baladjam [No 19]. However, the members of the Melbourne group were, during the trial, identified by first names only and Benbrika was referred to as ""Sheikh Bakr"".

173The Melbourne group were charged with offences against Pt 5.3 of the Code. Their trial commenced in Melbourne on 5 February 2008, well before the date on which the trial of the appellants commenced. The commencement of the Melbourne trial, in particular the lengthy opening by the Crown prosecutor, attracted a degree of media attention, resulting in only partially successful applications for suppression orders (see [34] above). The Melbourne trial concluded with verdicts (convicting some of the Melbourne accused) in September 2008, about six weeks before the commencement of the trial of the appellants. The verdicts attracted a degree of media attention.

174As it happened, the recording of the 7.30 Report interview with Benbrika was played to the jury on 28 January 2009. Although it had been suggested that only a sound recording might be played, or a transcript provided, this was rejected on the basis that a proper assessment of Benbrika's persona was important. A few days after the recording was played, on 3 and 4 February 2009, those of the Melbourne group who had been convicted were sentenced. Again, the sentencing attracted a degree of media attention. Some reports contained images of Benbrika. Some of these may have been taken from the video of the 7.30 Report interview, or at least appeared to be very similar.

175Accordingly, on 11 February 2009 all appellants applied for discharge of the jury, on the stated basis that what was said to be widespread publicity following sentencing irretrievably damaged their chances of being afforded a fair trial. Essential to the reasoning was that, notwithstanding the limitation on the identification of the Melbourne men maintained in the evidence in the Sydney trial, it was likely that jurors would have taken an interest in the media reporting, and made the connection between ""Sheikh Bakr"" and Benbrika. In those circumstances, it was argued, there was a real risk that the appellants would be prejudiced by the evidence of their association with the Melbourne group, especially Benbrika and, to a lesser extent, Joud. That Whealy J had declined a request to have the evidence of the 7.30 Report interview limited to a transcript, or audio without the visual image of Benbrika, enhanced the likelihood that some jurors would make the connection. Underlying this was the proposition that the jury would or might, in effect, transfer the guilt of the Melbourne men to the appellants.

176The application for discharge was supported by volumes of copies of reportage produced as a result of assiduous searches of print, television, radio and the internet.

177On 6 March 2009 Whealy J refused the application, giving reasons for that decision: Elomar [No 12]. 

178It is not entirely clear, but it seems likely that what was sought was, in effect, deferral of the trial until the publicity concerning the Melbourne convictions and sentences had subsided. We draw that inference because there is no mention in the judgment of an application for a permanent stay of the prosecution, and because the submissions made on behalf of the appellants (as recorded by Whealy J) urged that it was likely that, as a result of the publicity concerning the Melbourne sentences coinciding with the Sydney trial, members of the jury would have had a heightened interest in what might otherwise have passed them by, and therefore made the connection between the Sydney accused and the Melbourne accused who had, by then, been convicted. That would tend to suggest acceptance that the damaging publicity would be short-lived, and would not impact adversely on a later trial. 

179We return now to the grounds as pleaded. All appellants rely on the ground (Ground 1) pleaded on behalf of Hasan. It will be observed that (except as pleaded in Ground 2, which specifically challenges the admission of ""the maximum damage conversation"", and except as pleaded on behalf of Elomar), the ground is not so formulated as to challenge the admission of the Melbourne evidence. Rather, the ground pleaded on behalf of the other appellants asserts:

(i) that the ""large scale publicity"" following the conviction and sentencing of the Melbourne group, in the context of the admission of the evidence of Benbrika's interview on the 7.30 Report, caused a miscarriage of justice; and 

(ii) that, in those circumstances, Whealy J erred in declining to discharge the jury when application was made to him to do so on 11 February 2009. 

180 So far as the admission of the evidence goes, the appellants (other than Elomar) challenge only the decision to admit the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"". On behalf of Elomar, however, express challenge was made to the decision to admit the whole of the Melbourne evidence. 

181Three issues therefore arise under these grounds. Logically, they fall to be determined in the following sequence:





Issue (i)

Was the publicity surrounding the conviction and sentencing of the Melbourne group such as to require the discharge of the jury as requested on 11 February 2009, and, in the absence of discharge, such as to render the convictions a miscarriage of justice? (This is to be considered specifically in the light of the evidence of the 7.30 Report interview with Benbrika.)

If that question is determined favourably to the appellants, a subsidiary issue arises as to the consequence of that determination. A conclusion that, in the circumstances, the convictions represent a miscarriage of justice will, of course, result in the quashing of the convictions. That will result in one of two possible consequential orders: entry of verdicts of acquittal, or an order for a new trial.





Issue (ii)

Was the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" properly admitted? If not, what are the consequences of that determination? 

If the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" was properly admitted:





Issue (iii)

Was the Melbourne evidence as a whole properly admitted? (This ground is raised by Elomar only, but, unless there is some reason to distinguish the effect of the evidence on him from its effect on other appellants, it is scarcely to be contemplated that upholding the ground would not affect the outcome of the appeals in relation to the other appellants.)

It is to be noted that there is no complaint about the directions given with respect to the Melbourne evidence.

182For the purposes of considering issue (i), it may be assumed that all of the Melbourne evidence was properly admitted.

183It is relevant to note that the impact of the Melbourne trial was not unexpected. In written submissions provided to Whealy J with respect to the issue of the admissibility of the Melbourne evidence, senior counsel who appeared for Hasan at trial described the publicity relating to the Melbourne trial as ""highly inflammatory"", and argued:

""There is a real risk that the jury will misuse the evidence by drawing a connection between the two groups that is not borne out either by the Crown case theory or the evidence. The real risk of unfair prejudice is particularly evident in the circumstances of this case where the trials are proceeding at the same time, albeit the Melbourne proceedings are at an advanced stage. Judicial direction cannot cure the real risk of unfair prejudice and will more likely reinforce the prejudice by drawing attention [to] the subject matter.""

Attention was drawn to the fact that the interviewee had said that he had six children (and another expected), and that the media reporting of Benbrika's sentencing identified him as a father of seven. There was also mention of the parallels between the national origin of the interviewee (Algeria) and reporting that Benbrika was of Algerian origin.

(In fact, the trials did not proceed at the same time. The Melbourne trial had concluded before the Sydney jury was empanelled, although counsel was not to know that at the time this issue was argued and determined, some months before the Sydney jury was empanelled. The only media reporting that coincided, temporally, with the trial of the appellants was the reporting of the Melbourne sentencing.)

184It was in recognition of the apprehension of a risk that the Sydney jury would draw a connection between the individuals the subject of the Melbourne trial (particularly Benbrika) and the Sydney accused, that identification of the Melbourne individuals was limited. Moreover, both Whealy J in Sydney and Bongiorno J in Melbourne were astute to exercise caution with respect to publicity emanating from the Melbourne trial.

185As we have mentioned, a volume of material taken from various media sources was presented as evidence of the extent and nature of the publicity concerning the Melbourne trial. That is what is described in Ground 1 as ""large scale publicity concerning the Melbourne proceedings"". 

186However, Whealy J made a somewhat different assessment. Whealy J referred to that in a number of passages in the judgment. These references are:

""46 Fourthly, it is fair to observe, as I predicted in February 2008, that the publicity generated by the Melbourne proceedings has diminished considerably, in relative terms, as the months have passed. In practical terms, it might be observed that it has dwindled considerably as a news item of major interest. For example, at the time of the order I made in February 2008, there had been a massive amount of publicity focusing upon the three-week opening by the Crown of the evidence that was likely to be led in the Melbourne trial. As it turned out, that publicity occurred some eight months before the jury in the Sydney trial was empanelled. In that sense, it did not pose any real problem for the commencement of the Sydney trial, although potential jurors would have been possibly aware that there was a terrorism trial proceeding in Melbourne.

47 The verdicts of the Melbourne jury were brought in during September 2008. Again, at that time, there was a brief flurry of publicity, but it was markedly less than the publicity that had accompanied the opening of the trial. The sentences were imposed on 3 February 2009 and, as I shall later demonstrate, the publicity surrounding the sentence had very considerably diminished by this time. Essentially, it demonstrated itself in news bulletins on 3 February, newspaper articles on the 4th and Internet publications on those two days. Although news bulletins appeared on both those days, it is clear, as I shall point out, that the scope of the publicity was very significantly less than it had been at other times during the year. In general terms, the topic had been well and truly relegated away from front headline status.""

187His Honour then mentioned in some detail the classes of evidence collected, and added:

""49 Not content with this amount of research, at the hearing of the application, the defence by then had been able to assemble some further material that had, after further exhaustive search, been discovered. The 'second' volume contained first a list of Google links, that is to say, links searched for and organised by Google on 3 and 4 February. The majority of these were references to links in far away countries: Asia, America, South Africa, Europe and beyond. The second category in volume 2 were a few further Internet reports, principally on 3 and 4 February 2009 (although some were anticipatory of the sentence being dated 2 February 2009). I shall refer to these as the volume 2 Internet material. Finally, I was handed up one Internet extract from the website www.theage.com.au dated 4 February 2009 and a wikipedia entry basically dating from 2005, but with modifications as at 3 February 2009.""

188Later in the judgment his Honour posed the question:

""Is there a clear connection demonstrated by the publicity between the Melbourne proceedings and the present proceedings?""

In the context of considering this question, his Honour alluded again to the extent of the publicity. He said:

""105 The publicity surrounding the sentencing was brief, muted, and did not assume any particular significance in any broadcast or news item. Generally speaking, the matter was only mentioned on the day of sentencing, or, in the case of newspaper reports, on the following day. Thereafter, other news has completely swallowed the topic up and it has not been mentioned again. In the days immediately following the sentencing, the media focused on major issues, such as the gloomy economic situation and then the terrible bushfire catastrophe in Victoria. 

106 My firm view is that the entire topic of the Melbourne sentences came and went with very little fuss or attention. I watched the jury carefully on the day after the sentences and I observed no indication that their usual diligence in listening to the evidence was in any way distracted or altered from that which it had been prior to the imposition of the Melbourne sentences. No juror has sent me a note, or raised with me any question about the Melbourne sentences. At the request of counsel, I gave a brief direction to the jury on 4 February 2009, reminding them that they were to pay heed only to the evidence in this trial. This was said to be in conformity with my original instructions and their usual practice. The members of the jury indicated by their demeanour that they understood this direction perfectly. The trial has now continued for some weeks since the Melbourne sentences were pronounced. The jury has continued to go about its business carefully and apparently quite unperturbed by any aspect of the Melbourne matter.

107 In all the circumstances, having considered the facts of the argument carefully, I have come to the conclusion that the jury would not have inevitably made the connection between the Melbourne offenders and the Melbourne persons mentioned in this trial. I acknowledge, however, that there might have been some minor potential for that occurring. But, overall, I consider it most unlikely that any such connection would have occurred to jurors or would, in fact, have been made. Overall, the methodology employed by the defence in assembling material to suggest that the jury will have made a connection between the two trials is flawed, at least in two respects.""

189The two respects in which Whealy J found the methodology to be flawed were:

(i) that the assembly of media material was excessive, producing an array of material well beyond what might realistically have come to the attention of any individual juror; and

(ii) the defence approach incorporated the knowledge of the appellant's legal representatives of the connection between the two trials, and imputed (without foundation) that knowledge to the jury.

190The more realistic view, his Honour concluded, was that the reporting was such that a juror or jurors may have become fleetingly aware of the Melbourne sentences, but the jury were unlikely to have pursued any link.

191Contained in the passages extracted above are significant findings of fact made by Whealy J concerning the extent and potential impact of the reportage of the Melbourne trial, verdicts, and sentences. 

192That he considered ""most unlikely"" that members of the jury would have made the connection between the Melbourne group and the appellants was not the only factor that moved Whealy J to decline to discharge the jury. He added that ""the Melbourne evidence"" was, in reality, a very small part of the overall Crown evidence. The trial at that point had been proceeding for over four months. The jury had by then heard and seen a great deal of evidence. His Honour said:

""109 ... The Melbourne evidence has not been of any special significance. Nor has it been singled out from the vast body of evidence, of which it forms but a fraction. The ABC interview was shown in less than half an hour. It was not sensational evidence, simply one man expressing his opinion to an interviewer.""

He considered that facts such as the number of children the interviewee had were ""completely incidental"", and that the focus of the interview was on the opinions expressed by the man the jury knew as ""Sheikh Bakr"". 

193As his Honour observed, a substantial number of further witnesses was then anticipated. He considered it not unfair to describe the Melbourne evidence as ""but a fraction of this material"". He said:

""109 Its [the Melbourne evidence's] significance is of no greater dimension than the remainder of the other material relied on by the Crown. It is all part of a detailed and elaborate mosaic or pattern going to make up the circumstantial case to be relied on by the Crown. That mosaic, including the fragments represented by the Melbourne evidence, will not fall to be considered in its entirety until the passage of a further four or five months. By that time, the publications ... will be a distant memory and their impact, slight as it was likely to have been, if there had been any impact at all, will have been consigned to the oblivion inevitably awaiting 'yesterday's news'.""

194The final matter he took into account was the extensive directions already given to the jury concerning the need to determine the issues on the basis of evidence given in the trial, and the faith placed by the criminal justice system generally in the adherence of juries to those directions.

195What his Honour anticipated in Elomar [No 12] at [109] came to pass. The trial did proceed, over a number of months. A great deal of evidence was heard and seen by the jury.

196The submissions made on behalf of Hasan, and adopted on behalf of the other appellants, were to the effect that Whealy J had underestimated (""downplayed"") the significance of the publicity by failing to give real weight to certain factual matters, and the combination of those factual matters. These were identified as (we paraphrase and summarise):

(a)that the publicity was ""nationwide and high profile"", appearing in an array of media outlets, increased markedly on the days of conviction and sentence;

(b)the asserted prominence of the media coverage - on prime time television news, on front pages of newspapers, including those circulating in Sydney;

(c)the sensational nature of the publicity: specific reference was made to ""the maximum damage conversation"" and to reports of proposals by the Melbourne group to target prominent locations and events, including a football grand final;

(d)the temporal connection between the viewing by the jury of the evidence of Benbrika's 7.30 Report interview, and sentencing;

(e)the use of images of Benbrika taken from or very similar to those seen by the jury in the recording of the 7.30 Report interview;

(f)the co-incidence of some of the evidence reported from the Melbourne trial with that in the Sydney trial: for example, Benbrika was referred to as a ""self described Sheikh"";

(i)that there were reports of the Melbourne group undertaking ""training camps"";

(ii)that there were reports of a ""common library of material"", including images of beheadings;

(iii)that there were reports that the Melbourne group possessed ""bomb making manuals"" including ""The Terrorist's Handbook"" and the ""White Resistance Manual"";

(g)the distinctive appearance of Benbrika; some of the reporting identified his place of origin as Algeria (the man the jury knew as ""Sheikh Bakr"" told the interviewer in the 7.30 Report that he had been born in Algeria); that Benbrika was reported to have had seven children (""Sheikh Bakr"" told the 7.30 Report interviewer that he had six children and a seventh expected);

(h)the reportage included references to Benbrika wanting to ""destroy buildings"" and kill people (this was said to provide a link with ""the maximum damage conversation"" attributed in the trial to ""Sheikh Bakr""); 

(i)the reportage included the full names of the Melbourne men convicted; this undercut the attempts to disguise their identity by the use of first names only. Further, their places of residence in Victoria were identified: the place names had been referred to in evidence in the trial of the appellants;

(j)the reportage included details of the dates of arrest of the Melbourne accused, which coincided with the dates of arrest of the appellants.

Analysis
Issue (i): Effect of publicity

197It not infrequently happens that an accused person contends that, by reason of extraneous information in the public arena that might come to the attention of potential members of a jury, a criminal prosecution ought to be stayed, either permanently or temporarily. Similarly, where such a contention fails to achieve the result sought, a subsequent conviction is said to represent a miscarriage of justice and ought to be set aside. Most frequently, although not invariably, the extraneous information is pre-trial publicity concerning the subject matter of the trial, or the individual accused.

198At the heart of these cases, however framed, is a collision between two important public interests. One is the right of a person accused of crime to be afforded a fair trial. That is not only a private interest, it is also an important public interest. The other public interest is in the due prosecution of individuals alleged to be guilty of criminal conduct.

199Examples of such cases were given by Spigelman CJ in R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258 at [16]. 

200Shortly after the decision in Jamal, the issue came again before this Court: see Skaf, Bilal v R; Skaf, Mohammed v R [2008] NSWCCA 303. In that case, concerning allegations of very serious sexual offences, it was acknowledged that the offences and the trials had attracted ""very considerable publicity"", all of it unfavourable to the accused. The publicity was described as:

""21 ... extensive, prominent and continued for a significant period of time.""

Some of it was also described as ""excessive"". Before the trial, an application for a permanent stay on the ground of adverse publicity had been made and refused. The refusal was the subject of the first ground of appeal. Another ground complained of a specific article published during the course of the trial, which had also been the subject of complaint during the trial. That article did not specifically refer to the then accused. This Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden and Howie JJ) dismissed the appeal, applying the principles to which we are about to refer.

201A slightly different class of case is exemplified in The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592. There, a Roman Catholic priest was charged in Victoria with various sexual offences against children. Committal proceedings attracted extensive media attention. A prominent media commentator, on three occasions, broadcast attacks on the priest, asserting publicly that he had (as was the case) been previously convicted of sexual impropriety with a child, and, on another occasion, similarly charged but acquitted. The broadcasts were sufficiently serious as to result in the commentator's conviction for contempt, in respect of which he eventually served a short term of imprisonment.

202An application by the priest for a permanent stay of proceedings failed; the priest went to trial and was convicted. An appeal against the conviction was allowed by the Victorian Court of Appeal sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal, which entered a verdict of acquittal. The basis for that decision was that the broadcasts, revealing the priest's prior conviction, had created a substantial risk that some members of the jury would have been aware of the conviction, rendering the trial unfair. 

203The Crown sought and was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court, which (by a narrow majority) upheld the appeal and reinstated the convictions. It was in that context that the High Court laid down the relevant principles. Those principles are applicable to applications for a permanent stay, and appeals against conviction, where the ground is that prejudicial material has, or may have, come to the knowledge of jurors or potential jurors.

204The starting point lies in a 1980 decision of the High Court (Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75 at 111 and adopted by Mason CJ in Jago v The District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23), as follows:

""To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences'.""

That passage, however, is directed only to whether the prosecution should be terminated with no trial to take place. It says nothing about the principles applicable to determining whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred when a trial has taken place.

205The expectation that persons accused of crime will be brought to trial:

""... requires that a conviction be quashed as unsafe and unsatisfactory only where the materials justify a conclusion that there was a likelihood or substantial risk of prejudice arising from pre-trial publication where the conviction is challenged on that ground."" (Glennon, per Mason CJ and Toohey J at 605)

Their Honours went on to say:

""And a court of criminal appeal, before it will set aside a conviction on the ground of a miscarriage of justice, requires to be satisfied that there is a serious risk that the pre-trial publicity has deprived the accused of a fair trial. It will determine that question in the light of the evidence as it stands at the time of the trial and in the light of the way in which the trial was conducted, including the steps taken by the trial judge with a view to ensuring a fair trial."" (at 605-6)

206Their Honours also recognised the faith necessarily placed in the integrity of the judicial system, and of individual jurors in adhering to the oath or affirmation they take at the commencement of a trial. They said:

""The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence ...

To conclude otherwise is to underrate the integrity of the system of trial by jury and the effect on the jury of the instructions given by the trial judge."" (at 603)

207Brennan J (as he then was, and who agreed in the result with Mason CJ and Toohey J) said:

""Of necessity, the law must place much reliance on the integrity and sense of duty of the jurors. The experience of the courts is that the reliance is not misplaced ..."" (at 614, internal citation omitted)

208There have been many statements to similar effect. For example, in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414, McHugh J said:

""31 ... Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.""

209Two additional matters must be mentioned. The first is that, in Glennon, the broadcasts were made more than five years before the trial that eventually took place. In Skaf, the most recent publication (except one) was six months before the trial. The second thing to note is that, in both Glennon and Skaf, what was broadcast was directly about the person accused; in the case of Glennon, it revealed his prior conviction; in the case of Skaf, it contained a great deal of lurid material about the offences alleged against the accused.

210In the present case, some of the media publicity took place during the currency of the trial. However, the publicity of which complaint was made included reports of the opening of the Melbourne trial - eight months before the jury was empanelled in the Sydney trial; evidence in the Melbourne trial - which was completed before the commencement of the Sydney trial; reports of the convictions - six weeks before the commencement of the Sydney trial; and the sentences. The assertion that the jury in the Sydney trial would have had a heightened interest in and awareness of the Melbourne proceedings has to be seen in that light. It is only the reporting of the sentencing that could realistically be said to have had any significant impact on the jury. As mentioned above, Whealy J's factual observations about the extent of that publicity were not put in issue.

211Even more importantly, the reporting of the Melbourne sentencing did not (by contrast with the facts in Glennon and Skaf) directly relate to any of the appellants. It related to individuals with whom they were said to have had a close connection, and from whom they were said to take spiritual guidance. Those individuals were not identified by name in the trial. The argument depends on the proposition that the jury would have made the connection between ""Sheikh Bakr"" and the members of the Melbourne group referred to by first names only, and the persons convicted in the Melbourne trial. It is not at all established that that was so, or likely.

212If the jury did make the connection, the fact that the Melbourne group were committed to violent Jihad was the very basis for the tender and admission of the Melbourne evidence. The fact that they were then found to have put that commitment into effect would have come as no surprise to the Sydney jury.

213Whealy J considered that it was unlikely, having regard to the precautions taken in the trial, that the jury would have made the relevant connection. Even if they had, however, the appellants' argument depends upon another step - the probability that the jury misused the information that the Melbourne group had been convicted - by another jury, on other evidence - and allowed that to colour their own deliberations.

214It is of some interest that the attention of this Court has not been drawn to the directions given to the jury by the trial judge with respect to the Melbourne evidence, nor to the directions generally given about the need to return verdicts based on the evidence in the trial, and to disregard extraneous material. 

215Also not mentioned in the submissions is the trial judge's characterisation of the Melbourne evidence as a tiny part of the overall Crown case - ""a fraction"". Focussing upon the media reporting for the purposes of this ground of appeal is apt to give it an undue proportion. This Court is not in a position to assess precisely where and how the Melbourne evidence fitted into the Crown case as a whole, in terms of time taken up or its impact on the trial overall, as it proceeded. But the brief outline of the categories of Crown evidence at the commencement of these reasons supports the assessment of the trial judge, who was, of course, in a much better position to make that assessment.

216We would answer the question posed in Issue (i) in the negative. The publicity surrounding the conviction and sentencing of the Melbourne group was not such as to require the discharge of the jury as requested following the sentencing; the subsequent convictions were not, on this basis, rendered a miscarriage of justice. 

217We therefore reject Ground 1 of Hasan's Notice of Appeal, and the corresponding grounds in each other Notice of Appeal. 


Issue (ii): ""the maximum damage conversation""

218Specific complaint is, on appeal, made about the admission of one aspect of the Melbourne evidence. This is the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"". This, it will be recalled, was a recorded conversation between Benbrika and Sharrouf in Melbourne on 23 February 2005. Benbrika is recorded as advocating joining a Mujahideen, and being prepared to die or be gaoled in the cause of Islam, and further advocating that, if adherents were to ""die for Jihad"", then it was necessary to do ""maximum damage"" - maximum damage to ""their"" buildings, and maximum damage to ""their"" lives. The relevant part of the conversation is set out in full at [133] above.

219The argument concerning the Melbourne evidence took place in May 2008 and judgment was delivered on 28 May. This was well in advance of the jury being empanelled, and necessarily was based upon the evidence that was then anticipated. While the evidence actually called conformed fairly closely with what was anticipated, there were, not surprisingly, some variations and departures. For example, and relevantly to the present ground, at the time of the argument it was believed that the evidence would establish that Hasan was present during the conversation. That turned out not to be the case. 

220We mention this because the ground of appeal is that the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" was wrongly admitted. Consideration of that ground of appeal necessarily focuses upon the decision in the light of what was known at the time of the decision: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308. 

221Of course, if evidence has been properly admitted, based on information available at the time of determination, subsequent events may show that the admission of the evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. That, however, is a different ground of appeal (see [167] above) that has not been here invoked. The ground taken is that Whealy J was in error, on 28 May 2008, when he determined to admit the evidence: Baladjam [No 19]. To succeed on this ground of appeal, therefore, the appellants must establish that the decision was erroneous at the time it was made, and in the circumstances in which it was made.

222Examination of the written submissions provided to Whealy J reveals that the specific emphasis now placed on ""the maximum damage conversation"" (as distinct from the Melbourne evidence as a whole) was not then present. In those submissions, ""the maximum damage conversation"" received some passing attention, but it was not isolated as an aspect of the Melbourne evidence that ought to be treated separately from other aspects. Generally, ""the maximum damage conversation"" was treated as standing or falling with the Melbourne evidence as a whole. Where reference was made to it, it was illustrative of what were said to be the problems with the Melbourne evidence generally. For example, in the written submissions filed before Whealy J for the purpose of the argument reference was made to what was called ""category 2"" evidence in the Melbourne evidence. ""Category 2"" evidence was evidence, including ""the maximum damage conversation"", of the interaction between Sharrouf and a number of the Melbourne accused, including Benbrika, and including the conversation presently under consideration. Even in those submissions, the subject matter went beyond the conversation of 23 February 2005.

223What can be discerned from the written submissions at trial on behalf of the various appellants is that objection was taken to the Melbourne evidence as a whole. Essentially, the objections challenged the relevance of the evidence; if that challenge were successful, the evidence was simply inadmissible: see Evidence Act, s 56. Alternatively, in different ways, counsel invoked s 137 of the Evidence Act. Some subsidiary arguments were put. For example, on behalf of Elomar it was suggested that the evidence was, if admissible at all, admissible only against Sharrouf in order to show his state of mind. (Sharrouf, at that time, was one of the accused.)

224The contention was, put simply, that, if the evidence were held to be relevant, its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellants. For the purposes of this ground of appeal, it is necessary only to consider that argument in respect of ""the maximum damage conversation"". 

225The Crown's submission, in brief, was that the evidence was relevant to establish the fact and the nature of the conspiracy and the intention of the appellants in the various activities that they undertook.

226In contrast to the manner in which the submissions had been put, Whealy J dealt, at some length, and in some detail, with the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"", not as an item of evidence to which separate objection was taken, but as exemplifying the nature of the Melbourne evidence. 

227Whealy J referred to the arguments advanced, including an argument advanced on behalf of Elomar, that the evidence of the conversation was not ""in relation to Sharrouf's advancement of the crime"" and therefore not relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. Nor, it was contended, could it be evidence of the state of mind of other accused because to use it in that way would be to use it for a prohibited hearsay purpose: see Evidence Act, Pt 3.2.

228In respect of that and other arguments, Whealy J said:

""105 In the first place, while the conversation may tell us something about Benbrika, it is not, in terms of the Evidence Act, an admission because Benbrika is not a defendant in the trial. Secondly, it may be, as [senior counsel for Elomar] has argued, that the conversation is relevant to Sharrouf's state of mind. For that matter, it may also be relevant to Hasan's state of mind. Arguably, Hasan was present in the room during this part of the conversation. On the other hand, there is no indication from the conversation itself to indicate that either Sharrouf or Hasan endorsed, adopted, or accepted the views expressed by Benbrika in the conversation. In regard to the state of mind of persons other than Benbrika present in the room, the conversation can be no more than a circumstantial fact bearing upon their respective states of mind, if that be relevant. Of itself, it would not prove a state of mind and the Crown does not necessarily rely upon it for that purpose.""

(In this paragraph an example of how things changed during the course of the trial can be seen. As mentioned above, at the time this judgment, Baladjam [No 19], was delivered, it was expected that the evidence would show that Hasan had been present. That was, at the end of the trial, abandoned by the Crown.)

229Whealy J went on to say:

""107 The correct starting point is to examine the evidence to determine whether, if it were accepted, it could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding ... The Crown wishes to argue that these activities took place in the context of the accused generally receiving advice and inspiration from Benbrika, he being a person who supported and promoted violent jihad as part of his preachings in relation to the theology of Islam.

...

109 Applying the Evidence Act test of relevance to the conversation, in the light of the manner in which the Crown will contend that the Melbourne evidence generally may be used in the trial, it will be seen that it is the relationship itself between Benbrika and the accused that brings about a situation where the conversation may properly be regarded as relevant. The relationship is one evidenced by the duration, frequency and content of the association between Benbrika and many of the accused on the other. It is that relationship, being one of religious and spiritual guidance, that makes relevant the fundamentalist attitudes expressed both publicly and privately by Benbrika. The relationship is one of spiritual guidance in connection with his views on the dictates of Islam. To Benbrika, jihad is a fundamental precept of his religion. This he makes clear in the interview in the 7.30 Report on the ABC in August 2005. He is an admirer and supported [sic] of Osama bin Laden. He does not tolerate other religions. Benbrika is what sections of the media have loosely described as 'a fire brand cleric'. Tacitly, he appears to approve of the September 11 destruction of the Twin Towers and the loss of American civilian lives. He is reluctant to ascribe blame to Al-Quaeda, but if they were the perpetrators, their actions were justified.

110 It is clear that the relationship does not prove by itself the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. Nor does the conversation. The conversation, and indeed, the relationship, are but part of an overall circumstantial case that includes the actions of the Sydney accused themselves in ordering laboratory equipment, ammunition and other materials arguably connected with preparation for a terrorist act or acts. It includes as well their possession of extremist material supporting jihad. The nature of the association, in my opinion, is relevant as a circumstantial fact, in proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The accused are men with strong religious views about their faith. They hold strong views about events relating to Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere. They are disconcerted by the attention paid to them by police and other authorities. They look to Benbrika as a religious leader. 

...

112 ... It is the nature of the relationship that makes the evidence of Benbrika's public and private espousal of violent jihad relevant to the facts in issue, and especially to the existence and scope of the conspiracy ...""

230His Honour repeated that the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" was no more than a piece of circumstantial evidence; he rejected the notion that it was tendered for a hearsay purpose, and added that it was not tendency evidence. He accepted the Crown submission that the evidence was:

""114 ... at least relevant as going to proof of the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy ...""

231Put shortly, Whealy J found the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" to be relevant, and that its probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellants, or any of them.

232In the written submissions filed in this Court with respect to this ground, extensive reference was made to what was said by Whealy J in the summing up. These references were misplaced and irrelevant. That is because the merit of the ground has to be assessed on the basis of what was before Whealy J in May 2008. The admissibility of the evidence cannot be determined by reference to what was said in the summing up.

233The written submissions in this Court appeared to run together the two issues - relevance and the balance required by s 137 of the Evidence Act. 

234Section 137 is in the following terms:

""137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

235The nub of the ground of appeal, as put forward in the written submissions is, it seems to us, this: when the evidence on which the Crown proposed to rely is properly analysed, it can be seen that Benbrika ""played a fairly insignificant role in the affairs of the Sydney accused"", there was no evidence that he was a financier, that he was the supplier of extremist material, or that he was actively involved in assisting the appellants to obtain the laboratory equipment from Haines. If Benbrika played ""a fairly insignificant role in the affairs"" of the appellants, then the probative value of the evidence of his expression of support for doing ""maximum damage"" was limited. By contrast, the danger of unfair prejudice was high. Indeed, the evidence was described in written submissions as ""amongst the most sensational evidence in the trial"". 

236For our part (admittedly and necessarily looking at the evidence retrospectively, not prospectively, but, as mentioned above, the evidence emerged substantially as anticipated) we do not see Benbrika's remark about ""maximum damage"" as more ""sensational"" than much of the video footage (see Ground 5) or the accumulated extremist material, or the accumulated instructional material concerning bomb manufacture. 

237However, in oral argument, senior counsel also contended that the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" was truly characterised as tendency evidence, and therefore subject to the stringencies of s 97 and s 101(2) of the Evidence Act, and therefore not admissible unless the conditions prescribed by those legislative provisions were met. Since the characterisation of the evidence as tendency evidence was not recognised at trial the necessary s 97 and s 101 determinations had not been made.

238Three questions must therefore be addressed:


was the evidence relevant?
if so, did the probative value of the evidence outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice?
was the evidence tendency evidence?

Relevance

239By s 56 of the Evidence Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible, and evidence that is not relevant is inadmissible. The admissibility of evidence that is relevant is, however, subject to a number of qualifications provided throughout the Evidence Act.

240By s 55 of the Evidence Act, evidence that is relevant is evidence that, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. The flaw in the appellants' argument is that it focuses only on ""the maximum damage conversation"", and isolates it from other evidence. The very point of a circumstantial case, as this was, is that it creates a mosaic of sometimes apparently tiny items of evidence, that, when put together, make up a whole picture. The tiniest fragment of evidence might, on completion of the mosaic, be shown to have significant relevance. It is a mistake, particularly in a circumstantial case, to attempt to determine the relevance of each individual item of evidence in isolation from all of the other evidence.

241It is not to the point that, on the evidence, of the Sydney accused, only Sharrouf could be shown to have been present at the conversation. The point of the Crown evidence was that the Sydney accused, particularly Sharrouf, were closely associated with Benbrika and his group, and took spiritual guidance from them, especially Benbrika. The evidence was therefore relevant to show what Benbrika's attitudes were. It was also part of the case that the Crown proposed to make that each of the appellants had attitudes consistent with those attributed to Benbrika. That Benbrika advocated doing ""maximum damage"" in the cause of Jihad, or Islam, was capable of throwing light on what operated on the minds of the appellants in amassing the chemical products that they did, and the literature that they did.

242For reasons which appear below, it is not correct to say, as was contended on behalf of the appellants, that the relevance of the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" depended upon the drawing of an inference that Sharrouf had passed on Benbrika's comments, or that Benbrika had, on other, unrecorded, occasions, made remarks of the same kind to one or more of the appellants.

243It was emphasised that Sharrouf's only response to Benbrika was to ask ""Why?"" and that this fell short of evidence that he (let alone the other appellants) shared or adopted the views expressed by Benbrika, and that that rendered the probative value of the evidence ""minimal"". That, in our opinion, is to misconstrue Sharrouf's query. The query came immediately after Benbrika said that Sharrouf should be careful and trust no-one and ""I'm waiting any time to, for them to come ..."". Sharrouf's query did not come immediately after ""the maximum damage"" remark. It was not addressed to that part of Benbrika's monologue.

244Further criticism of the admission of this evidence concerned what was then known of Sharrouf's mental state. It will be recalled that Sharrouf was initially found unfit to be tried. It was agreed that he had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorder and had a history of polydrug abuse. It was therefore argued that, even if the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" could be seen as relevant to Sharrouf's mental state, these circumstances made it irrelevant to provide any foundation for an inference of the mental state of any of the appellants.

245That might have some validity if the only relevance of the conversation was to demonstrate Sharrouf's state of mind. For reasons we have given, that was not the only relevance of the evidence.

246It was, in our opinion, correct for Whealy J to hold that the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" was relevant. 

Did the probative value of the evidence outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice?

247The answer to this question requires an assessment, first, of the ""probative value"" of the evidence, and secondly, of the danger of unfair prejudice. ""Probative value"" of evidence is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as:

""...the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.""

The assessment of probative value, therefore, requires the identification of the ""fact in issue"" said to be affected by the evidence. In this case, as we have mentioned above, a good deal of the circumstantial material upon which the Crown relied to establish the conduct of the appellants was not in dispute. The most significant fact in issue in the proceeding was the state of mind of each of the appellants. In order to satisfy the definition of ""terrorist act"", as defined in s 100.1 of the Code (see [11] above), it was necessary that the Crown prove that the action with respect to which the appellants allegedly conspired was accompanied by an intention to advance ""a political, or religious or ideological cause"", and with the intention of ""coercing, or influencing by intimidation"" an Australian government or foreign country or intimidating the public or a section of the public. That fell to be proved by inference. 

248In those circumstances, the expressed attitudes of the leader of a group with whom the appellants associated, and from whom they (allegedly) took spiritual and religious guidance had the capacity significantly to affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of that fact. The evidence therefore had probative value to a significant degree.

249The next question is whether it carried with it a danger of unfair prejudice that outweighed that probative value.

250In our opinion, it did not. Indeed, to contend that it did is to contradict the submissions put on behalf of the appellants with respect to relevance. ""The danger of unfair prejudice"" is the danger that a jury might make improper use of the evidence. It was proposed, on behalf of the appellants, that evidence that comes within that category is apt to provoke an irrational, emotional or illogical response in the jury, or in the jury giving the evidence more weight than it properly deserves or otherwise misusing the evidence: Lodhi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 360; 179 A Crim R 470 at [140], R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; 56 NSWLR 182 at [116], Regina v Duncan and Perre [2004] NSWCCA 431 at [246], R v Sophear Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 at [120] and R v Yates, Parry, Hyland, Powick [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252].

251It is difficult to see how the jury might have a response of the kind described, or how it might have misused the evidence. The evidence was tendered to establish that the person from whom the appellants sought and obtained spiritual and religious guidance held and expressed extremist views, the inference being that those views influenced or were shared by the appellants. That does not create unfair prejudice. 

252Whealy J was correct to decline to exclude the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act. We would add, although it does not strictly arise, that there is no basis for a conclusion that, notwithstanding that the ruling to admit the evidence was correct at the time it was made, subsequent events meant that the admission of the evidence gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

Was the evidence tendency evidence?

253Tendency evidence is evidence tendered to establish that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind. It is evidence that is tendered in order to provide the foundation for an inference that, because the person has or had that tendency, it is more likely that he or she behaved in a particular way, or had a particular state of mind at a time or in circumstances relevant to the issues in the dispute: see Gardiner v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 190; 162 A Crim R 233 at [124]. Tendency evidence is considered in more detail below: see [344].

254There was no written submission put before Whealy J to the effect that the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"", nor, indeed, the Melbourne evidence generally, was tendency evidence. Whealy J said, in passing, that it was not tendency evidence, but merely ""a circumstantial fact"" which, together with other material would be assessed by the jury in its overall evaluation of the Crown case.

255No written submissions were, on appeal, directed to the proposition that the evidence of ""the maximum damage conversation"" is properly to be seen as tendency evidence. Indeed, only glancing reference was made to it during the course of oral argument. It was merely submitted that the finding was wrong, and that the evidence was tendered for the purpose of establishing that Benbrika had a tendency to talk about ""maximum damage"". 

256It will be apparent, from what we have said above, that we reject this contention. The purpose of the tender of the evidence was not to establish that Benbrika had a tendency to use that phrase. The evidence was tendered to establish his attitudes, and accordingly the behaviour he encouraged in the appellants.

257In any event, even if that were not so, we reject this aspect of this ground of appeal. By s 97 of the Evidence Act, tendency evidence is not admissible unless two pre-conditions are satisfied. The first is that reasonable notice of the intention to adduce the evidence has been given. The second is that the court comes to the view that the evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party, has significant probative value. 

258Since this issue was not raised before Whealy J, it can hardly be said to have been an error for him not to reject the evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act. Moreover, it is plain that adequate notice was given of the Crown's intention to adduce the evidence (although not characterised as tendency evidence). Further, had the issue been raised, it is apparent, from what Whealy J said in his comprehensive judgment, that he would have concluded that the evidence had significant probative value. No complaint can be made of his Honour's failure to address the s 97 questions in the absence of their having been put to him on behalf of the appellants.

259We reject Ground 2 of Hasan's appeal, and the corresponding grounds in the other Notices of Appeal.

Issue (iii): Was the Melbourne evidence as a whole properly admitted?

260As mentioned above, only Elomar took this ground. However, in neither the written nor the oral submissions was it argued that the category of evidence known as ""the Melbourne evidence"", as a discrete category, was wrongly admitted. The submissions, both written and oral, addressed a different category of evidence (although one that encompassed at least some of the Melbourne evidence). That category is, as identified in Ground 2, evidence of ""the acts and declarations of the alleged co-conspirators which were not in furtherance of the conspiracy"". This evidence was not the same as, or co-extensive with, the Melbourne evidence. Indeed, it refers to evidence (of acts and declarations of alleged co-conspirators) that necessarily excludes the Melbourne evidence. That is because the Melbourne group were not alleged to have been involved in a conspiracy with the appellants, and therefore could not be ""alleged co-conspirators"".

261There being no argument addressed to Ground 1 of Elomar's Notice of Appeal, we reject it. In reaching that conclusion, we note that, in the written submissions filed on behalf of Elomar, Grounds 1 and 2 were argued together. There is a logical inconsistency in that. As will appear below, Ground 2 was concerned with ""acts and declarations of the alleged co-conspirators"". As we have said, it was always made plain, and seized upon by the Sydney accused, that the Melbourne group were not alleged to be co-conspirators with the Sydney group. Grounds 1 and 2 necessarily raise different and mutually exclusive issues.

262Since the two grounds were argued together, however, it is convenient now to deal with Ground 2 as pleaded in Elomar's Notice of Appeal.

Ground 2 (Elomar): Acts and declarations of alleged co-conspirators

263This ground is directed to a wide range of evidence contained in recorded conversations involving one or more of the appellants, the four Sydney accused who were not on trial with the appellants, and others. 

264Objection, on the same basis as is now argued, was taken before Whealy J, pre-trial, and is the subject of a judgment: Baladjam (No 38), delivered in August 2008. The evidence to which objection was then taken was identified by Whealy J in par [7]. It consisted of three large folders of transcripts of conversations of the accused with one another or with others, and the product of examinations of the appellants' computers and electronic devices. Whealy J was also asked, on the same basis, to reconsider his approach to the argument relating to the Melbourne evidence, the subject of Baladjam [No 19].

265The computer material is not the subject of the present ground.

266The actual evidentiary material to which the ground relates was not, in this Court, specified with any precision. It was referred to globally, as in the ground itself, as ""evidence of acts and declarations of the alleged co-conspirators which were not in furtherance of the conspiracy"". In his judgment Baladjam (No 38), Whealy J extracted some passages from the evidence there proposed to be tendered by the Crown. (Not all of the evidence to which Whealy J referred was, in the trial, led. However, the present ground complains of the decision to admit the evidence, and that decision must be evaluated in the light of the circumstances as they existed at that time. There is no separate ground of appeal that a miscarriage of justice arose as a result of any item or items of that evidence having been adduced.)

267It may be taken, from the brief samples given by Whealy J in pars [11] to [19] of Baladjam (No 38) that the evidence in question is of the kind outlined at the commencement of these reasons. That shows that there was a great deal of evidence of recorded conversations, both telephone and face to face, in which one or more of the appellants took part, either with one another or with members of the Melbourne group, or with others. The conversations were capable of being seen as disclosing states of mind of the participants to the conversations, attitudes to Jihad, Islam, to martyrdom in the cause of Islam, hostility to western civilisations, to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and much more. Some were capable of being interpreted as directly disclosing the intention of the participant or participants to take part in terrorist activity.

268The argument put to Whealy J, rejected by him, and maintained on appeal, was this. Evidence of acts and/or declarations of the alleged co-conspirators are admissible only on one (or perhaps both) of two bases. The first is pursuant to ""the co-conspirators' rule"": Ahern v The Queen [1988] HCA 39; 165 CLR 87. The second is under the rules of evidence relating to admissions: see Pt 3.4 of the Evidence Act. Either way, the admissibility of the evidence is circumscribed. If it is tendered under the co-conspirators' rule, it is admissible only if the statements or acts are made or done ""in furtherance of the conspiracy"". If the evidence is tendered as admissions, it is admissible only against the individual who made the statement or did the act, unless it comes within s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act which, again, requires, as a pre-condition to admissibility, that it be said or done ""in furtherance of a common purpose"". (Section 87(1)(c) is set out and considered below at [287].)

269Contained within the argument is the proposition that evidence of statements made by any accused is not admissible, unless the statements are made ""in furtherance of the conspiracy"". Specifically, evidence of such statements is not admissible to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy. 

270The argument is flawed for a number of reasons.

271First, it misunderstands the effect of the decision in Ahern. 

The co-conspirators' rule

272The co-conspirators' rule dates back at least to the decision in The King and the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth v The Associated Northern Collieries (the Coal-Vend Case) [1911] HCA 73; 14 CLR 387, and adopted in Tripodi v The Queen [1961] HCA 22; 104 CLR 1.

273In Tripodi, the Court (Dixon CJ, Fullagar and Windeyer JJ) said:

""For upon a charge of conspiracy the proof of the crime may well consist in evidence of the separate acts of the individuals charged which, although separate acts, yet point to a common design and when considered in combination justify the conclusion that there must have been a combination such as that alleged in the indictment. When that is so evidence may readily be let in of what each party to the conspiracy alleged may do or say in furtherance of the common purpose ... When the case for the prosecution is that in the commission of the crime a number of men acted in preconcert, reasonable evidence of the preconcert must be adduced before evidence of acts or words of one of the parties in furtherance of the common purpose which constitutes or forms an element of the crime becomes admissible against the other or others, that is to say of course, unless some other ground for admitting the evidence exists in the given case ... It must be remembered that the basal reason for admitting the evidence of the acts or words of one against the other is that the combination or preconcert to commit the crime is considered as implying an authority to each to act or speak in furtherance of the common purpose on behalf of the others. From the nature of the case it can seldom happen that anything said by one which is no more than a narrative statement or account of some event that has already taken place, that is to say, some statement which would be receivable in evidence against the man who made it as an admission and not otherwise, can become admissible under this principle against his companions in the common enterprise. Usually the question of admissibility will relate to directions, instructions or arrangements or to utterances accompanying acts.""

274With respect to the co-conspirators rule, the Court in Ahern (Mason CJ, Wilson, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said (we adopt the paragraph numbering system retrospectively and usefully assigned to High Court decisions by Austlii):

""[7] ... Evidence of the acts or declarations of others led for this purpose [that is, as proof of the participation of an accused] will be led to prove the truth of the assertion or implied assertion contained in those acts or declarations. It would be excluded as hearsay or its equivalent were it not admissible upon some other basis.

[8] That basis is provided in an appropriate case by the rule which states that when two or more persons are bound together in the pursuit of an unlawful object, anything said, done or written by one in furtherance of the common purpose is admissible in evidence against the others. The combination implies an authority in each to act or speak on behalf of the others: Tripodi, [at 7]. Thus anything said or done by one conspirator in pursuit of the common object may be treated as having been said or done on behalf of another conspirator. That being so, once participation in the conspiracy is established, such evidence may prove the nature and extent of the participation. The principle lying behind the rule is one of agency and the closest analogy is with partners in a partnership business ...

...

[17] In our view, the test adopted in Tripodi is the appropriate one. Where an accused is charged with conspiracy, evidence in the form of acts done or words uttered outside his presence by a person alleged to be a co-conspirator will only be admissible to prove the participation of the accused in the conspiracy where it is established that there was a combination of the type alleged, that the acts were done or the words uttered by a participant in furtherance of its common purpose and there is reasonable evidence, apart from the acts or words, that the accused was also a participant ..."" (italics added)

275It is therefore correct to assert that, where evidence of a statement or conversation attributed to one accused is tendered against another accused pursuant to the co-conspirators' rule, it is admissible against that other accused only where (inter alia) it was said ""in furtherance of its common purpose"". 

276The flaw in the argument is to regard admissibility under the co-conspirators' rule as the only basis of admissibility recognised in Ahern. The argument also overlooks the important circumstance that the evidence was not, and never was, tendered under the co-conspirators' rule.

277It is not correct to regard Ahern as authority for the proposition that acts, statements, declarations or conversations of one or more alleged conspirators are admissible against other alleged conspirators only if made in furtherance of the common purpose. Ahern expressly holds otherwise. The Court said:

""[5] In conspiracy cases a clear distinction is to be made between the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of each of the alleged conspirators in it. Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means and it is the fact of the agreement, or combination, to engage in a common enterprise which is the nub of the offence. This fact can seldom be proved by direct evidence of the making of an agreement and must in almost all cases be proved as a matter of inference from other facts, that is to say, by circumstantial evidence. For this purpose, evidence may be led which includes the acts or declarations of one alleged conspirator made outside the presence of the others provided such evidence is not led to prove against the others the truth of any assertion or implied assertion made by the actor or the maker of the statement. It may take the form of evidence of separate acts or utterances from which the fact of combination might be inferred. Led in that way, it is not hearsay and is not dependent upon some circumstance to take it outside the hearsay rule, such as an implied authority making the acts and words of one the acts and words of the other.""

278The Court quoted from the judgment of Isaacs J in the Coal-Vend Case as follows:

""... though primarily each set of acts is attributable to the person whose acts they are, and to him alone, there may be such a concurrence of time, character, direction and result as naturally to lead to the inference that these separate acts were the outcome of pre-concert, or some mutual contemporaneous engagement, or that they were themselves the manifestations of mutual consent to carry out a common purpose, thus forming as well as evidencing a combination to effect the one object towards which the separate acts are found to converge.""

279Essential for the Crown to prove in a conspiracy trial (inter alia) are:

(i) the existence of the conspiracy alleged; and

(ii) the participation in that conspiracy of the various accused.

280While recognising that certain items of evidence might be relevant to each of these, it is necessary to carefully delineate which evidence goes to prove the existence of the conspiracy, and which goes to prove the participation of any of the individual accused. But it is wrong to say, as was contended on behalf of Elomar, that, unless conversations or statements or acts are had or made or done in furtherance of the conspiracy, or of the common purpose, that evidence is not admissible against any accused other than the accused to whom it is attributed.

281A similar argument was put to this Court in R v Louden (1995) 37 NSWLR 683. Allen J, with whom Newman J and Simpson J agreed, categorised that argument as ""fundamentally wrong"". The argument to which his Honour referred was, in essence, that the evidence would not be admissible on any ground other than that the conversations the subject of the evidence were in furtherance of the conspiracy charged.

282In Louden, Allen J accepted that a good deal of the evidence there in question did not implicate the appellant, in the sense of proving his participation in the conspiracy. It was, however, circumstantial evidence of both of the existence and the nature of the conspiracy alleged. It was by other evidence that the appellant was shown to be involved.

283The evidence the subject of this ground of appeal was not tendered under the co-conspirators' rule, and was not subject to the limitation that it be evidence of acts or statements in furtherance of the conspiracy.

284To classify any particular item of evidence as ""in furtherance of the conspiracy"" may, in some cases, present difficulties. If it were necessary to make that decision in the present case, it would present particular difficulties, in the absence of any breakdown of the particular conversations to which objection is taken. Since the evidence was not tendered under the co-conspirators' rule, but was tendered for a different purpose, that question does not arise. The evidence was amply able to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy. 

Admissions

285The alternative submission was that the evidence could only be tendered as admissions (against the accused to whom it was attributed) and, by reason of s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act, was admissible against others subject to the same limitation, that the act or statement be done or made in furtherance of the conspiracy.

286""Admission"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as:

""... a previous representation that is: 
(a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding); and
(b) adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding.""

287The admissibility of evidence tendered as admissions is the subject of Pt 3.4 of the Evidence Act. Section 81 provides that neither the hearsay rule nor the opinion rule applies to evidence of an admission. For present purposes, the salient provision is s 87, which is in the following terms:

""87 Admissions made with authority

(1) For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by a person is also taken to be an admission by a party, the court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that: 
(a) when the representation was made, the person had authority to make statements on behalf of the party in relation to the matter with respect to which the representation was made, or
(b) when the representation was made, the person was an employee of the party, or had authority otherwise to act for the party, and the representation related to a matter within the scope of the person's employment or authority, or
(c) the representation was made by the person in furtherance of a common purpose (whether lawful or not) that the person had with the party or one or more persons including the party.

(2) For the purposes of this section, the hearsay rule does not apply to a previous representation made by a person that tends to prove: 
(a) that the person had authority to make statements on behalf of another person in relation to a matter, or
(b) that the person was an employee of another person or had authority otherwise to act for another person, or
(c) the scope of the person's employment or authority."" (italics added)

288Section 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act is accepted as a statutory form of the co-conspirators' rule: R v Macraild (NSWCCA, 18 December 1997, unreported). 

289The argument however, proceeded on the basis that, unless the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged, s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act operated to exclude them. For reasons given in relation to the argument concerning the co-conspirators' rule, the argument must fail. One way of identifying the flaw in the argument is to recognise that it perceives s 87(1)(c) as an exclusionary rule. It is no such thing. It is the converse. Section 87(1)(c) is an inclusionary rule. It specifically permits - and requires - the admission of evidence tendered as an admission made with authority where it was made in furtherance of a common purpose. That is evidence that otherwise would be excluded by the hearsay rule.

290Section 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act has nothing to say about the alternative basis of admissibility recognised in Ahern - that is, evidence going to the existence and nature of the conspiracy alleged. 

291In our opinion, Ground 2 of Elomar's Notice of Appeal must fail. 

Ground 3 (Hasan): ""the car park incident""

292Ground 3 of Hasan's Notice of Appeal is concerned with the incident, at an early stage in the trial, the circumstances of which are broadly outlined above at [52]. It is necessary to set out more detail. 

293On 26 November 2008, about four weeks into the trial, the jury sent the judge a note, in the following terms:

""On Thursday 19th November 4 jurors were followed to our car park (Parramatta Stadium). All 4 didn't enter our cars & waited until those people went to their cars (but we didn't see them enter or drive away).

On Tuesday 25th November, 1 juror as she was turning out from the car park noticed that the same person from the week before was standing behind her car & and pulled out a note pad from her handbag & wrote something down & pulled out her phone & made a call. 

I am not normal (sic) paranoid, but this did cause me to park in a different location & this has caused the other jurors some concern. The lady has a head scarf & is located in the public gallery.""

294The clear inference was that at least the woman to whom the note referred had been making a note of the registration number of the juror's car. 

295After discussing the note with counsel in chambers, Whealy J directed the jury in the following terms:

""Thank you, members of the jury, for the note you have sent me. As you would well appreciate, the subject matter of the note is clearly a matter of concern to the Court. You may be assured the Court takes the issue very seriously.

What I want to do is this: I am going to refer the incident to the police for investigation and ask that a report be given to them. It may be that there is an entirely innocent explanation for the incident. I don't know. Just like you, I try to keep an open mind on all these things and that is the important thing to do. That might take a few days to examine. 

But, more importantly, I want to say to you that while it appears that, at least at face value, that the incident had something to do with the person who has been in court in the public gallery, there is not the slightest suggestion that this incident has anything to do with the accused at all. There is not the slightest suggestion that the incident has been prompted by the accused, has been suggested by the accused, has been encouraged by the accused. There is not the slightest suggestion that it has anything to do with the accused at all.

If I may pick an analogy, you know yourself if you read in the paper that sometimes supporters of a club will misbehave at a match, and it is a sad thing when that happens, but it often has nothing to do with the club or the players. They have not sought it to be done or encouraged it. So hear what I say to you, and I want to stress it as much as I possibly can, it has nothing to do with the accused, and you should not draw any inference against the accused at all because of the occurrence of this incident. 

Your duty is to judge this trial impartially and on the evidence you hear in this court. I have said that to you a number of times, and I cannot stress too highly how important that is. So that when an incident of this kind happens, you have to put it out of your mind and you have to say to yourself: 'I will judge this case on the evidence I hear in court and nothing else.'

These are not just empty words. They are words that you should deeply reflect upon, and I trust that all of you, having taken an oath or affirmation to decide this case according to the evidence will do just that. You should not allow this to be a distraction to you. It will be investigated, the court will take care of it, and you should put it out of your mind and simply concentrate on the evidence that is brought before you.

Of course, if anything of a similar kind were to happen again, you should report it to me immediately. A prompt report would mean that I can take prompt steps. I trust that nothing of this kind will happen, but if it does, let me know and please do not hesitate to let me know.

There are a number of practical steps I want to put in place today, and I think that they may take me a little while. There will be some further matters I have to deal with counsel arising out of the incident, and I think in all those circumstances, rather than keep you hanging around today, I will ask you to disperse for the day and to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. I am sorry that you lost a day. It was the last thing I wanted to happen, but these things happen, as I say, and we must take them in our stride.

The important thing I want to stress to you is that this incident has nothing to do with the accused and you should not draw any inference adverse to these men arising from this incident, and you can be assured that I will have a look at the issue, about car parking, or where you park, and how you get here, and see from a practical point of view if I can protect you from any similar sort of incident happening again. I will be attending to that during the course of today and reporting back to you tomorrow. Thank you, see you tomorrow."" 

296The ""lady with the headscarf located in the public gallery"" of the court was quickly identified as Elomar's niece. She had at times engaged with Elomar's counsel, in circumstances the jury may have been able to observe.

297All counsel sought discharge of the jury. The Crown prosecutor, on instructions from the Director, did not oppose those applications. That was expressly because of the relatively early stage of the trial, which was anticipated to be lengthy, at which the incident occurred. It is of some interest that the Crown did not concede any apprehension about the effect the incident might have on the jury; rather, the Crown took a cautious approach out of concern for the views that a future appellate court might take.

298Some additional information soon came to light (in the absence of the jury). The Crown prosecutor said that the woman in question had made derogatory comments to police, and had, during the evidence, made apparently hostile gestures to witnesses, and had made a particularly insulting remark to one of the prosecution legal team. Some of this may have been observable by the jury.

299The suggestion that the woman had been making a note of the registration number of the juror's vehicle was said to have a particular poignancy. That was because, in recent days, evidence had been given that the execution of a search warrant at Baladjam's home revealed that he had in his possession a document recording makes, models and registration numbers of some vehicles.

300Notwithstanding the position taken by the Director, Whealy J declined to discharge the jury: Elomar [No 4]. 

301He made non-publication orders concerning the incident and the applications. Notwithstanding the non-publication orders, counsel reported that some media outlets did refer to the incident. The precise terms of the reporting were not before this Court. 

302There followed some discussion about what course should next be taken, his Honour favouring a course of directly asking the jury if they felt able to discharge their task as jurors impartially. He met opposition to this proposal, and ultimately took a slightly different course. He rejected a proposal that he examine the jurors individually, pursuant to s 55D of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW). (It may be noted, in passing, that s 55D does not authorise such a course in relation to an incident of the kind here in question. Section 55D authorises examination of a juror (or jurors) in order to determine whether he or she has ""read, seen or heard prejudicial material published or broadcast during the trial"".)

303The course Whealy J took was to address the jury, which he did in the following terms (the following is taken from the written submissions filed on behalf of Hasan, to which no criticism was directed): 

""Good morning, members of the jury. Thanks for coming in. 

I have a task for you. In reference to the events mentioned in your note ... you will recall that I gave you a direction before you left court yesterday morning. It was a direction expressed in firm terms. But now I want to ask you, all of you, through your foreman, if I may, are you able to assure the court that, notwithstanding the events mentioned in your note, each of you is able to discharge his or her task as a juror in this trial impartially? 

This is a question that I need to ask of you and want to ask of you individually. I want you to feel that you can give a genuine and honest answer to it. Please understand that, if any of you feel that you can not approach the issues in this trial impartially, there would be absolutely no criticism of you if that were the view you took.

So, what I'm going to do is simply hand the foreman the note. It is in an envelope. Because it may be easier for you to discuss among yourselves in the privacy of the jury room the contents of the note, I'm going to ask you, Mr Foreman, if you would not mind just sending me a note saying 'Yes' or 'No' in answer to my question. I will hand that note to you now. I will have a copy of it marked for identification as MFI 62. I will distribute copies to counsel.""

304The note handed to the jury read as follows:

""Members of the jury,

In reference to the events mentioned in your note MFI 61, you will recall I gave you a firm direction before you left the court yesterday morning. I want to ask you, all of you, through your Foreman, are you able to assure the court, that notwithstanding the events mentioned in your note, each of you is able to discharge his or her task as a juror in this trial impartially.

I will ask you to retire to the jury room to consider this question which I have reproduced.""

305The jury retired as requested, and returned, providing a note in the following terms:

""Your Honour, the jury has had a discussion regarding your note. The response is unanimous. Every juror remains able to discharge his or her task as a juror in this trial impartially. For the record, this is yes.""

306On 27 November 2008, Whealy J declined to discharge the jury and delivered reasons for his decision: Elomar [No 4]. 

307Whealy J prefaced his reasons by noting that the jury empanelment process had been lengthy, extending over a week. Because of the anticipated length of the trial, it began with the summoning of an unusually large jury panel, which was, after personal applications had been dealt with, reduced to about 5 per cent of its initial number. Implicit in these observations was recognition of the logistical difficulties that would attend any necessity to recommence the trial. His Honour also observed that, in the four weeks over which the trial had been proceeding, his impression had been that all (15) members of the jury were ""diligent, attentive and highly conscious of their duties as members of a criminal jury"". 

308He then recorded the note from the jury and the directions he had initially given, before considering relevant authority. He expressed his satisfaction that the responses to the note, enquiring of the jury's self-assessed capacity to remain impartial, should be taken at face value, and that the face value was considerable. In other words, he accepted, as a matter of fact, that no member of the jury was compromised in their capacity to discharge his or her task as a juror in the trial.

309His reasons for refusing to discharge the jury were encapsulated in a few paragraphs, as follows:

""37 As I have said, I have taken into account all the matters put to me by the defence. I have come to the conclusion, after assessing those matters, that, in the light of the direction I have given the jury and the jury's reaction to it, I cannot, and do not, conclude that the parties, or the public, might entertain any reasonable apprehension that the jury might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues involved in the trial. 

38 I have addressed this jury on a number of occasions on the need to bring an impartial and unbiased mind to the resolution of the issues involved in the proceedings. I am satisfied that the particular incidents, and the concerns expressed by the jury, in the light of the direction I have given, will not lead to the presence of bias or a lack of partiality (sic - impartiality) in the proceedings. I accept, however, that the ultimate test is an objective one and goes beyond this consideration. In that regard, in the light of the direction I have given and my overall evaluation of the circumstances, I have concluded, as an objective matter, that a fair-minded and informed observer would not reasonably apprehend a lack of impartiality on the part of any of the members of the present jury.

40 The ultimate concern of the Court is to ensure a fair trial for the accused. Where the Court is convinced a fair trial can be had, and that no miscarriage of justice is likely, it would be quite wrong for the Court to discharge a jury simply because, for reasons not of substance but arising out of mere forensic or other expediency, the Crown has, effectively, been instructed to succumb to a defence application of this kind. The Court must respect the integrity of the institution of trial by jury, just as it must respect the jurors themselves.""

310The principles applicable to a decision to discharge or not discharge a jury following an irregularity in a trial were stated in Webb v The Queen; Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 as:

""... whether the incident is such that, notwithstanding the proposed or actual warning of the trial judge, it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension or suspicion on the part of a fair-minded and informed member of the public that the juror or jury has not discharged or will not discharge its task impartially."" (per Mason CJ and McHugh J at 53, per Brennan J at 57, per Deane J at 67, 71, and per Toohey J at 87)

311There is no difficulty in the statement of principle. In some cases, there may be considerable difficulty in its application. In Webb, while all members of the Court agreed that the test was as stated, the Court divided on the result of its application: three members of the Court (Mason CJ, Toohey and McHugh JJ) concluded that a fair-minded observer in that case would not have had the relevant apprehension; two members of the Court (Brennan and Deane JJ) to the contrary.

312The facts in that case were somewhat unusual. In the closing stages of a murder trial, one of the members of the jury impulsively presented a bunch of flowers to another person with the request that they be passed on to the mother of the victim of the murder.

2704118,R v Clarke [2014] NSWDC 307,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Jesse James Clarke for two crimes. One of them is a drug supply offence and the other is assaulting a police officer.
	
	
	The drug supply offence is the supply of 26 grams of methlyamphetamine. The supply was in the form of an agreement to supply. That is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to that offence.
	
	
	When I am sentencing him for that crime Mr Clarke has asked me to take into account four other offences under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Those four additional crimes are two offences of hindering police in the execution of their duty and two offences of dealing with property being suspected proceeds of crime. They are listed on a form. For the purposes of s 32 of that Act I will take those matters into account when I am sentencing him and I sign the form to that effect. The form is part of exhibit A.
	
	
	The second offence is assaulting a police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty. That is an offence against s 58 of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 5 years imprisonment to that crime.
	
	
	It is important for a judge to set out briefly what happened to amount to the crimes the judge is sentencing an offender for so that an assessment can be made of just how serious an example the particular offences are of that category of crime.
	
	
	Mr Clarke was a local ice dealer in the Albury area. Police commenced surveillance on him and found that he was, according to the agreed statement of facts, supplying drugs. The facts say this -
	


“It was revealed that Clarke was supplying amounts varying between ‘[p]oints’ ([b]eing 0.1 [g]ram, sold for about $100), ‘[h]alf [w]eights’ or ‘[h]alves’ (0.5 [g]rams, sold for $350), ‘[g]rams’ or ‘[f]ulls’ (1.0 gram, sold for $600 to $800), through to larger amounts including an ‘[e]ight [b]all’, ‘[e]ights’ or ‘[b]each [b]alls’ (being 3.5 grams, sold for $1,750).”


	
	The facts go on to say that the supply of these drugs “was facilitated by customers calling or exchanging text messages with Clarke”. Police claimed that Mr Clarke “would typically obtain large amount of drugs from a person in the Sydney area when his supplies were depleted before returning to the Albury area.” He would there distribute the drugs to his customers.
	
	
	Police intelligence discloses a series of 38 occasions where Mr Clarke was in contact with people he described as his associates and selling methylamphetamine to them in the amounts and price ranges which I have referred to. The agreements to supply ranged between 31 May 2013 to 1 August 2013, a period of about two months.
	
	
	About a week after the last agreement to supply Mr Clarke went to Sydney to obtain more drugs from the up-line supplier. He was coming back by train. Police knew that he was going to get off the train at Culcairn and were waiting for him at about 4 o’clock in the morning when he arrived on 8 August 2013. The police approached him and he ran off, dropping a bag of luggage. He then “produced an envelope from his pocket which ripped. He began then throwing the envelope and contents of it and his pockets into the air as he ran. The contents were several rocks of [m]ethylamphetamine which he disbursed over about 400 metres.”
	
	
	Police caught him and arrested him. They later recovered about 1.7 grams of methylamphetamine which had been distributed by Mr Clarke. He was taken to a room in the train station to be interviewed. Whilst he was being searched he reached into his pants and pulled out an iPhone “which he commenced attempting to break by snapping it in his hands, causing damage to the phone.” One of the police officers, Detective Senior Constable Martin, tried to grab the phone “at which stage Clarke struck Detective Senior Constable Martin to the throat using his right elbow and attempted to hold him against the wall in an attempt to continue destroying the phone.” The two men struggled and Mr Clarke was eventually subdued.
	
	
	The police later that morning went to Mr Clarke’s house where they found “items consistent with the supply of prohibited drugs”. They included “drug packaging and scales”. They found a safe which they opened and recovered about $1,500 in cash as well as two iPhones.
	
	
	The offence of assaulting police in the execution of duty regards Detective Senior Constable Martin. The two hinder police concern the escape and his attempts to avoid being searched. The proceeds of crime relate to the cash and to the phones.
	
	
	The facts record that “about 2500 phone calls were intercepted, as well as 5000 text messages since June 2013.” As can be seen, Mr Clarke was heavily engaged in a business of sourcing and distributing the toxic drug methylamphetamine, better known as ice, to people in the Albury area.
	
	
	As I have said, he was arrested on 8 August 2013. As it happens he was on parole for another offence. That parole was revoked on 29 August 2013. So from 8 August until 5 September he was serving the balance of parole for the earlier offence. Since 5 September 2013 he has been in custody regarding these matters only.
	
	
	Mr Clarke, once he was charged with these offences, pleaded guilty on 21 July 2014 at the Albury Local Court. Both Ms C Mendes of counsel who appears for Mr Clarke and Mr A Thomas who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions agreed that the plea was at the earliest available opportunity. That means that a judge can discount the sentence which the judge would otherwise impose by some 25%. I propose to do that.
	
	
	Mr Clarke has a very poor criminal record. He has been committing offences as a juvenile. He is now only 23 years of age. As a juvenile he committed break and enter, including an aggravated one, traffic offences, property damage offences, car theft offences and goods in custody offences. He has served prison sentences as an adult, including for crimes such as armed robbery, goods in custody, resisting police and a police pursuit on one occasion. He also has a record in Victoria. I regard his criminal record as serious enough to take into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentence Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Ms Mendes appropriately and fairly conceded that another aggravating factor was that the drug offences her client has pleaded guilty to involved a number of criminal acts. In addition, of course, as an aggravating feature, Mr Clarke was on parole for a sentence he was serving for a driving offence and, significantly, for resisting a police officer in the execution of their duty. A further aggravating factor was that he was committing the crimes, at least the drug offences, for financial gain, although I accept Ms Mendes’ submission that most of the income he derived from his business was to feed his own habit and that his personal financial gain was limited.
	
	
	Mr Clarke has written a letter to the Court. Judges see many of these letters. In it he explains that he accepts responsibility for what he did and points to his plans to gain some qualifications and begin some tertiary education. In addition he points out that he has done some research into the impact which the drug ice has on those who use it and the families of those who use it. He accepts that he will be punished and held responsible and does not attempt to offer any excuses for his behaviour. He acknowledges the support from his family. It is clear that he is very contrite for his criminal activity and I accept that.
	
	
	The claims made by Mr Clarke in his letter are backed up in two respects. His interest in rehabilitation is confirmed by a letter from a counsellor at the Long Bay Correctional Centre dated 2 December 2014 which became exhibit 6. The second respect is that Ms Mendes called her client to give evidence. His contrition is obvious to me. I also accept Ms Mendes’ submission that Mr Clarke is a sincere and impressive young man.
	
	
	As was pointed out in evidence - and is consistent with the documentation - since turning 18 Mr Clarke has spent about 3 years in custody. When he was out of custody he sooner or later fell back into the use of prohibited drugs. I should add that I accept that he is a user of prohibited drugs. He was not a person who was selling purely as a business without being themselves addicted.
	
	
	Mr Clarke as a young man had an extraordinarily bad start to life. His family of origin was dysfunctional. The partner of his brother, Candice Mountney, in an affidavit which became exhibit 4 explains it in this way in paragraph 11-
	


“Jesse had a very difficult and sad start in life. His family home was not functional. I am aware that he and his siblings witnessed a lot of domestic violence between his parents. His parents drank heavily and his mother had a drug problem. Jesse’s older sister, Danielle, tried as best she could to raise Jesse and remains very supportive of her brother. Jesse’s father took his own life in February 2010 whilst Jesse was in custody. Jesse spoke to his father the day before he died and felt that something was not quite right; Jesse has felt a sense of guilt ever since. Jesse’s mother is currently serving a sentence in custody.”


	
	A number of observations can be made about that. The first is that Mr Clarke confirmed that account in his evidence. Secondly, his sister Danielle remains loyal and supportive and has been present at the sentencing proceedings. Thirdly, he confirmed in evidence that his father had committed suicide. In fact, Mr Clarke received a death benefit from his father’s death and spent it all on drugs, bikes and gambling. He ran out of money and still had bills to pay and a drug habit to feed and so he fell into his most recent episode of criminal activity namely, the supply of illegal drugs.
	
	
	Mr Clarke in the witness box also showed some insight into the impact which ice has, confirming what he had said in his letter. Asked the obvious question of what is different this time by Ms Mendes, Mr Clarke said that he is actively involved in drug and alcohol counselling. That is confirmed by exhibit 6 where the drug and alcohol counsellor observes that Mr Clarke “has demonstrated a commitment to participating in these [counselling] sessions with eagerness and rectitude.”
	
	
	Mr Clarke is interested in developing, as he said, a career not just a job and is wanting to further his education. His ex-partner, Jessie Williams, had been involved in some criminal activity but is obviously on the road to rehabilitation herself and holds down a job with a legal firm in Albury. The impact of being in adult prison yet again has been sobering. As he said, he sees men in the yard who are in their 40s, 50s and 60s and he does not want to go down that road himself. He acknowledges that he has not used parole opportunities in the past but has set himself as determined to rehabilitate himself on this occasion. He has had the opportunity of taking drugs in prison but has refused.
	
	
	I should add that the reasons I accept that Mr Clarke himself was a drug addict include the affidavit from Candice Mountney and exhibits 2 and 3 which indicate that he had made enquiries at drug rehabilitation centres last year.
	
	
	The counsellor who authored the report of 2 December 2014, Dona Shepherd, said that Mr Clarke “has completed an application to be admitted into ‘The Peppers Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre’”. He is apparently waiting for a confirmation letter and available bed which could become available in a few weeks or a few months. In addition Ms Mountney made it clear that Mr Clarke will have the support of her partner, who is Mr Clarke’s brother. He will assist and encourage him and indeed offer him accommodation when he comes out of prison. That is in addition to the support that he already receives from his sister Danielle.
	
	
	I have been assisted by Ms Mendes’ usual helpful written submissions. I accept her submissions about the role of her client in the supply of drugs which she sets out at paragraph 1.3 of her submissions (which became MFI 1). The drugs were supplied to those who were adults and who sought the drugs rather than indiscriminately supplied to all takers, including juveniles. The amount was just over five times the indictable quantity. I agree that I can infer that it was street level purity.
	
	
	I accept that the assault of the police officer should be seen in the context that although actual violence was used there was no weapon, nor is there any evidence of a physical injury. That is not to reduce the gravity of what Mr Clarke did to the police officer who is entrusted with protecting members of the general public from the activities of people like Mr Clarke. But in some cases an offence can produce injuries which are documented by medical or other evidence. That is not the case here.
	
	
	I accept Ms Mendes’ submissions that her client has reasonably good prospects of rehabilitation. I also accept her submission regarding her client’s background and the fact that I should take that into account. She drew my attention to a passage from the judgment of Simpson J in R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 where her Honour said the following (at [69]) -
	


“I am not prepared to accept that an offender who has the start in life that the respondent had bears equal moral responsibility with one who has had with what might be termed ‘normal’ or ‘advantaged’ upbringing. Common sense and common humanity dictate that such a person will have fewer emotional resources to guide his (or her) behavioural decisions.”

I am grateful for that being drawn to my attention. In my opinion it applies in this case.


	
	Ms Mendes realistically acknowledges that a “custodial penalty” is the “only appropriate penalty in all the circumstances of this matter”. I agree with that submission in accordance with s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Ms Mendes submitted that the evidence is significant about the maturity that her client has undergone over the last year or so since being arrested for these offences. It is clear to me from his evidence that he is determined this time to get his life back into order. He will however need a lot of support both from agencies and from his family once he is back in the community. There is a risk, as Ms Mendes pointed out, of him becoming institutionalised but there is also a risk of course of him reoffending. That has occurred before.
	
	
	The offending in this case occurred towards the end of the parole period that he was serving for an earlier offences. I do not propose to entirely backdate the sentence I will impose but I will fix it to commence about halfway through that parole period namely, 22 August 2013. I accept Mr Thomas’ submission that the offence of assaulting the police officer was separate and there should be some accumulation of the sentence.
	
	
	The offending is a serious instance of both crimes. The assault on the police officer fell, however, towards the lower end because of the factors that I have mentioned. The drug offending was persistent and over a long period of time involving many different transactions. The crimes were committed when Mr Clarke had been given liberty to return to the community on trust. He breached that trust. He has a bad criminal record which means that I need to emphasise deterrence for him as well as protection of the community. Against this is the fact which I accept of his family background and I take into account the observation made by Simpson J with which I respectfully agree.
	
	
	I had thought that an appropriate sentence for the drug offence was 6 years but I propose to commence at 5 years given Mr Clarke’s age and his background. I regard an appropriate sentence for the assault on the police officer as 2 years imprisonment. However Mr Clarke pleaded guilty to both crimes at the earliest available opportunity. I am therefore going to discount both those proposed sentences by 25%. The drug offence sentence will be reduced from 5 years to 3 years and 9 months. The assault police officer offence will be reduced from 2 years to 18 months imprisonment. I propose to accumulate those two sentences by 3 months so that the total sentence will be 4 years imprisonment. I propose to fix one sentence as an aggregate sentence in accordance with s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That one sentence will be 4 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Normally a sentence of 4 years imprisonment would attract a non-parole period of 3 years. Ms Mendes puts a strong case for there being special circumstances to reduce that non-parole period in this case. She points to her client’s youth and his need for lengthy supervision “to assist with accommodation, drug relapse, employment and counselling”. She also points to the risk of “entrenched institutionalisation” which her client may face. I think she is right in both submissions and I accept them.
	
	
	I had in mind to fix a non-parole period at 2 years being 50% instead of the 75%, but I am going to reduce that even further. The same factors are relevant except that I am taking into account the most recent exhibit, namely exhibit 6, which points to Mr Clarke’s pursuing a drug rehabilitation program through a regional agency in or around Wagga. I think that the evidence shows that he has taken a significant turn in his young life and appears to be determined to put things right this time.
	
	
	I am putting the community at risk by releasing him, which I will in a few months’ time, at this stage because he could relapse, as he has done before, and inflict further criminal behaviour on society. But I am going to take into account that risk but nevertheless fix a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment which is, I acknowledge, significantly low. I am doing this because I want to encourage his attempts to rehabilitate himself. There is some independent evidence of those attempts which come from within the prison system. I, myself, have been impressed by his own evidence. He appears to have family support. If I were to leave him in gaol for another 9 or 10 months then I would not want that enthusiasm and commitment to wane or for some incident to occur. However, on the other hand, he must serve an appropriate period of time for the crimes that he has committed. The non-parole period I have decided on is 18 months which will expire on 21 February next year.
	


HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now Mr Clarke.


	
	I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to both crimes. That aggregate sentence is 4 years imprisonment. I fix it to commence on 22 August 2013. The overall sentence will expire on 21 August 2017. I fix a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment. That also commenced on 22 August 2013 and will expire on 21 February 2015. After that, the balance of your sentence will commence on 22 February 2015, after your parole date, and expire on 21 August 2017.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now I do not fix parole because it is over 3 years. I think that is all the formalities. I have got to deal with the proceeds of crime, and I will come to that. As far as the sentence is concerned, before I explain it to your client, I think I have covered everything.

MENDES: Perhaps if your Honour just indicates that you take into account the matters on the Form 1.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you for reminding me, yes.


	
	Ms Mendes correctly reminds me about the additional offences under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I had in fact fixed the drug offence sentence bearing that in mind. I have in fact taken it into account and I had omitted to mention it.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Mr Clarke, you have got a 4 year prison sentence. I have given my reasons and I have explained it all. It commenced on 22 August last year. I could have commenced it on 5 September, I have backdated it a couple of weeks. Therefore it expires on 21 August 2017, 4 years later. I had in mind to fix your non parole period as 2 years to expire on 21 August next year but I have changed my mind because of that recent report and for the reasons that I have given. I want to encourage you to get on with your rehabilitation . So your non-parole period commenced on 22 August last year. It will expire on 21 February 2015. On that date, 21 February 2015, you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get it or not depends on the Parole Authority. Once you are released on parole, as you know better than I do, you are on parole until your sentence expires on 21 August 2017. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I am also conscious of the fact that I am putting the community at risk, which I said in my remarks on sentence, by letting you out but I have some faith and trust in you that you will get on with your rehabilitation once you are out. You have got this opportunity which, it seems to me, you want to grasp and I am going to give you that, and I do not want the community paying for that. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: We have to deal with, and I got some paperwork about this, were you asking to be heard on this Ms Mendes?

MENDES: No I am not, your Honour.


	
	I make the orders contained in the document Forfeiture Order signed by me, sealed and dated today, having considered that today’s value of the property forfeited is $5,600 in total.
	


HIS HONOUR: Mr Clarke forfeited to the State are all your phones and almost $1,500 cash. They are the orders I have made. Do you understand that? Okay. I will put those with the papers.

2704124,JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297,"Judgment

 

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.

 

2R A HULME J: JM (the applicant) pleaded guilty to nine offences involving child sexual assault, using children to make child abuse material and possessing child abuse material. He also asked that his guilt of a further nine offences be taken into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

 

3His Honour Judge Bennett SC sentenced the applicant in the District Court at Parramatta on 25 January 2013. He imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 18 years, with a non-parole period of 13 years, with effect from 12 May 2011.

 

4To avoid identifying the child victims of the offences, neither they nor JM and his former wife are named in this judgment: s 578A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

 

Offences, facts and indicative sentences

 

5At the time of the offences, the applicant was living with his then wife (TP) and her three children, MP (a girl aged 15), LP (a girl aged 11) and BP (a boy aged 9). He and TP also had their own child, KM (a 2-year-old girl).

 

6Following a complaint made by LP, police executed a search warrant at the family home on 22 October 2010. They seized a camera, a laptop computer and two external hard drives and submitted them for specialist examination. This examination located a number of files that showed the commission by the applicant of a number of offences against the children.

 

7There were two indictments. The first contained eight counts and the second contained a single count.

 

8In announcing indicative sentences for each offence, as required by s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, there is no requirement to specify non-parole periods unless the offence is one for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed. There is also no need to specify a date on which the indicative sentences would commence. In this case, however, the judge engaged in both of those unnecessary specifications. I will say more about this later.

 

9The offences were all contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act. The facts, the maximum penalties that applied, together with any relevant standard non-parole period prescribed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were as follows.

 

Count 1 - Sexual intercourse with child under 10 (s 66A(2)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for life - standard non-parole period 15 years + Form 1 (5 offences)

 

Count 2 - Use child under the age of 14 to make child abuse material (s 91G(1)(a)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years. 

 

10There was a photograph taken at 7.59pm on 22 September 2010 showing the applicant's 2 year old daughter in the bath with his hand on her genital area parting her labia. (First Form 1 - offences 3 (Use child under 14 to make child abuse material) and 4 (aggravated indecent assault)). (Another photograph showing the same thing but taken immediately before this one constituted the offences in counts 3 and 4).

 

11There was a four-minute video file, the recording of which commenced five minutes later. It showed the applicant with the same daughter on a bed. She was naked and he was naked from the waist down. He approached her and performed cunnilingus for about a minute. He then lay on his back on the bed, placing her on his chest facing away from him and masturbated his penis while still performing cunnilingus upon her. At this point, the child's face was close to his exposed penis. After a short period he wiped his penis with a towel and kissed her on the lips. He then turned the camera off.

 

12The performance of cunnilingus upon the child constituted the offence in Count 1. Offences 1, 2 and 5 on the First Form 1 were offences arising from the same incident - Commit act of indecency upon a person under 16; Produce child abuse material; and Possess child abuse material.

 

Indicative sentence (count 1, taking into account Form 1 offences): 13 years with non-parole period 9 years dating from 12 May 2011.

 

Indicative sentence (count 2): 6 years 8 months with non-parole period 5 years dating from 12 May 2011.

 

Count 3 - Film a child under the age of 16 engaged in a private act without her consent for the purpose of enabling another person to obtain sexual arousal or gratification - (s 91K(3)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years + Form 1 (3 offences)

 

13Police located a video file of 20 minutes duration on one of the external hard drives which showed the applicant's 11 year old stepdaughter entering the bathroom, disrobing, showering and getting dressed. (Count 3)

 

14There was also an 11 minute video showing his 9 year old son and a 23 minute video showing his 15 year old daughter doing the same thing on different occasions. (Second Form 1 - offences 1 and 2 (Film private act for sexual gratification)).

 

1543 images of naked male and female children amongst groups of naked adults were found on the laptop computer. The genitals of the children were exposed. Some of them appeared to be under the age of 10. The images were enfaced with an internet website address. (Second Form 1 - offence 3 (Possess child abuse material)).

 

Indicative sentence: 3 years 4 months with non-parole period 2 years dating from 12 May 2019.

 

Count 4 - Use child under the age of 14 to make child abuse material (s 91G(1)(a)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years

 

Count 5 - Indecent assault upon child under the age of 16 whilst under authority (s 61M(2) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years - standard non-parole period 8 years

 

16These counts concerned the second image taken at 7.59pm on 22 September 2010 of the applicant indecently assaulting his 2-year-old daughter in the bath (see above in relation to offences 3 and 4 on the Form 1 taken into account in relation to Count 1).

 

Indicative sentence (count 4): 7 years with non-parole period 3 years dating from 12 May 2020.

 

Indicative sentence (count 5): 6 years with non-parole period 3 years dating from 12 May 2010. 

 

Count 6 - Use child under the age of 14 to make child abuse material (s 91G(1)(a)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years

 

Count 7 - Indecent assault upon child under the age of 16 whilst under authority (s 61M(2) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years - standard non-parole period 8 years

 

17Police found on the laptop computer an image of a child's vagina. The applicant's wife identified the child as her 11-year-old daughter, LP. This was the subject of the complaint made by LP that led police to search the applicant's home. LP had complained that on 1 October 2010 she was in bed when the applicant came in, lifted up the bedclothes, pulled down her clothing and took a photograph of her vagina. She told police she feigned sleep whilst this occurred.

 

Indicative sentence (count 6): 7 years with non-parole period 3 years dating from 12 May 2020.

 

Indicative sentence (count 7): 6 years with non-parole period 3 years dating from 12 May 2020.

 

Count 8 - Possess child abuse material (s 91H(2)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years

 

18On the second external hard drive police found 14 images of naked female children with their vaginas exposed. Some of the children appeared to be under the age of 10. The images were enfaced with a website address.

 

Indicative sentence: 4 years with non-parole period 3 years dating from 12 May 2010.

 

2nd Indictment - Possess child abuse material (s 91H(2)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years - Form 1 (one offence)

 

19The applicant's wife abandoned her relationship with him following the complaint by her daughter (LP) and the execution of the search warrant on 22 October 2010. He commenced a new relationship with a woman identified as ""DH"" in January 2011. She visited him in custody after he was arrested on 12 May 2011 and charged with the offences described above. On one such visit, he instructed her to return his security pass to his employer and to obtain an external hard drive he had left at work. She did so in June 2011 and stored the hard drive with his other property. Sometime later she accessed the hard drive looking for some of his legal papers and found a disturbing image. The hard drive was provided to police.

 

20The statement of facts and the summary provided in the judge's sentencing remarks are both lengthy and detailed. Suffice to say that the hard drive contained 2801 child abuse pictures and 36 child abuse videos. They included video images of his former stepchildren naked in the bathroom. The other videos were of nudist groups depicting naked children and adults engaged in various activities.

 

21Police used the COPINE scale to categorise the severity of the still images. The majority of them (1592 out of 2801) were in the second lowest level. The others were at the middle to top end of the scale. At the highest level of the scale (10 images) were images of naked children aged from about 6 to 15 bound and in some cases being tortured. For example, one image showed a 12-14 year old girl with ropes binding her ankles, knees and waist with her hands bound above her head while a naked 13 to 15 year old boy held a pistol to the girl's abdomen.

 

22There were 75 images in the next highest category. They included adults engaged in sexual intercourse with children as young as 5. The summary in the statement of facts includes reference to children being in visible pain.

 

23The Form 1 offence was one that was contrary to s 91K(3) and involved the filming of the applicant's 15 year old former stepdaughter naked in the bathroom.

 

Indicative sentence: 6 years with non-parole period 1 year dating from 12 May 2013.

 

The course of proceedings in the District Court

 

24The applicant was arrested on 12 May 2011 and remained in custody thereafter. He was committed to the District Court for trial on 16 November 2011. He came before Bennett DCJ on 27 February 2012 for trial. His counsel indicated that the trial would be ready to begin the following day. At 2.00pm on 28 February, the applicant entered pleas of guilty. At some point in the intervening period, his counsel had taken the opportunity to view the images that were at the core of the prosecution case.

 

25There was then a delay in the proceedings on sentence until 25 October 2012. The main reason for the delay was the further investigation of the material that had been found on the hard drive retrieved from the applicant's work place. He was charged with further offences at some point in August-September 2012. He pleaded guilty and was committed for sentence on 12 September 2012. When he appeared before Bennett DCJ on 25 October, the applicant was arraigned upon the second indictment containing one of the charges and asked that the other charge be taken into account. (It had been placed on a Form 1 document.)

 

26Notwithstanding the differences in the timing of the pleas (most being on the trial date but the latter being found to have been ""at the first opportunity""), the judge allowed a discount for the utilitarian value of them all at ""somewhere between ten and fifteen per cent"". More will be said about this when dealing with the grounds of appeal.

 

The applicant's personal circumstances

 

27The judge noted that the applicant was born in 1969 and had no relevant criminal history.

 

28His Honour recounted some of the content of a letter written by the applicant. It included that in 2009 he had become ""curious in the transition of young girls to womanhood"" and that it was for this reason he had installed a camera in the bathroom to film the children. He said that he knew this was wrong, repulsive and sickening but he ""could not resist the temptation of watching the children blossom to womanhood"". He acknowledged that his activities extended to downloading images of young girls ""at the cusp of womanhood"" and then to ""the ultimate revolting act that can be committed on a child, the act of sexual assault"". He claimed that it was not the sexual act that excited him but the fact that the act itself was being filmed.

 

29The applicant also wrote that he was grateful that the police had stopped him: ""as I truly want to rid myself of the hideous urge to violate children"". He concluded the letter with an apology to the children's mother.

 

30A report by Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, was before the judge. It included an account of the applicant's history, none of which is presently relevant except that he claimed to have been undergoing a degree of stress and anxiety arising from Family Court proceedings with his ex-partner in Victoria. There were custody and access issues and he was the subject of what he claimed were unfounded allegations of sexual misconduct. The judge noted Dr Allnutt's opinion that ""the reasons behind the offending behaviour were the external stressors, including the custody battles with his ex-wife, his knowledge that she was unfaithful to him and depressive symptoms including reduced self-esteem and loss of interest in activities"". His Honour also noted the doctor's opinion that the applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.

 

31Dr Allnutt's report included that aside from some depressive symptoms there were no mental health or drug and alcohol issues that were relevant to the offending.

 

32The judge took into account in the applicant's favour that he had no prior convictions; he was otherwise of good character, albeit that was of limited significance when there were serious offences that were not isolated or spontaneous (ROS 30).

 

33Consideration was given to the question whether there were special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole component. In the end, the judge decided that the usual proportions would provide a sufficient period for supervised release on parole.

 

Aggregate sentencing

 

34This case raises a number of issues about aggregate sentencing and so it is appropriate to say something about the concept generally before turning to more detail about the case and the grounds of appeal.

 

35Provision is made in s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the imposition of an aggregate sentence. It was inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010 (NSW) and came into force on 14 March 2011. The provision applies to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed unless prior to that date the offender was convicted, or a court had accepted a plea of guilty and the plea has not been withdrawn: Sch 2 Pt 21 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

 

36The section provides as follows:

 

53A Aggregate sentences of imprisonment

 

(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.

 

(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a written record of, the following:

 

(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,

 

(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.

 

(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

 

(4) The term, and any non-parole period, set under this Division in relation to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not revoked or varied by a later sentence of imprisonment that the same or some other court subsequently imposes in relation to another offence.

 

(5) An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.

 

37Section 44 provides (in sub-s (2C)) that there is no need to indicate the non-parole period that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed unless it is required by s 54B.

 

38Section 54B provides, in part, that in determining an aggregate sentence, the court is to make a written record of the non-parole period it would have set for each offence to which a standard non-parole period applies (s 54B(4)). Reasons must also be provided by way of a written record why the court would have set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period (s 54B(5)). An offence to which the standard non-parole period applies is one that is listed in the Table in Pt 4 Div 4 and is in the middle of the range of seriousness when assessed by taking into account only the objective factors affecting its relative seriousness (s 54A(2)). It should be noted, however, that the court is not required to identify the extent to which the seriousness of the offence differs from ""an offence to which the standard non-parole period is referable"" (s 54B(6)).

 

39A number of propositions emerge from the above legislative provisions and the cases that have considered aggregate sentencing:

 

1. Section 53A was introduced in order to ameliorate the difficulties of applying the decision in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 in sentencing for multiple offences: R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [31]. It offers the benefit when sentencing for multiple offences of obviating the need to engage in the laborious and sometimes complicated task of creating a ""cascading or 'stairway' sentencing structure"" when the principle of totality requires some accumulation of sentences: R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [43]; Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [231]; Behman v R [2014] NSWCCA 239; R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 at [55]-[57].

 

2. When imposing an aggregate sentence a court is required to indicate to the offender and make a written record of the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed and also indicate the sentences that would have been imposed if separate sentences had been imposed instead (the indicative sentences): s 53A(2). The indicative sentences themselves should not be expressed as a separate sentencing order: R v Clarke [2013] NSWCCA 260 at [50]-[52]. See also Cullen v R [2014] NSWCCA 162 at [25]-[40].

 

3. The indicative sentences must be assessed by taking into account such matters in Part 3 or elsewhere in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as are relevant: s 53A(2)(b).

 

There is no need to list such matters exhaustively, but commonly encountered ones in Part 3 include aggravating, mitigating and other factors (s 21A); reductions for guilty pleas, facilitation of the administration of justice and assistance to law enforcement authorities (ss 22, 22A and 23); and offences on a Form1 taken into account (Pt 3 Div 3). Commonly encountered matters elsewhere in the Act are the purposes of sentencing in s 3A, and the requirements of s 5 as to not imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless a court is satisfied that there is no alternative and giving a further explanation for the imposition of any sentence of 6 months or less.

 

SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 is an example of a case where a sentencing judge took pleas of guilty into account only in relation to the aggregate sentence, and not in relation to the indicative sentence. This was held (at [35]-[43]) to be in breach of the requirement in s 53A(2)(b). Khawaja v R [2014] NSWCCA 80 is another example. Martin v R [2014] NSWCCA 124 is a case in which a sentencing judge was held (at [17]) to have correctly taken into account pleas of guilty in relation to the indicative sentences.

 

In JL v R [2014] NSWCCA 130 at [54] it was said by way of conclusion in an appeal against the asserted severity of a sentence that ""The starting point for the aggregate sentence of 24 years before the allowance of a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the early pleas of guilty was not excessive"". This must be understood as a broad assessment within the conclusion rather than indicating that it is the aggregate sentence to which the discount should be applied. Stoeski v R [2014] NSWCCA 161 is anomalous in that at [33]-[34] it rejected a complaint that the sentencing judge had not discounted the aggregate sentence for the plea of guilty rather than rejecting the assertion that the discount applied to the aggregate sentence at all.

 

4. It is still necessary in assessing the indicative sentences to have regard to the requirements of Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. The criminality involved in each offence needs to be assessed individually. To adopt an approach of making a ""blanket assessment"" by simply indicating the same sentence for a number of offences is erroneous: R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17], [26]; Nykolyn v R, supra, at [32]; [56]-[57]; Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 159 at [27]-[29]; SHR v R, supra, at [40]; R v Lolesio [2014] NSWCCA 219 at [88]-[89]. It has been said that s 53A(2) is ""clearly directed to ensuring transparency in the process of imposing an aggregate sentence and in that connection, imposing a discipline on sentencing judges"": Khawaja v R, supra, at [18].

 

5. The imposition of an aggregate sentence is not to be used to minimise the offending conduct, or obscure or obliterate the range of offending conduct or its totality: R v MJB, supra, at [58]-[60].

 

6. One reason why it is important to assess individually the indicative sentences is that it assists in the application of the principle of totality. Another is that it allows victims of crime and the public at large to understand the level of seriousness with which a court has regarded an individual offence: Nykolyn v R, supra, at [58]; Subramaniam v R, supra, at [28]. A further advantage is that it assists when questions of parity of sentencing as between co-offenders arise: R v Clarke, supra, at [68], [75].

 

7. Non-parole periods need not be specified in relation to indicative sentences except if they relate to an offence for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed: ss 44(2C) and s 54B(4); AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 31 at [9].

 

8. Specification of commencement dates for indicative sentences is unnecessary and is contrary to the benefits conferred by the aggregate sentencing provisions: AB v R, supra, at [10]. Doing so defeats the purpose of a court availing itself of the power to impose an aggregate sentence: Behman v R [2014] NSWCCA 239 at [26]. See also Cullen v R, supra, at [25]-[26].

 

9. If a non-custodial sentence is appropriate for an offence that is the subject of the multiple offence sentencing task, it should be separately imposed as was done in Grealish v R [2013] NSWCCA 336. In my respectful view, there was error involved in Behman v R [2014] NSWCCA 239 where an offence with an indicative, but unspecified, non-custodial sentence was included in an aggregate sentence imposed by this Court. The provision for imposing an aggregate sentence in s 53A appears within Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which is headed ""Sentencing procedures for imprisonment"", and within Division 1 of that Part which is headed ""Setting terms of imprisonment"".

 

40The following further propositions emerge from the cases in relation to appellate review of aggregate sentencing exercises:

 

10. Another benefit of the aggregate sentencing provision is that it makes it easier on appeal to impose a new aggregate sentence if one of the underlying convictions needs to be quashed: R v Brown, supra, at [51]; FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182; 224 A Crim R 82 at [327]-[329]; Nykolyn v R, supra, at [58]-[59]; Subramaniam v R at [28].

 

11. The indicative sentences recorded in accordance with s 53A(2) are not themselves amenable to appeal, although they may be a guide to whether error is established in relation to the aggregate sentence: R v Brown, supra, at [17]; Nykolyn v R, supra, at [58]; PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44]; R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [32]-[33], [42]-[43]; Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen, supra, at [218], [227]; Subramaniam v R, supra, at [28]; SHR v R, supra, at [40]; R v Clarke, supra, at [56]; Martin v R [2014] NSWCCA 124 at [47]; JL v R [2014] NSWCCA 130 at [17]; Stoeski v R, supra, at [43]; CL v R [2014] NSWCCA 196 at [53]-[55].

 

12. Even if the indicative sentences are assessed as being excessive, that does not necessarily mean that the aggregate sentence is excessive: PD v R at [44],[82]; BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123 at [252]-[254].

 

13. A principle focus of determination of a ground alleging manifest inadequacy or excess will be whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved: R v Brown, supra, at [37]; R v Rae, supra, at [42]-[46], [62], [69]. This Court is not in a position to analyse issues of concurrence and accumulation in the same way that it can analyse traditional sentencing structures: Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen, supra, at [231]; Martin v R, supra, at [33]-[41].

 

14. Erroneous specification by a sentencing judge of commencement dates for indicative sentences (such as there being gaps between the expiry of some indicative sentences and the commencement of subsequent sentences) are immaterial and may be ignored as being otiose: AB v R, supra, at [10], [67].

 

15. A failure of a judge to specify a non-parole period in the indicative sentence for a standard non-parole period offence will not lead to an appeal being upheld. Failure to do so does not invalidate the sentence: s 54B(7). Setting non-parole periods for the indicative sentences for standard non-parole period offences would have no effect upon the aggregate sentence imposed: Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen, supra, at [214]-[218].

 

Grounds of appeal

 

41The applicant filed a document headed ""Grounds of Appeal"" which set out six numbered grounds of appeal and what appeared to be a complaint about his former legal representatives. However, he confirmed at the hearing of the appeal that the latter was intended as a ground of appeal as well. It was expressed as follows:

 

It is alleged that defence counsel and the appellant's legal representatives breached the legal Professionals Act by not taking their clients instructions. The appellant seeks to present further evidence in support of this appeal.

 

42The applicant sought to make three points:

 

1. Counsel and her instructing solicitor did not take ""explicit instructions"" from the applicant during the course of the sentencing proceedings. In particular, counsel ignored his instructions to challenge the victim impact statement, ""along with other instructions"".

 

2. The solicitors ""waived the applicant's rights to a committal hearing""; meaning that he wanted to plead guilty in the Local Court and be committed for sentence but was denied the opportunity to obtain the benefit of doing so.

 

3. Fresh evidence would be led on the hearing of the application arising from the incompetence of counsel and his solicitors.

 

No challenge to victim impact statement

 

43The applicant has not made good any assertion that the sentencing proceedings miscarried because of a failure of his legal representatives to ""challenge"" the victim impact statement made by the mother of the complainants on their behalf. The judge referred to the content of this statement (at some length) but concluded that it did not describe harm caused to either complainant that was more than would ordinarily be encountered in relation to such offences. He concluded, ""I am unable to find that the behaviour described reflects substantial psychological harm from these crimes such as to extend to be an aggravating factor"" (ROS 25). So, the victim impact statement was not taken into account in a way that was detrimental to the applicant. He has no cause for complaint.

 

Lost opportunity to enter pleas of guilty in the Local Court

 

44The applicant said that he had spoken to his solicitors whilst proceedings were still in the Local Court and indicated that he wanted to plead guilty. Contrary to his wishes, however, he was committed for trial.

 

45The applicant provided documents relating to a complaint he had made to the Legal Services Commissioner about this issue. But they did not assist his cause because they simply showed that the Commissioner had investigated and had dismissed the allegation.

 

46A further matter standing in the applicant's way in relation to this issue was that after the proceedings were committed to the District Court he elected to be tried by judge-alone. It is untenable to suggest that he would have made such an election, after having received advice from his lawyers, if he wanted to plead guilty.

 

Incompetence of legal representatives

 

47General assertions were made by the applicant about what he described as the incompetence of his counsel and solicitors. Nothing specific was raised that had any relevance to the conduct of the sentence proceedings or conceivable bearing upon the sentence imposed.

 

Conclusion

 

48I would reject this unnumbered ground.

 

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred by reducing the discount for the sequence two offences below twenty five per cent.

 

49This ground is concerned with the two charges the subject of the committal for sentence in September 2012 which came to be set out in the second indictment and accompanying Form 1. The judge discussed, at length, the procedural history that I have set out earlier. He concluded:

 

""The offences across the spectrum are serious. The misconduct, upon which this offender engaged, taking his sexual pleasure at the expense of small children, is so serious that there is a need to provide adequate protection to the community. This impacts upon the extent to which he is entitled to a discount in respect of the further offence upon which sentence is to be imposed, taking into account the additional offence which, to his advantage, has been placed on a Form 1. Accordingly the discount to be applied to the sentence to be imposed in respect of that offence will not extend to twenty-five per cent. It will sit somewhere between ten and fifteen per cent.""

 

50The judge appears to have overlooked what he had said during the proceedings on sentence:

 

""HIS HONOUR: Just before we go to that, just in terms of utility, it would seem to me that his discount in respect of all matters but for the most recent, is compromised to somewhere below the 25% mark.

 

[CROWN]: That's so your Honour.

 

HIS HONOUR: In respect of this most recent matter that's on a further indictment that he would--

 

[CROWN]: Receive the full discount your Honour.

 

HIS HONOUR: Yes.""

 

51It would seem that the judge had regard to the criminality involved in all of the other offences in assessing the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty to the offence on the second indictment. Where there are multiple offences and pleas at different times, the utilitarian value of the plea should be separately considered for each: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [32] citing R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291, presumably at [86]. There was significant utilitarian value in the applicant's very early acknowledgment of his guilt of the second indictment offence (and the offence on the Form 1), given that it came very soon after he was charged.

 

52I also do not understand the reference to the protection of the community in this context. Sometimes there will be an offence in relation to which community protection will weigh against affording an offender what might otherwise have been allowed by way of reduction because of a plea of guilty. But this was not such an extreme or unusual case: cf Milat v R; Klein v R [2014] NSWCCA 29 at [69]-[92].

 

53The judge also referred to ""the additional offence which, to his advantage, has been placed on a Form 1"" (emphasis added). He had earlier quoted all of the ""principles of general application"" on this subject set out by Howie J in R v Borkowski at [32], the ninth of which was:

 

""The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage, such as having matters put on a Form 1."" (Citation of authority omitted)

 

54If the judge intended by the reference to the placing of the additional offence on the Form 1 being to the applicant's advantage as somehow eroding the utilitarian value, he had overlooked the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty to that offence in the Local Court. There was no delay resulting from a plea bargain that lessened the utilitarian value.

 

55There is no rule or entitlement about the extent by which a sentence should be reduced on account of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. But there is a usual practice that early pleas of guilty are rewarded with something at or close to the top of the range suggested in the guideline judgment of R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. There is also an expectation that if a judge is minded to take a different approach in a particular case there will be an explanation for doing so. In this case, the explanation is, with respect, erroneous.

 

56I would uphold the applicant's complaint in relation to this issue. However, the applicant must be taken to be seeking leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence, not against the indicative sentences.

 

57Not ""all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion"": Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [42]. The total of the indicative sentences is a period of 59 years. If the judge had indicated a sentence for the latter with the full discount of 25 per cent instead of ""somewhere between ten and fifteen percent (say 12.5 per cent), the total would be one of (in round figures) 58 years. In the application of the principle of totality, it is inconceivable that the aggregate sentence would have been any different if a correct approach had been taken in assessing the value of the applicant's plea to the second indictment offence.

 

58I would not uphold this ground.

 

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred by failing to state precisely the amount of the discount he gave for the sequence one offences

 

59By ""the sequence one offences"", the applicant was referring to the offences on the first indictment containing eight counts.

 

60The judge assessed the discount to be allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas to these offences thus:

 

""There was delay in the pleas of guilty to the charges upon which the offender was ultimately arraigned. That does not allow for a discount beyond somewhere between ten per cent and fifteen per cent of what would otherwise be appropriate sentences for those offences. The offender was listed for trial before me, and a jury to be selected in the Court at Goulburn. His position did not change until his counsel, with the benefit of having viewed the abhorrent material that would have been presented in the Crown case, had further opportunity to consult with him, whereupon he wisely took her advice and chose a difference course.""

 

61The judge did not have to quantify the extent to which he was allowing a discount with absolute precision: Ayache v R [2013] NSWCCA 41 at [14]-[18]. The applicant's counsel accepted the judge's indication during the proceedings on sentence that the discount for these offences would be between 10 and 15 per cent (POS 17-18).

 

62In any event, the applicant can have no legitimate complaint about not receiving a discount of any more than 10 per cent, given that the pleas were entered the day after the day fixed for his trial.

 

63There is no merit in this ground.

 

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in staggering the accumulation of the sentences to largely increase the non-parole period and the head sentence

 

64The applicant submitted that all of the offences arose out of the one criminal enterprise in that they were linked in time and place. Accordingly, the sentences should have been concurrent or, at worst, partially accumulated to a small degree.

 

65Other submissions made by the applicant were concerned with the actual degree of accumulation of the sentences that were apparent from the commencement dates (unnecessarily) specified by the judge in respect of the indicative sentences. Those submissions may be put to one side.

 

66The real issue is whether the applicant has demonstrated that the aggregate sentence imposed is excessive having regard to the totality of criminality inherent in the various offences together with any necessary increment where Form 1 offences were required to be taken into account. That matter falls for assessment under the final ground.

 

67Ground 3 must be rejected.

 

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred in increasing the overall sentence in respect of sequence 2 in order to achieve an appropriate ratio between the non-parole and head sentence

 

68This is another ground that arises only because of the unnecessary specification by the judge of commencement dates for the indicative sentences.

 

69In determining whether the applicant can demonstrate that the aggregate sentence is excessive, it may be of some utility to examine the length of the indicative sentences. Accordingly, the complaint raised under this ground is also one that falls for consideration under the final ground.

 

70Ground 4 fails.

 

Ground 5 - The sentencing judge erred in declining to take into account that the offender would be likely to serve most of his sentence in protective custody

 

71The submissions for the applicant cited authorities on the subject of protective custody (for example, R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 148 and later cases that refer to it) that predate current jurisprudence. It used to be thought that serving a sentence in protective custody always warranted some reduction in sentence. However, in Clinton v R [2009] NSWCCA 276, Howie J said:

 

[24] ... decisions about the significance of protective custody given before R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299; 58 NSWLR 581 should be read in the light of that decision and the different approach that was there taken to the relevance of the fact that a person was in protective custody. The change to the approach previously taken was as a result of information provided to the Court that revealed that protection did not necessarily result in harsher prison conditions. The change in approach was continued in R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304, was approved in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [177] and has been applied to cases where assistance has been given to authorities: R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92.

 

72The applicant's general proposition that service of his sentence in protective custody warranted a lesser sentence must be rejected.

 

73The applicant went further and sought to rely upon evidence of the following matters:

 

1. He has not been able to continue tertiary studies in law.

 

2. He has been denied access to computers and to print legal documents.

 

3. His application to work in the laundry or in textiles, in preference to working on ground maintenance has been denied.

 

4. He cannot see his children and other family members because they live interstate.

 

74The first matter arose, inter alia, because of the need for Corrective Services to prioritise the provision of educational opportunities to inmates based on need. The second matter is inconsistent with the voluminous word-processed and printed documents placed before the Court for the purpose of this application. The third matter is trivial. The fourth matter is simply a happenstance. And none of the matters has anything to do with the applicant being in protective custody.

 

75There is no merit in this ground.

 

Ground 6 - The sentences and the totality of the sentence are manifestly excessive. In determining the sentences to be imposed, the sentencing judge made the following errors:

 

(i) The sentencing judge erred in failing to determine the level of objective criminality in the offences.

 

(ii) The sentencing judge erred in treating the applicant's previous good character as irrelevant.

 

(iii) The sentencing term imposed for the individual offences are manifestly excessive as the starting point is too high and insufficient regard was had to all relevant and mitigating factors.

 

(iv) The overall sentence is manifestly excessive.

 

(i) Failing to determine the level of objective criminality

 

76As to 6(i), the sentencing judge did make findings as to the objective seriousness of the offences. In relation to the most serious offence (Count 1), the judge said that he had viewed the video recording. He gave an oral description of what it showed which does not bear repeating except in one respect:

 

""The summary of facts does not include features of the child's responses to the offender. There was no sign of resistance from her. She was completely compliant and there did not appear to be any instruction given to her. She was responsive to the offender in her position on the bed as he came to her in the first sequence and as he lifted her on top of him and continued with her face proximate to his penis, which he masturbated to the point of ejaculation. This I infer from his use of the towel to wipe his penis. When he finished with the child she sat of the bed and put about her a robe partially covering her young body as the offender kissed her lips, to which she responded. It is my perception that she contemporaneously kissed him in return. Her responsive presentation was as a mature woman in an act of consensual love making with further affection after the coupling. She was as if an adult as she placed the robe about herself and responded to his kiss.

 

To see a child of such tender years behave so with this man leaves me with no conclusion other than that her relationship with her father had been sexualised to the point where she was a responsive participant in this sexual encounter. It is of course not possible to say how the offender groomed her to this point, or over what time, or the number of occasions that might have preceded this. I am satisfied beyond any doubt however that this was not an aberrant or isolated event with this child.

 

I have not put aside the submission of counsel that I should not allow the images presented to the Court, as offensive as they are to accepted standards of decency, to enlarge the objective seriousness of this offence. I have taken care to avoid that error, I believe. Moreover, I do not intend to punish the offender for conduct for which there is no charge before this Court or increase the punishment for these offences because of the certainty that his crimes against this child preceded this event. However, it is appropriate not to overlook that the misconduct charged was not an aberrant or isolated episode in an otherwise healthy and appropriate relationship between a father and his two year old daughter when assessing the gravity of this crime."" (ROS 14-15)

 

77The applicant claimed that the offence was at a lower level of seriousness because of the nature of the activity and because there was an absence of threats or pressure to secure the complainant's compliance or to ensure her subsequent silence. He also relied upon the absence of evidence of physical injuries.

 

78The applicant also referred to other cases decided in this Court in support of his claim that the objective seriousness of the offences were at a lower level. Most of the cases concerned victims who were aged between 6 and 9; one case involved a victim aged 4. The sexual activity and the relationship between the offender and the victim varied widely. They do not, in my view, support a submission that the assessment of seriousness in the present case was not one that was open to be made.

 

79Towards the end of his remarks on sentence the judge said this about the objective seriousness of the offences:

 

""These offences overall must in combination be viewed as of the utmost seriousness. Children are entitled to be protected from sexual predators such as this man. The most serious of the offences of course is the first count in the indictment, the allegation of sexual intercourse with KM. The significance of that misconduct is reflected in the maximum penalty specified, imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of fifteen years. As serious as this offence is, it is not a worst case example. I have not overlooked that the child was two years of age at the time and I have not overlooked that the commission of that offence included not only sexual gratification but also the production of child abuse material in its execution. There is no evidence before me of any physical injuries suffered by KM and no evidence of any penetration beyond that which might have occurred in the performance of the cunnilingus. It is, in my judgment, an [offence] that falls at or perhaps slightly above the middle range of objective seriousness. So too with regard to the other offence for which there is a standard non-parole period specified."" (ROS 31)

 

80I consider that it was well open to the judge to find that the applicant's sexual assault of his two-year-old daughter was ""at or perhaps slightly above the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". The matters to which the applicant directed attention might possibly have called for an assessment at a lower level if the child was significantly older. The abuse of a two-year-old child by a father in the context of the relationship having been ""sexualised"" as the judge found renders such matters of little significance.

 

(ii) Treating previous good character as irrelevant

 

81The sentencing judge said the following about the applicant's otherwise good character:

 

""He has the benefit of not having any prior convictions relevant to the matter. There is no material to suggest that outside of this offending he is a person of otherwise poor character, but in any event, that is of limited significance in this case. Indeed, in this regard exploitation of the opportunity presented is a matter to be brought to account. A significance of good character such as one find is ameliorated by the serious nature of the offences, which were not isolated or spontaneous."" (ROS 30)

 

82The applicant referred to Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 where McHugh J explained the significance in sentencing of an offender's prior good character (at [23],[25]):

 

""It is necessary to distinguish between the two logically distinct stages concerning the use of character in the sentencing process. First, it is necessary to determine whether the offender is of otherwise good character. When considering this issue, the sentencing judge must not consider the offences for which the prisoner is being sentenced. Because that is so, many sentencing judges refer to the offender's ""previous"" or ""otherwise"" good character.

 

...

 

Second, if the offender is of otherwise good character, it is necessary to determine the weight that must be given to that mitigating factor. If an offender is of otherwise good character, then the sentencing judge is bound to take that into account in the sentence that he or she imposes. The weight that must be given to the prisoner's otherwise good character will vary according to all of the circumstances.""

 

83The approach taken by the sentencing judge was precisely that of which McHugh J spoke. His Honour made the finding that the applicant was of otherwise good character. He then gave it the weight he thought it deserved in the circumstances of the case. This was a matter within the exercise of his discretion. He was not compelled to find that good character should be given ""significant weight"" as the applicant asserts.

 

84The applicant also challenged the judge's finding in this context that the offences ""were not isolated or spontaneous"". He referred specifically to the judge's observations about the reactions of the applicant's two-year-old daughter that I have quoted above (at [76]). Those observations were made in the light of the judge having viewed the recording of the incident. It has not been established that they were not open to be made. Generally, it was also open to the judge to find that the offences were not isolated or spontaneous. To set about filming children and to amass a collection of child abuse material cannot be regarded as conduct that occurred spontaneously. Further, in the context of the range of offending, none of the offences were isolated aberrations of conduct.

 

(iii) The individual sentences are manifestly excessive and did not give sufficient weight to mitigating factors

 

85There is no utility in determining this sub-ground. The appeal is against the aggregate sentence. The applicant's contentions should be considered in that context.

 

(iv) The overall sentence is manifestly excessive

 

86The applicant asserted that a survey of other cases as well as sentencing statistics demonstrated that the indicative sentence for the s 66A offence concerning his two-year-old daughter was excessive. The submissions failed to address the fact that there were additional offences that he asked the judge to take into account when assessing the sentence for that offence.

 

87It was contended that the implicit starting points for indicative sentences relating to the offences of using a child under the age of 14 to make child abuse material (counts 2, 4 and 6) were consistent with a finding that they were each ""well above the middle of the range"" of objective seriousness. He submitted that such an assessment was not warranted. The same submission was made in respect of the offence of filming a person under the age of 16 in a private act (count 3). It was contended that there should have been a finding that it was ""in the lower range of objective seriousness"" because it did not involve filming a person engaged in a sexual act; the child was showering in the bathroom.

 

88The offences of aggravated indecent assault of a person under 16 (counts 5 and 7) were also said to involve implicit starting points for the indicative sentences that indicated an erroneous assessment of objective serious ""in the high range"". The submissions referred to the maximum penalty for these offences being 10 years but no reference was made to the existence of a standard non-parole period of 8 years. It was asserted that sentencing statistics (presumably those maintained by the Judicial Commission) show a sentencing range for this offence of between 2 and 4 years, whereas the sentences indicated for these counts were each 6 years. (In fact, the current iteration of the Judicial Commission's statistics for offences against s 61M(2) (as at October 2014 for offences committed January 2009 to March 2014) shows that 80 per cent of sentences fell within a range of 2 years to 6 years.) The applicant also cited three cases in which lesser sentences had been imposed for this type of offence.

 

89In relation to offences of possessing child abuse material it was submitted that for count 8 of the first indictment the material comprised 14 images of a ""nudist colony"". That is not correct. The facts in relation to count 8 indicated that it related to 14 images of naked female children, some under the age of 10, with their vaginas exposed. It was also submitted that the offence in count 8 and that which comprised the sole count in the second indictment occurred at the same time, had features in common, and formed part of the one criminal enterprise and so should have resulted in concurrent sentences. That, of course, relies upon the unnecessary specification by the judge of commencement dates for indicative sentences. It is a submission, however, that is relevant to whether the aggregate sentence resulted from an erroneous application of the principle of totality.

 

90A submission expressed as being ""in the alternative"" was that the implicit starting point for the indicative sentence for count 8 indicates that, although unstated, there must have been an assessment of that offence as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Given the number and nature of the images, it should have been an assessment of ""low range"". The implicit starting point for the offence in the second indictment indicates that, although unstated, there must have been an assessment of it being in the ""high range of objective seriousness"". Statistics and reference to other cases were said to support the proposition that the indicative sentences for these offences were excessive.

 

91A further submission in relation to the sentence for the offence in the second indictment was that the judge must have impermissibly extended the parole period so as to provide for a sufficient period of parole in the aggregate sentence. That, of course, relies upon the unnecessary specification by the judge of a commencement date and a non-parole period for an indicative sentence.

 

92Submissions directed to the aggregate sentence included that there was an implicit starting point of 20 to 21 years before allowance for the pleas of guilty. The submission ignores the fact that discounts must be directly applied to the assessment of indicative sentences, with care taken to ensure that in assessing the aggregate sentence there is no erosion of the benefit.

 

93It was also submitted that the judge failed to give appropriate weight to the asserted fact that the injury and emotional harm caused by the s 66A offence in count 1 was not substantial. The applicant relied upon the judge's finding that he could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that it was substantial. That does not necessarily support a finding on the balance of probability that such harm was not substantial.

 

94Another submission was that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's lack of any significant record of previous convictions. However, the judge specifically noted this and I would not infer that he gave it less weight than it deserved. It was the allied factor of prior good character that he found to be of reduced significance.

 

95An argument was advanced that there should have been a finding of special circumstances on the basis of the applicant's lack of previous convictions. But the judge specifically addressed the issue of special circumstances and found that the parole period within the aggregate sentence would be sufficient to assist the applicant's reintegration into the community. That was a discretionary conclusion that was open to him.

 

96It was submitted that there should have been findings of good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of reoffending. However, the evidence comprised the following somewhat guarded assessment of Dr Allnutt:

 

""He presents as an individual who has reasonable prospects for rehabilitation in that he has cognitive ability and is motivated to pursue treatment; at this stage however I believe his insight is limited but he presents as an individual who could develop insight in the context of a rehabilitation program.""

 

97On this basis, findings in the applicant's favour were not mandated. In any event, the opinions expressed by Dr Allnutt were undoubtedly based upon the history provided. The judge rejected the explanations the applicant gave to the doctor for having committed the offences.

 

98Finally it was submitted that the judge had failed to have regard to the principle of totality in his assessment of the aggregate sentence: ""it appears in this case the sentencing judge simply added up the sentences and passed sentence which the arithmetic produced"". The problem with that assertion is that if his Honour had proceeded in that fashion the aggregate sentence would have been one of 59 years.

 

99The applicant then sought to draw comparisons with other cases involving multiple child sexual assault offences, some including child pornography offences. The wide variety of circumstances of such multiple offending render such comparisons of no utility.

 

100Other submissions made in support of this sub-ground were repetitious of those made in the context of other grounds and need not be repeated.

 

Conclusion

 

101The endeavour to draw comparisons with statistics and other cases carries the applicant's argument nowhere. The circumstances of cases such as these vary widely and call for individual discernment with the application of general sentencing principles.

 

102I am of the view that the sentencing judge's assessment of the first offence (the offence against s 66A) that the objective seriousness was at or slightly above the middle of the range of objective seriousness was well open to him and cannot be impugned. Having regard to the statutory guideposts of a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years, the indicative sentence of 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years was also an assessment that was well open to him.

 

103In addition to that offence there was a wide range of serious criminal conduct involving multiple victims (including in relation to the child abuse material offences a great many unknown victims) to be factored into the assessment of the aggregate sentence. For all of that additional criminality the applicant received a sentence that is but 5 years longer than that which was assessed for the first offence. It is clear that this was a result of the judge applying the principle of totality.

 

104In my view, the aggregate sentence was an appropriate reflection of the applicant's diverse and serious criminal conduct. To impose anything less would be to put at risk the longstanding policy of the courts of treating sexual offences committed against young children as being of the utmost seriousness: see, for example, R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445; R v Evans (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 24 March 1988, unrep); R v ABS [2005] NSWCCA 255 at [26]. Sheller JA observed in R v BJW [2000] NSWCCA 60 ; 112 A Crim R 1 at [20]:

 

""The maximum penalties the legislature has set for such offences reflect community abhorrence of and concern about adult sexual abuse of children. General deterrence is of great importance in sentencing such offenders and especially so when the offender is in a position of trust to the victim. See the remarks of Kirby ACJ in R v Skinner (1994) 72 A Crim R 151 at 154. In R v Hudson (unreported) CCA, 30 July 1998 at 3 Sully and Ireland JJ with whom Spigelman CJ agreed, said:

 

'Recognition is also given to the fact that children in a family situation are virtually helpless against sexual attack by the male parent and that children have a right to be protected from sexual molestation within the family and that this can only be achieved by the courts imposing sentences of a salutary nature.'""

 

105It is unfortunate that the sentencing judge took such a detailed yet unnecessary approach to the specification of the indicative sentences and delivered quite discursive sentencing remarks. It has given rise to a number of arguments advanced by the applicant, many of which are irrelevant to the critical issue of whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive. In the end it is my view that the aggregate sentence was within the legitimate exercise of the judge's sentencing discretion.

 

Orders

 

106I propose the following orders:

 

1. Leave to appeal granted.

 

2. Appeal dismissed.

 

107ADAMSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2704134,BEM v Victims Compensation Fund Corporation [2014] NSWCATAD 208,"reasons for decision

1BEM claims statutory compensation by way of an application lodged in March 2011, in which he alleged that he had suffered various compensable injuries as the result of an assault by an acquaintance at Bellambi in the State of New South Wales on 22 May 2009. 

2I note that BEM was represented by Hansons Solicitors before the compensation assessor and continues to be represented for his subsequent appeal. 

3On 15 March 2011 BEM submitted the Application to the Victims Compensation Tribunal (""the Tribunal""). I note that the application was lodged within the statutory period required by section 26 of the old Act. 

4During the period May 2011 to September 2012 BEM's Solicitors provided a range of medical and other material to the Tribunal which addressed both act of violence and compensable injuries. 

5In the interim BEM applied for an interim award under section 33 of the old Act. However as the compensation assessor was unable to make a finding at that stage that BEM would receive an award of statutory compensation when the matter was finally determined, they declined to make an interim award having regards to section 33 (2) of the old Act.

6On 1 June 2012 the Tribunal advised BEMs Solicitor that the matter was listed for determination at the first available opportunity on or after the month of September 2012. In that letter BEM's Solicitor was reminded of the need to ensure that all relevant evidence to establish the claimed compensable injuries must be received prior to the listing date.

7On 6 May 2013, the Compensation Assessor determined that BEM was not entitled to compensation and issued a Notice of Determination under section 29 of the old Act. The Assessor found that BEM was not the victim of an act of violence. The Notice of Determination, which was (inter-alia) in the following terms, advised:

... I have carefully considered all the material on this file. The applicant has submitted that he was the victim of an unprovoked physical assault, where he was head butted and sustained physical injuries.

(BEM) reported the incident to police without delay. The police interviewed the alleged offender of 16 July 2009. The alleged offender admitted to borrowing the applicant's phone, for the purpose of using the light of the phone to locate $50 that he had dropped on the ground. The alleged offender informed police that the applicant had struck him with [sic] to the head with a beer bottle and grabbed him, after which time the offender admitted to head butting the applicant in self-defence. 

The police subsequently obtained a sworn statement from the alleged offender's girlfriend, who had witnessed the incident. She declared that she had seen the applicant throw a beer bottle at the alleged offender's head, and then throw a number of punches.

The police contacted the two other people who had witnessed the incident however they both declined to provide police statements. The police investigation was then suspended as there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. The police noted that the applicant had provided two statements with fairly significant discrepancies. 

Having taken all of the material into account, I am not satisfied that the incident occurred in the course of a criminal offence as required by section 5 (1) (a). This finding is based on the fact that there is evidence to support the offender's claim that he was acting in self- defence when he head butted (BEM).

I have taken the applicant's statutory declaration into account. The applicant stated that two people had verified his version of events to police, and that the detective had told (BEM) that he believed his version of the incident. Unfortunately this is not supported by the police commentary within the COPS report, or the follow up reports on file. As a result the evidence before me is not capable of supporting the applicant's version on the balance of probabilities.

Given that a third party supports the offender's version, and noting the fact that (BEM) provided two conflicting versions to police; I am not satisfied that the applicant was the victim of an act of violence as defined in Section 5 of the Act. While I note that the applicant gave consistent disclosures of the incident to ambulance and hospital staff, this fact alone is not sufficient to establish an act of violence given the weight of the other evidence on file. 

The compensation assessor then made a finding that as an act of violence is not established the application must be dismissed. 

Application of the old Act

8On 7/05/2013 the New South Wales Government introduced legislation that changed the form of support provided to victims of violent crime in New South Wales. The Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 (""the old Act"") was repealed and replaced by the Victims Rights and Support Act 2013 (""the new Act""). The legislation came into force on 4 June 2013 and the Tribunal was then abolished and, by operation of Clause 14 of Schedule 2 of the new Act, appeals to it were taken to have been commenced before the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (""ADT""). 

Grounds of Appeal

9BEM's Solicitor wrote to the Director Victims Services on 2 August 2013 seeking an 'Internal Review'. It is clear from the correspondence that the Solicitors were seeking to have the matter considered under the provisions of the Victims Rights and Support Act 2013 (the new Act). At page 2 of the Internal Review application BEM's Solicitors submit that their client would be entitled to a Category C recognition payment for grievous bodily harm in addition to payment of his expenses. The references relate to section 36 (1) (d) of the new Act, and clause 12 (c ) of the Victims Rights and Support Regulation 2013 (the Regulation).

10However, on 16/08/2013, Clause 16 of the Victims Rights and Support Regulation 2013 (""the Regulation"") commenced operation. This provided that despite the repeal of section 36 of the repealed Act, if a notice of determination of a compensation assessor was served before the repeal and an appeal could have been duly made in accordance with section 36 (3) (a) if it were still in force, an appeal may be made after 3 June 2013 as if section 36 (other than section 36 (2) and (3) (b) ) were still in force.

11It appears that the matter was considered by the newly created Commissioner for Victims Rights as a request for an Internal Review under the provisions of the new Act. Correspondence dated 5 August 2013 issued by the Commissioner outlines the future conduct of the Internal Review. On 22 August 2013 the Commissioner issued a listing notice indicating that the review would be considered in the latter half of September 2013. 

12There is no meaningful information on file to explain what transpired between 22 August 2013 and 8 January 2013. It may be that a Senior Assessor identified jurisdictional issues. I make this observation for a number of reasons:


The matter was finally determined by a compensation assessor prior to the repeal date of the old Act. 
The Notice of Determination was served prior to the repeal date of the old Act. 
The matter is not one which meets the terms of Clause 5 (1) of the new Act, in that it is not 'an application for statutory compensation that was lodged but not finally determined under the repealed Act before the introduction day, ... (emphasis added) 
Under clause 5 of Schedule 1 of the new Act, the matter cannot be dealt with under the new Act as though it were an application for Victims Support. 
Section 49 (1) of the new Act only provides for an Internal Review of victims support decisions. (emphasis added). 

13In any event on 8 January 2014 the Commissioner of Victims rights wrote to both BEM's Solicitor and the newly created NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT), in effect 'transferring' the matter to NCAT which had jurisdiction to deal with appeals under the old Act. 

14Initially such appeals were sent to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (ADT) pending the repeal of the old Act. It appears because there was no record of a Notice of Appeal on the papers transferred to the Tribunal, that this did not occur. (see paragraph 9 above). Clause 16 of the Victims Rights and Support Regulation 2013 provides that transitional appeals are dealt with under the relevant provisions of the old Act (notwithstanding its repeal). See paragraph 10 above. 

15The ADT was abolished from the date of commencement of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 No 2 on 1 January 2014 and Clause 7(1) of Schedule 1 Savings, transitional and other proceedings, provides: 
All unheard proceedings in an existing tribunal are taken, on and from the establishment day, to have been duly commenced in NCAT and may be heard and determined instead by NCAT.

16Further, Clause 7(3) provides:
For the purposes of subclauses (1) and (2):
(a) NCAT has and may exercise all the functions that the relevant existing tribunal had immediately before its abolition, and

(b) the provisions of any Act, statutory rule or other law that would have applied to or in respect of the proceedings had this Act and the relevant amending Acts not been enacted continue to apply.

17The Registrar of the Tribunal wrote to BEM's Solicitors on 28 January 2014 and advised them that the matter would be determined by a Senior Member of NCAT, and provided a copy of the 'Transitional Appeals Guideline (5.2)'. 

18As a Senior Member in the Administrative & Equal Opportunity Division of the NCAT, I have been directed by the President of the NCAT to hear the appeal and, in doing so, to exercise all the functions that were exercised by the Tribunal immediately before the commencement of the new Act.

19Upon receipt of this matter recently I identified the issues outlined at paragraphs 9 - 14 (above), and in particular noted that the papers contained no Notice of Appeal either in the form prescribed by Clause 15 of the now repealed Victims Compensation Rule 1997 or any documentation identifying an appeal as opposed to an internal review. On 17 November 2014 the Registrar of the Tribunal wrote to BEM's Solicitors outlining these issues, and requesting that they consider the matter and in effect make an election as to how they wished to proceed. I indicated that if an election was made to deal with the matter as an Appeal, then the material dates of the internal review request should apply to any appeal, and that this was in reflection of the administrative handling and processing of the matter between 5 August 2013 and 28 January 2014. 

20 On 21 November 2014 BEM's Solicitors reply to the 17 November 2014 correspondence was received. They advised that they had in fact lodged a Notice of Appeal (subsequent to the request for Internal Review) on 17 September 2013 with Victims Services / Commissioner for Victims Rights. A copy of the relevant e-mails and documents were provided. It appears that these documents were not on file when the matter was forwarded in early January 2014 to NCAT.

21The Notice of Appeal therefore was subsequently lodged on 17 September 2013 complementing the Internal Review request of 2 August 2013. The Grounds of Appeal are:

(1)That the Assessor erred in finding that the Appellant / Applicant was not the victim of an act of violence as defined in section 5 of the Act. 

22 Particulars of appeal were filed in support of the application.

(1)The alleged offender received no injuries and sought no medical intervention.

(2)He was not interviewed by police until approximately 12 months after the incident.

(3)He initially denied he was involved in a fight.

(4)He apparently failed to show up for two appointments with the Police to provide a statement and only eventually did when he was threatened to do so.

(5)The Police did not charge the applicant with assault. 

Decision on the papers

23BEM has not applied for the appeal to proceed by way of hearing and I am satisfied that the matter can be properly determined without a hearing under section 38(2) of the old Act, pursuant to section 38 (1). In addition I have read and considered the whole of the evidence before the compensation assessor. I have taken it all into account even though I may not refer specifically to all the evidence and material in these reasons.

Act of violence
24Section 29(2) of the old Act provides that in order to make an award of compensation the Tribunal must be satisfied that:
... On the balance of probabilities, that the person to whom the application for that compensation relates:
(a) is a primary victim, secondary victim or family victim of an act of violence, and

(b) is eligible to receive the amount of compensation provided by the award.

25In essence the Assessor found that BEM was not a victim of an Act of violence in accordance with the provisions of section 5 (1) of the old Act. It appears (from the words of the determination) that the Assessor applied weight to the fact that Police raised the issue of self-defence, (Corroborated) as a basis of ceasing any further investigation or prosecution, and the fact that there were inconsistencies in BEM's version of events. 

Evidence of act of violence.

26At Part 4 of the application for compensation BEM declares that: 'I was visiting a friend when the offender asked to use my phone. I gave it to him and he got into a scuffle with another person. I asked for the phone back and he said he didn't have it. As I looked around the park to see if I could see it, the offender head butted me.' 

27The COPS Event provides the following information: ' (SMT) requested to use his mobile phone with the victim handing him his Sony Ericsson mobile phone and (SMT) making a call. After the call the victim states that (SMT) placed the mobile phone into his pocket and as a result the victim said, ""Can I get my phone back?"". (SMT) replied, ""I don't have your phone, what are you going to do about it?"". The victim replied ""Nothing, I'm not going to do anything"". At this time (SMT) head-butted the victim to the nose and commenced to punch out at the victim, with the victim wrestling with (SMT) in an attempt to block the punches.' 

28In addition the COPS event provides the following information about BEM's injuries: '(BEM) was informed by Doctors at Wollongong Hospital that he has a fractured nose and needs to have surgery to have his nose realigned. (BEM's) nose was bent, red and swollen and had bruising around the nose and under the left eye. These entries were completed after talking with and observing BEM at hospital the evening of the incident. BEM later advised police that the alleged offender was (SP) not (SMT). This information was clarified after BEM discussed the incident with his brother.

29BEM changes his statement to police 11 days later were he states (after recovering somewhat from his injuries), that (SP) borrowed the phone to use the light on the phone to assist in finding a lost $50 note and that (SP) had not called anyone. BEM explained the discrepancy due to his injury but stated he now recalled the exact turn of events. 

30When (SP) is interviewed by police he provides a broadly consistent version of what occurred prior to the assault. He says that he lost $50 whilst riding his bike and borrowed (BEM's) phone to look for it. Whilst searching for the phone (SP) has fallen off his bike and the phone has fallen out of his pocket. (SP) states that when the victim asked for his phone back (SP) stated that he did not have it. (SP) then alleges that (BEM) struck him to the head with a half full bottle of beer and grabbed (SP). (SP) stated that at that time he head-butted (BEM) in self-defence as he feared that he was going to be hit with the bottle again. (SP) stated that his girlfriend (SN) witnessed the incident. 

31Police obtained a statement from the witness (SN). She stated that she saw BEM throw a beer bottle at (SP) which hit him in the head. (SN) then says that (BEM) threw a number of punches at (SP) at which time (SP) head-butted (BEM) to the face. Two other nominated witnesses were contacted by Police but both declined to provide statements.

32The police investigation appears to have concluded because of the issue of self-defence, and the fact that BEM altered his statement in respect of what purpose (SP) borrowed the mobile phone. It also appears that weight was placed on the apparent corroboration of (SP's) version of events by (SN). I note that there is a reference in the COPS event to an earlier issue (the day prior) involving BEM and a comment made that (BEM) failed to mention this incident when investigators spoke to the victim. On the face of the record, it is not possible to glean any objective relevance or significance to those matters in respect of the investigation of the serious assault.

Consideration

33I note that there are various conflicts in the three versions of events, i.e.: those given by BEM, SP and SN. BEM says that after a verbal exchange SP head-butted him in an otherwise unprovoked manner. SP says that BEM 'struck him to the head with a half full beer bottle and grabbed him'. SN stated that BEM 'threw a beer bottle at SP which struck him in the head' . There is a slight conflict in SP and SN's version in that on one hand SN says he was struck with a beer bottle, and BEM needed to be grabbed in order to prevent being hit again with the bottle. This would be consistent with BEM holding the bottle during the course of any assault. On the other hand SN says that BEM 'threw the beer bottle', and that BEM 'has then thrown a number of punches at SP'. SP makes no mention of any punches, but says that the beer bottle was 'half full' and that when he head-butted BEM in self-defence it was 'in fear that he was going to be hit again'. 

34 On one hand SP and SN's evidence is in conflict both in how SP was allegedly hit, whether he had the opportunity to immediately 'hit' SP again with the beer bottle, and in conflict as to whether BEM began punching SP around the face immediately after 'dispatching' the beer bottle, or not. 

Self defence

35The police raise the issue of self-defence, (and presumably) the apparent corroboration as grounds which would indicate that there would be no reasonable prospect of conviction. That consideration was made having regard to the criminal standard, as opposed to the civil standard (which I must apply in making findings in this matter), which is whether it was more likely than not, that the particular issue occurred. This is often referred to as the balance of probabilities. 

36In any criminal prosecution, where the issue of self-defence is raised, the onus is on the Crown to negate self-defence. Butterworth's Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW provides the following commentary on self-defence at 8s-58.20.

Self defence is not properly to be regarded as a defence but as a matter which the prosecution must negative beyond reasonable doubt: Zecevic v DPP (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645 at 657; ALR 641;BC8701784. It should be listed with all the other issues which the Crown has to establish and be expressed so as to emphasis at all times that the onus lies upon the prosecution to eliminate any reasonable possibility that the accused was acting in self defence: R v Dziduch (1990) 47 A Crim R 378 at 380-1;BC9002651. 

The question to be asked is whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self defence to do what he did. If he had that belief and there were reasonable grounds for it, or if the jury is left in reasonable doubt about the matter.


37The Crimes Act 1900 provides the following provisions in respect of self defence:

418 Self-defence-when available
(1)A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.

2. A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary: 
(a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or
(b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or
(c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or
(d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass,
and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.

419 Self-defence-onus of proof
In any criminal proceedings in which the application of this Division is raised, the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self-defence.

38In the current matter in my view, whilst the Crown may have difficulty in negativing self-defence, there is a clear conflict not just between the victim and the alleged perpetrator, but also a conflict in the exculpatory evidence which would be used to establish self-defence as a consideration to be rebutted or negatived. On the basis of all of the material before me, in respect of the actual assault (not the non-violent circumstances leading up to the assault), on my assessment the evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that SP was the instigator of the actual violence. In addition the significant injuries of BEM (and the apparent lack of any injuries requiring treatment of SP), lead me to the conclusion that on the balance of probabilities, SP assaulted BEM. Whether that assault involved excessive force, is only a finding of fact relevant in criminal proceedings where the issue of self defence is before the Court on the circumstances and facts of the case. 

39I therefore make a finding based on the analysis of the evidence above (and the medical evidence on file) that BEM was the victim of an act of violence in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the old Act.

40In reaching this conclusion I have also had regard to the various statutory declarations of BEM dated 21 March 2011 and 4 September 2012. However, my finding is based is based on the totality of the evidence to the requisite standard.

41It is necessary to consider the issue of section 30 in each application. In this matter, whilst section 30 might appear to be a live issue (in respect of section 30 (1) (a) of the old Act), having made the finding that I have above, based on the analysis at paragraphs 26 - 38 (inclusive), consequentially matters referred to in the sub section, are as a finding of fact, discounted. I therefore find that there are no section 30 issues which would reduce any award or disentitle BEM to an award of statutory compensation. 

42For completeness I reject BEM's Solicitor's 4th Particular of Appeal (see paragraph 22 above), as in my view it is an entirely irrelevant consideration in what BEM is required to establish. 

Compensable Injury

43BEM has claimed four compensable injuries from Table 1 of Schedule 1 of the old Act. Those injuries are:


Head: Ear - Partial deafness of both ears - remaining hearing socially useful with hearing aid if necessary. - $18,000.00 
Head: Nose - Partial loss of smell and / or taste - $12,000.00 
Head: Nose - deviated nasal septum requiring septoplastomy - $4,800.00 
Head: Nose- Displaced fracture of nasal bones - $3,600.00

44There is a claim for expenses under section 18 (1) (a) of the old Act in respect of actual expenses. These have been paid as disbursements by the compensation assessor on 6 May 2013. 

45Based on a thorough consideration of the medical evidence, I find that the acclaimed compensable injuries are established, and arise as a direct result of the act of violence.

46Clause 3 of Schedule 1 of the old Act provides the following in respect of multiple compensable injuries:

3 Multiple injuries
If 2 or more compensable injuries are received by an eligible victim, the standard amount of compensation for all of those injuries is the total of the following amounts (subject to the other provisions of this Act):
(a) The full standard amount for the most serious injury (that is, for the injury that has the largest standard amount payable).
(b) 10% of the standard amount for the second most serious injury (that is, for the injury that has the same or the second largest standard amount payable).
(c) 5% of the standard amount for the third most serious injury (that is, for the injury that has the same or the third largest standard amount payable).
(d) No amount for any further injuries.


47As a result BEM will receive statutory compensation for the three most serious (based on value) injuries at the percentage payable as set out in clause 3. There will be no compensation payable for the fourth most serious injury.

48I make an award of statutory compensation in the following manner:

(1)Head: Ear - Partial deafness of both ears - remaining hearing socially useful with hearing aid if necessary. - at 100% --------- $18,000.00

(2)Head: Nose - Partial loss of smell and / or taste - at 10% ----------------- $1,200.00

(3)Head: Nose - deviated nasal septum requiring septoplastomy - at 5%.------- $240.00

Subtotal: ------------ $19,440.00

(Less $750.00 statutory deduction for all awards less than $20,001.00 pursuant to section 19A of the old Act.


49Total Compensation payable: ----- $18,690.00

I make an award of costs in the sum of $500.00 (plus GST if applicable).

2704140,FB v R [2014] NSWCCA 282,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with Adams J.
2ADAMS J:
Introduction
3On 23 July 2010 the appellant was convicted following a trial by judge alone of the offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which a maximum penalty is prescribed of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years applies.  The particulars of the charge allege that, between 16 August 2006 and 31 August 2006 the appellant had sexual intercourse with SE without her consent and knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely at the time SE was 14 years of age and was under his authority as SE's teacher and the headmaster of the school she was attending.  The primary judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for six years and six months with a non-parole period of four years to commence on 9 February 2010.  (For convenience I refer to this as the earlier offence.)
4At the time of this sentence, the appellant was already serving a sentence imposed by another judge on 20 November 2009 for five offences committed between 10 and 14 December 2007 to which the appellant had pleaded guilty, involving sexual intercourse with a 16 year old girl who was under his special care in that he was the principal of the school the victim attended (the ""later offences"").  These occurred some 16 months after the earlier offence but they had been earlier disclosed to the authorities and the consequent proceedings were concluded before those relating to SE.  The first of the later offences involved an act of cunnilingus and the four others involved penile/vaginal intercourse with the same victim.  In respect of these offences the appellant was sentenced to a total effective term of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment commencing on 9 May 2008 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.  
5The sentence imposed for the earlier offence commenced on 9 February 2010 and was therefore partially concurrent with the non-parole period imposed in respect of the later offences by 6 months.  
6The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the sentences for the later offences on the grounds of manifest inadequacy.  This Court upheld the appeal and substituted a sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 9 August 2009, six months earlier: FB v R; R v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217.  Accordingly, this Court allowed a greater degree of concurrency than had the primary judge with the previous sentence being served by the appellant. 
7The appellant sought a review under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  Schmidt J referred this matter to this Court ""to determine whether the Muldrock error affected the sentence imposed on the applicant as the result of the Crown appeal"".  The error is, of course, that identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, concerning the correct interpretation and application of Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) providing for standard non-parole periods, in which the High Court of Australia held that the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 erred in concluding that s 54B(2) was framed in mandatory terms, requiring the court, ""when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness"": ibid at [25].  For the purposes of the appeal, the Crown accepts that the Court of Criminal Appeal applied sentencing principles contrary to Muldrock and, accordingly, its judgment cannot stand.  It is submitted, however, that no lesser sentence is warranted under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act and, the sentence imposed in the District Court being manifestly inadequate, this Court ought not to vary the sentence now under appeal.  
The nature of the present appeal
8The appellant and respondent contended for significantly different approaches which, each argued, was appropriate where the decision being reconsidered is that of this Court, having allowed a Crown appeal,  increased the appellant's sentence.  Since this issue was already under consideration by this Court, judgment being reserved, the Court ordered, with consent of the parties, that the disposition of this appeal would await that decision, giving the parties the opportunity to make written submissions when that judgment was delivered.  This has now occurred: Louizos v R [2014] NSWCCA 242.  The Court, by majority (Leeming JA, R A Hulme J agreeing, Fullerton J dissenting) held, in substance, that the new process created by ss 78 and 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) is not a mere rehearing of the Crown appeal as though this Court stood in the shoes of the previous Court of Criminal Appeal; rather, it is ""a 'new appeal' by the offender against the sentenced imposed"" by that court: ibid at [37].  As Leeming JA explained, the appellant is taken to have appealed under s 51C of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against that sentence; leave is not required; and he is entitled to rely on grounds going beyond the matters relied on in the reference (here, the Muldrock ground), all of which are to be assessed on their merits as if the appeal were a conventional one.  Fullerton J dissented from this approach for reasons which, if I may say so with respect, are persuasive to my mind.  Indeed, the appellant in the present case contends that Louizos is wrongly decided and that the approach thought right by her Honour should be that which this Court should take.  Of course, I mean no disrespect to Fullerton J but, in my view, this matter having been so recently decided, albeit by a majority, in my view the judgment of the majority should be followed until such time as a court of five judges holds it to be in error.  Accordingly, I do not intend to rehearse the arguments relied on by the appellant in submitting that this Court should follow Fullerton J.  They must be rejected.
9It is unnecessary to revisit the Muldrock issue.  The question is whether, error being conceded, a lesser sentence is warranted.
The facts
10There was no dispute in the earlier proceedings as to the primary judge's findings.  His Honour said -
""In August 2006 the complainant was having difficulties in her relationship with her family and particularly her mother.  As a result of these difficulties her parents consulted the prisoner who was I say the school principal at the time.  The prisoner suggested that the complainant spend some time with him and his family as a time out.  Once again in my view at this stage there was much more than altruism in that offer by the prisoner. In my opinion that supports the fact that he was taking steps to spend as much time as he could with the complainant, probably with a sexual undertone as well.  The complainant spent some two weeks with the accused and his family between 16 and 31 August 2006.  On 19 August 2006 the prisoner took the complainant flying, out of Coffs Harbour and also purchased a gift which was for the complainant to give to her sister in relation to the latter's birthday.  In my opinion this was also conduct by the prisoner in which he was attempting to ingratiate himself with the complainant by firstly impressing her as I infer from taking her flying and next providing money, not huge amounts, for the purchase of gifts.
In the period leading up to the sexual assault the prisoner attempted close physical contact with the complainant by hugging her when they were watching television.  Immediately preceding the offence he gave her two tablets which he represented were Panadol and which had the effect of causing her to go to sleep.  When she awoke she found herself in her pyjamas and the prisoner on top of her.  It was her evidence which I accepted in the trial beyond reasonable doubt and do for the purpose of sentencing, that his penis was inside her and she was screaming out for him to stop.  She observed that he had his shirt on and the complainant thought he had some pants around his ankles.  She believed that he was not wearing a condom during this process.  It was her evidence that he held her down by her arms, but otherwise no further force was used by him.
The complainant remained at the house after these events for a period of two to three days during which period the prisoner attempted no further sexual contact with her.""
Subjective features
11These, also unchallenged in the present appeal, are taken from the previous judgment (at [140]-[147]).  The appellant was dealt with on the basis that the offence was his major criminal offence, the offences for which he was serving his sentence at the time having occurred in the following year.  The appellant's long standing symptoms of a ""severe depressive illness"" did not contribute to the commission of the offence against SE, amongst other reasons, because his psychiatrist, Dr Watson-Munro, was unable to say whether the appellant had been suffering any psychological symptoms at the time.  Nevertheless, he did have a long standing depressive illness of a severe nature which was, at the time of sentence, still affecting him.  Dr Watson-Munro, who expressed the opinion that ""the prisoner is clearly a paedophile"", thought he needed more intensive treatment than he had received at the time of the sentence hearing, in this respect the primary judge noting that there were programs which might be of considerable assistance in his rehabilitation.  Dr Watson-Munro was, as the Court described it, ""wary of expressing a definitive opinion on the risk of recidivism"" but, if he had a ""long commitment to treatment"", the risk of recidivism was ""moderate"".  As the Court observed, ""the sentencing judge accepted this proposition, namely that the need for post-release treatment and its prospects of decreasing the risk of recidivism, required a lengthy non-parole period enabling supervision.""  Of course, it also meant that the risk of reoffending was a live and significant issue.  
12The following discussion is usefully set out in full -  
""[145] There were two matters, however, which the sentencing judge thought should particularly be taken into account as mitigating factors. These were the fact of extra curial punishment and, due to the nature of the offence, the harshness of the incidents of imprisonment. As to the first, the sentencing judge took into account that, prior to the commission of the offence, the respondent had been a highly regarded professional teacher and the principal of a country school. He had been a well-educated person apparently living a happy family life. His Honour said (Remarks on Sentence, 20):- 
It is self-evident that his fall from grace, by reason of these serious criminal matters, has been dramatic, and no doubt traumatic for him and also for his family. It has resulted in his estrangement from some of the members of his family and from the loss of any future career in teaching. I interpolate to say it may well have a far broader impact, that it would prohibit him from any career which may well bring him into contact with young children... His counsel has submitted that he practically is unemployable. Whether that description overstates the position or not might be debated. However, it is certainly clear that his professional life, as he knew it, after his release from custody, is not open to him and never will be. 
[146] As to the second matter, the sentencing judge accepted the evidence of Dr Watson-Munro that the respondent ""is a vulnerable person in the prison context and is likely to be the subject of adverse attention by other prisoners"". It appears the respondent told his psychiatrist that he had been assaulted in prison, ""leading to broken bones"". Furthermore, he had been subsequently been assaulted by others ""throwing fruit at him"". He had been on full protection since his incarceration ""and that meaning he has been locked in his cell for between 18 and 23 hours a day"". His Honour indicated, however, that there was no direct evidence from the respondent of this fact, although he was prepared to accept the second-hand account of the respondent's position at the time when that information had been passed to his psychiatrist. 
[147] There were other general matters dealt with by his Honour. He noted, for example, that the respondent had completed a sex offenders' programme over 14 weeks at the Goulbourn Gaol. He noted that the respondent had expressed ""profound remorse notwithstanding that he indicated he was not guilty"". He noted the previous good character of the respondent. (In this regard, his Honour indicated that he proposed to treat this offence as the first serious offending of the respondent in point-of-time). On the issue of character, his Honour observed that good character or lack of previous conviction was not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor, if the court were satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to an offender in the commission of an offence. (This was clearly a reference to the provisions of section 21A(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which, it is accepted, applied to the subject offence and the respondent). In this regard, his Honour concluded, however, that the respondent's good character should be treated as ""a neutral factor"". That is to say, the sentencing judge took the view that the issue of good character was one which was to be regarded as neutral in the particular circumstances that related to his position in the school and his ability thereby to pursue his predilection for interfering with young girls.""
Discussion
13The criminal culpability of the appellant was considerable.  The offence was committed with a significant degree of deliberation and premeditation as demonstrated by the fact that he had drugged her and waited until she was sleeping before having intercourse.  He acted with callous indifference for the well-being of a young girl in his care, for whom he also had the additional responsibility of being the principal of the school in which she was a student.  
14Although, of course, this was the appellant's first offence in point of chronology, it is clear from his subsequent offences that he represents a real risk to any young girls in respect of whom he has any responsibility and who come under his influence.  It follows that, in his case, the personal deterrence aspect of punishment is of greater significance than if he had offended only once.  
15The Court of Criminal Appeal said, in respect of two circumstances thought significant by the sentencing judge, namely hardship in prison and the factor of extra curial punishment -
""[155] ... As to the first, the only evidence before the sentencing judge was the abusive behaviour experienced by the respondent in prison and his concern that this would or might continue after he had been sentenced.  There was no evidence, for example, to suggest that there would be imposed on the respondent any specific custodial situation that would reveal hardship out of the ordinary...
[156] As to extra curial punishment, it may be accepted that the respondent had lost altogether his career as a teacher by virtue of his commission of the offence.  Once again, however, this consideration could not, in the circumstances, have possibly outweighed or effectively undermined the level of objective seriousness involved in the offence.  The respondent must have known that his sexual pursuit of pupils in his care would sooner or later bring his professional career to an end.""
16It is clear, from the appellant's subsequent criminal conduct, that whatever remorse he might have had after the commission of his offence, it did not affect his behaviour.  The sentencing judge rightly regarded the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation with ""guarded optimism, only if he continues with the treatment which he has been given"".  His Honour went on to express some scepticism of his long term prospect in this regard given the wealth of learning revealing the difficulty of either eradicating or controlling behaviour of the kind exhibited by the appellant.  To this I would add the subsequent offending.
Conclusion
17In my respectful view, the Court of Criminal Appeal was correct in concluding that the sentence imposed by the primary judge was manifestly inadequate.  Considering the objective seriousness of the offence, together with the appellant's subjective features, bearing in mind as yardsticks, the standard non-parole period and (less so) the maximum term prescribed for the offence, I am not persuaded that any lesser sentence than that substituted by the Court of Criminal Appeal  is warranted in law.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

		01 December 2014",2014-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704155,R v IL (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1710,"Judgment

 

1IL (the accused) is charged with a number of offences. By count 1, the indictment alleges that she manufactured a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (6.7 kg of methylamphetamine). Count 2(a) is an allegation that she murdered Zhi Min Lan and count 2(b) is an alternative count alleging the manslaughter of Mr Lan. Counts 3 to 6 are four allegations that she was in possession of prohibited weapons or pistols.

 

2The accused was charged after police and fire fighters attended residential premises at Quarry Road, Ryde (""the premises"") in response to a house fire. The accused was present at the premises along with the victim of the alleged homicide. The accused was suffering from symptoms consistent with minor smoke inhalation. Mr Lan had suffered severe burns, was taken to hospital and died some days later. Police and fire fighters discovered that the fire was contained largely, if not completely, within the bathroom of the premises. Next to the toilet there was a gas cylinder which was connected by a pipe or hose to a ring burner. Elsewhere within the premises the police discovered a large number of items consistent with the manufacture of methylamphetamine on a relatively large scale. For reasons that are unexplained, there was no analysis done of the items within the bathroom.

 

3At the conclusion of the Crown case, counsel for the accused made an application that the jury be directed to return verdicts of not guilty in respect of the charges of murder and manslaughter.

 

4The prosecution brings its case of murder on the basis of constructive murder pursuant to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). To do so, it must also rely on the principle of common purpose or joint criminal enterprise. The learned Crown Prosecutor concedes, fairly and properly, that he cannot establish that the act causing death was the act of the accused and cannot establish, whoever did it, that the act was done with an intention to kill, inflict grievous bodily harm or with reckless indifference to human life.

 

5In essence, and at risk of oversimplifying its case, the prosecution says that the accused and the deceased were jointly involved in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of drugs (an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years or life), that each was responsible for the other's acts in carrying out that common criminal design and that the fire that killed the deceased occurred in the course of that criminal enterprise. By virtue of principles of common purpose, it need not prove that the accused did the act causing death because she is responsible also for the acts of (in this case) the deceased. By calling into aid the murder felony rule (constructive murder), it need not prove the specific intention ordinarily associated with the crime of murder. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of murder.

 

6The case may be unique in Australian legal history. Neither counsel has pointed me to any case where the prosecution has attempted to establish murder in similar circumstances. Even in the case most closely related on its facts, the foundational offence involved an act of violence (conspiracy to cause an explosion at the Turkish Consulate in Melbourne): R v Demirian [1989] VR 97; 33 A Crim R 441.

 

7The prosecution has drawn my attention to one case, prosecuted in the NSW District Court, where a death from an explosion in a clandestine laboratory resulted in one participant being charged with the manslaughter of the other: R v Dagger (District Court (NSW), 21 November 2012, unrep) (Judge Haesler). I will return to discuss that case but for present purposes I note that (i) the Crown did not seek to rely on the murder felony rule, (ii) the accused was charged with an offence that did not involve specific intention and (iii) the judgment to which I have been referred related to an application to quash the indictment and did not involve the question of whether there was a prima facie case based on the evidence adduced at the trial.

 

SOME RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES

8Before turning to the respective arguments of counsel it is appropriate to sketch at least some of the relevant legal landscape.

 

The role of the jury and the power to direct a verdict of not guilty

9In R v R (1989) 44 A Crim R 404; 18 NSWLR 74, the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal resolved the question of when a trial Judge has the power to direct a jury to return a verdict of not guilty. Gleeson CJ (with whom Maxwell and Wood JJ agreed) rejected a line of authorities that suggested the existence of such a power when a trial Judge formed the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. The Court accepted that the narrower view was correct and held that that;

""a judge should only direct an acquittal if [they conclude] that there is no evidence upon which a jury properly directed could properly convict. It is sometimes expressed by saying that the question is whether there is evidence on which the accused could lawfully be convicted.""

 

10The power to intervene if the verdict in unsafe or unsatisfactory (ie unreasonable and unable to be supported on the evidence) is reserved to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

 

11In a case based on circumstantial evidence, it has been held that the question of whether the Crown has negatived all other reasonable inferences consistent with innocence is a question for the jury, not the trial Judge on an application for a directed verdict (R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39).

 

12However, the Crown properly accepts that if there is no evidence capable of establishing an essential intermediate fact in the circumstantial case, a verdict of not guilty might properly be directed (T 400).

 

13In R v Staines [1999] NSWSC 1101, Greg James J directed an acquittal where his Honour formed the view that the evidence was not capable of negativing self-defence.

 

 

 

Constructive murder and the principle of common purpose

14As I have said, the prosecution relies upon to two different principles of criminal liability, each of which extends the liability of an accused person beyond the ordinary reach of the criminal law. The first of those principles is the principal of constructive murder under s 18, a concept well known to the law as ""felony murder"". Section 18 provides:

""18 Murder and manslaughter defined

(1) (a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.

(b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.

 

(2) (a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.

(b) No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only."" 

 

15The principle is to the effect that if somebody is killed while an accused person commits a crime carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years or life imprisonment, the accused is liable to be convicted of murder even though it cannot be established that the accused acted with the specific intention ordinarily required to establish murder (that is, an intention to kill, an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, or an act done with reckless indifference to human life). Constructive murder alleviates the necessity for the Crown to prove specific intention. It does not affect the requirement of proof that there be a voluntary act and that the act causes the death of the victim.

 

16The second principle of criminal liability upon which the prosecution relies is the concept of common purpose, or as it is sometimes and interchangeably described, joint criminal enterprise: McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 113. As I have said, it is necessary for the Crown to rely on that principle because it is not able to prove that any act of the accused caused the death of the deceased.

 

17The principle was explained in McAuliffe v The Queen (at 114) as follows:

""The liability which attaches to the traditional classifications of accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree may be enough to establish the guilt of a secondary party: in the case of an accessory before the fact where that party counsels or procures the commission of the crime and in the case of a principal in the second degree where that party, being present at the scene, aids or abets its commission. But the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.

 

Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose.""

 

18In Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; 168 A Crim R 174; 81 ALJR 439 at [3] the High Court declined an invitation to revisit these principles. The Court reiterated the following principle at [17]:

""A person who does not intend the death of the victim, but does intend to do really serious injury to the victim, will be guilty of murder if the victim dies. If a party to a joint criminal enterprise foresees the possibility that another might be assaulted with intention to kill or cause really serious injury to that person, and, despite that foresight, continues to participate in the venture, the criminal culpability lies in the continued participation in the joint enterprise with the necessary foresight. That the participant does not wish or intend that the victim be killed is of no greater significance than the observation that the person committing the assault need not wish or intend that result, yet be guilty of the crime of murder.""

 

The Crown opening

19The learned Crown Prosecutor opened the case on 18 November 2014 and explained the basis upon which the Crown sought to establish the murder charge (T 28-31):

""Count 2 is a charge of murder, but it's a very particular charge. It's quite different from what is alleged in most cases of murder. In this case the person who died was Mr Lan, with whom we say she was at least in this joint criminal enterprise. There is a particular name for this sort of a charge, it's referred to either as felony murder or constructive murder, and here, the liability for the charge of murder is based upon the foundation crime for the offence. The foundation crime is the joint criminal enterprise to manufacture a large commercial quantity. In other words, it is a condition precedent to find the accused guilty on count 2 that you must find that she was in a joint criminal enterprise in count 1. That is why the indictment reads that way. Because if you don't find count 1 proved beyond reasonable doubt you don't move to count 2. Because of the principles of joint criminal enterprise where each person is responsible for the acts of the other in it, the accused is responsible not only for her acts but for those of the deceased. 

 

Because this is an unusual sort of charge, I am going to give you an example of the way it normally comes before the Court. When I say normally, it's not this case, but just to introduce you to the concept that we are talking about here of constructive murder. Supposing that two people agree that they are going to go to a petrol station at midnight and commit an armed robbery. One of them has the gun, it's loaded, and the other one knows that. They both go together. They go together for the purposes of robbing the store at gunpoint of whatever might be in the cash register. At some stage during the armed robbery the gun goes off and the attendant is killed. The second robber, the one who didn't have the gun, can't turn around and say, not my fault, I did not have the gun, the other person did, because under the principles of joint criminal enterprise, he knew if he went in there for the purpose of committing armed robbery, if he knew that there was a gun, which he could probably see, he knew that it was loaded, it had to be on the cards, all things considered, that the gun would be used during that enterprise. And so he's equally liable as the other one. That is the sort of concept we are talking about here. That is why it's called constructive murder. 

 

In this particular case you have got a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture the large commercial quantity. You have got the use of dangerous and flammable chemicals. It's called a clan lab or clandestine laboratory because it was set up for the manufacture of this particular drug. It's in her house. She has got a receipt for acetone. That is the solvent. And you have got in this case, we would say, a place basically unsuitable for the purpose, because it does not have the sorts of equipment, and whatever that you might expect that you would need if you were going to if you could lawfully conduct this operation. 

 

So we say that the process of evaporation was occurring in the bathroom because of the burner and the gas bottle. So we say that lighting the burner, and it doesn't matter who lit the burner, begins a process of evaporation; you're applying heat to a body of stuff with a solvent in it; you're entering on the process of evaporation. It is necessarily going to be the case that at some stage the fumes are going to enter the air. The burner is a naked flame; if the vapour can't escape, then it is likely to ignite.

 

The Crown says that in this case the accused knew that the process involved acetone because she purchased it, or at least a quantity of it, she was aware of the fact that the manufacture, certainly in coming in there because of the smell, she was aware of the process happening in the bathroom because it was the only one in the house. It was readily obvious that the whole house had been set up for the purposes of manufacturing.

 

We also say that the risks were known in this case. We're going to ask you to specifically look at the bathroom itself. We're going to direct your attention to a couple of holes in the ceiling, one of which goes right through. There is going to be a suggestion about whether it was open to the weather or whether, in fact, there was an extraction or exhaust fan there. That's a matter that I will be raising with Detective Sergeant Agius who is the first witness.

 

In any event, whether there was a hole there or whether there was an extraction fan there, you might think that the purpose of either of those things was to allow flammable gases to escape, in which case she must have been aware that there was a possibility of the build up of those gases.

 

He dies as a consequence of the fire. We don't at this stage don't know how. The situation is that there was a fire in the bathroom at some stage and you will see that the suggestion is that in order to perhaps smother the fire, a mattress was brought in. It didn't smother the fire, it actually increased it, because of the substance that the mattress was made out of, and you will see the burnt out [remnants] in the bathroom itself. We say that if in all those circumstances you accept beyond reasonable doubt, you come to the conclusion about those matters, then you'll find her liable for the first count. If not, you then move to 2B, which is really a charge of manslaughter.

 

Briefly, this is what is called manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. Essentially here, the manufacture of methylamphetamine is unlawful. It is made, so it is prohibited under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. We also say it is inherently dangerous because of the process of manufacture which is crystallisation which involves the heating of this solvent and vaporisation and so forth. 

 

We would say, again it is a matter for you, that these clan labs or clandestine lab streets set up, if you like, in a residential house, are of their nature highly suspect because they deal in things like flammable solvents. This particular house lacked the sophisticated equipment required to safely manage the process of manufacture. They, for example, used a naked flame. They didn't have proper ventilation. There wasn't any proper storage of chemicals. It was a suburban house, not a properly constituted laboratory. It was, quite frankly, a mess inside. These are the sorts of things you will have to look at and consider on that aspect of whether it was inherently dangerous on that third count.""

 

20The Crown's opening statement that the murder count is an ""unusual sort of charge"" was a masterpiece of understatement. In fact, neither counsel has been able to provide me with any authority in which a co-offender was particularised as the ""victim"" of a murder charge arising out of the joint commission of an agreed criminal enterprise.

 

21Nor have I been taken to any previous murder case where the prosecution has sought to establish (i) the voluntary act causing death by reliance on the principles of common purpose and (ii) the intention required for liability in murder by calling in aid the murder felony rule (constructive murder).

 

Demirian, Ryan and US authorities.

22A somewhat analogous case is the Victorian case of R v Demirian [1989] VR 97; 33 A Crim R 441. In that case the applicant to the Victorian Court of Appeal had been convicted of conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life (count one) and murder (count two). The deceased and the applicant had conspired together to cause an explosion in the Turkish Consulate in Melbourne. The deceased entered the car park of the building with the bomb with the intention of executing the plan. As he was doing so, and in circumstances that were not clear, the bomb detonated prematurely. The deceased was killed in the explosion. The murder felony rule had been abolished in Victoria and replaced with s 3A(1) of the Crimes Act 1958 (VIC) which provided:

""A person who unintentionally causes the death of another person by an act of violence done in the course or furtherance of a crime the necessary elements of which include violence for which a person upon first conviction may, under or by virtue of any enactment, be sentenced to life imprisonment or to imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more shall be liable to be convicted of murder as though he had killed that person intentionally."" 

 

23The case at trial had been put in two ways, neither of which relied on s 3A(1). Rather, the case was put on the basis of common purpose and, alternatively, on the basis of what was described by the trial judge as ""murder by recklessness"". It is unnecessary to dwell on the errors that the Court of Appeal found in the directions other than to note that McGarvie and O'Bryan JJ held (at 105-108) that, because the deceased could not be convicted of his own murder, the applicant could not be guilty as an accessory or principle in the second degree. The accused makes a similar submission in the present case.

 

24Their Honour's discussion of constructive murder came in the context of whether there should be an order for a re-trial. An important part of the Victorian court's analysis in R v Demirian arose from the discussion by Barwick CJ in Ryan v The Queen [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205. In particular, their Honours (at 110) placed reliance on the following passage of the former Chief Justice (at 121 CLR 218):

""Whilst, of course, all the happenings of the evening antecedent to the discharge of the gun might be regarded for the purpose of deciding whether some act of the applicant which caused the death of the deceased qualified under one or more of the conditions of culpability for murder which are set out in section 18, they could not, in my opinion, be regarded in the aggregate as the act of the accused causing death. Such a course, in my opinion, not merely lacks the requisite precision, but fails to provide a subject of which one or more of the said conditions or concomitants could be predicated. The earliest act of the applicant which, in my opinion, could have been selected by the jury as the act causing death was the presentation of the gun towards the back of the deceased after, at the applicant's bidding, he had turned around to enable his hands to be tied behind him. Thus, at the most, the jury could choose the presentation of the gun in the circumstances or its subsequent discharge as the act causing death."" 

 

25Their Honours went on (at 111) to refer to White v Ridley [1978] HCA 38; 140 CLR 342 at 352 where Stephen J again ""emphasised the importance of identifying the act relied on to constitute the crime"".

 

26Before returning to R v Demirian, it is worth remembering the following observation of Barwick CJ Ryan v the Queen (at 219):

""I must first observe that no specific attention was paid to the identification of the act causing death. Ordinarily, there would be little need to spend much time on this question. But on occasions, of which the instant case affords an instance, that clearly was not merely the first question to be resolved, but one which required specific and close consideration. The Crown insistence in this case upon 'felony murder', where an element of the felony was a wounding by the accused, considerably underscored this necessity.""

 

27I note that comment, not to adopt his Honour's implicit criticism of the Crown in that case. In the present case, it is quite clear that the Crown has no case for murder apart from the possibility of establishing the crime by means of constructive murder. That is because there is no evidence that the accused (or, for that matter, the deceased co-offender) acted with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm or with reckless indifference to human life. On the contrary, everything points to this being a misadventure, albeit a misadventure in the course of committing a crime carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years or life. However, I paused over that comment by Barwick CJ because it seems to me that this, too, is a case where there is a need identify and focus with real precision upon the act that the Crown seeks to establish as the act causing death. In this case, the act selected by the Crown is the act of lighting the ring burner.

 

28I also observe that in the case of Penza and Di Maria v R [2013] NSWCCA 21, Hoeben JA reiterated (at [159]-[161]) the importance of focussing on the precise act causing death and relied on the seminal reasoning of Barwick CJ in Ryan v The Queen. It is unnecessary to dwell on Penza and Di Maria because it was decided on the basis that the verdict was unreasonable and (at [167]) that the trial judge misdirected the jury by effectively taking away the issue of whether the act causing death was a voluntary act. That case involved a shooting murder and there was a dispute as to whether the accused jointly agreed to commit an armed robbery or whether the victim produced a gun which discharged accidently. However, the reasoning in the case provides a cogent example of the need to focus with precision on the act causing death.

 

29Returning to R v Demirian, I note that it was decided before the decision in McAuliffe v The Queen and Clayton v The Queen. However, it was decided after Johns v The Queen [1980] HCA 3; 143 CLR 108 and the Court made reference to that authority (for example at 116). The case was decided by reference to principles of accessorial liability and agency. The Court quashed the conviction for reasons that are currently not relevant. However, in deciding whether to order a re-trial the Court embarked on an extensive analysis of the murder felony rule and analysed a number of cases from the United States. This occurred because (119):

""The only cases drawn to the attention of the Court where a party had killed himself in the course of committing a crime and another party to that crime had been charged with murder as a result, were cases decided in the United States of America.""

 

30The analysis is thorough and helpful and I set it out in full:

""The cases have to be treated with some reserve because the decisions involve reliance on a form of felony murder rule much wider than the common law rule or the statutory rules which apply in Australia. Some of the decisions depend on statutory provisions or principles of law not applicable in Victoria.

 

The felony murder rule was developed because it was regarded as being in the public interest. It is a flexible and adaptable concept. The cases in the United States provide a useful indication of judicial views upon whether the public interest requires that the law should treat an accomplice as guilty of murder when another accomplice accidentally kills himself or herself during the commission of a serious crime.

 

The case in which it was held that another party to the crime was guilty of murder was Commonwealth v Bolish (No 1) 381 Pa 500 (1955). The prosecution case was that Bolish had instigated Flynn to burn a house. The evidence was that volatile material which Flynn was heating to start the fire exploded prematurely and he was badly burned and died soon after. Bolish was convicted of murder and arson. It was common ground that he was properly convicted of arson. On appeal to the Supreme Court (Pennsylvania) the majority held that the conviction of murder was justified by the law. The majority saw the question as whether the felony murder doctrine applied to the death of an accomplice which resulted from the accomplice's own act in the perpetration of arson (at 509). Authorities were cited for the proposition that where another person is killed in the course or furtherance of a felony not only the person who does the killing but the others taking part in the felony are guilty of murder (at 512-515). The majority took the view that the public interest which required that an arsonist be liable for murder if the fire killed an occupant of the building, a fireman or a member of the public, required the same result where the fire killed an accomplice (at 519).

 

Because there had been unrelated errors at the trial a new trial was ordered. Bolish was again convicted of murder. There was a further appeal and the majority on that occasion upheld the conviction, applying the same principle. Commonwealth v Bolish (No 2) 391 Pa 530 (1958) .

 

In each appeal the majority proceeded on the basis that Bolish was present at the house when the explosion occurred. In each appeal there was a strongly argued dissent by Musmanno J.

 

In People v Ferlin 265 P 230 (1928) the Supreme Court (California) considered a similar factual situation, affirming the trial judge's order for a new trial following the conviction for murder and affirming also the conviction for arson. In deciding that the conviction of Ferlin for murder was wrong the court reasoned that as it could not be seriously contended that the deceased was guilty of murder in accidentally killing himself it could not be said that Ferlin was guilty of murder because of that accidental killing. The court also held that it could not be said that Ferlin and the deceased had a common design that the deceased should accidentally kill himself, emphasising that his death was not in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy but entirely opposed to it.

 

In comparable circumstances in People v La Barbera 287 NYS 257 (1936) Harris J of the Supreme Court (New York) dismissed a murder indictment. The Penal Law of the State define homicide as the killing of one human being by act, procurement or omission of another. It was held that as the deceased had killed himself it was not the act of another and he did not commit homicide. If the deceased did not commit homicide his associates in crime had not committed homicide.

 

In People v Jennings 52 Cal Rptr 329 (1966) a District Court of Appeal (California) in dealing with a similar case held (at 332):

'... that it is not murder for an accomplice to kill himself accidentally while engaged in the commission of the crime of arson, and consequently his principal may not be charged with such offense inasmuch as the act of accidentally killing one's self does not constitute an 'unlawful killing' within the meaning of Penal Code, s 187, particularly in view of the rule that the felony-murder doctrine was enacted for the protection of the public, and not for the benefit of the lawbreaker.'

 

The American cases have been decided in the context of the felony murder rule which attributes constructive malice to those carrying out the felony. As the decisions in Commonwealth v Bolish demonstrate, there was in most jurisdictions little conceptual difficulty involved in extending the felony murder rule to cover the death of a co-felon. The fact that for one reason or another the rule was not so extended in the majority of cases seems to reflect a judicial view that the public interest, regarded as requiring that the rule extend to the unintentional killing of a member of the public, did not require it to extend to the case of a co-felon who had unintentionally killed himself. There is force in the comment made by Norval Morris, borrowing from Cardozo, that cases such as Commonwealth v Bolish illustrate the tendency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its logic. (1956) 105 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 50 'The Felon's Responsibility for the Lethal Act of Others' at 80, n 127.

 

The policy behind the felony murder rule is stated by P Gillies, Criminal Law, p 494:

'The rationale of the felony murder rule is that it operates to deter people who are minded to commit felonies, when resistance from other people will be encouraged, from resorting to force, or at least it encourages such people to moderate the force used. In short, it affects a situation in which the felon acts at his or her peril. Stephen J explained the justification for felony murder in the case of Serné (1887) 16 Cox CC 311 at 313, thus: ""when a person [begins] doing wicked acts for his own base purposes, he [risks] his own life as well as that of others ... If a man begins attacking the human body ... he must take the consequences if he goes further than he intended when he began ...'

 

We agree with the comment of C Howard on the decision in Commonwealth v Bolish:

' ... there can be little doubt that the felony murder rule was never intended to impose responsibility on D for the accidental death of one of his co-felons; and it is difficult to see what purpose is served by such an extension of the law: Criminal Law, p 64.'

 

The fact that Parliament abolished the common law felony murder rule in 1981 and replaced it with s 3A(1) of the Crimes Act, without specifically referring to the killing of one accomplice by another, suggests that Parliament did not see a need for such an extension.

The cases have to be treated with some reserve because the decisions involve reliance on a form of felony murder rule much wider than the common law rule or the statutory rules which apply in Australia. Some of the decisions depend on statutory provisions or principles of law not applicable in Victoria.

 

The felony murder rule was developed because it was regarded as being in the public interest. It is a flexible and adaptable concept. The cases in the United States provide a useful indication of judicial views upon whether the public interest requires that the law should treat an accomplice as guilty of murder when another accomplice accidentally kills himself or herself during the commission of a serious crime.""

 

 

31In more recent times, convictions have been obtained in California in not dissimilar circumstances (The People v James (1998) 62 Cal App 4th 244,

White v Chrones (D Cal, EDCV 06-329, 21 September 2009), The People v Schaefer (2004) 118 Cal App 4th 893). These cases were not subject to argument and must be treated with the same reserve of which McGarvie and O'Bryan JJ spoke in 1989. They are cases decided under different criminal statutes and in the context of a substantially different legal system. References in the cases (for example, White v Chrones) to ""strict liability"" and ""inherent dangerousness"" are difficult to reconcile with the common law and statute law of New South Wales. The offences were described as ""second-degree felony murder"" which is not an offence known to the law of New South Wales (although the elements appear to fit within s 18).

 

Constructive murder under s 18 does not require an offence of violence

32A peculiarity in the version of the murder felony rule as created in s 18 of the Crimes Act is that the foundational offence is not required to be an offence of violence. This distinguishes it from the Victorian provision [s 3A(1)] considered in R v Demirian and the current formulation of that section which was amended in 1991. It is also a departure from the common law which required the felony to be an offence involving violence or at least to be ""dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death"". See also s 302(1)(b) Criminal Code (Qld) 1899 and the analysis of the development of the law in Ryan v The Queen at 240-241 (Windeyer J).

 

33The second reading speech introducing the amendment that led to the omission of the words ""of an act obviously dangerous to life"" shows that the purpose of the amendment was to foster certainty. The then Minister of Justice said that ""three different lines of interpretation have been applied by the courts to this concept, and the committee is unanimously of the opinion that, according to which of these lines is adopted, the concept either unnecessarily increases the Crowns difficulties of proof, or is mere surplusage, or operates with unreasonable harshness against the accused"" (New South Wales Legislative Assembly Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 13 March 1974 at 1355-6).

 

34The New South Wales Law Reform Commission's Report on Complicity [129] (2010) recommended at [5.83] an amendment to s 18 to provide that the foundational offence was one that, viewed objectively, was likely to endanger human life.

 

35The matter was also subject to a detailed discussion in the article ""Some Aspects of Constructive Murder in NSW"", Button and Babb, (2007) 31 Crim LJ 234. The article details some of the surprising outcomes that could arise in various hypothetical circumstances. As far as I can see, the article did not address the situation where the co-offender was killed as a result of his or her own act. The learned authors said that the law was in ""urgent need of reform"" but considered ""that in the current political climate, that is most unlikely.""

 

36The call for reform has been ignored. I approach the case on the basis of the law as it stands. To put it in the blunt but effective language of the learned Crown Prosecutor's written submissions:

""... those who engage in the commission of a crime carrying a penalty of 25 years or more should be held accountable for murder if the plan goes wrong. What the legislature is in fact saying is that those who create the conditions that activate this crime have to wear the consequences of having done so, and that is why the Crown does not have to prove intent. There is no element of violence in this offence.""

 

Possible conflict in the authorities as to proofs required for constructive murder

37In R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292 Carruthers J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Smart agreed) set out (at 297F) the elements required to be proved in a murder felony case where the foundational offence was armed robbery with wounding (s 98 Crimes Act):

""As to felony-murder (upon the assumption that the foundational crime was the offence under s 98) it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:

(i) that there was a common purpose between the appellant and Attard in company to rob John whilst Attard was, to the knowledge of the appellant, F armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun;

(ii) that during the course of the armed robbery Attard wounded John and during the course of such armed robbery with wounding or immediately thereafter, Attard discharged the gun causing the death of Nick;

(iii) that the discharge of the gun by Attard during or immediately after the armed robbery with wounding of John, was a contingency which the appellant had in mind, whether or not the gun was fired intentionally and whether or not in furtherance of the common unlawful purpose.

 

As to the final element, see especially the judgments of this Court in R v Johns [1978] 1 NSWLR 282, particularly at 294-295, where Begg J quotes with approval the directions of the trial judge.""

 

[My emphasis]

 

38It will be seen, from the emboldened portion of the above passage, that the Court held that a requirement for constructive murder was that the accused adverted to the possibility that the accomplice would shoot the victim. This accorded with the approach taken in R v Johns [1978] 1 NSWLR 282 at 287, 290 (Street CJ) and 294-295 (Begg J). The Court of Criminal Appeal applied the approach of Carruthers J in R v Spathis [2001] NSWCCA 476 [315] (Carruthers J, Hedyon and Smart AJ agreeing) and R v Jacobs [2004] NSWCCA 462; 151 A Crim R 452 at [223]. The Criminal Trials Bench Book published by the NSW Judicial Commission also adopts that approach at [5-1120]. However, the former Chief Justices' Forward should be borne in mind:

""It is appropriate to reiterate that the Bench Book does not contain an authoritative statement of the law.""

 

See also the comments of Spigelman CJ in Hong v R [2009] NSWCCA 242 at [31]-[35].

 

39The ""[importing] of a limited mental or fault element for constructive murder"" was questioned in the NSW Law Reform Commission Report 129 published in December 2010 [5.34]. It has also been the focus of a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Batcheldor v R [2014] NSWCCA 252. Hidden J (with whom Bathurst CJ agreed) discussed the authorities and at [79] questioned whether third element set out by Carruthers J in Sharah was required:

""However, the issue does not end there. In Johns the focus was upon the complicity of the secondary parties, especially the accessory before the fact, in the murder. The judgments did not deal in terms with the foundational offence of armed assault with intent to rob with wounding. However, in Sharah Carruthers J did address the offence of armed robbery with wounding, as follows (at 297-8):

'In relation to the s 98 count, it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:

 

(i) that there was a common purpose between the appellant and Attard in company to rob John whilst Attard was, to the knowledge of the appellant, armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off, double-barrelled shotgun;

 

(ii) that during the course of the armed robbery Attard wounded John;

 

(iii) that the appellant contemplated that in the carrying out of the common unlawful purpose of armed robbery such wounding might occur.'

 

This, of course, is in accordance with the statement of principle in the judgment of Street CJ in Johns which I have quoted above. To establish the appellant's guilt of the armed robbery with wounding it was necessary to establish not just that a wounding occurred, but also that the appellant contemplated a wounding as a possible incident of the criminal enterprise. Of course, if that were established his complicity in the murder (on the basis of constructive murder) would necessarily follow."" 

 

40In his additional comments (with which the Chief Justice also agreed) RA Hulme J explained that it appeared that the element of advertence had been imported into constructive murder from the requirements of proof in the common purposes cases. His Honour made the following comments:

""129. It is important to bear in mind that the foundational offence in Johns was armed assault with intent to rob with wounding (s 98 of the Crimes Act). The case is authority for the proposition that on the facts of that case an accessory before the fact, like a principal in the second degree, must be shown to have contemplated the possibility of the principal offender discharging his weapon in order to be liable for the foundational offence. If so, and regardless of whether the discharge of the weapon was intentional or accidental (but as to the latter, see Penza and Di Maria v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 21 at [167]), it would follow that a participant in either of those capacities would be liable for murder on a felony/constructive murder basis. Without foresight of the possibility of the weapon being discharged, the accessory before the fact and the principal in the second degree would not have foreseen the possibility of a wounding and would be not be guilty of the foundational offence, but merely of assault with intent to rob whilst armed (s 97), an offence that does not qualify as a foundational offence for constructive murder.

 

130. In Sharah, Carruthers J set out the elements of 'felony murder'. (Hidden J has quoted them out at [69].) His Honour cited the judgment of Begg J in Johns but added an element over and above those that were approved in Johns. He held that it was necessary for the Crown to prove all of the elements of the foundational offence and that the appellant foresaw a contingency that during or after the commission of that offence (including the wounding) that the gun would be discharged. For convenience I will repeat the third element (Sharah at 297F):

 

'(iii) that the discharge of the gun by Attard during or immediately after the armed robbery with wounding of John, was a contingency which the appellant had in mind, whether or not the gun was fired intentionally and whether or not in furtherance of the common unlawful purpose.'

...

132. The resolution of Ground 8 does not depend upon what was said in Sharah. Like Johns, this is a case in which proof of the liability of Ms Batcheldor for the foundational offence was all that was required to establish the mental element for constructive murder. The Crown conceded that there was a deficiency in the directions given as to the elements of the foundational offence. For the reasons given by Hidden J, I accept that this concession was well-founded.""

 

41While their Honour's questioned the necessity for the element of advertence, the Court did not specifically overrule the decision in Sharah. Hidden J at [76] said (in a slightly different context) that ""the decisions in Johns and Sharah have settled the law in this State"". In any event, unless the decision in Sharah is clearly overruled, trial Judges are bound to apply it.

 

42Taking the prosecution case at its highest, there is no evidence capable of supporting an inference that the accused in this case contemplated the possibility that somebody might be injured, let alone that they might die, in the course of the manufacturing process. However, these considerations and this possible conflict in the case law are not determinative of the application in the present case.

 

The foundational offence in the present case

43The foundational offence for the purpose of application of constructive murder in the present case is an offence of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The offence created by s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) is the offence of manufacturing a commercial quantity. By s 33(2) this offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. However, by s 33(3) where the court is satisfied that the amount of the drug is not less than the large commercial quantity, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life.

 

44In spite of the statutory framework, the accused concedes that the foundational offence relied upon by the Crown is ""a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years"".

 

45The Crown accepts that it must establish that the accused was aware of the possibility that the manufacture was in an amount exceeding the large commercial quantity. By Schedule 1, a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is 1.0kg.

 

Accessorial and derivative liability

46In Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; 247 CLR 265 the respondent (Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions) invited the High Court to ""sweep away all of the out-dated distinctions between principals and accessories in favour of a single coherent principle underlying the law of complicity"". The High Court declined the invitation at [27] (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) and [42-]-[43] (Heydon J). Heydon J alluded to the ""radicalism of that submission"". The whole Court was of the opinion that it was unnecessary and inappropriate to deal with the issue because the appellant's argument failed on other grounds.

 

47The appellant had argued [24] that he could not be guilty of murder based on an ""accessorial case"" because the Crown had accepted pleas of guilty to less serious offences in relation to the principal offenders. The Court rejected that submission. What the Crown had to prove was not that the principals had been convicted of murder, but that the evidence supported the fact that they were guilty of murder (at [24]). The joint judgment at [22]-[23] explained ""the common law distinctions between categories of participation namely principals, accessories before the fact, accessories at the fact [ie principals in the second degree] and accessories after the fact"".

 

48A person present at the scene of a crime assisting or encouraging its commission is described as a principal in the second degree or (in earlier times and sometimes still) as an accessory at the fact. The criminal liability of such an offender is derivative and she cannot be guilty of the crime unless the principal is guilty of that crime. As the High Court explained in Likiardopoulos, this does not turn on the conviction of the principal but on the evidence establishing the guilt of the principal offenders.

 

49The principle that the liability of a principal in the second degree is derivative is fundamental and was explained in R v Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29; 53 NSWLR 480 by Wood CJ at CL at [68]:

""It needs to be borne in mind that the liability of a principal in the first degree is primary (Osland at para 72) and is not derived from that of another principal, while that of a principal in the second degree is derivative and depends upon the guilt of the principal in the first degree being established; Dunn (1930) 30 SR (NSW) 210 and Osland at p 71."" 

 

Mutual drug use and supply cases

50Another series of analogous cases are those involving allegations of manslaughter arising from either the supply of drugs or mutual drug use. There is a series of cases in England, and a Scottish case which takes a different approach. These cases were collected and considered by the High Court in the case of Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334.

 

51In Burns v The Queen, the accused was convicted of manslaughter in circumstances where she had supplied methadone to the deceased who died after injecting the drug. The Crown case was put in the alternative - manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act or criminal negligence. The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal against the conviction. The High Court quashed the conviction and entered a verdict of acquittal.

 

52French CJ said:

""11. There may be a case for specific legislation to cover culpable drug induced homicide. It is undesirable to strain the criteria for liability for involuntary manslaughter at common law in order to cover drug-related deaths at the margins of those criteria.

 

12. The application of the common law criterion of unlawful and dangerous act to drug supply and injection cases in the United Kingdom has varied and evolved, reflecting the difficulties which particular cases can throw up. R v Cato concerned consensual but unlawful injection of a user which resulted in his death and was sufficient to establish liability without a separate consideration of dangerousness. The consent of the deceased was not a defence and there was no suggestion that it might be relevant to causation. In R v Dalby the accused supplied a drug to the deceased who injected himself. The Court of Appeal identified as a 'difficulty' the fact that the supply of the drug was not an act which caused 'direct' harm. The Court said:

'the supply of drugs would itself have caused no harm unless the deceased had subsequently used the drugs in a form and quantity which was dangerous.'

Dalby was 'explained' in Goodfellow as 'intending to say... that there must be no fresh intervening cause between the act and the death.' R v Dias resembled Dalby. The accused had handed a syringe containing heroin to the deceased who self-injected and died. Holding that the supply of the heroin was not an 'unlawful and dangerous act', the Court of Appeal said that the deceased was an adult who could decide for himself whether or not to inject the heroin:

'His own action in injecting himself might well have been seen as an intervening act between the supply of the drug by the defendant and the death of [the deceased].'

 

13. Dalby and Dias were referred to with approval by the House of Lords in R v Kennedy (No 2) [31]. There, their Lordships said [32]:

'the act of supplying, without more, could not harm the deceased in any physical way, let alone cause his death.'

 

That observation was underpinned by a particular view of the criminal law as generally assuming the existence of free will:

'generally speaking, informed adults of sound mind are treated as autonomous beings able to make their own decisions how they will act'.

That view was supported by reference to statements by Glanville Williams and Hart and Honoreè, which are quoted in the joint judgment. Exceptions were acknowledged in the case of young people, those not fully responsible for their acts, the vulnerable and those subject to circumstances of duress, necessity, deception and mistake. The exceptions were treated by their Lordships as matters relevant to causation. They were also at least arguably relevant to whether the supply of drugs to another creates, by reason of an attribute or condition or circumstance of the other, ""an appreciable risk of serious injury"".

14. The House of Lords in Kennedy (No 2) was asked the question:

'When is it appropriate to find someone guilty of manslaughter where that person has been involved in the supply of a class A controlled drug, which is then freely and voluntarily self-administered by the person to whom it was supplied, and the administration of the drug then causes his death?'

 

The answer given by their Lordships was:

'In the case of a fully-informed and responsible adult, never.'

 

The absolute character of that answer directs attention to the cautious oxymoron 'never say never'. It is as much applicable to the law as other spheres of life and more so when it relates to an apparently normative statement based upon a narrow factual hypothesis. The joint judgment in this case however applies the proposition, which I accept, that underpins the reasoning in Royall v The Queen: 'that the voluntary and informed act of an adult negatives causal connection'.

...

47. As explained in the joint reasons and noted above, it was not open to exclude as a reasonable possibility that the deceased injected himself with the methadone and that his decision to do so was voluntary. For present purposes therefore, the existence of a duty of care relevant to criminal negligence must be determined on the hypothesis, which cannot be excluded, that the deceased did so inject himself. That possibility, which cannot be excluded, marks a point of distinction between this case and cases in which the accused has created a danger to other people, for example by starting a fire, and thereafter failing to take any steps to remove the danger or warn those at risk of the danger.

 

48. If the deceased had ingested the drug himself and had rebuffed a suggestion that an ambulance be called, there could be no basis to support a finding that Mrs Burns owed a duty to him. On that hypothesis, which cannot be excluded, the deceased had created the danger to himself. While Mrs Burns may well have been under a strong moral duty to take positive steps to dissuade him from leaving until medical assistance could be called, there was, in the circumstances, no legal duty, breach of which would support a finding of criminal negligence. For these reasons, and the reasons given in the joint judgment, I agree that there should not be a new trial.""

 

53Gummow, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ spoke about the issue of causation:

""86. The analysis of the causation of homicide in Royall v The Queen is posited on an acceptance that the voluntary and informed act of an adult negatives causal connection. Absent intimidation, mistake or other vitiating factor, what an adult of sound mind does is not in law treated as having been caused by another. The introduction of the concept of the predictable response of the sane adult actor would radically change the rationale for and the nature of the causal inquiry. Neither party invited this Court to endorse that approach.

87. The deceased was a sane adult. It is not suggested that his decision to take the methadone was vitiated by mistake or duress. His ability to reason as to the wisdom of taking methadone is likely to have been affected by the drugs that he had already taken but this is not to deny that his act was voluntary and informed. It was informed because he knew that he was taking methadone. He chose to take methadone not knowing what effect that drug would have in combination with the drugs he had already taken. A foolish decision to take a prohibited drug not knowing its likely effects is nonetheless the drug taker's voluntary and informed decision.""

 

THE EVIDENCE

54The evidence is relatively confined and, in general terms, consists of:

(i)The observations and findings made by police and fire fighters at the premises during their search and examination on 4 and 5 January 2013.

 

(ii)The results of the forensic and scientific analysis (fingerprints, DNA and chemical/drug) of various items of evidence found during the search.

 

(iii)The finding of a sum of money at other premises where the accused was living.

 

(iv)Evidence establishing the accused's ownership of the premises and two cars that were parked outside of the premises.

 

(v)Expert opinion evidence as to the possible causes of the fire and conclusions that can be drawn from the chemicals and drugs found at the premises.

 

(vi)Statements made by the accused to investigating police.

 

(vii)The observations of two neighbours as to smelling unusual odours emanating from the vicinity of the premises.

 

55Twenty six witnesses gave evidence in the Crown case and there are twenty five prosecution exhibits. I have considered all of the evidence and examined the inferences that arise from the material.

 

Firearms and cash

56It is unnecessary for present purposes to detail the evidence relating to the firearms charges (counts 3, 4, 5 and 6). Four items were found at the premises, either within the house or in one of the cars outside, that fall within the definition of pistol (three) or prohibited weapon (one, a 20 round magazine). There are certificates that show that neither IL nor Mr Lan were authorised to own the firearms. The guns that bore serial numbers were not registered. As the owner of the premises or car in which the firearms were located, there is an onus on IL to prove that she did not know (or could not reasonably have known) that the firearms were there or that she was not in possession of the firearms (s 4A Firearms Act 1996 (NSW)).

 

57As I understand it, the residual relevance of the firearms is that they indicate the existence of a criminal enterprise consistent with that alleged by the Crown. A similar inference can be drawn from the finding of a large sum of cash ($346,812.55). Most of that cash was found at the premises but the total also included a significant sum ($16,900) found at IL's residence.

 

Evidence of drug manufacture at the premises 

58A forensic chemist, Dr Coghlan, gave uncontested evidence that in his opinion the premises were being used for the final stage of the manufacture of methylamphetamine. In short, the process involved the purification of the base product (which was manufactured elsewhere). The purification was done by means of an evaporation process. The product was placed in a solvent (in this case, acetone) with a little water and heat was applied until the liquid reached boiling point. As the liquid evaporated, impurities were removed and the amount of pure methylamphetamine increased in the substance that remained. After the boiling process the mixture of solid and liquid was allowed to cool, seemingly to room temperature and then in a fridge in the kitchen. The solid was then drained from liquid or removed by using a sieve or similar item. It was then allowed to dry.

 

59The evidence that the premises were being used for drug manufacture is extremely strong. The issue does not seem to be in contest. In point form, the material located at the premises included:

(i)In excess of 6 kg of methylamphetamine in solid form (crystals, salts or powder) in varying purities. Dr Coghlan said that where the purity of substance was high (over 80%); it suggested that the substance had gone through the extraction or evaporation process. Where the substance was of low purity (below 20%); it suggested that the substance was yet to undergo the purifying evaporation process or (in one case) that the purified substance had been ""cut"" in preparation for sale.

 

(ii)Evidence of more than 70 litres of acetone. Most of this was comprised of empty (already used) tins and bottles of acetone. There were a few full (unused) bottles remaining but most of the solvent had already been used.

 

(iii)Various receptacles containing a combination of liquids and solids. When drained the solids contained a percentage of methylamphetamine which varied from item to item. Some (those with low purities of the drug) indicated that the process was in its early stage with heat yet to be applied. Others (those with a high purity of drug) suggested that the process had already occurred and that the substance was in the process of cooling.

 

(iv)Various liquids also tested positive for low purities of methylamphetamine. The presence of methylamphetamine suggested that these liquids had been used in the evaporation process.

 

(v)A number of utensils that would typically be used in the extraction process. These included large metal pots, sieves, a Buchner funnel and associated vacuum flask and pump, plastic buckets, latex gloves, thermometers and a gas burner. There were also chopsticks, which can be used to control the boiling process. Many of these items were found with the liquid and/or solid substances containing methylamphetamine.

 

Evidence connecting IL to the drug manufacture

60The evidence allows an inference to be drawn that IL was somehow involved in the manufacturing process. This evidence includes:

(i)Her ownership of the premises.

 

(ii)Her presence at the premises at the time of the fire.

 

(iii)A Bunnings Warehouse receipt dated 1 January 2013 was found in a Prada handbag containing personal items connected with IL. The receipt included the purchase of two 4 litre containers of Acetone.

 

(iv)DNA was located on a latex glove found within the premises which contained a mixture of DNA. IL could not be excluded as the minor contributor to the mixture of DNA on the glove.

 

(v)The material associated with the manufacture was throughout the house. The Crown says that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a person present at the premises to be oblivious to the process.

 

Evidence of drug manufacture in the bathroom

61The evidence showed that there was a gas bottle and gas burner in the bathroom along with a pot containing a liquid. For reasons which are unexplained, the pot and the liquid were not subject to analysis.

 

62Dr Coghlan gave evidence that he was ""unable to say what process was occurring in the bathroom"".

 

63The Crown says that the evidence of the other things found in the house, and the unusual circumstance that there was a gas bottle and burner in the bathroom, allows the jury to draw an inference that something was happening in the bathroom that constituted part of the manufacturing process. He relies, amongst other things, on the evidence of Dr Coghlan that ""we find gas burners all the time at labs"".

 

64While I accept the Crown's submission, the fact is that the failure to test the items in the bathroom is a remarkable and significant oversight on the part of the investigators. The Crown Prosecutor suggested (T 398) that ""it seems that there was, to put it kindly, a misunderstanding between two different agencies as to who was to assume responsibility for this.""

 

Evidence of the cause of the fire or explosion

65There is a similar lack of evidence in relation to the cause and origin of the fire. After the Crown Prosecutor referred to the misunderstanding between the agencies he went on (T 398) ""your Honour will see I think on the firsthand that Spouszta, who was the Fire Officer, didn't do the excavation he must have assumed the police were, and I think vice versa."" An excavation is a forensic process whereby layers of the debris within a fire site are removed layer by layer ""so that you can find the lowest level of burning and identify any other pieces of evidence that may indicate what the cause of the fire was"" (T 228). This was not done in the present case.

 

66The first witness in the trial was Detective Sergeant Agius. He gave evidence of the inspection he carried out at the premises on 5 January 2013. A folder of photographs that he took became exhibit A. Based on his experience in investigating fires, he gave evidence of his opinions as to the possible processes and cause(s) of the fire. The centrepiece of his evidence was (T60-61):

""My opinions and conclusions are as follows: The fire commenced in the bathroom. It is unable to be determined what process caused the ignition of the fire due to the numerous possibilities. These possibilities include, but cannot be limited to, heat from the ignited gas ring igniting an object, ignition of vapours by the gas ring, ignition of vapours with the lighter, ignition of vapours by spark caused by an electric fan or a part arc in the light switch. 

...

In my opinion there is no evidence to suggest a vapour or gas explosion. I'm unable to determine if the fire is accidental or deliberate."" 

 

67In terms of the process that caused the ignition of the fire, Mr Agius said ""there were numerous scenarios that could not be excluded"" (T67). He went on (T69-72):

""Q. Now, I'm going to take you to the last page of your statement, this is part of paragraph 38, sergeant, where you raise a number of possibilities? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. About the fire. The first is that the ignited gas ring ignited an object? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. That's, I suggest to you, on the very top of page 22? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Is that so? 

A. Yes, that's correct. 

 

Q. The gas ring that we're talking about, that is the one on the floor? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. On which when you come in there's a pot and so forth? 

A. That's correct. 

 

Q. Is there any evidence then that has ignited any object there? 

A. There were objects surrounding that gas ring, being the plastic bucket and various other items which can't be excluded from being in that close proximity to it, just due to the fact mattress placed on top and removed items and there was debris, but there was nothing that excluded that possibility. 

 

Q. If the mattress was brought in for the purposes of smothering the fire, then it may be, may it not, that things were moved slightly where they were in the bathroom? 

A. That's correct. 

 

Q. The second possibility that you give is the ignition of vapours by the gas ring? 

A. Yes, that's correct. 

 

Q. So basically we're saying both that first one and the second one, the gas ring is on, it is burning? 

A. Yes, that's correct. 

 

Q. The third possibility that you give is ignition of vapours with the lighter. Do I assume when you use the term ""lighter"" that you're referring to that gun on the floor in the shape of a gun but it is a lighter? 

A. That's correct. 

 

Q. Does this possibility that you raise there presume, in fact, that then the burner is not on; it's off? 

A. It may have not been ignited, yes. 

 

Q. Is that because, I mean, in terms of the burner itself, are you able to give me some sort of idea about the diameter of it? 

A. It was about 38, 35 centimetres in diameter. 

 

Q. Does that mean that if it were on, that would be the primary source of ignition? 

A. Yes. The burner itself did exhibit on a sign on it, saying it had auto ignition; although when I tested that, it wasn't operating again but that could have been due to exposure to high heat and fire in general. The large amount of the water in the environment and debris could have contaminated and stopped that feature from working, so. 

 

Q. So lastly, you raise two possibilities, and I will just read it here, there is ignition of vapours by spark arc, you put in brackets electric fan arc in light switch; correct? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. So we understand what you mean by that, the electric fan, what you're referring to then, what we have previously been discussing as being on the floor of the bathroom, that thing that has fallen down? 

A. Yes, that's correct. 

 

Q. Parting arc and a light switch, does that mean the light switch that turns the light in the room on and off? 

A. Yes, that is correct. 

 

Q. In terms of those possibilities, for either of them to be the case, are you making an assumption or not that the gas burner is off? 

A. Yes, I am. And I am also assuming that there's vapours within the room from a volatile liquid that could have been ignited. 

 

Q. In terms of the light switch itself, I don't think that we have a photograph of that in the series that you have taken there? 

A. No, there isn't. 

 

Q. Can you, for the record, tell us where it was located.

A. It was a two gang switch, means it had two switches on it and it was located on the, looking at the door jam from the outside, on the right hand side, standard type sort of midway. 

 

Q. So it's on the inside of the bathroom? 

A. Yes, on the inside. 

 

Q. Did you examine it at all? 

A. Yes I did. I did look at the light switch. 

 

Q. I will come back to that. The other possibility that you raise is some sort of a spark in the electric fan, that is the exhaust fan that is in the cavity in the roof; right? 

A. Sorry, can you repeat that question?

 

Q. The other possibility you have raised here concerns the electric fan, the exhaust fan as I understand it that you are saying was in the ceiling, in that rectangular cavity? 

A. That is correct. 

 

Q. If either of those possibilities were the case, would you expect to see any evidence of it? 

A. I would, if the light switch was an ignition point, I would have expected to have found some thermal damage to the light switch itself. And more than likely evidence of a vapour sole explosion. Although, you can have an ignition of vapours without an explosion. Just a quick - where the vapours reach their flash point where they are ignited. So I didn't see any signs that that was there, but I can't exclude that. 

 

Q. You are only talking now about the light switch, or about the fan as well? 

A. In regards to the damage to the fan, it suffered thermal damage from being up high within the compartment, where the heat is going to naturally accumulate, because hot air rises, hot gases rise, which is going to cause thermal damage to that fan. So any evidence that that had been an ignition point is going to be destroyed by that thermal damage through the progression of the fire. 

 

Q. In terms of the light switch being a possible cause, that is the arcing there? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. How likely or unlikely is that scenario then in your view? 

A. In my view, based on what I saw, I think it's highly unlikely that that was an ignition scenario. 

 

Q. Does that translate into any percentage, or something like that? 

A. In my experience, and from what I know about compartment fire investigation and electrics playing a part in that, I would say probably less than a 5 per cent chance in this ignition scenario. 

 

Q. What about the electric fan or the exhaust fan? 

A. Again based on the absence of evidence of a vapour explosion, seeing that it's highly mounted, you would have needed a for the room to have a higher level of vapour for it to encapsulate the whole compartment. I think it's a highly unlikely scenario that that has occurred. 

 

Q. Does that have the same percentage attaching to it or not? 

A. Probably lower. Less than 5 per cent.""

 

68 In cross-examination (T79) he was asked:

""Q. Detective, you didn't observe any evidence that the gas ring burner was lit prior to the ignition of the fire; correct? 

A. Not that it was alight, no.""

 

69He was also cross-examined about the possibility of a gas leak causing the fire (T79):

""Q. In paragraph 31 of your statement you say: ""The LPG tank valve was loose and felt to be partially open""? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Well was the tank valve itself loose? 

A. The valve knob would probably be a more accurate description than as in the control knob that opens the valve and closes it, and felt loose. It wasn't firmly shut. 

 

Q. But as a general proposition, loose gas fittings are potentially dangerous, aren't they? 

A. The actual knob being loose, I don't think would be dangerous. If the valve itself was loose in the body, yes gas could escape, but in this case the knob itself was loose and, as in my meaning, it wasn't firmly shut. 

 

Q. Can that partially loose valve result in gas leaking from the LPG tank without being ignited? 

A. In this case, it would gas would have been it wasn't firmly shut, so gas would have been travelling through the hose to the ring. And yes, gas could escape from that ring without being ignited. 

 

Q. And can it ignite without the intervention, without any human act, for example an electrical fault? 

A. It can, but it's very uncommon.""

 

70A photograph of the control of the gas unit (Ex A, photograph 73) is ambiguous as to whether the unit was on or off. Using a clock face to describe the photograph, the ""off position"" is at 12 o'clock while the ""on"" position is at 9 o'clock. The switch is at around 11:45. It is clearly not in the ""off"" position but it is closer to that position than it is to the ""on"" position. Mr Agius was asked about this:

""Q. Back to photograph number 73 Detective, the control knob, as you have told us is situated slightly left of the 'off' position? 

A. Yes, that's correct. 

 

Q. Detective, did you conduct any tests of the ring burner to see if gas would flow past the control knob to the element with the knob slightly left of 'off'? 

A. I didn't on this specific burner. It had been exposed to hazardous materials and asbestos, so I couldn't conduct experiments on this burner, although I have tried various other burners, and until the ring is in the total 'off' position some gas will still exit the burner.""

 

71The first fire fighters into the premises were Scott Tipping and Christopher Hughes. Mr Tipping gave evidence that he saw ""a cooking pot with an unknown substance in it, well alight next to a gas cylinder"" (T207). The pot can be seen in photographs 67-68 in Ex 1. Mr Hughes said he could see no fuel sources other than the gas cylinder (T224).

 

72Benjamin Spouszta is a fire investigator with Fire and Rescue New South Wales. He did not enter the bathroom to undertake an excavation of the site to determine the cause of the fire (T228). He gave evidence as to various departures from safety standards and (T231):

""Clandestine drug laboratories by their very nature are highly volatile and likely to ignite in a variety of normally benign environments. Accidental ignition is far more likely in these circumstances than what would normally be found within a properly regulated commercial or domestic situation.""

 

73None of the evidence is capable of establishing that the fire or explosion was a deliberate act on the part of either the deceased or the accused. The evidence of their respective injuries suggests that it was the deceased, rather than the accused, who committed the act or omission that led to the fire. As to that matter, it is the Crown case that the act causing death was the lighting of the ring burner (T 30, 394, 400).

 

74There is nothing in the evidence that would allow an inference to be drawn that the fire was deliberately set. It was, on any rational view of the evidence, a misadventure caused by incompetence or carelessness on the part of the deceased and/or the accused.

 

DIRECTED VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY: MURDER 

75The starting point, as has been emphasised in cases such as Ryan v The Queen and Penza and Di Maria, is to identify with precision the act that the jury might find caused the death of Mr Lan. Ultimately, that is a jury question. However, it is not sufficient simply to put the case on the basis that ""the whole conduct of the [accused] from the inception of [her] exploit as the act causing death"" (Ryan at 220; Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378 at 386 (Mason CJ)).

 

76In the present case, the Crown Prosecutor identifies the lighting of the ring burner as the act causing the death. Of course, there is a preliminary problem arising from the evidence of the Crown's own expert that he cannot say whether the burner was in fact alight. That, in itself, may be sufficient to compel a directed verdict. However, I will proceed on the basis of an acceptance of the Crown's submission that the jury might draw an inference that the burner was alight in spite of the evidence of Mr Agius.

 

77The Crown concedes that it cannot establish who (if anybody) lit the burner. In other words, the case will be put to the jury on the basis that it may have been the deceased himself who lit the burner. Once this is accepted, the question that arises is whether the act of the deceased can be attributed to the accused and on what legal basis.

 

78The Crown says that it is as simple as applying principles of common purpose or joint criminal enterprise. In other words, if the act of lighting burner was an act in furtherance of the common purpose, the accused is criminally responsible for that act. The defence says that, once it is accepted that the act causing death was the act of the deceased himself (or that this possibility cannot be excluded), the criminal liability of the accused for murder is derivative and, because the deceased cannot be guilty of his own murder, the accused cannot be guilty as a principal in the second degree.

 

79There is a flaw in the Crown's argument concerning the applicability of the principles of common purpose. In McAuliffe v The Queen the High Court explained the operation of the principle. The liability of one offender for the actions of the other was not put as an open-ended proposition whereby each is simply held to be responsible for every act committed by the other. Rather, it was explained (at 114):

""If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.""

 

80In this case, the crime of which IL is alleged to be guilty is the crime of murder. It cannot be said that the deceased did all those things necessary to constitute that crime in accordance with the agreement.

 

81The Crown eschews reliance on what was described in Clayton v The Queen (at [14] and [20]) as ""extended common purpose"" (which makes the parties to the agreement liable for ""any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose"" (McAuliffe at 114). The Crown says that it is unnecessary to rely on that principle because the act of lighting the burner was an act done in furtherance of the agreement to manufacture drugs. In any event, for extended common purpose to apply, it is necessary to establish ""foresight of the possibility"" that the other party would act with the requisite intent to commit the crime (in this case murder or manslaughter) said to be within the scope of the common purpose. That is clearly not this case.

 

82I accept the submission of Mr Pontello that the criminal liability of the accused is derivative. Properly analysed, if the accused is liable for murder, she is liable as a principal in the second degree. That is, she was present at the scene and (allegedly) ""aiding and abetting"" the commission of the crime (of manufacture). The deceased could not be convicted of his own murder. The offence of suicide was long ago abolished and there is no evidence capable of establishing that he acted with the requisite specific intent. This approach accords with the approach taken by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Demirian.

 

83The situation may be different if an innocent third party had been killed. Central to my decision is the fact that the victim (deceased) is the person who committed the act leading to death. He cannot be guilty of his own murder and thus the derivative liability of the accused cannot be established.

 

84As Mr Pontello submitted (T 388-390, 402), the structure of s 18 may also be important. The first reference to ""the accused"" in s 18 is in reference to the act causing death. Thus, the act must be hers (or one for which she is responsible by operation of the law). When the accused is mentioned in the constructive murder part of the section, the reference is to an act done ""by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her"". Mr Pontello submitted (T 402):

""I make the submission again that where the accused is first referred to in s18 as having committed the act [causing] the death charged, that means the accused committed the act either himself or herself, or pursuant to common law principles of complicity as discussed.""

 

85I do not accept that the combination of principles of common purpose and constructive murder work together to make IL liable to conviction for murder in the circumstances of the present case. Whether the situation may be different where the deceased person was not the one who committed the act or where the death was of an innocent victim is not necessary to decide in the circumstances of this case.

 

86I have reached the conclusion that there is no evidence capable of establishing the charge of murder. Accordingly I propose to direct the jury to acquit.

 

87In those circumstances, it is unnecessary for me now to deal with the second part of the accused's submission, which concerns the question of causation. I will deal with that in considering the application for a directed verdict on the alternative charge of manslaughter.

 

DIRECTED VERDICT: MANSLAUGHTER

88The Crown's case for manslaughter is based on an allegation of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. The elements of this form of the offence have been discussed in cases such as Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313 and The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67. The relevant act causing death must be both unlawful and also dangerous. Dangerousness is an objective concept. It must be established that, objectively, the act carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury (see Wilson v The Queen at 333 (Mason CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)).

 

89The Crown relied on the judgment of Judge Haesler SC in R v Dagger. However, that was an application to quash an indictment or to permanently stay the proceedings. Different considerations arose. His Honour noted (at p 14) that there was only a limited amount of factual material before him and (at p 15) contemplated a number of possibilities that might arise once the evidence was adduced. These included, at one extreme, that the deceased was solely responsible for the manufacture and (thus) his own death and, at the other, that the deceased was simply a casual visitor to the premises. I also agree with Mr Pontello that the reference (at p 9) to R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; 110 A Crim R 198 as authority for the proposition that ""ordinary principles of joint criminal enterprise can make one co-offender liable for the acts of another even if the co-offender suffers as a result of his own action"" is inapposite, if not misconceived, in a case such as the present. The so called ""co-offender"" (deceased) in R v Cramp was a 16 year old who the appellant provided with alcohol and encouraged to drive at excessive speed. She was not the ""fully-informed and responsible adult"" of whom the House of Lords spoke in R v Kennedy (No 2) [2008] AC 269. In R v Cramp, the appellant was not liable for conviction of manslaughter on the basis of the child's act but because of his acts in allowing her to drive, in encouraging her to speed and in providing her with alcohol. I am unable to derive very much assistance from the judgment refusing to stay the indictment in R v Dagger.

 

90In the present case, the prosecution alleges that the accused and the deceased were together involved in an activity that was unlawful and objectively dangerous. It may be that to establish the charge of manslaughter, the Crown does not need to focus with such precision on the act that gives rise to derivative liability for constructive murder.

 

91However, even accepting that to be so, if the act causing death was the act of the deceased, a question arises as to causation. Earlier in this judgment, I outlined the circumstances in which the High Court entered a verdict of acquittal in the case of Burns v The Queen. In the present case, the accused submits that the act relied upon by the Crown was an act that was committed by the deceased himself. It is more correct to say that the learned Crown Prosecutor concedes that it cannot prove who committed that act.

 

92Again, I will put to one side the deficiencies in the investigation of the cause of the fire and the activity in the bathroom and the problems in proving that the burner was alight at the time of the fire (as to which see above at [68] and the cross-examination of Mr Agius at T 79).

 

93In Burns v The Queen, the joint judgment noted at [88]:

""The Crown submitted that the appropriate consequential order was for a new trial at which it should be permitted to present a case on manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act based on the appellant's alleged complicity in injecting the deceased with methadone. This appeal is not the occasion to consider the responsibility for manslaughter, of a person who assists an adult at the adult's request with the administration of a prohibited drug. Nor is it necessary to consider whether the Crown should be permitted to run a new case relying on a different unlawful act. This is because the evidence at the trial was not capable of establishing the appellant's complicity in injecting, or assisting to inject, the deceased with the drug. The Court of Criminal Appeal's conclusion to the contrary was based upon a misunderstanding of a concession made by the appellant"".

 

94Their Honours went on (at [90] and [92]) to explain that the evidence as to how the methadone was taken was unclear. It those circumstances it was not appropriate to order a re-trial to allow the Crown to conduct a case that was different to the case presented at trial. This was not because of the unfairness in allowing that course but because the evidence would not have permitted a finding that the appellant and the deceased had acted together in injecting the methadone.

 

95The joint judgment at [81] noted the reference by the House of Lords (in R v Kennedy (No 2) at 275) to the following observation of Professor Williams in his article ""Finis for Novus Actus"", Cambridge Law Journal, Vol 48 (1989) 391 at 392.

""I may suggest reasons to you for doing something; I may urge you to do it, tell you I will pay you to do it, tell you it is your duty to do it. My efforts may perhaps make it very much more likely that you will do it. But they do not cause you to do it, in the sense in which one causes a kettle of water to boil by putting it on the stove. Your volitional act is regarded (within the doctrine of responsibility) as setting a new 'chain of causation' going, irrespective of what has happened before.""

 

96Their Honours concluded at [86]:

""The analysis of the causation of homicide in Royall v The Queen is posited on an acceptance that the voluntary and informed act of an adult negatives causal connection. Absent intimidation, mistake or other vitiating factor, what an adult of sound mind does is not in law treated as having been caused by another. The introduction of the concept of the predictable response of the sane adult actor would radically change the rationale for and the nature of the causal inquiry. Neither party invited this Court to endorse that approach.""

 

97While it is open to the jury in the present case to find that the act of the deceased was an act in furtherance of the common purpose alleged by the Crown, there is no evidence to suggest that the accused and the deceased acted together in lighting the burner. The case is not analogous to the situation (not resolved by the High Court) where two drug users inject one another with a dangerous drug.

 

98The evidence is not capable of excluding the possibility that it was the act of the deceased that caused his own death. There is no evidence that the deceased was not acting voluntarily. There is no evidence that he was other than a fully informed and responsible adult.

 

99I have therefore concluded that there is no evidence capable of establishing the guilt of the accused in relation to the alternative charge of manslaughter and the jury will be directed accordingly.

 

POST SCRIPT

100Since delivering this judgment on 2 December 2014, I have formed the view that the causation issue that led me to direct a verdict of acquittal in relation to the manslaughter charge is equally applicable to the murder charge. This point had been made in a footnote in Mr Pontello's helpful written submissions and his submission was directed to both forms of homicide charged in the second count. The High Court's decision in Burns v The Queen arose in relation to a manslaughter charge but was not restricted to cases of manslaughter (see [86] where the joint reasons referred to ""the analysis of causation of homicide in Royall v The Queen is posited on an acceptance that the voluntary and informed act of an adult negatives causal connection."").

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:

The applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced on the following counts:

 

Count 1 - Between about 1 July 1997 and 23 May 2001 at Sydney NSW and elsewhere she did conspire with Paul William Ernest Mascall, Leslie Ann Mascall and divers others to defraud the Commonwealth contrary to ss29B and 86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

 

Count 2 - Between about 24 May 2001 and 31 July 2005 at Sydney NSW and elsewhere she did conspire with Paul William Ernest Mascall, Leslie Ann Mascall and divers others with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to a third party, namely the Commonwealth, contrary to s135.4(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).

 

Count 3 - Between about 1 April 2001 and 23 May 2001 at Sydney NSW and elsewhere she did conspire with Jane Maria Sakovits and Ronald Rudolf Sakovits to defraud the Commonwealth, contrary to ss29D and 86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

 

Count 4 - Between about 24 May 2001 and 30 September 2006 at Sydney NSW and elsewhere she did conspire with Jane Maria Sakovits and Ronald Rudolf Sakovits with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to a third person, namely the Commonwealth, contrary to s135.4(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).

 

2Sentence proceedings were heard by Schmidt J on 30 August 2012 and her Honour passed sentence on 18 October 2012. The sentences imposed were as follows:

 

Count 1 - Imprisonment for 2 years, 6 months commencing on 18 October 2012 and expiring on 17 April 2015.

 

Count 2 - Imprisonment for 2 years, 6 months commencing on 18 April 2015 and expiring on 17 October 2017.

 

Count 3 - Imprisonment for 2 months and 2 weeks commencing on 21 October 2015 and expiring on 3 January 2016 (wholly concurrent with Count 2).

 

Count 4 - Imprisonment for 5 years and 2 weeks commencing on 4 January 2016 and expiring on 17 January 2021 (of which 1 year 10 months and 13 days were concurrent with Count 2).

 

3The resulting head sentence was 8 years and 3 months to date from 18 October 2012. Her Honour made a recognizance release order pursuant to which the applicant would be eligible for release after serving 4 years 11 months in custody. This reflected a ratio of 60 percent of the head sentence which her Honour arrived at having regard to ""special circumstances"".

 

4The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences on the following grounds:

 

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in the manner in which she took the schedule offences into account

 

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge made a mistake of fact in finding that the applicant received personal gain beyond the professional fees earned.

 

Ground 3 - The sentencing discretion miscarried as evidence now available demonstrates that the basis on which the discretion was exercised, namely that the applicant's medical conditions would be adequately treated in gaol and her forecast life expectancy, have been thwarted.

 

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to have adequate regard to the principle of equal justice.

 

Ground 5 - The sentence is otherwise manifestly excessive.

 

Factual background

 

5The applicant was operating a tax avoidance scheme, which sent profits from Australian companies to Vanuatu, disguised as legitimate payment for services. The funds were then distributed back to shareholders in Australia directly and indirectly. The general operation of the tax avoidance scheme is set out in the sentencing judgment at [21] - [31] (R v Liles [2012] NSWSC 1249.)

 

6Counts 1 and 2 relate to the ""Mascall"" conspiracy set out in more detail at [34] - [43] of the judgment on sentence. The applicant established the scheme in Vanuatu with Paul and Leslie Mascall in 1997. The Mascalls owned and operated a company which was the majority shareholder of the Australian company, Air Solutions International Pty Ltd. They along with three other Air Solutions directors were co-conspirators. Between June 1997 and April 2003 over $689,000 was sent by Air Solutions to Zax International Corporation, the Vanuatu company established for the scheme. Between June 2000 and May 2003 approximately $630,000 was distributed from Zax to Air Solutions shareholders' accounts.

 

7Paul Mascall and the applicant prepared Air Solutions' accounts and tax returns for the years ending June 1998 to June 2003, which treated the payments made to Zax as legitimate business expenses reducing the company's taxable income. The applicant prepared the personal tax returns for the Mascalls for each year during the charged period, except 1999 and prepared one of the other director's returns in 2000. The tax liabilities avoided by the scheme totalled $884,793.

 

8Counts 3 and 4 relate to the ""Sakovits"" conspiracy, set out in detail at [44] - [56] of the judgment on sentence. Jane and Ron Sakovits were the directors and shareholders of Inform Promotions Pty Ltd, the trustee of the discretionary trust of which they and their children were beneficiaries. In 2001 International Promotions Inc was incorporated in Vanuatu. Other subsidiary entities were established in Vanuatu with the assistance of the applicant for the purpose of carrying out the scheme, one of which was the International Prestige Promotions Trust. Between May 2001 and June 2006 Inform Promotions Pty Ltd paid $1,432,850 to International Prestige Promotions. Between August 2001 and July 2006 International Prestige Promotions transferred approximately $790,000 to bank accounts in Australia and approximately $141,600 cash was withdrawn from ATMs in Australia.

 

9The income tax returns and accounts for the family trust and Inform Promotions included false claims for deductible expenses. The applicant prepared loan documents and gave advice facilitating the scheme. She began providing Vanuatu bank account operation services through a Vanuatu company beneficially owned by the applicant and her husband after a falling out with the person who had previously provided this service. She provided written confirmation that the business they were conducting was not for tax avoidance purposes, and prepared the personal income tax returns for Jane Sakovits for the year ending June 2001 to June 2005 and Ron Sakovits for the years ending June 2005 and June 2006. The tax liabilities avoided by the scheme totalled $1,141,243.

 

10Each conspiracy was subject to two charges because of the introduction of a new statutory regime on 24 May 2001. The maximum penalty under s86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) was 20 years. The maximum penalty under the new regime, s135.4(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) was 10 years. The sentencing judge stated that the maximum penalty she would have regard to in respect of each conspiracy was 10 years, having regard to R v Ronen [2006] NSWCCA 123; 161 A Crim R 300 per Spigelman CJ at [76] and R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17.

 

11Two further offences relating to a third conspiracy, the ""Boughen and Cameron"" conspiracy were taken into account on a s16BA schedule:

 

(i)Conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth with Wayne Francis Cameron, Michael Boughen and divers others, contrary to s29D and 86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which was to be taken into account on Count 1.

 

(ii)Conspiracy to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth with Wayne Francis Cameron, Michael Boughen and divers others, contrary to s135.4(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), which was to be taken into account on Count 2.

 

12The details of the Boughen and Cameron conspiracy are set out in the judgment on sentence at [57] - [66]. Michael Boughen and his wife were directors of Concept Television Productions Pty Ltd. Wayne Cameron became a director in 1985 and the applicant was a director from 1993 to 1998. She prepared tax returns and accounts knowing that false claims were made for deductible expenses. The applicant advised as to the establishment and operation of entities, accounts and structures used in the scheme between 1 July 1997 and 31 July 2004 during which $2,080,421 was transferred by Concept Television to Universal Entertainment Corporation Ltd in Vanuatu. $2,264,622 was transferred out by Universal which was ultimately received by Boughen and Cameron.

 

13The applicant prepared Concept Television's accounts and tax returns and Boughen and Cameron's personal tax return claiming false expenses and failing to disclose payments received. The tax liabilities avoided by the scheme totalled $1,755,613.

 

Sentence Proceedings

 

14The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. The sentencing judge noted that this made it difficult to accept many of the submissions advanced on her behalf. The sentencing judge did have available a lengthy statement made by the applicant to the Federal Police of 30 May 2012 in which she set out her version of what had occurred.

 

15The applicant's professional history was relevant not only to her subjective case, but to the objective seriousness of the offending. She had commenced working as an accountant in 1979. She formed an association with the Vanuatu firm, Moores Rowland International, in the late 1980s and purchased a 30 percent share of that partnership. From 1994 until 1996 she was the President of the National Institute of Accountants and between 1993 and 1998 she had represented the Institute on the fringe benefit tax subcommittee of the National Tax Liaison Group, the peak consultative forum between the ATO and the tax profession. Her career suffered a setback in late 1998/9 when she was made bankrupt. In 2001 after being discharged from bankruptcy, she became a partner in an Australian firm in which she owned a 50 percent share. In 2002 she formed her own firm, Phoenix Accounting Group (Aus) Pty Ltd, of which she was a director.

 

16The conclusion arrived at by the sentencing judge was that the applicant was ""a well experienced senior practising accountant [who] was always very well aware of the illegality of her actions"". In her statement the applicant admitted that in 2006 when interviewed by the ATO in relation to her clients, she continued to assert that the scheme was legal in the hope that the ATO would accept her assertion. Even in 2007 she prepared financial statements and tax returns which reflected agency fees which had never been paid in order to reduce the taxable income of her clients.

 

17In relation to the seriousness of the offending the sentencing judge had regard to its consequences. Her Honour noted the considerable actual losses suffered by the revenue as well as the intangible losses caused to the Australian taxation system. Her Honour said:

 

""82 In this case, Ms Liles' understanding of the damage which her offending caused to the system is also unquestionable. This, together with the matters earlier referred to, cannot leave any doubt as to the seriousness of Ms Liles' offending and that it cannot be characterised in the way for which it was contended on her behalf. These were serious offences knowingly committed by a person well placed to conceal the offending from the investigating authorities, who on her own account took considerable steps to conceal what had been done, even when the offences became the subject of investigation.

 

83 There can be no question that there was personal gain from the offending, beyond the professional fees earned. After the falling out with Moores Rowland, Ms Liles clearly stepped into its shoes and then operated the scheme in its place, with the assistance of Mr Vasaris. This is an aspect of her conduct which may not be overlooked in assessing the seriousness of her offending.""

 

18Her Honour concluded that no sentence, other than a sentence of imprisonment, would be appropriate for the offending. In assessing the length of sentence her Honour had regard to the matters identified in s16A(2) of the Crimes Act, including the applicant's personal circumstances.

 

19Her Honour reviewed the applicant's personal circumstances. She was born in 1947 and was aged 65 at the time of sentence. Her 71 year old husband was unwell with multiple medical problems. The applicant was his principal carer. At the time of sentence she was at liberty on bail.

 

20Her Honour referred to a report of Dr Obeid, a consultant physician and geriatrician. This report indicated that the applicant was suffering from a number of serious chronic and ongoing medical problems for which she was being treated. They included hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesteroleamia, possible ischaemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, hepatitis, presumed irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and benign skin lesions. She had a family history of heart disease and cancer and had herself been treated for ovarian carcinoma some 25 years before sentence.

 

21Dr Obeid assessed the applicant as stressed, emotional and suffering from severe depression. When he examined her in June 2012 he opined that this had been brought on by the stress of her current legal situation. He thought that she was facing multiple cardio-vascular risk factors, was suffering symptoms of recurring chest pain and undiagnosed gastrointestinal symptoms. He gave her a life expectancy at that time of 7 years (compared with the normal life expectancy for a woman of that age of 21 years). He thought that her symptoms of panic, depression and anxiety would worsen with a custodial sentence.

 

22Her Honour found that there was no evidence as to what steps had been taken to arrange for appropriate care for the applicant while in prison. She noted that it was not suggested that the applicant's medical needs could not be met if she received a custodial sentence.

 

23The applicant was seen by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Stephen Allnutt. The history which he took was somewhat different to that of Dr Obeid. On that history the applicant had not been diagnosed with any major medical problems and had never been prescribed any psychiatric medication. He found that her mental state was stable. He took a history that, apart from what the applicant charged for her accounting services, she received no benefit from her offending. He concluded that the applicant was showing symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder.

 

24Her Honour set out her conclusions as follows:

 

""102 Ms Liles' mental state is what one might well expect of a person in her position, given the loss of her reputation, her profession and her business and that she is facing an extended term of imprisonment. That cannot mitigate the gravity of this offending, but the difficulty of her imprisonment, given her age, her physical and psychological health and her resulting reduced life expectancy, are all matters which must be properly taken into account in the sentencing exercise.""

 

25When considering general deterrence her Honour had regard to what the High Court said in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 where the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:

 

""63 The applicants' offending was sustained over a long time. It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies. The applicants acted out of personal greed. The amount of tax evaded was not small. Detection of offending of this kind is not easy. Serious tax fraud, which this was, is offending that affects the whole community. As was pointed out in Ruha, the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the recognizance release orders that were made.""

 

26Her Honour found that the scheme could not have operated as it did without the applicant's ongoing involvement. Her Honour noted that the applicant not only filed false tax returns, she provided advice, created documents and provided other services which facilitated the scheme's ongoing operation. Her Honour found that throughout she was active in devising steps to be taken to conceal the scheme from Australian and Vanuatu authorities. Her Honour specifically rejected that part of the submissions put forward on behalf of the applicant to the effect that she was ""trapped"" or that she felt ""obliged to remain involved"". Her Honour concluded that the sentences should include a strong element of general deterrence.

 

27Her Honour had regard to the sentences imposed on other offenders involved in the scheme, i.e. Messrs Hili and Jones, Mr Zerafa and Mr Agius. Having examined the roles of these persons, her Honour concluded that the offending of the applicant was closer to that of Mr Agius than those other persons.

 

28Her Honour was asked to take into account the applicant's plea of guilty and the assistance which she had provided to the authorities and was likely to provide in the future. Having pleaded guilty in February of 2012, the applicant provided the Federal Police with a lengthy statement. It was anticipated that she would be called to give evidence in relation to the prosecution of Jane and Ronald Sakovits. The Crown submitted that the applicant's combined discount should be less than 40 percent, given the nature of her assistance and because the pleas had not been entered at the earliest opportunity. The applicant pressed for a combined discount of 40 to 50 percent.

 

29The sentencing judge noted that the pleas were entered in 2012 after committal and also after negotiation over the charges which resulted in one of the charges being withdrawn and the Boughen and Cameron conspiracy being dealt with on a schedule. It was only then that the pleas were entered and a statement provided. Her Honour found that while it was apparent that the applicant was always aware of the nature of her offending, the assistance was not given immediately but at a comparatively late stage.

 

30Her Honour's conclusion was:

 

""135 Even so, it must be accepted that a willingness to facilitate the course of justice was then demonstrated. The pleas were clearly not entered at the earliest opportunity and the assistance provided after the entry of the pleas was obviously somewhat belated, which explains the police assessment that it was of low to medium assistance. That must all be taken into account. In the result, weighing all of those considerations, I have concluded that there should be a combined discount of some 37%, 15% of which should be for future assistance.""

 

31Her Honour decided that the sentences would be partially cumulative with a total head sentence of 8 years and 3 months. The applicant had submitted that a finding of special circumstances should be made and that the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period should be 50 percent. Her Honour ultimately fixed a non-parole period which was 60 percent of the head sentence. Her Honour set her reasoning out as follows:

 

""151 Ms Liles' offending was sustained over a long time. It was planned and deliberate offending, involving a significant breach of trust on the part of a qualified and highly placed accountant. As observed in Hili at [63] , detection of sophisticated tax fraud such as this, which affects the entire community, is difficult. The sentence imposed must thus have both a punitive and a deterrent effect.  Also to be considered in this case, however, is the evidence of Ms Liles' ill health and its ongoing impact and the other relevant circumstances to which I have referred. On that evidence, it seems to me that some amelioration of the minimum custodial sentence which would otherwise have to be imposed upon her, must result.""

 

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in the manner in which she took the scheduled offences into account

 

32In order to understand this ground, it is necessary to set out the paragraphs of her Honour's judgment which were the subject of challenge:

 

""136 As I have said, the charges relating to the third conspiracy must be taken into account in fixing the penalty for the offences for which Ms Liles is being sentenced. ...

 

137 On the evidence the result must clearly be an increase in the penalties which would otherwise have been imposed on Ms Liles for the offences in respect of which she is being sentenced. ...""

 

33The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred by taking the schedule offences into account in respect of all four charged offences. What should have happened, in the applicant's submission, was that the schedule offences were only to be taken into account in respect of Count 1 (schedule offence 1) and Count 2 (schedule offence 2) respectively.

 

34The applicant submitted that the schedule offences were thus erroneously taken into account in respect of all four offences and the likely result was to impermissibly increase the overall sentence. The applicant submitted that the result was that each schedule offence was taken into account at least twice, thereby occasioning double counting and impermissibly increasing the overall sentence. The applicant submitted that as a result, her Honour's sentencing discretion had patently miscarried.

 

35The Crown conceded error in this regard. Moreover, it could not be said that this was an error which in reality would have had little or no effect on the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.

 

36In those circumstances, error having been established it was necessary for this Court to independently re-exercise the sentencing discretion. In doing so, the Court was required to take into account events which have occurred since the applicant was sentenced (Douar v The Queen [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [124] and Baxter v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [19]).

 

37In Baxter Spigelman CJ said:

 

""19 ... Section 6(3) is directed to ensuring that the Court of Criminal Appeal does not proceed in that manner, but re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides.""

 

38More recently the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 has provided further guidance as follows:

 

""42 Spigelman CJ's analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"".  A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period.  A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

 

43 After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.""

 

39Although it was necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, I should say something about the other Grounds of Appeal.

 

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge made a mistake of fact in finding that the applicant received personal gain beyond the professional fees earned.

 

40The applicant submitted that there was no evidence to substantiate that finding of fact.

 

41That Ground of Appeal has also been made out. While there was evidence that the applicant received professional fees (perhaps substantial professional fees) from her offending, there was no evidence that she received any financial benefit beyond those professional emoluments. Accordingly, when re-exercising the sentencing discretion, this Court could not rely upon that erroneous finding of fact.

 

Ground 3 - The sentencing discretion miscarried as evidence now available demonstrates that the bases upon which the discretion was exercised namely that the applicant's medical conditions would be adequately treated in gaol and her forecast life expectancy have been thwarted.

 

42This Ground of appeal is now moot since a substantial quantity of medical material is before the Court which came into existence after the applicant was sentenced. In accordance with Douar v The Queen, Baxter v The Queen and Kentwell v The Queen this Court took that up to date medical material into account when re-exercising the sentencing discretion.

 

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to have adequate regard to the principle of equal justice.

 

Ground 5 - The sentence is otherwise manifestly excessive.

 

43In support of Ground 4, the applicant submitted that her Honour should have had regard to the sentences imposed on other offenders who were involved in similar offending arising out of the similar transference of funds to and from Vanuatu. The applicant submitted that she was not relying upon parity principles, but on the general principle of equal justice in that these sentences established an appropriate range for offences of this kind.

 

44She submitted that when one had regard to the 37 percent discount given by the sentencing judge in her favour it was obvious that the starting point for her sentence was significantly higher than that imposed on any other similar offender, in particular Mr Agius. She submitted that Mr Agius had been acknowledged by the Crown in the sentence proceedings to have been guilty of more serious offending, but had received a significantly lower sentence. The applicant submitted that when one allowed for the 37 percent discount, the starting point for her sentence was 13 years and 1 month whereas that for Mr Agius was 8 years and 11 months.

 

45There are difficulties with the applicant's approach. Implicit in it is the assumption that in a multi offence sentencing exercise, the correct approach is to apply a discount to the accumulated term. This is not so. The correct approach is to apply discounts to individual sentences (which her Honour clearly did) and then accumulate in such a way that the effect of the discount is not eroded.

 

46There is, however, a problem with the result of the accumulation after the individual sentences were discounted. In the sentence proceedings, the Crown in its written and oral submissions accepted that the criminality of the applicant fell below that of Mr Agius. In oral submissions (T.27.7) the Crown said:

 

""NEIL: Your Honour just dealing with the closing parts of my learned friend's submission, we have submitted in the written outline of submissions that this is a case that falls below the criminality in Agius ...""

 

47While her Honour was not bound to accept that concession by the Crown there is nothing in her Honour's judgment to indicate that she rejected it and if she did reject it, she did not explain why. On the appeal the Crown accepted that it was bound by the concession but submitted that while it accepted that the applicant's criminality was below that of Mr Agius, it was only just below.

 

48It follows that the accumulation of the individual discounted sentences did not give proper effect to the discount found to be appropriate by her Honour. When one has regard to the discount, the applicant has received a heavier sentence than Mr Agius for criminality which was acknowledged to be less. In that sense Ground 4 has been made out.

 

49For the above reasons, Ground of Appeal 5 is now irrelevant and need not be considered further.

 

Re-sentence

 

50Having re-read the evidence I agree with the findings as to objective seriousness of the offending made by her Honour. I also accept the submission of the Crown that while the criminality in the applicant's offending was below that of Mr Agius, it was not significantly so. This is because although the applicant did not devise the scheme, she not only operated it from the Australian end and sought to enable clients to deceive the revenue authorities, but also in the later stages of the conspiracies played a significant role at the Vanuatu end. Nevertheless, as a result of the Crown's concession, the accumulated term of her sentence should be below that of Mr Agius.

 

51A matter of significant controversy between the parties was the state of the applicant's health, both following sentence and at the time when the appeal was heard. Based on the conclave of doctors which occurred on 8 August 2014 (Dr John Obeid on behalf of the applicant and Professor Rosenfeld, Consultant Geriatrician and Physician and Dr Simm, Staff Specialist in Geriatric Medicine on behalf of the Crown) it is clear that following her imprisonment the applicant experienced substantial health difficulties. That situation, however, appeared to have improved considerably by the time of the conclave. By that time, the doctors agreed that although the applicant suffered from a range of chronic and sub-acute medical symptoms and conditions, she was not acutely medically unwell. These conditions were not active. While she remained depressed, that condition had also improved. She was at the time of the appeal living in an Independent Living Unit (ILU) where she had her own room with access to toilet and washing facilities. While there had in the past been difficulties in her obtaining medical aids while in prison, those difficulties at the time of the appeal had been largely overcome.

 

52Although Dr Obeid recommended that she should be receiving regular psychiatric treatment by a psychiatrist, she had been seeing a psychiatric nurse and was regularly attending a psychologist. While access to laundry facilities and medication was not as good as it would have been had she not been in the prison system, the most recent report from Dr Sim was to the effect that the provision of these facilities, while not ideal, was adequate.

 

53There was agreement between the doctors that the applicant's life expectancy had increased during her imprisonment. At the time of sentence, Dr Obeid estimated her life expectancy at 7 years. By the date of the appeal he assessed her life expectancy at 8 years and the assessment by Professor Rosenfeld was 10½ years.

 

54Many of the difficulties identified by Dr Obeid and by the applicant in her affidavit were sources of irritation and in some respects demeaning but were a usual concomitant of institutional living, particularly where that institution was a prison. One could well understand the existence of the applicant's psychiatric difficulties with depression when one had regard to her position as a highly qualified accountant of senior years who had not been to prison before. In that context, the apparent improvement in her depressive condition is of significance. Nevertheless, it is evident that in the past, particularly in the months following her admission to prison, her circumstances must have been very difficult and certainly more difficult than for someone who was younger and in better health. These matters have been taken into account on re-sentencing.

 

55As was made clear in Kentwell v The Queen the re-exercise of the sentence discretion by the Court does not simply involve an adoption of findings already made by the sentencing judge. It involves a genuine re-exercise of the discretion which extends to all matters relevant to sentencing. In this case, an important consideration is the extent of the discount of 37 percent allowed by her Honour for facilitating the course of justice by a plea of guilty and for past and future assistance.

 

56At the time of the appeal, there was no need for future assistance since pleas of guilty had been entered by all of the applicant's clients. Other than making a statement when she pleaded guilty, there was little evidence of past assistance. Moreover, the plea of guilty was not an early plea but one entered after considerable negotiation and the achievement of a significant benefit for the applicant in that one charge was withdrawn and two were dealt with by way of a schedule. In the circumstances, the combined discount which I assess for the applicant's assistance and facilitation of the course of justice is 30 percent.

 

57Otherwise I adopt the findings of the sentencing judge as to the need for general deterrence, the need to ensure that the person was adequately punished for the offence and the other matters set out in s16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

 

58Taking those matters into account, and taking into account the matters on the s16BA schedule in respect of Counts 1 and 2, the sentences which I would impose are as follows:-

 

(2)In respect of Count 1 imprisonment for 1 year and 7 months commencing 18 October 2012 and expiring 17 May 2014.

 

(3)In respect of Count 2 imprisonment for 1 year and 7 months commencing 18 May 2014 and expiring 17 November 2015.

 

(4)In respect of Count 3 imprisonment for 4 months commencing 18 January 2015 and expiring 17 May 2015.

 

(5)In respect of Count 4 imprisonment for 3 years and 2 months commencing 18 May 2015 and expiring 17 July 2018.

 

The resulting head sentence is imprisonment for 5 years and 9 months commencing 18 October 2012.

 

59I would impose a single recognizance release order without surety for all counts of 3 years and 6 months commencing 18 October 2012 and expiring 17 April 2016.

 

60The orders which I propose are:

 

(1)The sentences imposed by Schmidt J on 18 October 2012 are quashed.

 

(2)In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows:

 

(i)In respect of Count 1 a sentence of imprisonment for 1 year and 7 months commencing 18 October 2012 and expiring 17 May 2014.

 

(ii)In respect of Count 2 a sentence of imprisonment for 1 year and 7 months commencing 18 May 2014 and expiring 17 December 2015.

 

(iii)In respect of Count 3 a sentence of imprisonment for 4 months commencing 18 January 2015 and expiring 17 May 2015.

 

(iv)In respect of Count 4 a sentence imprisonment for 3 years and 2 months commencing 18 May 2015 and expiring 17 July 2018.

 

(3)The offender is to be released on 17 April 2016 upon entering a recognizance to be of good behaviour during the balance of the term of imprisonment without lodging cash security.

2704164,R v IL [2014] NSWSC 1752,"ex tempore Judgment (Revised)

 

1HIS HONOUR: The trial has reached the tail end of the prosecution case and the last witness in the prosecution case, a Dr Daniel Richard Coghlan, is about to be called. Dr Coghlan is to be called as an expert in forensic chemistry and his evidence is set out in two certificates. These are before me as exhibits VD1 and VD2. Mr Pontello, who appears for the accused, objects to one part of Dr Coghlan's second certificate (VD2). Since delivering these reasons I have published another judgment in which the circumstances of the offences, the issues in the trial and the evidence in the case are set out in a little detail (R v IL (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1710).

 

2The expertise, qualifications and experience are set out on pages 1-2 of exhibit VD1:

""Qualifications:

Bachelor of Science (Adelaide) - Major in Chemistry

Bachelor of Science (Hons) (Adelaide) - Organic Chemistry

Doctor of Philosophy (Adelaide) - Organic Chemistry

 

Other Study/Experience:

I have been employed for over eight (8) years as a forensic chemist. For the first five (5) of those years I was the team leader of the NSW Police Force (NSWPF) Forensic Services Group's Chemical Drugs Intelligence Unit. This unit undertook analysis of sub-samples from illicit drug seizures for the purpose of drug profiling. For over three (3) years I was the team leader of the NSWPF Forensic Services Group's Clandestine Laboratory Unit. This unit was responsible for providing the NSWPF Drug Squad & other NSWPF units with scientific expertise and advice relating to all aspects of the clandestine manufacture of prohibited drugs. The unit attended clandestine laboratory scenes throughout NSW for the purpose of assisting Fire & Rescue NSW with chemical safety and the collection of evidence. The unit also undertook the preliminary analysis of the collected evidence and provided expert opinion regarding the manufacture of prohibited drugs based on final analysis results. During this time I attended 37 scenes where I was the principal scientific investigator and provided expert opinion statements as well as assisted at a further 25 scenes and attended another 16 scenes. I have attended court on 4 occasions to give evidence on matters related to the clandestine manufacture of prohibited drugs. The scientific response for the investigation of clandestine laboratories was transferred from the NSW Police Force to NSW Health in May 2013, where I am currently the team leader of the NSW Health's Forensic & Analytical Science Service Illicit Drug Analysis Unit Field Response.

 

I have attended and passed the NSWPF Drug Squad Clandestine Laboratory Investigation & Safety course.

 

I have three (3) years experience working as the senior chemist for the biotechnology company, FLUOROtechnics. I was responsible for the isolation and identification of naturally occurring fluorescent organic molecules; the chemical modification of these molecules to stain proteins and DNA; and the identification of their mode of reaction. I was also the chemical Quality Assurance manager for product quality and stability and the team leader of the chemistry section.

 

I have five (5) years experience in the area of antibiotic synthesis undertaken at the University of Wollongong. The organic synthesis of antibiotics involved the reaction of small organic compounds and the subsequent identification, separation and analysis of the chemical products.

 

I have lectured general chemistry to first year undergraduates and organic chemistry to second and third year undergraduates for two (2) years at the University of Wollongong.

 

I have three (3) years experience in the area of chemical synthesis, isolation, analysis and reaction of amino acid analogues. These compounds are very similar to amphetamines. This work was undertaken at Loughborough University, England.""

 

3The certificates provide opinion evidence in relation to the nature of the process of manufacturing methylamphetamine, various types of chemical reactions that can and do occur in that process and, in parts, provides opinions as to possible causes of the fire.

 

4Dr Coghlan was not the forensic chemist who actually attended the premises in Ryde the subject of this trial. Accordingly, much of his opinion evidence is based on a variety of sources and, in particular, the observations of the chemist who was in attendance, Mr J Hugel. The notes made by Mr Hugel are exhibit VD5.

 

5As I said, objection is taken to one part of the second certificate of Dr Coghlan:

""14. Question 7 - Is there evidence that the process in the bathroom simply went wrong, and hence, caused an explosion, or simply burst into flames?

According to the NSWPF exhibit log and the scene notes recorded by HUGEL, a forensic chemist with the NSWPF, some of the items from the bathroom include sieves, a large cooking pot, a LPG cylinder that was on at the time of the examination and a gas burner that was also turned on. Due to the damage in the bathroom items located in that room were not recovered. Also due to fire it is likely that the chemical evidence would have been destroyed. I can only comment that it appears that the LPG cylinder and gas burner were on and may have provided an ignition source. ln my experience clandestine laboratories that have exploded and/or caught fire are usually caused during the evaporation of flammable solvent.""

 

6The objection is in two parts. The first objection is to the ultimate opinion provided by Dr Coghlan which is, ""in my experience clandestine laboratories that have exploded and/or caught fire are usually caused during the evaporation of flammable solvent.""

 

7It is put on behalf of the accused that the jury might use this opinion evidence in an impermissible way and, in particular, may, in effect, jump to conclusions based around the fact that there is evidence of flammable solvents, particularly acetone, present and there will be evidence from Dr Coghlan that one of the processes of manufacture involves evaporation. In other words, the jury might impermissibly use Dr Coghlan's general observation as evidence of what happened in this specific instance.

 

8In my opinion any danger that the jury would jump to conclusions can be cured by direction. The kind of opinion stated is in a form that it is very common when experts give evidence in criminal trials. Rarely do experts give evidence that is in terms of absolute certainty. In its very terms it is quite clear that this opinion allows for other possible causes and I refer specifically to the use of the term ""usually"" within that sentence. The jury is entitled to consider that opinion, along with the other evidence in the case including the evidence of another expert (Mr Agius) as to possible causes of the fire.

 

9The conclusion stated is not based on the hearsay evidence to which I will presently turn. Rather, it is a stand alone opinion which is, on its face, well within the expert's field of expertise and experience. He is not being called to give an opinion that this particular fire or this particular explosion occurred during the evaporation of a flammable solvent.

 

10Reliance is placed on ss 135 and 137 the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which provide:

""135 General discretion to exclude evidence 

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 

 

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 

(b) be misleading or confusing, or 

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.

...

137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

 

11In my view the evidence has some probative value, particularly when assessed alongside the rest of the evidence in the trial. As I have said, any danger of unfair prejudice can be cured by direction.

 

12I hold that the final sentence of paragraph 14 is admissible and can be led by the prosecution.

 

13The second part of the objection concerns the fact that the report contains a statement that the gas burner was on. As I have said, Dr Coghlan did not observe that but, rather, bases that assumption or fact on the material in the notes of Dr Hugel (VD 5). The specific part of those notes is at page 14 of 16, at about point six on the page. It says:

""Item A05 - 1 x LPG tank attached to 5 kg cylinder. 6kg from label on at time of observation (partly) (?)

 

Item A06 - large LPG burner, 35 centimetres diameter, includes control as noted. 

AO7 [which is struck out] - gas on burner control was switched on.""

 

14It is the statement of that fact (control switched on) - if it be a statement of fact - to which objection is taken. The objection is, in a sense, a simple one. It is that the evidence coming from Mr Coghlan is hearsay. That is to say, he's not saying what he saw, he's saying what Mr Hugel saw. Prima facie, that is obviously correct.

 

15However, the Crown relies upon an exception to the hearsay rule to be found in s 65 of the Evidence Act. That section relevantly provides:

 

""65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available 

 

(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

 

(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation: 

(a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or 

(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or 

(c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or 

(d) was: 

(i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and 

(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable. ...""

 

16 The Crown places particular reliance on sub paragraph (2)(b) of the section, saying that the asserted fact, or the statement, was made shortly after the asserted fact occurred.

 

17Section 67 of the Evidence Act requires that notice be given if a party is to rely on evidence pursuant to s 65(ii). No such notice has been given. I will take the Crown's application as being an application for a direction that the notice requirements be dispensed with under s 67(iv).

 

18The purpose of those notice requirements is obviously to bring on any objection like this one that might be taken. Plainly, I accept the Crown Prosecutor's statement that he did not see this as being an issue prior to the trial commencing. Nevertheless, the fact is that the notices were not given and, as a result of that, the defence were not called upon to turn their mind specifically to whether or not objection would be taken.

 

19I do not see the failure to provide notice as being fatal to the Crown's application. It turns on the probative value and importance of the evidence and whether it is otherwise admissible.

 

20Section 65 applies to criminal proceedings if the maker of the statement is not available to give evidence. I am told that the witness is in Canada and I accept that assertion from the bar table. In a layman's terms, that would mean that Mr Hugel is not available. However, the Dictionary to the Evidence Act provides specifically for what unavailability to give evidence means or encompasses. As far as I can tell this is not a case which fits within that definition:

(a)Mr Hugel is not dead.

(b)He is not incompetent to give evidence.

(c)It would not be unlawful for him to give evidence of the fact.

(d)There is no provision in the Evidence Act which prevents the evidence being given.

(e)It cannot be said all reasonable steps have been taken by the party seeking to prove that he is not available, to find him or secure his attendance.

(f)There is no evidence that all reasonable steps have been taken by the party seeking to prove that he is not available to compel him to give evidence.

 

21In sub-s (2) of the definition of ""unavailability of persons"" says, in all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence. For those reasons, in my view s 65 is not engaged because it cannot be said under the terms of the Evidence Act, that Mr Hugel is a person who is not available to give evidence.

 

22However, given the somewhat technical nature of that outcome, I should also express some opinion as to whether or not the evidence would otherwise be admissible, assuming there had been notice and assuming it was established that reasonable steps had been taken without success to secure Mr Hugel's attendance.

 

23I would have excluded the hearsay evidence in any event. As was submitted by Mr Pontello, the notes do not make clear whether or not the relevant statement is a statement of opinion, a conclusion based on particular observations or a statement of certain fact. It is not possible for the accused in the circumstance to contest or explore the basis upon which it is said that the gas burner was switched on. It may be based on the observations of the burner itself. There are photographs in evidence that show the switch to be in a position which might be considered to be off but could also be considered to be on. It is not clear whether the observation that the burner was on was based on the appearance of that switch or on some other observation.

 

24It is also the fact that there was another chemist present as well as other police officers and fire fighters who may be capable of giving the evidence. There is no intention to call those witnesses. The accused is not in a position to be able to test the evidence with those who were present when the observation was made or conclusion drawn. There is also something of a question mark over precisely when the notes were made, although on their face I would accept that they were probably made on 5 January 2013. When the observation was made is not clear but it must have been on 4 January. That probably brings it within s 65(2)(b) which is to say that it was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred.

 

25The basis of the statement is just not clear and, in the circumstance, there is a relevant unfair prejudice in terms of s 137. No direction could cure that prejudice. To allow such a hearsay statement to go before the jury when it is not able to be tested and when the basis of the assertion is unknown is to invite the jury to speculate. I do not doubt that the evidence has some probative value in terms of establishing that the gas burner was on, but in my judgment the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

 

26The Crown does not seek to tender the notes but seeks to adduce the evidence of what is in the notes through Dr Coughlan. However, in whatever form the tender was made, I have concluded that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

 

27Accordingly and for those reasons, I propose to allow the opinion evidence to be given but I reject the hearsay evidence.

2704170,R v Cyril Weazel [2014] NSWSC 1664,"Judgment

Introduction

1In the early hours of the morning of 27 July 2011 the deceased, Nancy Dynevor, was taken by ambulance from a boarding house in Redfern to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at Camperdown NSW. There, despite various attempts to resuscitate her, she was pronounced dead at 11.55 am. A post mortem examination revealed that she had suffered multiple blunt force injuries, which were the principal contributing causes of her death. Later that day the accused, Cyril Weazel, who was the partner of the deceased, and who had been with her throughout the time before she was hospitalised, was arrested and charged with her murder.

2Some time later a question arose as to the accused's fitness to be tried, and an enquiry as to this matter was conducted pursuant to the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act 1990 (""the Act""). On 17 September 2013 Adams J of this Court found the accused unfit to be tried and ordered that he be detained. Pursuant to s 14 of the Act his Honour referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the tribunal""). On 16 December 2013 the tribunal determined, pursuant to s 16 of the Act, that it was unlikely that the accused would become fit to be tried within 12 months after the finding of unfitness. The Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"") was notified of this determination. On 18 January 2014 the DPP advised the Court, pursuant to s 19 of the Act, that he intended to proceed with the charge of murder, and an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. A special hearing was therefore required to be conducted pursuant to s 19 of the Act.

3The special hearing commenced before me on 22 September 2014. No prior election had been made by either party to have the hearing determined by a jury. Accordingly, pursuant to s 21A of the Act, the hearing proceeded before myself alone. The accused was arraigned on two charges: first, that on 27 July 2011 he murdered Nancy Dynevor; alternatively, that between 15 and 28 July 2011 he caused grievous bodily harm to Nancy Dynevor with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. In accordance with s 21(3) of the Act the accused was taken to have pleaded not guilty to both charges. As required by the Act, the accused was represented by a legal practitioner, namely Mr Mark Austin of counsel.

4I think it appropriate at this stage to briefly indicate the principal legal issues which arose at the hearing, so that my description of the events which preceded the death of the deceased can be seen in context. In relation to the murder charge, the first issue was that of causation, namely whether the Crown has proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was an act or acts of the accused which substantially contributed to the death of the deceased. If the Crown cannot establish that matter, then obviously the accused must be found not guilty of murder. If the Crown succeeds on that issue, then a further significant issue arises relating to the accused's intention at the time of inflicting the fatal injuries. The Crown does not suggest that he intended to kill the deceased, but rather that he intended to really seriously injure her. A finding adverse to the Crown on that issue would almost certainly lead to an acquittal. Finally in relation to the first charge, if the Crown were to succeed on both those issues, so that the verdict would otherwise be guilty of murder, the partial defence of substantial impairment was raised, which would reduce the appropriate verdict to one of manslaughter. And if the Crown cannot succeed in relation to the first charge, the second charge requires consideration, namely that the accused caused grievous bodily harm to the deceased with intent to do so.

5I should also say at the outset that the mental condition of the accused which led to the finding that he was unfit to be tried was not such as could give rise to a defence of mental illness. The evidence which was before Adams J, some of which was also tendered before me, indicated that he had significant cognitive impairment, almost certainly caused by alcohol related brain damage and associated frontal lobe impairment. In this regard, he gave the medical experts a history of having commenced drinking alcohol at the age of 13 or 14, and consuming large quantities of alcohol ever since. He is now 46 years old.

Factual background

6Both the accused and the deceased are of aboriginal descent, and come from north Queensland. Their families knew each other well. As at July 2011 the two of them had been in a relationship for something under three years. The deceased at that time was 32 years old. They moved to Sydney in late February 2011, and initially stayed with relatives of the accused. About a week before 26 July they moved into a public housing building, Tivoli House, in Cleveland Street Redfern, where they were in room 75.

7The events leading up to the death of the deceased commenced on the morning of 26 July 2011. That morning the two of them went by train to Mount Druitt, where the accused had an appointment at Centrelink at about 9.45 am. Numerous witnesses - some 28 in all - gave evidence of their observations of the two of them between about 9.00 am at Mt. Druitt and when they returned to Tivoli House at about 7.30 that evening. I will try to encapsulate that evidence as briefly as possible, but some of it is of real significance in this case, given the central issue of causation. 

8The accused's appointment at Centrelink was apparently a brief one, and by 10.00 am the two of them had left and walked towards Dawson Mall, near the Westfield shopping centre. There they met up again with two aboriginal men whom they had known from Queensland, and whom they had encountered by chance earlier that morning when they first arrived at Mt. Druitt. They spent much of the rest of the day in the company of these two men, drinking very considerable quantities of tawny port. The statements of the two men, Emmanuel West and Mervyn Dunrobyn, were read onto the record, as neither was available to give evidence. Indeed Mr West had died in the meantime.

9It appears that these two men went to this area on a daily basis, where they would regularly ""bite"" for money to buy alcohol. (""Biting"" is the word they used for requesting money from members of the public). They had become very familiar figures in the area, and were known, at least by sight, to virtually all the witnesses who worked in the vicinity of the Dawson Mall.

10On all accounts, at the beginning of the day both the accused and the deceased were happy and positive. This was confirmed by another aboriginal friend, Duker Lane, who was talking to them for a short time at about 10 o'clock that morning. At that time they were both sober, and were talking enthusiastically about the ""new beginning"" they were proposing to make in Sydney. 

11The statement of Mr. West contains little additional information. He said that he was already drunk by the time he met up with the accused and the deceased that morning. The four of them went and sat in the park where they stayed for some time, drinking and talking. Later in the day, after they had moved to a different location, he saw the accused and the deceased arguing. He thought that the accused was going to strike the deceased, so he pushed him up against a wall in order to stop him. 

12Mr. Dunrobyn also said in his statement that after they had left the park the accused and the deceased were arguing. At one stage he left to go to the toilet, and when he returned he saw a mark on the side of the deceased's face ""as if her skin had been opened."" At the end of the day he said that the deceased was very drunk. She was slouched over and spitting onto the ground; she could not walk and she was slurring her words. It required the two of them, himself and the accused, to assist her to the escalator in order to get to the station.

13The observations of the remaining witnesses generally relate to events which happened well into the afternoon, by which time it must be assumed that a considerable amount of port had been consumed by all four of them. Tina Angely, who worked at Liquorland at Mt. Druitt, described the deceased as coming into her shop at 2.08 pm and buying two 750 ml bottles of tawny port. She returned at 2.40 pm and bought a third bottle. Ms. Angely described her as ""chatty"", but she did not seem to be intoxicated, and there were no marks on her face.

14It is apparent that conflict escalated amongst the group during the course of the afternoon. Aycan Yilmaz, who owned a bakery near the Dawson Mall, said that at about 3.00 pm he saw one of the ""familiar"" aborigines (either Mr. West or Mr. Dunrobyn) yelling at the accused and pointing towards the deceased. The other familiar aborigine intervened to stop them. Kirsty Stanford, the manager of a shoe warehouse in the area said that at about 3.30 pm she heard shouting and swearing outside her shop, and she saw the four of them. The deceased was stumbling and falling over and seemed to be ""really drunk"". The accused was yelling at her, abusing her and calling her a slut. Ms. Stanford called the security guard. She saw the two of them later as they were going towards the train station, and she said that the accused was pushing and shoving the deceased. They were both yelling at each other. 

15The security guard called by Ms. Stanford was Sekone Ioane. He said that he went to the area shortly after 4.00 pm in the company of another security guard, John Palmer. He saw a group of four aborigines. He saw what he thought was two people fall to the ground. When he looked more closely, he saw the deceased on the ground holding a bottle and a man who, from his description, was almost certainly the accused bending over her and holding her around the shoulders. He was yelling at her. He, Mr. Ioane, called out to them, and they all walked off towards the station. On the way, it appeared that two of them - the accused and one of the other men - were preparing to fight, but then they hugged each other. 

16The other guard, Mr. Palmer, said that he and Mr. Ioane went there at about 4.30 pm. He described seeing four aborigines who had bottles of alcohol in their hands outside the shoe warehouse. He recognised all four of them, as they used to come to that area on a weekly basis. Mr. Palmer's description of the four people makes it clear that they must have been the accused, the deceased, Mr. West and Mr. Dunrobyn. He asked them to move away, as they were in an alcohol-free zone. The deceased was intoxicated and was talking ""gibberish"", he said. The accused had an angry, aggressive demeanour. A little later Mr. Palmer heard a female scream, and he saw the ""third male"" (who must have been the accused) throw the deceased to the ground. He did this, Mr. Palmer said, by grabbing her by the front of her jumper and forcefully throwing her to the concrete ground. She landed on her backside area, and curled up into a foetal position. It looked as if the man might be going to hit her or kick her, so Mr. Ioane called out to him, and he stopped. The woman then got up and sat down on a park bench with her head in her lap. As the men came towards her, she got up and walked off towards the train station. The other three men started arguing with each other. Mr. Ioane called out to them to ""settle down"" and they appeared to do just that. 

17There are problems with some aspects of this evidence. It is clear that Mr. Ioane and Mr. Palmer were together throughout all this time, yet they gave quite divergent accounts of their observations. Mr. Palmer's account is considerably more detailed, which in many cases would tend to support its accuracy. But some difficulties remain. For instance, he described the deceased as getting up and walking towards the train station, leaving the other three behind. But on all other accounts, the deceased was accompanied by at least one of the others throughout the time she went to the station. Indeed by that time she was having great difficulty in walking on her own. On the other hand, Mr. Palmer's description of the accused as having pushed the deceased onto the ground is to some extent supported by the CCTV footage of the Dawson Mall area, although the images are a little distant and indistinct.

18The Crown also relied upon the evidence of Glenda Carter, who was working at the Dawson Mall as a receptionist with an X-ray group. At about 4.15 that afternoon she went outside for a cigarette break. There she saw three aborigines, two men and a woman. One of the men was a regular at Mt. Druitt. She had not seen the others before. The unfamiliar man was yelling at the woman who was sitting on the ground with her back to the wall. She got to her feet, with difficulty, and was staggering a bit. The same man then punched her in the left cheek with his clenched right fist. She reeled back, and he grabbed the hair from the back of her head and pulled her head back. The familiar man then put an arm around the woman and comforted her. The other man then seemed to calm down, and the three of them walked off in the direction of the station. 

19The Crown relied upon Ms. Carter's evidence, as it was one of the few occasions on which a witness observed the accused actually striking the deceased. On the other hand, Mr. Austin questioned whether this group was indeed the group which included the accused and the deceased. Ms. Carter described the man who struck the woman as having shoulder-length black hair and a beard. He was not wearing a hat, she said. In fact the accused was clean shaven at the time, and the CCTV images show that throughout that day he was wearing a distinctive beanie.

20I think it very likely, in all the circumstances, that it was the accused and the deceased who were observed by Ms. Carter. There is no doubt that they were in that area at the time, and that there was some conflict between them. Also, Ms. Carter's description of the woman matched that of the deceased. It is not uncommon for bystanders to be mistaken in their description of people whom they observe only briefly; and also in their description of events which happen quickly and unexpectedly, as this obviously did. I will take all of this into account when determining what weight to attach to this evidence.

21A rather different picture was painted by the witness Fan Zhang, the proprietor of a coffee shop at Westfield. At about 4.30 pm he had taken a smoking break in the carpark of the Mt. Druitt station. On the way back to his shop he saw an aboriginal woman and three men. Two of the men were very familiar to him as being regulars in the area. When he was back in his shop he looked outside and saw one of the older (familiar) men putting his two hands around the woman's neck. Then the younger, unfamiliar man put his arm round her shoulders as if he was trying to comfort her. 

22Julia Turczak, who worked in the Dawson Mall, saw one of the two aboriginal men whom she regularly saw in the area, this time in the company of a younger, unfamiliar aboriginal man. The unfamiliar man was very aggressive: pushing and shoving the familiar man, and screaming and swearing. The familiar man was trying to settle him down. An aboriginal woman was sitting down next to them, leaning forward with her hair covering her face. The security guards, she said, were watching them.

23Aycan Yilmaz, who had seen the four of them earlier in the afternoon, saw them again a little before 5.00 pm. At that time the woman was lying on the pavement. An argument developed between one of the older, familiar men and the younger man. The younger man (who must have been the accused) then walked off towards the station together with the woman. She was unable to stand, and kept falling down. The accused tried to help her by putting his arm around her waist and supporting her, but whenever he loosened his grip she fell down again.

24At this point the scene shifted to Mt. Druitt railway station, where a number of witnesses observed the accused and the deceased. Mr. West and Mr. Dunrobyn had remained at the shopping centre and were no longer with them. 

25The first observer in point of time was Anthony Collins, a cleaner employed by Railcorp NSW. He saw the two of them on a ramp which leads to the station from the shopping centre. The deceased was on the ground when he first saw them, and seemed unable to stand on her own. The accused was trying to pull her up, but was having great difficulty in doing so. A bystander who had been riding a push bike came and helped the accused drag the deceased onto the concourse and to the booking office, followed by Mr. Collins. At this stage they encountered Andrew Bent, who was duty manager at the Mt. Druitt station. The cyclist left, as he was concerned that someone might take his bicycle. Mr. Bent described the deceased as ""not just intoxicated but very intoxicated"". She was on the ground, slumped over, and unable to walk unaided. He told the accused that she could not get onto a train in that state. The accused argued with him, asking to see the policy in writing, and saying that they had to get to Redfern. Eventually, with the assistance of Mr. Sean Simpson, who also gave evidence, the accused managed to get the deceased down the stairs to the platform. Towards the bottom, they needed even more assistance from Mr. Collins, who took hold of the deceased's legs. She was placed onto a bench, where she immediately flopped forward. After a train arrived at the station, Mr. Collins assisted them into carriage number four, where the deceased was placed onto one of the long seats in the vestibule area of the carriage. At this stage Mr. Bent rang the city security office in order to alert them to the situation.

26Tracy Iping was initially the assistant guard and later the principal guard on this train, sitting in the guard's cabin in the fifth carriage. When the train arrived at Granville station (at 6.24 pm), a female passenger came and told her that there was a disturbance in the fourth carriage, with verbal abuse between a man and a woman. Later, when the train stopped at Lidcombe, another woman told her of a disturbance in the fourth carriage. As well as verbal abuse, the woman said, the man was starting to hit the woman. Finally, at Strathfield station, a man came and told her that the man in the fourth carriage was physically hitting the woman. Ms. Iping arranged for the train to delay its departure. She and other station staff went to the fourth carriage where they saw the accused and the deceased in the vestibule area. She was lying on his lap across the seats and seemed to be passed out. One of the station staff told them that they had to get off the train. The accused said to the deceased: ""Come on, love, we got to get up and get off the train."" Eventually the deceased managed to get up, but as she was walking towards the door she collapsed onto the ground. The accused pulled his right foot back, and then appeared to kick her, although Ms. Iping said in her initial statement that she could not tell whether he was kicking her or using his foot to try and lift her up. Eventually the accused did manage to get her up and they left the train. On the way, Ms. Iping observed scratch marks which appeared to be recent on the deceased's left cheek. The two of them went and sat on a bench on the platform. The train then left the station and continued on its journey.

27One of the station staff who accompanied Ms. Iping into the carriage was Mark Hall, who also gave evidence. He said that both the accused and the deceased were intoxicated. He observed bruising on the deceased's face, under her right eye. He said that the deceased fell onto the floor of the carriage on their way out. The accused grabbed her by the arm in order to help her up and get her outside. Mr. Hall apparently did not see the accused move his leg as if to kick the deceased while she was on the ground, or presumably he would have mentioned it.

28Once the accused and the deceased were out of the train and sitting on the platform, the station staff apparently departed and left them alone. They were therefore in a position to board the next train to Central station via Redfern, which they did. As they were moving forwards on the platform and the train was approaching, the CCTV cameras record the deceased falling forward. At the time she was perilously close to the edge of the platform. She was pulled back by the accused, who thereby saved her from what could well have been a catastrophic fall. 

29The next known observations of the two of them were at Redfern station. Three transit officers gave evidence of seeing them there at about 7.00 pm. One of them, Craig Gerstenberg, described the accused as pulling the deceased up the stairs from the platform by her sleeve. When asked if they were okay, the accused said: ""Yeah, I'm just trying to get her home."" The deceased had grazing and bruising on the left side of her face, Mr. Gerstenberg said. He asked her if she wanted an ambulance, and she said, in a slurred voice: ""no, no, I'm just really drunk."" The other two officers gave similar evidence, although they were less specific about the position of the deceased's facial injuries. Interestingly, two of the three officers described the accused as having a beard, but we know with certainty that he did not have one at that time. 

30The accused and the deceased then proceeded to walk from Redfern station to Tivoli House in Cleveland Street. Robert Rule was probably the first of the witnesses to see them during this journey. In a statement tendered into evidence he said that very shortly after 7.00 pm he was leaving the Redfern Police Station in Lawson Street with his bull terrier ridgeback dog when an aboriginal woman - clearly the deceased - said, in a slurred voice: ""oh what a beautiful dog."" He said that she was very drunk, and was ""staggering all over the place"". She was being held up by an aboriginal man. When this man let her go, Mr. Rule said, she kept bumping into shop window fronts. He heard the male shout at her: ""come on, come on"", but did not see him strike her. 

31Andrew Walker, who worked at 80 George Street Redfern, went outside to have a cigarette at about 7.15 that evening. At the intersection of George and Wells Street he saw an aboriginal woman lying on the ground on her side, with a man standing over her and yelling at her. From his description, they must have been the accused and the deceased. He described the accused as waving his arms and saying: ""get up or I'll fucking kill you."" She was yelling back, saying that she couldn't get up. She appeared very intoxicated. At that stage, Mr. Walker said, another man appeared across the road who was on the phone. He heard the accused shout that the man was calling the police, and he - the accused -then ran around the corner into Wells Street. Before he did so, he kicked the deceased two or three times with the toe of his boot, and also stomped on her hips a couple of times with the bottom of his boot. Only moments later he returned and managed to pull the deceased to her feet. They then walked across the intersection. The deceased fell on at least two further occasions that Mr. Walker observed. He had a clear vision of the first fall, and said that she ""fell hard with her whole body landing flat"", falling onto her side and slightly to the front. The two of them then moved out of his view. In cross-examination Mr. Walker was asked whether, when the accused stomped and kicked the deceased, he appeared to be trying to get her up. He answered that the accused seemed to be trying ""to get a reaction, to get her to move.""

32The man whom Mr. Walker observed on the phone was clearly Stein Lotveit, whose statement was read onto the record. Mr. Lotveit was riding his scooter along Wells Street. When he came to the corner of George Street he saw the deceased slumped on the footpath with her legs outstretched. The accused had her wrists in his hands, and was shouting for her to get up off the ground. He was pulling at her arms as if he was trying to pull her up. He appeared very aggressive. The female was very apologetic, saying: ""I'm sorry babe."" Mr. Lotveit called out to the accused that he was phoning the police. He turned his back while he made the call. At about that time the accused walked away from the deceased, but then came back again and grabbed her by the wrists, trying to get her up. He did this a couple of times, and each time he let her go she would slump down to the ground. Eventually he got her to her feet, but after walking only a few metres she fell down again. Once again he got her to her feet and they began walking north down George Street. The accused was supporting her. Mr. Lotveit said that she would not have been able to walk without him.

33The accused and the deceased were also observed by Casey Castro and her husband Reinaldo in George Street Redfern. Mrs. Castro heard a man's voice shouting ""get up"" and ""come on"" and some profanities such as ""fuck you"". She then saw the deceased on the ground. The accused had her by the hair and was pulling her up and yelling at her, saying things like: ""get up or I'll kill you."" He pulled her up from the ground, and she then pushed at him and stumbled backwards. The two of them started to walk down George Street towards Cleveland Street. Mrs. Castro described them as walking side by side as if they were ""buddies"". They were swaying and stumbling and appeared to be affected by drugs or alcohol.

34Mr. Castro's observations generally supported those of his wife, although he described these events in less detail than she did.

35No further observations were made of the accused or the deceased until after their arrival at Tivoli House. Indeed, with only one exception, all of these subsequent observations occurred in the early hours of the next morning after the deceased had already stopped breathing and the accused was desperately trying to revive her. The single exception consisted of films captured by CCTV cameras in Tivoli House. A camera in the foyer showed the two of them when they first walked in from the station . The deceased appeared to walk straight into a window or wall, and then to recoil backwards. Another camera in the hallway outside their room showed the accused helping the deceased upstairs and into their room. 

36As to what happened after their return to Tivoli House and before the deceased's terminal collapse in the early hours of the next morning, we have only the accused's account during his ERISP a little later that morning. I will be discussing this shortly. 

37One of the first people to encounter the accused after the deceased's collapse was another resident of Tivoli House, David Hayes, whose statement was tendered into evidence. He said that at about 1.30 that morning he left his room to go to the toilet which was just along the hall from room 75. He saw the accused standing outside the open door to room 75. The accused asked him to come and have a look at ""my lady"". Mr. Hayes did so, and saw the deceased lying under a doona. He immediately thought she looked dead. He asked whether she was hot or cold. The accused started crying, saying ""she's cold"". He leant over and blew into her mouth and did compressions onto her chest. When Mr. Hayes left he was crying quietly and cradling the deceased's head in his arms.

38It must have been at about this stage that the accused telephoned triple-0 and asked for an ambulance urgently. When the operator asked for his address he had to go outside and ask someone else for the street number. He sounded extremely distressed. The operator asked him to lay the deceased on her back and tilt her head backwards and then see if he could discern any breathing. He said: ""my baby's not breathing."" The operator then instructed him on how to perform CPR. He put the phone on speaker, and the recording of the call (which was admitted into evidence) indicates that he performed a very large number of compressions upon the deceased until the ambulance arrived some minutes later.

39Lee Greensill was staying in room 74 at Tivoli House at that time. At about 1.30 that morning he was in the courtyard having a drink when the accused came down the stairs, very agitated, saying that his girlfriend was not responding. He asked for the street number of Tivoli House to give to the triple-0 operator. Mr. Greensill had been in his room until a short time before this, and said that he had heard nothing from room 75, which was next door to his room.

40The occupant of room 76, which was also adjacent to 75, gave evidence that in the early hours of that morning he heard tapping or banging noises. It was not unusual to hear such noises in that area, he said, and he was not sure whether these ones came from inside the building or outside. This being the case, I attach no weight at all to his evidence.

41Jaime Warhurst was one of the paramedics employed by the ambulance service who came in response to the accused's call. They arrived at Tivoli House at 1.40 that morning. The deceased was lying on the floor in room 75. She was cold, wet, and had bruising around her face, neck and shoulder areas. There was blood in some parts of the room. The paramedics confirmed that there was no pulse, and commenced normal resuscitation measures in this situation. At 1.58 am spontaneous circulation was restored, and at 2.24 am the ambulance left Tivoli House to take the deceased to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

42Jodie Anderson was one of the other paramedics to arrive at that time. She noted that the deceased had no clothing on the lower part of her body, which was covered by a doona. The accused was asked why she was wet, and he said that he had put her in the shower in an attempt to wake her up. When asked what had happened, he said that they had been in bed asleep and he noticed that she was not breathing. The accused was extremely concerned, and was saying things like: ""come on, come on. You've got to get her back. Please come on. Is she going to make it?"" When asked about the swelling and bruising around the deceased's face, the accused said: ""she's been fighting with the bitches at Mt. Druitt"".

43The extent of the accused's distress was also confirmed by the other paramedic who was present at the time, Lucy Gillett. She told the accused at one point that the deceased was not responding. He became very emotional and upset, saying: ""come on, sister, she's only a child, she's only a child."" He was sitting on the bed rocking backwards and forwards, she said.

44The accused was asked whether he wanted to accompany the ambulance to the hospital, but he declined, saying he did not know how he would get home. At about the same time police officers attended at Tivoli House. Constable Cicek asked the accused how the deceased got the injuries to her face. The accused answered: ""In Mt. Druitt we were near the shopping centre. She went to use the toilets and came back a little while later and said to me 'I got slapped by an Islander slut in the toilets.'"" When asked what time this happened, he said at about 11.00 am.

45The accused was placed into the rear of a police caged vehicle, where he was found, sleeping, at about 5.00 that morning by the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Senior Constable James Mabberley. He was taken to Redfern Police Station and a lengthy ERISP then took place, commencing at 5.38 am and finishing at 7.09 am. At the outset, the accused said that he was willing to participate in the interview, but he wanted it to be fast, because, to use his own words: ""I'm really stressed out about seeing my woman."" It is to be remembered that a pulse had been restored in the deceased shortly before she was taken to hospital, and the accused clearly thought at the time of the ERISP that she would recover. Indeed he was talking about buying a ring, as they had recently become engaged and were planning a wedding.

46The following is a brief account of what the accused told the police during this interview. He said that the deceased had been ""slapped in the head"" by Samoans or Tongans while they were at Mt. Druitt. After that they decided to go home. He had no recollection of how they got from Redfern station to Tivoli House. After they arrived back they went upstairs, he said, and the deceased lay down, as she was ""wiped out."" He said that he then tried to go to sleep but she kept waking and asking for water. He was asked what led up to the ambulance being called, and he said that they were sitting talking, and she kept falling backwards and cracking her head on the wall next to the door. He said that this could have happened anything from five to ten times. Then she went down and did not get up again. At first he thought that she was deliberately ignoring him. Her eyes were looking into space, so he blew into them but there was no response. Her hands were cold and he could not feel a pulse. He started freaking out, he said, so he dragged her into the shower in an endeavor to wake her up. He turned on the hot and then the cold water for a few minutes, then took her back to their room. She still did not respond. At that stage he rang for the ambulance, and started to do CPR, as instructed by the operator. Then the ambulance came and they managed to get a faint pulse.

47The accused was asked for more details about what they did at Mt. Druitt the previous day. He said that they were drinking with some Mt. Druitt people. His accounts were sometimes fairly garbled, but it would appear from what he said that between them they drank two 2-litre flagons of tawny port followed by at least two 750 ml bottles. At one stage the deceased went to the toilet. When she came back she told him that the ""bitches"" had slapped her. She did not have any visible injuries, he said, except for her eyes. Also her gums were bleeding. After this they continued to drink in the park and then went to the station and caught a train. She had difficulty walking, and he was holding or carrying her wherever they went.

48The accused at this stage also said more about what happened after they had returned to their room in Tivoli House. The reason why the deceased was not wearing pants, he said, was because they had sex at some stage during the evening. They also watched a nature programme on television for a while. It was after this that the accused was trying to get to sleep and the deceased was constantly waking him and calling out for water. He became annoyed, and they ended up screaming at each other, but he denied that he ever became violent. A little later, he said, the deceased started to lean back and bang her head against the wall. She also struck her head on a number of occasions on the iron bar at the end of her bed. During this time she was still calling out for water. Then she stopped, and was lying there without speaking. It was at this stage that the accused started to realise that something was seriously wrong. He blew into her eyes, and when she did not respond he half carried and half dragged her into the shower in an attempt to revive her. What happened after that has already been recorded.

49At the time of the ERISP (which finished at 7.09 am) the deceased was still alive. Indeed it is clear, as already indicated, that the accused was expecting her to survive. Later that morning all endeavours to revive her were abandoned, and life was pronounced extinct. That afternoon the accused was formally charged with her murder.
 
Causation

The medical evidence

50The most significant evidence on the issue of causation came from Dr. Rebecca Irvine, the forensic pathologist who performed the postmortem examination on the deceased. Dr. Irvine's autopsy report, which was tendered into evidence, specified ""hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy"" as the direct cause of death. Antecedent causes were listed as (a) ""out of hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation"" and (b) ""multiple blunt force injuries."" The remaining significant condition which was said to have contributed to the death, but was not related to the disease or condition causing it, was ""acute ethanol intoxication"". 

51In her evidence Dr. Irvine was asked what was meant by ""hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy"". She described it as oxygen deprivation, due to the lengthy time when the deceased's heart was not beating and she was not breathing, leading to extreme and irreversible brain damage. Her evidence made it clear that it was the multiple blunt force injuries sustained by the deceased which were the essential causes of death; for they were responsible for the cardiopulmonary arrest which in turn caused the fatal brain damage. 

52It is therefore appropriate to look in some detail at a number of these injuries as described by Dr. Irvine. I should say at the outset that she described all the injuries sustained by the deceased as ""acute"", meaning that they were inflicted within 24 hours before her death.

53Dr. Irvine was asked if she could indicate which of the injuries sustained by the deceased were the most serious, in that they were most likely to have had a direct link with the cardiopulmonary arrest. She said that this was very difficult to say, because there were so many injuries which together would have had a cumulative effect. Even the bruises beneath the skin, of which there were many, could have contributed to the arrest, she said, for each one represented a removal of blood from the deceased's circulation which in turn reduced the blood supply to the brain. As a result it was very difficult to separate out individual injuries, she said, because there would have been a great deal of interaction between them.

54Having said that, Dr. Irvine went on to describe two injuries as each being potentially life-threatening on their own. The first was a laceration of the liver, and the second consisted of damage to the brain caused by blunt force injuries to the head, which also caused a scalp laceration. 

55Dealing first with the liver laceration, Dr. Irvine said that it resulted from blunt force being applied to that area of the body, which then caused a tearing injury of the liver. She noted that there was significantly less blood loss arising from this injury than would normally be expected, leading to the real possibility that by the time the deceased sustained this injury she was already in a state of shock, with reduced blood circulation. Indeed, Dr. Irvine said that it was possible that the liver laceration occurred as a result of attempted cardiac resuscitation. She described this as unusual, but said that liver lacerations can occur with attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, particularly if it is carried out inexpertly.

56The deceased was a small, malnourished woman and the accused a much larger man. We heard, on the recorded triple-0 telephone call, the sounds of the accused administering CPR to the deceased. Given the whole of the evidence about this liver laceration, including the time at which it was probably inflicted, I would have to conclude that it is very likely to have been caused by the accused's attempts to revive the deceased. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the deceased sustained no fewer than 12 rib fractures on the left side of her chest. Dr. Irvine said that there was a real possibility that these fractures were caused by vigorous resuscitation attempts. All the fractures were on the front of the rib cage, and she said that rib fractures were common after cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts, particularly in malnourished individuals. The number of fractures in this case indicated that the amount of force used and the placement of the hands might well have been less than ideal. 

57For not dissimilar reasons I must also put to one side the blunt force injuries to the deceased's head, leading to brain damage. The accused in his record of interview described the deceased as repeatedly falling backwards, both against a railing at the end of the bed and against the bedroom wall. He pointed to blood stains on the wall as indicating where she had fallen. Dr. Irvine said that these episodes might well have caused the laceration on the back of the deceased's scalp and also caused the brain damage which she observed, although she was unable to say whether they were all connected or not. As with the liver laceration, there was less blood loss from these injuries than would normally be expected, indicating that they may well have been sustained relatively late in the piece. In this regard, the accused said that it was immediately after these repeated falls that the deceased went into cardiopulmonary collapse.

58These, of course, were only two of the multiple blunt force injuries which the deceased sustained within that 24 hour period. According to Dr. Irvine, none of them can be excluded as possibly having contributed to the death of the deceased. The list of these injuries is very extensive indeed, as evidenced both in the autopsy report and in the numerous postmortem photographs of the deceased. I do not propose to go through them here, but they include extensive injuries to virtually every part of the deceased's body: her head, face and neck; her hands and arms; her upper and lower back, including her buttocks; and her legs and feet. 

59The deceased sustained a fracture of one of the bones in her right hand, which Dr. Irvine said in her autopsy report could well have been a defensive injury. However in her evidence she said that it was ""certainly possible"" that this injury was caused by the deceased falling on her hand. Indeed, the doctor went on to say that she could not exclude any of the deceased's injuries as having arisen from a fall, particularly with her history of repeated falls. It is unusual to sustain neck injuries in a fall, she said, but it is still possible. It would have required a significant number of falls to cause all the deceased's injuries, given their number and dispersal. But, as the doctor said, falling is a mechanism for sustaining blunt force injuries, and all the deceased's injuries were blunt force injuries.

60It is relevant here to refer to the evidence of Dr. Narendra Gunja, who was called as a witness in the defence case. Dr. Gunja specialises in clinical and forensic toxicology, and he was asked to assess the likely blood alcohol reading of the deceased during the period leading up to her death. It is unnecessary for present purposes to go through the details of Dr. Gunja's evidence on this subject. To summarise it briefly, he considered that the deceased probably reached her highest alcohol level between about 5.00 pm and 7.00 pm on 26 July, and that it was likely to have been above .3%, and could have been as high as .4%. At these levels, an inexperienced drinker would be deeply unconscious, possibly requiring life support, whereas a regular drinker could still be walking around, albeit with difficulty. Significantly in relation to this issue, Dr. Gunja said that physical trauma will have more deleterious effects upon an intoxicated person than on one who is not intoxicated. An intoxicated person will be likely to sustain more serious injury and recovery will be delayed. 

61I should also mention here that the deceased was severely hypothermic when she was admitted to hospital, which meant that her body temperature was significantly lowered. In certain cases, Dr. Irvine said, hypothermia can itself lead to cardiac arrest. However in the present case it was almost certainly a result of the fact that the deceased had been without a pulse for some time, which was exacerbated by ""environmental hypothermia"" arising from the fact that she was wet after having been put into the shower by the accused. In other words, it was very likely that her hypothermia was a result of her condition, rather than being a cause of it.
 
Submissions on causation

62The Crown relied upon the number and the dispersal of the injuries sustained by the deceased in submitting that there could be no reasonable possibility that all of her injuries were occasioned by falls alone. To quote the Crown prosecutor: ""there are just so many of them, and they are so widely dispersed and not in any particular pattern."" He also relied on the evidence of John Palmer and Glenda Carter, both of whom described the accused as pushing or striking the deceased when they were at Mt. Druitt. Their evidence was supported by the CCTV footage at the Dawson Mall which showed the accused pushing the deceased to the ground. Further, it was submitted, none of the witnesses who observed the deceased before she returned to Tivoli House noted the extensive injuries which were later discovered after her death. It could therefore be inferred that many of these injuries were inflicted by the accused after they had returned to their room.

63Mr. Austin submitted that the very matter relied upon by the Crown, namely the impossibility of determining which of the injuries sustained by the deceased resulted from falls, and which - if any - were inflicted by the accused, makes it impossible for an affirmative finding to be made that any injury inflicted by the accused substantially contributed to the death of the deceased.

Conclusion on causation

64This has not been an easy matter to resolve. Ultimately, however, there are two matters which, taken together, have convinced me that I must determine this issue in favour of the accused. They are, first, the heavy onus of proof which the Crown bears in this case, combined with the fact that the Crown must prove that an act or acts of the accused substantially contributed to the death of the deceased. 

65Given the totality of the evidence, I accept that the accused almost certainly did, on occasions, vent his frustration by physically assaulting the deceased. After all, he also was intoxicated, although not nearly to the same extent as she was. But I cannot be satisfied that this happened on more than a few occasions. I am certainly not prepared to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that any physical assaults continued after the two of them had returned to Tivoli House. Moreover, any injuries which the deceased sustained as a result of such assaults were likely to have been essentially subsumed by the injuries sustained from other causes, particularly as a result of her falling. In this regard, almost every witness who observed the two of them later in the day on 26 July described the deceased as being almost totally unable to remain upright except with the accused's support. There can be no doubt that she fell on many, many occasions. And according to Dr. Irvine, all the injuries which the deceased was later found to have sustained could have been caused by her falling.

66As already indicated, I am, for present purposes, putting to one side the evidence relating to the deceased's liver laceration and the brain damage which was caused by direct blunt force. The brain injuries were very likely to have been caused when the deceased repeatedly fell backwards, striking her head on the bed rail and on the bedroom wall. And it is highly probable that the liver laceration was caused during the accused's attempts to resuscitate her. Of course, on one level this could be seen as a positive finding that the accused did indeed cause this injury. However when one is considering causation in the context of a murder charge, an injury which was unintentionally caused during an attempt to resuscitate the victim can hardly be taken into account as part of the case against the accused. 

67Those two injuries - to the brain and the liver - were, according to Dr. Irvine, the most serious of the many injuries sustained by the deceased. Each of them, alone, was capable of causing death. When they are removed from consideration, we are left with many minor injuries, none of which on their own would be capable of causing death, but the cumulative effect of which was devastating, particularly when added to the liver and brain injuries. Even if I was in a position to identify which of the large number of relatively minor injuries sustained by the deceased were caused by the accused, it would still be extremely difficult to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that those particular injuries substantially contributed to her death. They might well have contributed in a minor way, but that is not sufficient for present purposes. And the situation is made even more difficult when, as here, it is not possible to identify any particular injury or injuries as having been inflicted by the accused.

68In the end, for the reasons given, I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that any particular act or acts of the accused substantially contributed to the death of the deceased. It follows that he must be found not guilty of the charge of murder.

69I should add here that even if I had found the causation issue in favour of the Crown, I could still not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the next matter the Crown must prove in order to establish this charge, namely that the accused had the requisite intention for murder. For the sake of completeness, I will say something more about this, albeit briefly. It is also relevant to the alternative charge, namely that the accused caused grievous bodily harm to the deceased with intent to do so. 

The Intention of the Accused

70It is necessary for the Crown, in any murder trial, to establish beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of inflicting the fatal injuries, the accused intended either to kill the deceased or to cause grievous bodily harm (frequently described as ""really serious injury""). There is an alternative means of establishing murder, namely by proving that the relevant act or acts were committed with reckless indifference to human life. However that has not been relied upon in the present case, nor could it be in the circumstances. Indeed, as already mentioned, the Crown does not suggest that the accused in this case intended to kill the deceased, rather that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm, or to really seriously injure her. The intoxication of the accused is a relevant matter when considering this issue.

71As with the issue of causation, the Crown relied upon the evidence that the accused was seen punching and pushing the deceased when they were at Mt. Druitt, as well as the observations of the witnesses who saw the two of them when they were making their way from Redfern station to Tivoli House. On this latter occasion, the accused was heard to say to the deceased: ""get up or I'll fucking kill you."" As to the evidence of the accused's later attempts to revive the deceased, the Crown submitted that this could be seen as the accused realising, too late, that he had overreacted earlier in the day, and expressing remorse for his earlier actions. It was his intention at the time of inflicting the relevant injuries which needs to be considered, and subsequent remorse, whilst potentially relevant, is by no means decisive on this issue. 

72This is certainly the case as a matter of law. However, having taken into account the whole of the evidence on this matter, I am unable to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that on the relatively few occasions when the accused probably did assault the deceased, he intended at the time to really seriously injure her. It has to be remembered that the accused was suffering from a number of serious cognitive deficits. In addition, he was significantly intoxicated at the time, having himself consumed a very large amount of port. In this regard, it is relevant to refer to the evidence of Dr. Ilana Heppner, a clinical neuropsychologist who was called in the defence case. She described the accused's impairment in mental functioning as ""significant"", saying that 98 per cent of his peers would have performed better than him. These impairments would have been exacerbated by his alcohol intoxication, she said, so that he would have been even less likely than usual to understand the consequences of his actions.

73It must also be remembered that, in addition to the accused's attempts to resuscitate the deceased early the next morning, which certainly indicated a lack of criminal intent at that time, he was seen on the CCTV camera as rescuing the deceased from a potentially extremely hazardous situation at a time which was much more proximate to the events relied upon by the Crown. I am referring to the occasion, on Strathfield station, when the accused grabbed the deceased and thereby prevented her from falling into the path of a moving train. 

74For all these reasons I am, as I have already indicated, unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that at the time that the accused inflicted any particular injury upon the deceased, he intended to really seriously injure her.

75This finding not only reinforces the conclusion I have already made in relation to the primary charge of murder, but it also means that the Crown cannot succeed in establishing the alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. I should also say that, for precisely the same reasons which led to my conclusion that causation had not been established in relation to the murder charge, I would also have been unable to make an affirmative finding in relation to the first matter to be established under the alternative charge, namely that the accused in fact caused grievous bodily harm to the deceased.

Conclusion and Verdicts

76For the reasons given, I find the accused not guilty of both charges in the indictment. Pursuant to s 26 of the Act the accused is to be dealt with as if he had been found not guilty at a normal trial in relation to these charges.

		25 November 2014",2014-11-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704171,R v Kerry John Wallace [2014] NSWDC 348,"Judgment


	
	There are two applications before the Court to exclude evidence. The first is to exclude evidence following the search of the accused in the early hours of 6 January 2014. The argument on behalf of the accused is that this search was illegal and that evidence flowing from it therefore should be excluded.
	
	
	The argument relies on the provisions of s 21 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 which in S21(1)(d) provides that:
	


“An officer may search a person without warrant if that officer suspects on reasonable grounds inter alia that the person had in his or her possession or under his or her control a prohibited plant or prohibited drug.”


	
	There has been a significant amount of evidence called on this voir dire but I propose to summarise it as quickly as possible, particularly because this is meant to be a three to five day trial and we are already at the end of day three.
	
	
	The facts here are that Senior Constable Lay, the officer-in-charge of this investigation, approached the accused not long after midnight on 6 January 2014, whilst the accused was a DJ in the DJ’s booth, in the upstairs area of the Abercrombie Hotel in Broadway, Sydney. The accused had just finished working as a DJ at a dance party operated by a business or entity called SASH, which was owned through a company of which he was a director. A number of DJ’s including the accused worked with that business. They, at the relevant time, operated a dance party every Sunday at the Abercrombie Hotel. SASH had been in existence for some time operating from various venues including some before the Abercrombie Hotel but in the Abercrombie Hotel for at least the preceding 12 months.
	
	
	The Abercrombie Hotel was due to close down and 5 January 2014 was to be the last dance party run by SASH operating there. The fact of the dance party and the fact that it was the last SASH dance party at the Abercrombie Hotel was advertised to patrons, including that it was to operate on Sunday in the normal course of events. Also advertised to patrons was a list of the DJs who would be playing and a playlist.
	
	
	The accused was one of those nominated to work as a DJ towards the end of the day. He was there, however, as one of the operators of the dance party from the time that the dance party started, including for a large part of the earlier part of the day, assisting those admitting patrons, stamping patrons, overseeing the operations of individual DJs, collecting drink tokens and distributing them and similar activities.
	
	
	There was a very large crowd on this occasion, larger than anticipated, more probably than not because it was the last dance party to be held at the Abercrombie Hotel.
	
	
	Over the preceding 12 months or even longer, police had received intelligence or reports that those operating the SASH dance parties at the Abercrombie Hotel were involved in supplying illegal drugs, particularly cocaine and ecstasy and that this supply was connected with the DJs and with the DJ’s booth. There were in particular two Crime Stoppers reports made, one in November 2012 and another in January 2013, specifically nominating this accused as a person who as a DJ at these dance parties on Sundays, supplied these drugs in those circumstances.
	
	
	Following the last of those two Crime Stoppers reports, police conducted an undercover and overt operation on the premises in July 2013, discovering at least one person using drugs in the DJ’s booth at the SASH party there and also at the time, observing a person overdosing on drugs and others using drugs. There were intelligence reports created as a result of that operation in July 2013.
	
	
	I accept from Senior Constable Lay’s evidence that following that operation in July 2013, police placed some conditions on the licensee of the Abercrombie Hotel, in an attempt to minimise the likelihood of drug supply and use recurring in connection with the SASH dance parties, but that police believed that by January 2014, compliance with these conditions was diminishing. Senior Constable Lay was the officer‑in‑charge of an operation conducted to coincide with the last dance party on 5 January.
	
	
	I accept that initially, a reason to put such an operation in place, was to ensure that this event did not escalate into any anti‑social events, including to ensure that patrons did not cause problems in circumstances where they all knew that the premises were about to close down. That was not however the primary purpose of the operation by the time it was conducted on 5 January. By the time the operation commenced in the afternoon of 5 January, Senior Constable Lay had already conducted a briefing with those officers who were to be involved in the operation. By that stage, the purpose of the operation had extended to include detecting people involved in the use and supply of illicit drugs and to ensure compliance with liquor licensing. The operational orders were tendered on this voir dire.
	
	
	The operation included a number of officers in plain clothes attending at the dance party, mingling with others who were there, pretending to be patrons. It also included Senior Constable Lay and Officer Vescio in uniform, waiting outside and communicating regularly with the plainclothes officers inside as to their observations.
	
	
	The text messages passing to and from those officers inside and Senior Constable Lay are tendered. These included advice that those officers were observing patrons using and supplying drugs. None of the text messages makes any specific reference to either the accused, nor any individual inside the DJ’s box. There were however observations made of people using and supplying drugs, and that in general terms was passed on in the text messages, as is clear from the wording of the text messages.
	
	
	The plainclothes officers and Senior Constable Lay and Officer Vescio went back to Redfern Police Station for a dinner break. Whilst there, they had conversations about what they had observed. Later the officers went back to the hotel, the plainclothes officers staying there until about 10.30, and Senior Constable Lay and Vescio going inside in uniform later, around about midnight. There had been an agreement for the music to stop at 11 but it stopped at about midnight.
	
	
	Senior Constable Lay I accept went upstairs not long after midnight where the accused had been working as a DJ in the DJ’s booth, with the dance party just recently ended. The music had stopped but there were about 20 patrons still left in the area, who started to disperse I accept when they saw police officers in uniform arriving. There were about six people or so in the DJ’s booth, including the accused. The accused was no doubt a person of interest and Senior Constable Lay knew that at the time he was in the hotel on that occasion. This much had been made known to all the officers present during the course of the briefing earlier that day.
	
	
	I accept Senior Constable Lay walked over to the DJ’s booth and I accept that as he did so about four people who had been inside walked out. As he walked towards the accused, I accept that was when he noticed the accused was holding a black satchel or bag. His evidence is that at that stage he noticed the accused was sweating and to his mind, according to his evidence, appeared to be under the influence of a drug, albeit slightly.
	
	
	He had a conversation with him, which appears in his statement, which was initially in fairly general terms. His evidence was that during this interaction with the accused, the accused appeared to him to be nervous and to be having trouble keeping eye contact with him. His evidence was also that the accused’s grip on the black bag tightened and he appeared reluctant to release his grip on the bag. At that stage he said he formed a suspicion that the accused may be in possession of an illegal drug inside the bag.
	
	
	He gave evidence that this suspicion was based on a combination of factors, including the immediate observations to which I have just referred, namely the accused apparently sweating, being nervous, not keeping eye contact, and also tightening his grip on the bag. His evidence was however that these observations were all in the context of the accused being a person of interest for drug supply because of those Crime Stoppers reports to which I have referred, and also the intelligence known to him flowing from the police operation in July 2013. That included his knowledge that during the course of that operation, drugs were apparently accessed, at least on one occasion, in the DJ’s booth during the course of the SASH dance party at the Abercrombie Hotel, and there were those using drugs in the crowd and connected with that dance party.
	
	
	Senior Constable Lay also gave evidence that he personally made observations of people apparently under the influence of drugs when he walked through the crowd on his way to the upstairs on this evening, that he evidenced as being people who were apparently sweating, whose eyes were wide and whose pupils were dilated. Whether or not there be other explanations for these sorts of observations, they are observations consistent with a person under the influence of a drug.
	
	
	This was then the context or background, according to Senior Constable Lay, in which he formed a suspicion, when he spoke to the accused in the DJ’s booth, that he may be in possession of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	There was other evidence on this voir dire of a further issue, namely a conversation alleged to have occurred between Senior Constable Lay and Constable O’Leary at Redfern Police Station sometime between 7 and 8 during the dinner break, which included an informal debrief. There is a dispute about that evidence to the extent that Senior Constable Lay did not make any notes about what was in fact said to him by Constable O’Leary, and nor did she.
	
	
	Further, there are some aspects of Constable O’Leary’s evidence which might give rise to some doubt about whether or not any person she saw, apparently involved in activities consistent with drug supply in the DJ’s box, was in fact the accused or whether she had made a mistake about the identity of that person. That might have some bearing on the extent to which the actual content of her conversation with Senior Constable Lay can be accepted.
	
	
	I do not, however, feel the need to make any determination about that dispute because of the view that I have reached that, even without that evidence, a suspicion based on reasonable grounds for searching the accused has been established by the evidence.
	
	
	I accept Senior Constable Lay’s evidence about what were his observations of the accused on that night. It may be that there are other explanations for the accused’s sweating; including the fact that it was 5 or 6 January and he had just finished working. However, I accept his observation that the accused was sweating. His opinion that the accused was slightly intoxicated I accept as being a valid opinion based on the observations that he said he made. He gave evidence that the accused appeared nervous and did not make eye contact. There has been no suggestion that these were not accurate observations, rather that there may be some other explanation for these observations.
	
	
	It is submitted that I would find that when Senior Constable Lay approached the DJ’s booth, he did so with the formed intention already of searching the accused’s bag. I do not accept that submission. His evidence was that he did not see that the accused was holding a bag until he got closer and that evidence is consistent with the time of day and the nature of the surroundings. I also accept that the conversation initially was of a very general nature, which is also contrary to an assertion that Senior Constable Lay approached with the already formed view of searching the accused’s bag.
	
	
	The test to be applied is what was in the mind of the officer conducting the search. That is clear from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Rondo 126 A Crim R 562 at para 53.
	
	
	The general propositions surrounding the basis on which the Court is to make a finding about whether or not this is a reasonable suspicion has been established for the purposes of this provision of LEPRA. It is clear, and I accept, that a reasonable suspicion is a lesser position than a reasonable belief but more than a possibility. Neither can it be arbitrary. Significantly the important situation is what is in the mind of the police officer conducting the search in this case.
	
	
	The officer Senior Constable Lay knew the background available from the Crime Stoppers reports and the intelligence report arising from the police operation in July 2013. The fact that there had been nothing specifically involving this accused in any of those reports since January 2013 does not in my view affect the fact that this was capable of operating properly on his mind to form a proper suspicion.
	
	
	In fact as recently as July 2013 police had conducted an operation in that same hotel and found exactly the same behaviour as suggested in the crime stoppers report, namely that drugs were being used and apparently supplied in the DJ’s box at a SASH party at the Abercrombie Hotel, albeit not in the presence of this accused nor by this accused.
	
	
	I reject the submission on behalf of the accused that the provisions of s 21 mean that police must have a specific suspicion connected with individual, not a group. Clearly any police officer searching or detaining an individual without a warrant must have a suspicion based on reasonable grounds about that individual, but that suspicion can be based on knowledge of that person’s membership or association with a particular group in certain circumstances. Whether or not in those circumstances the suspicion is a reasonable one must always depend on the particular circumstances of any case. It could obviously never be reasonable to suspect that someone had committed a crime or was in possession of a drug or similar, simply because that person was for example, of a particular ethnic group or came from a particular suburb or was a particular religion.
	
	
	But this case is nowhere near as general as that. In this case police had information which, to an extent was verified by their operation in July 2013, that either DJs working at SASH dance parties or those involved with the DJs at those SASH parties at the Abercrombie Hotel on Sundays, were involved in supplying specific drugs. They also had specific information and knowledge that this accused was alleged to be one of those people, namely a DJ working at SASH parties who had in fact just finished working as a DJ at this particular SASH party and was still in the DJ’s booth.
	
	
	On the evidence which I have accepted, Senior Constable Lay saw evidence himself that many of those patrons at the dance party were under the influence of drugs. One person to his knowledge had been arrested earlier in the evening, in possession of and therefore in deemed supply of drugs. All of this I accept was operating on his mind when he approached the accused in the DJ’s box and made the observations that I accept he did.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I accept then that he formed the suspicion he did, and in those circumstances I accept that that suspicion was a reasonable one. Therefore the search was lawful under s 21 and evidence arising from that search is admissible.
	
	
	A further application is made to exclude the analysis of the drugs found in the possession of the accused. That challenge to the admissibility of the evidence is made on the basis that the analysis was done contrary to the provisions of regulation 10 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulations. That regulation appears in the section of the regulations involving the disposition, destruction, possession and analysis of prohibited drugs taken into possession by police officers during the course of investigations under their general powers, and in particular in relation to the provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. That regulation, inter alia, provides that such drugs taken into the custody of police following, in this case the search of an individual, must be submitted as soon as possible but, in any event, no later than 14 days after they come into the possession of the police.
	
	
	The argument on behalf of the accused is that the provisions of this regulation are couched in mandatory terms. In this case, the drugs found in the accused’s satchel on search were taken into possession of police on 6 January and were submitted to what was then called DAL on 23 January. That is thus three days outside the upper limit set by the regulation for the analysis of drugs pursuant to regulation 10.
	
	
	The Crown’s argument, as I understand it, would appear to be that on construction of the regulation I would not find that this was a mandatory provision. I am referred to authorities to that effect. Whilst I accept that the use of the word “must” does not necessarily indicate that any particular statutory provision is mandatory, it seems to me that the combination of that word and the words in brackets “(in any case no more than 14 days)” mean that the provisions of this part of regulation 10 are mandatory. In other words, drugs taken into possession of the police must be submitted for analysis no later than 14 days after they come into possession of the police.
	
	
	That did not occur here. The analysis was conducted by DAL. The results were made available. The Crown seeks to rely on that analysis either by the tender of a certificate or some other way but nonetheless by tendering a certificate. The argument is that the drugs, having been submitted for analysis outside the mandated 14 days, the evidence arising from what is alleged to be that illegality, ought be rejected. I do accept that the provision is mandatory. The evidence is clear that the drugs were submitted three days outside the 14 days. Thus, the submission of the drugs for analysis was not in compliance with regulation 10.
	
	
	As such, I accept that the evidence is unlawfully obtained, given that the analysis itself depends on the taking into possession of the drugs by the laboratory in contravention of the mandatory provision of regulation 10. However, it then turns to determine whether or not despite this illegality, the evidence ought to otherwise be admitted pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	One of the issues in relation to my determination on this point is that there is very little evidence on which I can make any decisions. Section 138(3) sets out a number of matters that the Court may take into account in exercising the discretion that is, engaging in the balancing exercise that is an inherent part of s 138 of the Evidence Act. That section provides that the evidence is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting it, outweighs the undesirability of doing so.
	
	
	Dealing with some of those matters or those matters that are relevant for S138(3), I accept that the probative value of the evidence is very high and its probative value gives rise to the significant importance of the evidence in the proceedings. Unless the evidence of analysis is admitted, the Crown case must fail because they cannot prove that whatever it was that the accused had in his satchel, was in fact a prohibited drug.
	
	
	The offence itself is a serious offence, as is any drug supply offence. This of course however is not, by any stretch of the imagination, at the top end of drug supply offences, given that the quantities are relatively small and it is brought as a deemed supply offence.
	
	
	As to the gravity of the contravention and the reason for the contravention, so far as the latter is concerned, I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever to allow me to make a finding.
	
	
	As to the gravity of the contravention, it is hard to determine. The purpose of this regulation it seems to me, is equally hard to determine. It seems to me that there are three possible likely purposes of this regulation and I have, during the course of debate, given voice to one that seemed obvious but thought about it more carefully since adjourning.
	
	
	It seems to me that there are three possible purposes. One is a largely machinery provision to enable the admission of evidence of analysis by way of certificate without the need to call witnesses. However, the general regulations contained in Part 3 covering more than that, it seems to me that that cannot be the overriding purpose of this regulation.
	
	
	A second possible purpose it seems to me is to ensure the possibility of contamination, degradation, loss or the like of such evidence is minimised. That is a possible purpose of this regulation, but looking further at that regulation it seems to me that it is probably not the only purpose. The reason for that finding is because nowhere in the regulation is to be found a time limit set for the analysis of the drugs, provision for the way in which they must be specifically sealed or retained by a laboratory or similar matters.
	
	
	The third possible purpose of this regulation is to ensure that evidence in serious cases gathered by police is properly marshalled and made available for analysis in a timely manner. It seems to me that this is another likely purpose, particularly so to ensure continuity of evidence and to ensure a lesser risk of the possibility of allegations of corruption or improper behaviour on the part of police in the context of criminal proceedings. That is not just a fanciful issue and is clearly evidenced in the findings of the Police Royal Commission in New South Wales.
	
	
	However, it is hard to actually determine what the purpose of the regulation is and therefore very difficult to determine how grave the contravention is. Whatever the purpose is, and it may be a combination of all three, in fact these drugs were submitted for analysis only three days outside the 14 day period. That is a factor to take into account in determining that the contravention is not of itself of significant gravity. There is no other evidence to suggest that except for the submission of the evidence three days after the 14 day cut-off period there was anything to suggest the quality of the analysis was in any way compromised.
	
	
	That having been said, however, I want to make it clear that I am not by making that finding attempting to reverse any onus. In fact the Crown has chosen not to call any evidence in relation to this issue, making it very difficult to make proper findings.
	
	
	If this were a case in which the drugs were submitted for analysis much later than three days after the cut-off period, the outcome may well be very different. The question on balance is whether the desirability of omitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of doing so. The balance is a fine one in this case, in my view. Clearly enough without the evidence the Crown case fails.
	
	
	The case is serious but not the gravest of matters being tried in the criminal courts. On the other hand, it is incumbent upon police to comply with regulations and statutory provisions. They are there for a reason. The fact that the reason is not abundantly clear in relation to this regulation does not, however, absolve them from complying with it. It is important that police not only comply with regulations but know what those regulations provide and that those at management levels in the Police Service make it quite clear to those operating at street level and at ground level what their powers are and, more particularly, what the limitation of their powers is. There are good policy reasons based in history in New South Wales and generally why those powers should be understood and the legislation limiting and imposing those powers should be strictly complied with and enforced.
	
	
	However, it is a balancing exercise whether or not to admit this evidence and I have concluded that on balance the desirability of admitting it outweighs the undesirability of doing so. The evidence of analysis will, therefore, be admitted.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused has quite properly indicated that even though in strict terms the certificate is not admissible as such, such a point will not be taken at the trial in the event that the Court decided to admit the evidence.

2704180,Panchal v R; R v Panchal [2014] NSWCCA 275,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  Mr Jayeshkumar Dashrathal Panchal seeks leave to appeal from his conviction after a trial, before a judge of the District Court sitting alone, of three counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1), and one count of aggravated sexual assault contrary s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). An offence contrary to s 61M(1) carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of 5 years. An offence contrary to s 61J(1) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of 10 years. All offences were committed on 24 February 2011, upon the same victim whilst she travelled on the train from Springwood to Wentworth Falls.  Mr Panchal was the guard on that train.  Although leave is required (because not all of the grounds raise a question of law), it is convenient to refer to Mr Panchal as the appellant when dealing with his appeal against conviction.  
2The Crown appeals, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. A sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, dating from 31 May 2013 (the conclusion of the trial), was imposed in the case of the aggravated sexual assaults contrary s 61J(1). Periods of imprisonment of 3, 6 and 9 months were imposed for the aggravated indecent assaults contrary to s 61M(1).  These sentences were also to date from 31 May 2013, and so were wholly concurrent with each other and the sentence imposed for the aggravated sexual assault.  
3The circumstance of aggravation for all counts, which is central to grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal against conviction, as well as to the Crown appeal, is the fact that the complainant was a young woman of ""moderate"" intellectual disability. Where a victim has cognitive impairment, ss 61J(2)(g) and 61M(3)(e) provide this as a circumstance of aggravation. 
4""Moderate"" in this context bears a technical meaning.  The uncontroversial evidence was that on many scales, she functioned at a level lower than 99.9% of her age peers, with an IQ between 35 and 49, and in many respects, including communication skills, had the age of a young child.  The forensic psychologist called by the Crown said that the complainant's disability:  
""would be obvious to a reasonable person within a few moments of contact with her.  She speaks slowly, in basic language, and has difficulty expressing herself.  She had difficulty in giving a detailed history of her life.  She is very concrete in her answers and immature in speech construction.  She also had an immature demeanour in social interactions, and is inappropriately giggly and compliant.""
Factual background
5On the afternoon of Thursday 24 February 2011, the complainant travelled home from her special school near Springwood to Wentworth Falls.  Station CCTV footage tendered at the trial shows her boarding through the rear doors of the last carriage of the train at 3.28pm, and walking along the platform at Wentworth Falls at 4.08pm after leaving the train.  The guard's compartment was at the very end of the train.  The footage shows her shaking hands with the guard immediately before she boarded the train.  The cameras at Wentworth Falls did not capture her image as she left the train, but she is shown waving, either to the guard or someone else in the train or on the platform, as the train drew out from the platform.
6An internal door, with a tinted glass window, separated the guard's compartment from the rest of the carriage.  It was contrary to RailCorp policy for passengers to travel in the guard's compartment.  However, there was no dispute that the complainant had travelled with the guard in his compartment for the conclusion of her journey.  How she came to be in the compartment was disputed.
7The complainant walked home from the station, and was driven by her father to a doctor's surgery, where she had an appointment.  In the waiting room, and in the surgery carpark after the appointment, she told him that she had been touched by the guard ""down there"". The complainant also said that the railway man had told her she wasn't to tell anyone what had happened, that she wasn't to say anything. When she returned home that evening, she made a more detailed complaint to her mother, consistent with the particulars of the charges as they were led at trial.  The mother called the police, and the complainant told a (female) sergeant that the guard had invited her into his compartment and touched her.  A police officer attended on the family's house that evening and secured the complainant's clothes, which were placed into individual bags, and taken to Katoomba Police Station.  Police made RailCorp aware of the incident that evening, and the duty security controller called the appellant at 9:30pm that evening.  That call was recorded, and the transcript placed into evidence.  
8The complainant was herself interviewed for slightly more than 3 hours on the following afternoon, Friday 25 February 2011, by a police officer in the Joint Investigation Response Team.  That interview was video-recorded and played at trial (its transcript is in the appeal papers).  There was a second video-recorded interview, made on 29 March 2011, which was much shorter, and also played at the trial.
9In her first interview the complainant said that she was standing in the carriage, because all the seats were taken, when the guard came to her, held her hand and pulled her into his compartment, saying ""Come, come here.  Hold my hand"", ""I really love you"", ""Come for a date"" and ""Stay on the train with me until to get to Katoomba"".  While he was saying this, she said he was feeling her private parts.
10The count of aggravated sexual assault was that the appellant penetrated the complainant's vagina with his finger.  The complainant described this in her first interview, stating that he had pulled down the zipper on her pants, and that his fingers were inside her clothes, and not touching her skin, but ""the private part"":  
""Q.  His fingers touched your private part?
A.  Yeah, yeah.  Oops.
Q.  And what do you call the private part?
A.  Ah, the gina.
Q.  OK.  And what ... did the fingers do on your gina?
A.  Ah, it was, it was starting to sting and burn.
Q.  OK.  How come it was stinging and burning?
A.  Ah, because, because I, I because he had his fingers in there and it was starting to, inside the gina was starting to burn ---
Q.  OK.
A.  --- when, he had his fingers in.
Q.  So he had his fingers inside your vagina ---
A.  Yeah.
Q. --- and you're telling me it started to sting and burn.
A.  Yeah.
Q.  Do you know how far his fingers were in your vagina when it started to sting and burn?
A.  Ah, ah, I don't know.
Q.  That's OK.
A.  I don't know.
Q.  OK.  What else could you feel?  You could feel stinging and burning.
A.  Yeah.
Q.  What else could you feel?
A.  It, It was starting to be sore and uncomfortable when, when he was having his fingers inside.""
11The counts of aggravated indecent assault were that the appellant had touched the complainant's right breast and her left breast, and that he had put his hand inside his own pants and held his erect penis close to her groin.  The complainant described the appellant touching both of her breasts in her first interview.  Each assault was, according to her description, different.  First, she said that the appellant held his hand under the complainant's shirt and over the outside of the bra on her right breast:  
""Q.  You said you had a bra on.
A.  Yeah.
Q.  Was his hand on the outside of the bra or on the inside of the bra touching your breast or something else?
A.  Ah, outside the bra.
Q.  OK.
A.  Yeah.
Q.  All right.
A.  Yeah.
Q.  And on the other side on your left breast ---
A.  Yeah.
Q.  --- he had his hand on the outside of your T-shirt is what you said, is it?
A.  Yeah.""
12The complainant described the event of him holding his penis in a further interview she gave on 29 March 2011:  
""Q.  ... What could you see?
A.  I, I didn't saw it. I, I felt it.  Yeah.  I only, I felt it.  Yeah.
Q.  Tell me more about how you felt it.
A.  He, he was, I, I felt it because he, 'cause he was moving around in, I, I felt it when he was moving with his half of his arm went in his pants.
Q.  Yeah.
A. And I felt his hands, I felt his hand moving to, to, to, you know, like a, like a cardboard.""
13It was not suggested by the appellant that, if the complainant's evidence was accepted, it was insufficient to establish the conduct constituting each of the counts on the indictment.  Accordingly, it is not necessary for present purposes to reproduce or otherwise summarise the detail of the balance of the complainant's account; it suffices to say that it proceeds in the same linguistic style as may be seen from the passages reproduced above, using very simple but direct language.  
14Turning to the near-contemporaneous accounts given by the appellant, as noted above, he was called by the duty security controller, Mr Chris Kalogeropoulos, at around 9.30pm that evening.  After confirming that he had been the guard on the relevant train, this conversation occurred:  
""CK:  Did you have any incidents on that at all up at Springwood or Wentworth Falls, an assault or anything?
JP:  Incident?  No.
CK:  No?  No incidents?  Alright.
JP:  There were two angry customers knocked the doors why the train is running slow and I think some naughty boys also.
CK:  Right, okay.
JP:  And then (inaudible) I just - there are two big girls and I just assisted one disabled girl from - from, I think, I don't know from where she got on but she knocked, she needed to get off at Wentworth Falls and she, I think she is upset with those boys. 
CK:  Okay, alright.
JP:  And I just assist her.
CK:  Okay.
JP:  There was no place to seat her and I think she has a walking and speaking problem.
CK:  Okay, alright then, no problem.
JP:  I just asked her to sit in my chair, then I was standing all the time because it was two stops she wanted to get off.""
15As is apparent from that transcript, the appellant spoke English as a second language, less than perfectly, and with an Indian accent.  He gave evidence that passengers often had difficulty understanding him because of his accent.
16On the afternoon of 25 February 2011, in the execution of a search warrant, a detective senior constable and around four other officers attended upon the appellant's house and seized some of the appellant's clothing.  The execution of the warrant was video-recorded, and during the process, the appellant was asked and answered questions about what had occurred the previous day (having been told that he did not need to say anything but that anything which he did say would be recorded and might be used in evidence).  The appellant was cross-examined as to the disparities between his testimony to the Court in 2013 and what he told police the day after the incident.  During that search, there were these questions and answers:  
""Q.  ... [S]o you are not allowed to have passengers inside the guard compartment, is that right?
A.  Yes.
Q.  Okay, so what happened - you said she was having trouble?
A.  Yes, and she said, 'I would like to sit there, so could you please help me?'  and I said, 'Yes.'  Normally - sometimes it is permissible for aged people, or people with troubles - if they are being harassed or abused on the train, so we help them up to their destination.  I asked the lady, 'Where you want to?'  'Wentworth Falls'.  She was sitting there during all that time.  I was stick to the door.  Only the one person now that I'm thinking because my boss ring me at night when I'm finished my job.  He said, 'Any complaint or assault or anything?'  And I said, 'No complaint'.""
17There were two other documents which dated, or purported to date, from the day.  One was a ""Guards Report of Late Running Trains"".  The evidence was that it was standard procedure for the form to be completed when a train ran late (as the train on 24 February 2011 was).  The appellant completed it, lodged it with his employer and kept a carbon copy.  On it he had written ""Train is late as slow running train after Springwood.  Assist to disabled passenger"".  The appellant also kept a diary at home with work-related information in it, including overtime he had worked.  The page for 24 February includes the words ""late train to Katoomba 12 mins and assist disabled girl to WWF"".
18To summarise the near-contemporaneous evidence dating from within 24 hours of the complainant's train trip, there were, first, complaints to her father and mother.  Secondly, there was an extensive interview by the complainant with a police officer, which was recorded.  Thirdly, there was a conversation between the appellant and his RailCorp supervisor, which was recorded.  Fourthly, there was a conversation with the police and the appellant during the execution of the search warrant, which was video-recorded.  Fifthly, there were two documents in the appellant's hand - the late train slip, and his personal diary.  Finally, there was CCTV footage from some of the stations on the line, including footage clearly showing the complainant entering the carriage (through the double-doors next to the guard's compartment).  They shook hands as the complainant entered the train.  The CCTV footage does not show the complainant leaving the carriage, but it does show her waving, most likely to the guard, as the train pulled out of Wentworth Falls. 
The DNA evidence
19On 30 May 2011, the appellant was arrested for sexual assault.  As was his right, he declined to participate in an interview.  He did provide a buccal swab from which his DNA could be obtained.
20Expert evidence of an analysis of DNA recovered from the items of clothing taken from the complainant was tendered at trial.  It included DNA testing using the ""Y-filer system"".  There was evidence that that system, which targets the gender-determining chromosome of the male:  
""can be particularly useful in a case where the DNA recovered from an item is a mixture of both male and female DNA.  As females do not possess a Y Chromosome (only X chromosomes) this difference is exploited in order to target only the male DNA in a male/female DNA mixture"".
21The evidence was that the appellant, or male relatives on his paternal line, and approximately 1 in 750 unrelated males in the general population could not be excluded from DNA found in the inside upper front of the complainant's underpants.  Further, DNA recovered from the outside front right of her bra, and inside right breast area of her t-shirt had the same profile as one of two other contributors to the DNA recovered.  The expert evidence was that ""this Y-minor profile is expected to occur in approximately 1 in 130 million individuals in the general population.""  The complainant's DNA was also found on the outside from left of the bra, and the inside left breast area of her T-shirt, together with other DNA, which was ""too weak and too complex to determine the profiles of the individual contributors"". 
22There was no challenge to the DNA methodology used, or the chain of custody.  The defence case accepted that the appellant's DNA had been found on the complainant's clothes.  The defence case was one of innocent transfer, it being common ground that the complainant had been in the guard's compartment that afternoon.
23It will be seen that the identification of the appellant's DNA on the inside of the appellant's underpants, and on the outside of the right cup of her bra and the inside right of her T-shirt, but not on the outside of the left cup of her bra or the inner left of her T-shirt, is consistent with what the complainant said in her recorded interview the day after the incident. 
The evidence at the trial
24The near-contemporaneous evidence referred to above, and the expert DNA evidence, was adduced at the trial.  The complainant's evidence in chief took the form of the recordings of her interviews (this is the subject of ground 2), and she was cross-examined by video-link in the afternoon of the second day of the trial.  There were some inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence, which are the subject of the first ground of appeal, and addressed below when dealing with that ground.  
25The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined on 6th and 7th days of the trial.  There were inconsistencies between his testimony at trial, and what he had said in the 24 hours immediately following the incident. 
26The appellant maintained in evidence in chief that he was new on the line, that he was not sure which side the platforms were on, and that while he was looking out the wrong side at Lawson (a station between Springwood and Wentworth Falls), the complainant had entered into his compartment.  He said that he thought that ""she is under stressful condition or under the influence of any intoxicating material or maybe medication"".  He found that she was travelling to Wentworth Falls, two stations further along the line, and let her stay in his compartment, because the carriage was full, and because it was ""only two stops"" and ""as a female passenger and mostly she was fretting, I tried to help her, let her sit in my cab"".  He denied touching her in any way, and all other aspects of the complainant's account.  He said that he did come slightly into contact with the complainant as he was checking the doors.  
27He was cross-examined:
""Q.  You were inquiring, 'Look, why did you come here?'  Effectively you have told her that she's not allowed in there, and suddenly she's here and you were surprised by that, and you're asking, 'Look, why are you here?'?
A.  WITNESS:  Yes.
Q.  Is that a fair summation of your evidence, sir?
A.  WITNESS:  Yes.""
28The appellant accepted that he was aware that passengers were not allowed to travel in the guard's compartment, and that doing so could result in disciplinary proceedings and retraining.  The appellant accepted that it would have been important to record the fact that the complainant had entered his cabin without permission in his report of the late running train, and that although he had recorded ""assisted disabled passengers"" he had not done so, either in the late train slip, or in his personal diary.
29He was cross-examined by reference to what he had said that evening to the duty controller, and the following afternoon to the police officer, about how the complainant had come into his cabin.  He accepted that his memory then would have been better than it was more than 2 years later.  He gave this evidence:  
""Q.  So you say that when you were talking to Mr Kalogeropoulos you were talking about a different time that you asked her [to] sit down, is that right?
A.  WITNESS:  Yes.  ""Sit there"" simply.
Q.  But you didn't say anything at all to Mr Kalogeropoulos about the fact that it was her, on your version, who came into your cabin without permission, did you?
A.  WITNESS:  It was because the lapse of time and I was just rushing back and maybe it didn't recall me.
Q.  The lapse of time - the six hours that had elapsed between Springwood station and Chris Kalogeropoulos - you say that's the reason that you didn't say anything to him about her effectively coming into your cabin without permission?
A.  WITNESS:  Yes.
Q.  On your version you specially said you're not allowed to come in, hadn't you?
A.  WITNESS:  Yes.
Q.  You don't think that would have been an important piece of information to tell the duty controller?
A.  WITNESS:  Maybe I missed that off.""
30The appellant said that he asked the complainant whether she was going to Katoomba.  When asked why, he said:  
""A.  WITNESS:  If she want to go to Katoomba - say ""Yes"" then I should have seen to report to Katoomba station manager about this lady.
Q.  You didn't take her to the station master at Wentworth Falls did you, when you got her off?
A.  WITNESS:  No, no.
Q.  Is it the case that you tell us about this conversation where you raised the station, Katoomba, because you heard [the complainant's] evidence that you had invited her get off the train at Katoomba with you - is that why you tell us about this?
A.  WITNESS:  No.""
The verdict of the trial judge
31Counsels' addresses concluded on 30 May 2013. The trial judge gave her decision at 10am on 31 May.  Her reasons occupy 45 pages.  Her Honour accepted that the complainant was the only Crown witness capable of giving direct evidence about the central events in the trial.  Her Honour, correctly, stated that it was not necessary for her to accept the evidence of the appellant in order for there to be a reasonable doubt, and that no inference could be drawn against him from his failure to participate in an interview after his arrest.  Her Honour summarised the evidence, and then, at pages 33-34, found the appellant guilty of counts 1-4.  Her Honour then gave reasons for those findings.  
32Her Honour found that the complainant was honest and accurate in important matters, and that although there were discrepancies, they were not such as to cause her to be doubted on important matters.  Her Honour said, of the lengthy video-recorded interview the complaint gave the following day to be ""compelling"", and ""particularly for someone who is disabled"".
33Her Honour found that the complainant's evidence was corroborated by the DNA found on the inside front of her underpants, and on the right cup of her bra.  The fact that no DNA was found on the left cup of the complainant's bra was consistent with her account, that she was squeezed on the right breast on the outside of her clothing.  
34Her Honour said of the complainant's disability this:
""I find it's more than obvious from the way she appears, her mannerisms, her speech and the way she behaved during her interview with police and whilst giving evidence before me of that fact.  She remained adamant at all times she told the police the truth and she told this Court the truth and I could find no reason to disbelieve her.""
35In relation to the complainant's waving to the appellant as the train left Wentworth Falls, her Honour said:
""The fact that she turned and waved, either to him or to other train passengers and was not seen to run from the station does not mean that what she says occurred did not occur.  Her demeanour is consistent with her intellectual disability, perhaps it took her time to process what had occurred.  What she did of course was to articulate and demonstrate as best she could to those who love and support her what had occurred to her and to do so consistently from then on.""
36Her Honour found the appellant's version of events ""simply implausible"".  Her Honour relied on the contradiction between his evidence in court and when he was first spoken to by police.  Her Honour did:
""not accept for one moment that he initially did not find this young woman significantly intellectually disabled.  One only has to look at her movements to determine that that is a possibility.  To suggest that she was someone under the influence of either alcohol or drugs is laughable, she had the appearance of a young girl, not someone affected by alcohol.  I find he knew full well she was disabled as evidenced by his notation to that effect in the delay slip and his diary.""
37Her Honour said, more generally:
""I had ample opportunity to view [the appellant] in Court throughout the trial and whilst he gave evidence.  His responses, in cross-examination in particular, I find were clearly responses when under pressure.  There were pregnant pauses before he answered questions, consistent with someone attempting to answer in a way as to minimise the risk of inculpating himself.  He was not a particularly impressive witness.""
38It is convenient to defer, until dealing with ground 3 of the appeal, what her Honour said as to the appellant's good character.  
39Sentencing took place on 30 August 2013; the sentencing remarks and the Crown's challenge to them are addressed in the part of these reasons dealing with the Crown appeal.
Ground 1:  Her Honour's verdicts were unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
40The trial was conducted without a jury, on the application of the defence which was not opposed by the Crown, pursuant to Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 132.  Her Honour's verdict has the same effect as that of a jury:  s 133.  It was common ground that the principles identified in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11] to the challenge under s 6(1).
41The question is whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to her Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.  That requires this Court to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality:  SKA at [14].  As noted above, the sufficiency of the Crown evidence was not in dispute, and as much is plain from the evidence of the complainant.  What was put in issue on this ground of the appeal was whether it was open to her Honour to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt as to the events described by the complainant.
42It is quite plain that it was open to her Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.  The essential question was, as her Honour appreciated, whether the complainant's testimonial evidence persuaded her of the appellant's guilt of the offences charged to the criminal standard.  Even the limited extracts of the transcript of her testimony, given 24 hours after those events and reproduced in these reasons, convey very clearly an intellectually impaired young woman, with the mental age of a young girl, doing her best to describe, accurately and truthfully, what had occurred.  Her evidence on matters of substance was not shaken in cross-examination.  Her complaints were very substantially consistent and - save for the indecent assault the subject of the fourth count - made at the first opportunity.  And the DNA analysis - obtained months after that interview was given - strikingly supports her testimony, especially in respect of her descriptions of the differences between the appellant's assaults when he squeezed her right breast (under her shirt) and left breast (outside her shirt).  
43The appellant's submissions focussed on what was said to be the highly implausible nature of the complainant's account:  that the guard forced her into his compartment, in full view of other passengers on a crowded train, that the offences could have been seen by those passengers through the window of the compartment, that the complainant's statement that she had been penetrated for 15 minutes was highly improbable, having regard to the length of the journey and the guard's duties on the platform when the train had come to a stop, and that in general her evidence in cross-examination was replete with statements that she could not remember.  Particular attention was given to the criticism that the guard kissed her in the public part of the carriage, and her waving to the guard as the train left Wentworth Falls station.
44It is certainly true that the complainant answered many questions in cross-examination by ""I don't remember"".  It is also true that there were some inconsistencies in the accounts that the complainant gave, however, the appellant's submissions overstate this.  Some of the inconsistencies are likely the product of ambiguity in the questions and answers, or misunderstandings. The language used by the complainant is consistent with her being kissed immediately after entering the guard's compartment, as well as in the passenger area of the carriage.  It was open to the trial judge to conclude that her waving to the guard as the train left Wentworth Falls, on which the appellant relied strongly, is far from decisive.  Early in her interview the following day, she said that he said ""Goodbye, goodbye, sweetheart"" and ""I walked, I walked to the, I walked, I was walking past the, the, near the toilets and I waved to him.  I, I didn't mean to, um, I didn't mean to um I didn't, I didn't mean to"".  That unprompted answer, given without the benefit of seeing the CCTV footage, tends to confirm that the complainant was, once again, doing her best to recall precisely what had occurred.  Other aspects of her evidence suggest a clear and episodic memory of the events.  For example, when asked where she went after getting off the train, she answered ""I walked up the bridge the railway, the, the bridge at the station"" ... ""I was going upstairs at the station and downstairs on the other side of the bride.  Then there's a bridge at Wentworth Falls train station"", ""I walked home down the, near the bush walking down near the bush"" ... ""and I got stuck at near the streets, near my street near Taylor Street.  And ... after when the cars went past I went straight across down to another bush where there's a, there's a walking track ... and I walked after the walking track I walked home"".  The episodic and plainly genuine recounting of events by the complainant no doubt contributed to the trial judge's assessment of the interview as ""compelling"".  
45Moreover, some inconsistencies are almost inevitable in any case when the same witness gives evidence over a period of years of the same events. 
46The complainant made consistent complaints essentially immediately.  Those complaints were corroborated by the DNA consistent with that of the appellant being found in her clothes precisely where it might be expected to be found consistently with her complaints:  on the inside of her underpants, on the outside of the right cup of her bra, on the inside of the right of her T-shirt, but not on the left cup of her bra or the left side of her T-shirt.  In relation to the fourth count, the trial judge said that:
""Her evidence has an extraordinary ring of truth to it in as much as she is a cognitively impaired young woman doing her best to describe a man, this accused, masturbating in front of her at a time when he had an erection.  She could feel that erection, 'it felt like cardboard'.""
47In contrast, the inconsistencies in the appellant's cases were substantial.  First, there is the serious discrepancy between what he said to the railway controller, and to the police, within 24 hours of the incident, that he had invited the complainant into his cabin, and his testimony at trial that the complainant had entered the cabin against his instructions.  Secondly, his evidence at trial that he did not at first appreciate that she was intellectually disabled was contrary to what he said, and wrote, at the time, and there is no reason to doubt what the trial judge said, and what was the unchallenged psychological evidence, that as much would be obvious almost immediately.  Thirdly, it is very difficult to reconcile the appellant's testimony with DNA consistent with his own being found on the complainant.
48Of course, the primary judge was much better placed than this Court to assess the credibility of the key witnesses.  Her Honour saw them both give evidence (the complainant via a video-link), over a period of hours in the case of the complainant, and eight days in the case of the appellant.  It is plain that there were matters which do not appear in the written record - including the pauses of the appellant when being cross-examined noted by her Honour.  
49This Court must itself scrutinise the whole of the evidence in order to assess the reasonableness of the guilty verdicts.  However, as Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [23]:
""However, in making that assessment, the Court would properly have been conscious of the fact that there were aspects of the case that would not be reflected adequately in the written record.""
50That echoed what had been said in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493:
""the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.""
51This is a case where what was said by Bathurst CJ in W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [158] is entirely apposite:
""This was a case where the trial judge's assessment of the complainant was vital: see MFA v The Queen at [23]. It was open, in my opinion, for the trial judge to be satisfied of the reliability of the complainant on the critical issues having seen her give evidence, notwithstanding the matters to which I have referred to above. ... It seems to me that any doubt which may exist as to the reasonableness of the verdict is resolved in this case by the advantage the trial judge had in seeing the complainant give her evidence.""
52Orally (but not in writing), it was submitted that the Court should view the video-recording of the complainant's interviews, so as to better assess the hesitations in her evidence, and to observe the difference between her evidence in chief  and her evidence in cross-examination.
53However, what was not submitted was that there was some particular aspect of the video-recorded evidence that needed to be seen because of a deficiency in the transcript. Indeed, counsel had not himself viewed the video-recorded evidence.
54French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ said in SKA at [31]:  
""It is to be expected that if there is something which may affect a court's view of the evidence, which can only be discerned visually or by sound, it can and will be identified. Absent this purpose it is not possible to conclude that a court is obliged to go further and view a recording of evidence. There must be something in the circumstances of the case which necessitates such an approach.""
55It may readily be inferred that the manner in which the complainant gave evidence in chief was different from her evidence under cross-examination.  That is the common experience of witnesses in court.  As much may be assumed, favourably to the appellant.  It does not detract from the proposition that it was open to the trial judge, enjoying the considerable advantages mentioned above, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the complainant's testimony on material matters.  Given the way in which the submission was advanced, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to view the recording of the complainant's interview, and we have not done so.
56Leave should be granted to raise this ground of appeal, but it must be dismissed.
Ground 2:  Her Honour erred in permitting the complainant to give evidence in the manner provided for by Chapter 6, Part 6 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, without first satisfying herself that the facts of the case may be better ascertained, if the person's evidence is given in such a manner, as mandated by s 306P(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
57Early in the trial, there was the following exchange:  
""CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Your Honour [the complainant] is in the CCTV room.  The reason that, your Honour's heard that she was 22 years old in 2011, she's now 24 years old.  The Crown says that she fits under the definition of vulnerable person under section 306M of the Criminal Procedure Act on the basis of her cognitive impairment and I understand that that's not in dispute.  Your Honour will hear some evidence about it during the course of the trial.
HIGGINS:  That's correct.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  As a result, the way that the Crown proposes to call substantially her evidence-in-chief, is by playing two pre-recorded interviews and she's entitled to do that under section 309S(1)(a), being a vulnerable person.  There is, as your Honour's clearly aware that there's a presumption that everyone's competent to give sworn evidence.  This might be a case though that your Honour might need to satisfy yourself that [the complainant] is competent to give sworn evidence.  Certainly in my discussions with her, she's been able to express what would happen if she was to tell a lie in court and she understands the obligation to tell the truth.  That just in terms of understanding an affirmation and an oath, it might be that your Honour gets to make some inquiry of her.
HER HONOUR:  Can we turn the screen on.  Has she got a support person in the room?""
58The Crown thereafter relied upon the mechanisms available under ss 306U and 306ZB of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986:  a pre-recorded interview was put into evidence, and the complainant was cross-examined via closed-circuit television.  
59This ground turned on s 306P(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which provides:  
""To the extent that this Part applies to cognitively impaired persons, this Part applies (unless a contrary intention is shown) in relation to evidence given by a cognitively impaired person in the manner provided by this Part only if the court is satisfied that the facts of the case may be better ascertained if the person's evidence is given in such a manner.""
60There was no dispute that the complainant was a cognitively impaired person for the purposes of the section.  The gravamen of the ground is that only if the judge turned her attention to the issue and was satisfied that the facts of the case might be better ascertained by that method, was the power available.  It was said that this was a ""fundamental"" defect in the trial, which required the verdict to be quashed and there to be a retrial.  
61There is nothing in this ground.  There is no requirement that the state of satisfaction required by s 306P(2) must be expressly recorded by the judge.  It is very difficult to resist the conclusion that, very shortly after the trial judge confirmed that the complainant knew the difference between truth and falsehood, her Honour must have been satisfied, had her attention been directed to the point, that the course proposed by the Crown and to which the defence acquiesced was the better course for ascertaining the facts of the case.  However, it is not necessary to resolve this ground of appeal on that basis.  That is because s 306ZJ of the Act is in the following terms:  
""306ZJ Validity of proceedings not affected 
(1) The failure of a vulnerable person to give evidence in accordance with a provision of this Part does not affect the validity of any proceeding or any decision made in connection with that proceeding.""
62That section replicated an identical provision in the Evidence (Children) Act 1997 (NSW) and was originally introduced in the Crimes (Child Victim Evidence) Amendment Act 1990 (NSW) as s 405I of the Crimes Act 1900.  As the Crown submitted, the effect of that provision is a complete answer to the ground.  The appellant contended that there was a distinction between validity and error.  It was put as follows:
""We don't contend it is invalid but [it is] an appeal point.  They are distinct legal propositions. .. [We do not regard] the proceedings as invalid.  We do say that they were affected by error such that the appeal should be upheld.""
63That submission must be rejected.  Not only the proceedings, but also the decision to permit the complainant's evidence to be given in the manner that it was, were valid.  In this context, it is plain that the ""validity"" mandated by statute denies the availability of any error which would attract the operation of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act.  The decision to permit evidence being adduced in accordance with ss 306U(1) and 306ZB(1) without the formation of the opinion required by 306P(2) is not susceptible to challenge.  
64It follows that leave should not be granted (leave is required under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, this point not having been taken at any stage during the trial) to permit it being raised on appeal.  
Ground 3:   In considering whether the appellant had committed the offences charged, as well as his credibility, her Honour erred in giving the appellant's prior good character less weight, by taking into account an irrelevant consideration, namely that sexual offences are often committed by persons of good character.
65The hearing took place without a jury; nevertheless, her Honour identified the approach she would take to various matters, in a way analogous to directions to the jury.  That included her approach to the evidence of the good character of the accused.  Her Honour said this:  
""The fact that the accused was a person of good character is relevant to the likelihood of him having committed the offence as alleged.  I can take into account his good character by reasoning that such a person is unlikely to have committed the offences charged by the Crown.  Whether I do or not is a matter for me.  I can use the evidence of good character to support his credibility.  I am entitled to reason that a person of good character is less likely to lie or give a false account, either in giving evidence or giving an account of events in answers to questions asked by him by police or investigators.  Whether I reason in that way is a matter for me to determine.  None of this means that good character provides the accused with some kind of defence, it is only one of the many factors which I am asked to take into account in determining whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.  What weight I give to the fact that he is a person of good character is completely a matter for me, but it is a matter I should take into account.""
66That occurred at page 27 of the transcript of 31 May 2013.  At pp 33-34, her Honour found the accused guilty as charged of counts 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Her Honour thereafter gave her reasons for those findings.  Her Honour addressed the testimonial evidence, the DNA evidence which corroborated it, the timing of the complaints by the complainant, the interview on the following day (which her Honour regarded as a ""compelling interview""), and her statement that ""there are aspects of her evidence which have an extraordinary ring of truth to them"".  Her Honour dealt with the contradicting testimonial evidence of the appellant, regarding him as ""not a particularly impressive witness"", and concluding (at T45) that:  
""There can be no doubt he is a person of otherwise good character, unfortunately persons of otherwise [good] character do commit crimes and often crimes of this very type.  Whilst it is a matter he is entitled to have taken into account as the law requires, I find as a matter to be given less weight than would otherwise be the case.  I do not doubt for one moment that he might be regarded by others as a caring and kind individual who is prepared to contribute to society in a significant way.  That does not alter the fact that I find myself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he has committed the offences for which he has been charged and I, accordingly, have found him guilty.""
67It was submitted that error was shown by her Honour's taking into account an irrelevant consideration, namely that offences of this type are committed by persons of good character.  
68It is not necessary to identify how this submission was elaborated in writing, and orally.  It may be acknowledged that her Honour's wording about giving good character ""less weight than would otherwise be the case"" is less than ideal, reflective of the fact that her Honour gave lengthy ex tempore reasons for conviction immediately after the conclusion of the trial.  However, it is plain that her Honour was not making a statement about the way in which good character is to inform the assessment of competing testimonial evidence.  Rather, her Honour was explaining the process by which the good character of the appellant did not displace the conclusion that, based on other evidence, he was guilty of the offences with which he had been charged.  This ground of appeal should be dismissed.  
Orders on the appeal against conviction
69For those reasons, there should be a grant of leave in respect of ground 1 and (to the extent necessary) ground 3.  Leave should be refused in respect of ground 2, and the appeal should be dismissed.
Crown Appeal 
70In support of the appeal the Crown brings under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) two grounds of appeal are relied upon.  The first, that her Honour erred by ordering the sentences on each of the four counts upon which the respondent was convicted to be served concurrently and, the second, that each of the sentences was each manifestly inadequate.  (When dealing with the Crown appeal, we refer to Mr Panchal as the respondent.)
71The first ground of appeal alleges error in the application of the principle of totality.  The Crown submitted that although an order for partial concurrency in respect of some counts of indecent assault would have been unassailable, in particular for the assaults charged as Counts 2 and 3 on the indictment, to order that they be served concurrently with each other, and with the aggravated sexual intercourse without consent charged as Count 1, failed to take into account the separate and distinct sexual offending for which the respondent was convicted. 
72The second ground of appeal invites this Court to conclude that the individual sentences imposed were unreasonable or unjust by reference to the sentences themselves without the need for the Court to identify any particular error in the process of reasoning that led to that result.  
73The respondent submitted that the first ground of appeal is really a particularisation of the challenge to the effective sentence as manifestly inadequate, in the sense that if this Court finds that the sentence imposed on Count 1 does not adequately reflect the totality of the respondent's offending, not only would the order for total concurrency have been made in error, but it would also follow that an effective sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years was erroneously lenient.  
74While that might be so, the limiting purpose associated with the bringing of a Crown appeal most recently identified by the High Court in Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 necessitates that the grounds of appeal are dealt with separately. 
The further facts found for sentencing purposes
75The sentencing judge was satisfied that the respondent was aware that the complainant was cognitively impaired.  She also found that he targeted her opportunistically with that knowledge in the expectation that she would not be able to convey to others what he intended to do to her, or in the event that she was able to do so, she would not be able to express herself sufficiently clearly that others could understand her.  Her Honour was also satisfied that once the complainant was under the respondent's control in the guard's room she was defenceless without any opportunity to seek help.
76Her Honour described the assaults as ""degrading, humiliating and unprovoked"" (which we take to mean wholly uninvited) and the respondent's conduct as ""despicable"".
77Her Honour found that the impact of the sexual and indecent assaults on the complainant was substantial.  She had become reclusive and withdrawn despite attending counselling to assist her to process what had happened to her.  More generally she suffered a significant mood change from a happy young woman who, with the courage of her independence, was able to attend a disability centre by train without a chaperone to a moody angry and increasingly aggressive young woman who blamed her family for failing to protect her.  At the time of sentence she had not undertaken any train travel.  She also exhibited behavioural traits reactive to the assaults including obsessive washing and a deterioration in her personal hygiene. 
78Her Honour noted the need for the sentences to reflect general deterrence in order that rail officers who have the obligation of protecting train travellers (which we interpret to include other transport officials who deal with the public) appreciate the trust reposed in them and that those who offend, as this respondent has offended, will face condign punishment.
79In dealing with the respondent's subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge noted he was 50 years of age at the time of the offences and 52 at the time of sentence.  He had no criminal record.  The respondent and his wife migrated to Australia in 2001 from India and he has family in both countries including a disabled sister who he assisted before migrating.  The respondent also has a friend with a disabled son who he would look after to allow the boy's parents to socialise when they were visitors in the respondent's family home.  Her Honour also noted that the respondent had provided support for an organisation established by his friend to support families with disabled children within the East Asian community in Australia.  He had also contributed to other charitable organisations and was a volunteer at community events. 
80As the respondent did not give evidence on sentence accepting responsibility for the assaults there was no finding of remorse or contrition.  Her Honour made no finding as to the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation. 
The first ground of appeal 
81It is well recognised that, subject to the application of established principle, questions of accumulation and concurrency are discretionary and that sentencing judges may exercise their discretion in differing ways without either being wrong:  LG v R [2012] NSWCCA 249 at [24].  It is equally as well recognised that whilst separate offences committed in the course of the one criminal episode may point to concurrent sentences being imposed, this will not be the inevitable sentencing result.  The critical question in every case is whether an order for concurrency is productive of a sentence that reflects or comprehends the totality of the criminality involved in a single episode of offending or a single course of criminal conduct.
82In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] Howie J said:  
""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""
83The question in any given case as to whether there ought to be an order for concurrency in whole or in part, calls for a discretionary judgment.  In JT v R [2012] NSWCCA 133 at [71] Rothman J said:  
""The exercise involved in determining accumulation and concurrence and the application of the principles of totality are inconsistent with the proposition that one single correct answer will be derived in every circumstance by every judge. The application of the principle of totality is an exercise of discretion, intuitive or instinctive, and cannot be conducted arithmetically...""
84The Crown accepted that this case involved a single episode of sexual offending, in the sense that it commenced when the complainant was lured into the guard's cabin and ended as the train drew into the complainant's station.  However, the Crown submitted that the offences involved sufficiently different levels of assaultive conduct, with the respondent persisting in his sexual mistreatment of the complainant despite her efforts to stop him, that partial accumulation of the separate sentences imposed referable to that conduct was necessary. 
85As the respondent emphasised in submissions, her Honour was acutely conscious of the differing nature of the offences but nonetheless reasoned to the conclusion that because the indecent assaults occurred at the same time, or almost the same time, as the objectively more serious sexual assault, an order for complete concurrency was appropriate.  This was said by counsel to be an entirely orthodox approach where multiple offences of a sexual nature are part of a continuous episode of sexual offending against one complainant.  R v Dousha [2008] NSWCCA 263 was relied upon to support that submission.  That case concerned an appeal against the severity of sentences imposed for multiple counts of indecent assault against two children and two counts of sexual intercourse against the same two children.  Concurrent sentences were imposed in respect of three of the four counts of indecent assault against one of the children which were partially accumulated on the fourth count of indecent assault, with that sentence in turn partially accumulated on a count of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years.  The sentences for three of the four indecent assaults were ordered to be served concurrently as they involved the same child and were committed on the same day in the one incident.  On the applicant's appeal against the severity of the effective sentence imposed, that finding was not under challenge.  At [50] Fullerton J observed that the concurrency in the sentences of the three counts of indecent assaults was explained by them being a continuation of the one episode of offending albeit involving touching that was progressively more invasive.  Nothing in that judgment is authority for the proposition that sexual offences of a different kind, or the same kind but committed in a different way as part of a continuum of conduct, should attract an order of complete concurrence on sentence.  
86Ultimately the question of accumulation and concurrency must be determined by reference to the principle of totality.  The question for this Court on this appeal is whether that principle has been breached amounting to appellable error in the sentencing exercise.87The respondent submitted that separate fixed terms of imprisonment of 3, 6 and 9 months on each of the three counts of indecent assault reflected the objective seriousness of that offending in the context of his offending overall.  It was then submitted that it was open to her Honour to be satisfied that the respondent, having been sentenced to full-time custody, should not to be required to undergo additional punishment, by partially accumulating the fixed terms on each other and with the sentence on the sexual assault count. 
88We do not regard that submission as to the point.  Having determined that a sentence of imprisonment was warranted for the offending the subject of each of Count  2, 3 and 4, because they were not isolated instances and, so far as the fourth count was concerned, because it was in her Honour's view ""a particularly distasteful way to behave towards the young woman, intellectually disabled or not"" (findings which were not challenged on the appeal there being no appeal against the severity of sentence), her Honour was only then obliged, in accordance with Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, to determine questions on concurrency and accumulation referable to the totality principle.  In applying that principle to this case the focus is not on the fact that sentences of imprisonment have been imposed but whether, having been imposed, an order for concurrency with each other and with the count of sexual assault adequately is productive of a sentence that comprehends the total of the respondent's criminality.  
89We accept that the conduct the subject of Counts 2 and 3, each involving touching of the complainant's breasts inside and outside her clothing within the same episode of touching of that region of her body and attracting fixed terms of imprisonment of respectively 3 and 6 months, could properly have attracted an order of concurrency.  However, the indecent assault which involved the respondent masturbating in the region of the complainant's groin with his left hand while forcing the complainant towards him in the process was an indecent assault of an entirely different order of objective seriousness.  We are satisfied the criminality inherent in that conduct, occurring as it did as the last assault in a series of assaults, could not adequately be accounted for by an order that it be served wholly concurrently with the sentences for Counts 2 and 3.  We consider that an order of partial accumulation ought to have been made.  Applying the same reasoning, we are also satisfied that the effective term of imprisonment for the three counts of indecent assault should also have been partially accumulated on the sentence for the count involving sexual intercourse without consent. 
The second ground of appeal
90The error in her Honour's application of the principle of totality will result in re-sentence subject only to the exercise of the residual discretion.  It is necessary, however, to consider the challenge to each of the sentences as manifestly inadequate since, if the Crown fails to make good that challenge, the re-sentencing exercise will be undertaken referable to the sentences that were imposed by the sentencing judge.
91The maximum penalty for each of the offences, respectively 20 years with the standard non-parole period of 10 years for the aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act and 7 years with a standard non-parole period of 5 years for each of the counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1), reflects the seriousness with which the legislature regards offending of this kind.  That the cognitive impairment of a complainant is a feature of sexual offending attracting a heavier maximum penalty and a standard non parole period is an expression of the legislature's legitimate concern that specific protection be afforded to the most vulnerable as well as providing heavy sentences for those who would prey upon them and to deter others from doing likewise.  
92The maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods for each of the four counts for which the respondent was convicted operate as a guide against which an appropriate sentence will be imposed in a sentencing exercise that involves the instinctive synthesis of a range of factors bearing upon both the objective seriousness of the particular offending and the subjective circumstances of the offender.   
93The Crown submitted that none of the sentences imposed after trial in this case adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the respondent's targeted offending against a vulnerable and defenceless young woman in breach of his position of trust as a train guard in public service, even if full weight had been given to his subjective circumstances, including his previous good character.  The Crown also submitted that although her Honour recognised the need for the sentences to satisfy the requirement of general deterrence, the sentences actually imposed, in particular the sentence for the aggravated sexual intercourse without consent comprised of a non-parole period of only 3 years, failed to meet that sentencing objective and that her Honour's sentencing discretion has also miscarried for that reason. 
94The respondent submitted that the Court would not be so satisfied.  Further, it was submitted that the Crown has failed to demonstrate that the sentences imposed, either collectively or individually, were so far below the range of sentences which, justly and consistently with sentencing standards, could be imposed for the offences of which he was convicted, that this Court's intervention is not warranted.  
95In support of the submission that a review of previous authorities of this Court demonstrates that the sentence imposed was not manifestly inadequate senior counsel for the respondent referred only to R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128. In that case the standard non-parole period did not apply and neither cognitive impairment nor physical disability was the feature of aggravation alleged.  It is of no utility for comparative purposes.
96It was not submitted by either counsel that the offending in this case could be meaningfully compared with the other offences committed in circumstances of aggravation, given that the features of aggravation provided for in s 61M(3) of which cognitive impairment is one, and the much larger category of aggravating circumstances in s 61J(3) of the Crimes Act differ so markedly from each other.  The Judicial Commission's sentencing statistics provided by the Crown in the course of the hearing do not provide any meaningful insight into the range of sentences that might be imposed for similar offending for this reason. 
97Senior counsel also advanced the submission that since the act of sexual intercourse the subject of Count 1 involved digital penetration it was for that reason ""vastly less serious"".  As authority for that proposition, Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 163 was cited where at [29] per RS Hulme J said:  
""I have no difficulty in accepting the proposition that there is no such rule. Nevertheless, confining attention for the moment to the nature of the penetration, there can be no doubt that the digital penetration as it occurred in this case was vastly less serious than many other instances of sexual penetration with which this Court has, from time to time, had to deal. The fact that the Applicant persisted despite the complainant saying his action hurt tends to add to the seriousness of his conduct in that respect but in any judgment as to the severity of that aspect of his conduct it is proper to recognise that the complainant sought solace from him later in the evening after she discovered her own father was absent, and this in circumstances where the Applicant's wife was also in the house.""
98His Honour's views on that issue are not coincident with other authority in this Court. 
99In Ingham v R [2014] NSWCCA 123 at [41] Fullerton J (Basten JA and R A Hulme J agreeing) in considering sentences imposed for multiple breaches of s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act said:  
""I accept that there is no hierarchy of seriousness for a breach of s 66A(1) with penile penetration at the apex.  Other means and mechanisms by which the offence can be committed may, in a particular case, be equally if not more objectively serious.  I also accept, as was most recently restated in Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [33]-[34] citing Doe v R [2013] NSWCCA 248 at [54] that there is no authority in this Court which supports the proposition that digital sexual intercourse is, of itself, less serious than other forms of forced sexual intercourse.  In Doe at [54] it was stated that:
'... Reference to the above authorities demonstrates that it has been emphasised, on more than one occasion, that the objective seriousness of offending is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question. Concentrating upon, or giving primary significance to, the form of the forced sexual intercourse in determining its objective seriousness reflects an erroneous approach. It is equally erroneous to attempt to rank forms of forced sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness.'""
Conclusion
100We are firmly of the view that the individual sentences imposed in this case are unreasonable and plainly unjust having regard to the gravity and sustained nature of the offending and that, subject only to the residual discretion, this Court should move to re-sentence. 
101Upholding the Crown appeal affords an opportunity for this Court to reinforce the significance of the standard non-parole period as a legislative guidepost where an aggravated form of a sexual offence under s 61J and indecent assault under s 61M is found proved, in particular where the victim is cognitively impaired as is the complainant in this case.
The residual discretion
102It was submitted that the residual discretion should be exercised in the respondent's favour because, unlike the sentencing judge, we would be satisfied that he has positive prospects of rehabilitation.  Even were we prepared to make that assessment based upon his prior good character and because he has not offended between his arrest and trial, this would not displace the need for re-sentence in this case.  The manifest inadequacy of the sentences requires this Court to intervene.
Re-sentence
103After taking into account all matters material to the exercise of this Court's sentencing discretion, including the modest weight that can be given to the respondent's subjective circumstances, and after exercising the restraint that attends the re-sentencing exercise in the context of a successful Crown appeal, the objective seriousness of the course of sexual offending against a vulnerable young woman who has suffered substantial harm as a consequence, requires that the respondent be resentenced on each count which, after a partial accumulation, results in an effective sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.
104We have preserved the sentencing judge's finding of special circumstances, on resentence, principally because of the partial accumulation of the sentences.
105The orders of the Court are as follows:  
The Crown appeal against sentence is upheld.
The sentences imposed in the District Court on 18 October 2013 are quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences are imposed:  
Count 2:  Fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 31 May 2013 and expiring 30 May 2014.
Count 3:  Fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months commencing on 31 May 2013 and expiring on 30 November 2013.
Count 4:  Fixed term of imprisonment for 16 months commencing on 31 July 2013 and expiring on 30 November 2014. 
Count 1:  Imprisonment for 7 years commencing on 31 May 2014, and expiring on 30 May 2021 comprising a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months expiring on 30 November 2018 and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. 
This results in an effective sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.

2704182,Shi v R [2014] NSWCCA 276,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA: I agree with Bellew J.

2FULLERTON J: I agree with Bellew J.

3BELLEW J: Si Shi (""the applicant"") pleaded guilty in the District Court to 10 offences contrary to s. 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (""the Code""). That section, which is considered more fully below, creates an offence of dealing with property which is reasonably suspected to be the proceeds of crime. It carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 3 years or 180 penalty units, or both. 

4The dates of the various offences, and the amounts with which the applicant dealt in each case, were as follows:

(i)26 September 2011 - $772,450.00 (Count 1);

(ii)between 5 October 2011 and 7 October 2011 - $1,951,570.00 (Count 2);

(iii)12 October 2011 - $532,950.00 (Count 3);

(iv)between 17 October 2011 and 21 October 2011 - $3,276,410.00 (Count 4);

(v)between 25 October 2011 and 28 October 2011 - $1,749,275.00 (Count 5);

(vi)between 31 October 2011 and 4 November 2011 - $5,134,865.00 (Count 6);

(vii)between 7 November 2011 and 11 November 2011 - $5,873,780.00 (Count 7);

(viii)between 14 November 2011 and 18 November 2011 - $6,907,125.00 (Count 8);

(ix)between 21 November 2011 and 25 November 2011 - $7,006, 245.00 (Count 9);

(x)between 28 November 2011 and 1 December 2011 - $2,660,505.00 (Count 10).

5The applicant also pleaded guilty to a charge contrary to s. 400.9(1A) of the Code which creates an offence which is essentially identical to that created by s. 400.9(1) but which is committed where the relevant amount is less than $100,000.00. The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 2 years or 120 penalty units, or both. In the present case, that offence was committed on 8 December 2011, and the amount of money involved was $88,615.00.

6The sentencing judge imposed the following sentences:

(i)in respect of each of counts 1, 2 and 3, imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months commencing on 12 December 2012 and expiring on 11 June 2014, such sentences to be served wholly concurrently; 

(ii)in respect of each of counts 4, 5 and 6, imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months to be served concurrently to commence at the expiration of the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1,2 and 3 (i.e. 12 June 2014), and to expire on 11 December 2015;

(iii)in respect of counts 7 and 8, imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months to be served concurrently and to commence at the expiration of the sentences imposed in respect of counts 4,5 and 6 (i.e. 12 December 2015), and to expire on 11 June 2017;

(iv)in respect of each of counts 9 and 10, imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months to be served concurrently to commence on 12 December 2016 and to expire on 11 June 2018;

(v)in respect of the offence against 400.9(1A) imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 12 December 2012 and expiring on 11 September 2013.

7The overall sentence imposed was one of 5 years and 6 months. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of 3 years. He also made an order pursuant to s. 48(2) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) for the forfeiture of a total of AUD$758,615.00. 

8The appellant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the grounds more fully set out below.

THE FACTS
9The sentencing judge found the following facts, which are not in dispute (commencing at ROS 1):
""The offences relate to so called black money which was being generated somehow illegally in Sydney or Australia and was being funnelled out of Sydney via the Westpac Bank and a currency transfer company called Super Forex. Those institutions have not been charged as being wrongly involved in this matter but plainly there was some conspiracy involving certain persons in which very large sums of money were being generated in Australia, probably ""black"" money in the sense of it being money upon which its possessor wished to pay no tax. It may have had some other criminal provenance but I do not know about that.

It was being warehoused so to speak, in premises occupied by Mr Liu and handed over physically to this offender Ms Si Shi, who had the role in this enterprise of receiving the large sums of cash from Liu and causing it to be put into a Super Forex account in the Westpac Bank at the Haymarket Sydney. Both of these people, Shi and Liu, are not sophisticated and are not, as it were, the kingpins or big wheels of this very substantial financial conspiracy. 

Each played a significant role without being told too much about it. Each had powerful reasons to suspect, at least, and in my view to realise, that the monies were unlawfully obtained and (in the case of Mr Liu) intended to be used in some illegality, even if merely to avoid the currency processes.

The background to Ms Shi is that she came to Australia with her husband in a relationship which broke down for reasons that are largely irrelevant here. She has a mother who was being cared for in China by another person who appears to be involved in this enterprise. This person, whom she described as an ""aunty"", appeared at first friendly to her and helpful and was very helpful to her mother in assisting that lady with medical treatments. It is plain this ""aunty"" person is a significant figure in this black money conspiracy. Ms Shi was asked or prevailed upon to perform the task of physically moving the money from one point to another and making deposits. The offender Shi was introduced to the principal of the Super Forex company by her husband, Mr Xi Qui Li in around May 2010.

The Super Forex people became concerned about the offender making large cash deposits at the Super Forex city branch and Mr Yang, the principal of Super Forex, told her the money should be more sensibly deposited into Super Forex's Westpac account. He liaised with her, advised her of the relevant exchange rate for the next day and got her instructions to send the money out of Australia. She told him she had a relative doing foreign exchange in Hong Kong and the relative has helped her mother. She said: ""So I am helping them now. The money is from Hong Kong persons in Australia who need to get the money to Hong Kong.""

The principal at Super Forex told her she was required to get identities and to be able to ascertain where the money was from, and that represented the Australian law. She told him:

""Don't worry, it is all from a legal business. I'm just helping a relative in Hong Kong.""

The Super Forex company was no doubt attracted by the notion large sums of money that were passing through its hands and it was receiving commissions, but nonetheless it was also obviously troubled about the arrangements. Ms Shi became known to the staff at the Haymarket Westpac Bank as a person who deposited large sums of cash. She told different stories to the bank, sometimes that she was just dropping the cash off on behalf of Super Forex customers and on another occasion she told the manager she was an employee of Super Forex, and she led the Westpac staff to believe that.

In late November the manager of the branch quite reasonably became increasingly concerned about the size of the cash deposits being made by the offender. He interrogated her about her connection with Super Forex and she gave some fairly unsatisfactory answers. Mr Yang of Super Forex was contacted and he told her Ms Shi worked for his company as a marketing manager. In late November 2011 the managers of several of the Haymarket branches of Westpac met to discuss the problem of these deposits being made. Shi entered at that time and the bank managers discussed with her the dangers of moving such large sums of cash around, and suggested alternative arrangements, for example, the use of Armaguard. She became quite upset during the meeting and at one stage began to cry. She was interrogated about her relationship to Super Forex and on that occasion she said she was not an employee of Super Forex but a customer.

On the following Tuesday Percy Yang of Super Forex attended the 591 George Street Branch and informed the manager that Ms Shi would not come back to the branch as she had organised Chubb to collect the money from her customers. Examination of information downloaded from the offender's mobile phone shows text messages between Yang and the offender and the offender and various numbers in Hong Kong about the money being deposited. On all but two occasions the subject of a charge, Yang sent a text in English to the offender confirming the deposits received by Super Forex. These amounts correspond to the deposits shown on the Westpac Bank statement for Super Forex and there is no doubt the documents show the monies deposited were properly transmitted to Hong Kong to several accounts which are identified in exhibit SA.

From the evidence overall, it seems that the man Liu would meet with her for the purpose of handing over a bag of cash which he had previously been given by somebody else. He met her initially in Chinatown in a Honda car. Liu got into the car with a bag of money, she showed him a passport and he handed her the bag. Thereafter, usually near the Ultimo Library, he met her in the Chinatown area, usually in his car. Except for the first meeting in Chinatown, he handed the offender the bag containing cash and watched her count the money before they parted. He says that sometimes after she had finished counting the cash she made a phone call and was collected by a Chinese man with a scar on his face.

On 1 December 2011 the offender attended the Haymarket branch of Westpac Bank with a suitcase containing $670,000 in cash. She left it there to be counted but they told her they did not have sufficient staff. They obviously delayed. She insisted Hong Kong needed the transfer but the AFP at that stage was involved and that deposit was never made.

The total amount of monies involved in this exercise is very substantial, over thirty-five million Australian dollars. In exhibit SA there is set out a list of the particular deposits that were made: on 26 September 2011 a total of $772,000 plus (that is the offence which is sequence 1). Sequence 2 is a number of amounts, 262,000 plus, 766,000 plus, 922,000 plus and so on.

Sequence 4 involves something over two million dollars. Sequence 5, again almost two million. Sequence 6, the following amounts - 31 October 2011 1.2 million plus, together with 1.5 million plus, together with one million plus, together with 1.2 million plus and so on until the end of November when the balloon went up, so to speak. These are very substantial sums of money.

Leaving aside questions of the state of mind of the offender, her knowledge and her role, objectively, the unlawful movement of such sums of money is calculated to cause very serious economic and commercial damage to the Australian economy and to the interests of the Australian people.

Ms Shi gave evidence before me and explained her background, her life in China and her unfortunate marital problems. She wanted to save face and to repay obligations relating to her mother and the person called ""aunty"". She gave evidence that from time to time there would be telephone calls between her and the person aunty, obviously a principal, who complained there was short payment from time to time. She said she felt threatened by aunty and particularly she felt concerned her mother might be hurt or injured by the interests associated with the money.

Mr Liu gave evidence. He denied stealing any money himself but I do accept, since he was found in a house stuffed in a haphazard way full of bags of money and since he had a drug addiction and was a gambler, it is highly likely that he was living off some of the money, to the extent he thought he could get away with it. This may have provoked anger from the principals.

As to what the offender Ms Shi may have been getting out of it, it is very hard to say. She denies any gain or reward in any significant way, apart from the fact of being assisted in the care of her mother in China. I do accept she is a person who is at a low level in this enterprise, even though that level is an important level. I do not regard her as being a kingpin. It was argued on her behalf and I accept, she was a face pushed forward by those who are principals in this to perform a function where she would be identifying herself to the bank and identifying herself to Super Forex without disguise. If there was any trouble, she would be the ""bunny"" who would get caught. She was undoubtedly used by others involved. She had connections with those higher up the chain and those connections have not been explored in detail in these proceedings.""

THE APPLICANT'S ROLE
10In terms of the applicant's role in the enterprise, his Honour made the following finding (at ROS 8): 

""The offender played a significant role in the overall conspiracy. Although she was used as a dispensable tool and her role was low level, what she did was important. Her task of liaison and depositing of the money was a vital ingredient of the overall enterprise. The overall sum is thirty-five million dollars plus. That alone is not a reflection of her criminality but it is something that I take into account. I have no doubt she was deliberately chosen by higher ups in China, Australia and in particular by the woman who befriended her mother and assisted that lady with medical bills"".

THE APPLICANT'S SUBJECTIVE CASE
11A report of Dr Katie Seidler, Clinical and Forensic Psychologist, was before the sentencing judge. The report noted that the applicant was born and raised in Guangzhou in Southern China. She was an only child and her parents separated when she was 12, after which she remained in the care of her mother. The applicant was educated to high school level and was employed in various capacities in China. She came to Australia in September 2009 to live with her husband who had earlier entered on a student visa. That marriage has since broken down. 

12At paragraph (48) of her report Dr Seidler said:

""...Ms Shi appears to be a vulnerable, unsophisticated and naïve young woman, who has poor self-esteem and prioritises others over herself. She has a strong sense of duty and is inherently prosocial. To this end, the present offences appear to be an aberration that occurred as a result of perceived obligation to a family friend who had assisted both her mother and aunt, in addition to the effect of naivety, social isolation and vulnerability"".

13The sentencing judge made reference to Ms Seidler's report (commencing at ROS 6) and concluded that the applicant was under ""tremendous pressure"" because of the charges. His Honour further noted (at ROS 7) that character references tendered on sentence indicated that the applicant's offending was out of character. He expressly accepted the observations of the author of one of those references who stated that the applicant had demonstrated ""a deep and profound regret that she became involved.""

14I have dealt in more detail with other aspects of his Honour's findings when considering the individual grounds of appeal.

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred by finding, and taking into account as an aggravating feature of the offences, that the applicant was aware that the money the subject of the offences was ""unlawfully obtained"" and/or criminally sourced.
The applicant's evidence 
15The applicant gave evidence on sentence. The sole reference in that evidence to her knowledge of the source of the money is to be found in the following passage (at T18 L42 - T19 L1):

Q All right, apart from Ms Jun and Mr Liu, her husband, did you have any knowledge of where the money originated from?
A INTERPRETER: I really had no idea.

Q When you gave evidence to his Honour about the involvement in transactions that are not charged and you became uncomfortable with the money what did you suspect about the money?
A INTERPRETER: I mean, Sister Ing told me, she said the money belonged to June's friends, all about very wealthy people, they either had company or factories here in Australia so I didn't doubt, I didn't try to guess the source.

16The Crown did not challenge this evidence. In particular, the Crown did not put to the applicant that she knew that the money was the proceeds of crime. 

17At the conclusion of the evidence, and consistent with what the applicant had said, counsel then appearing for her made the following submission (at T48 L28-32):

""She suspected the money was tainted but nonetheless she carried out the instructions that she was given and those instructions that were given were initially culturally based, if I could put it that way...""

18The Crown did not make any submission to the contrary regarding the applicant's suspicion. In particular, the Crown did not submit that his Honour should find that the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime. 

The findings of the sentencing judge
19At ROS 2, the sentencing judge said the following:

""Both of these people, Shi and Liu, are not sophisticated and are not, as it were, the kingpins or big wheels of this very substantial financial conspiracy. Each played a significant role without being told too much about it. Each had powerful reasons to suspect at least, and in my view to realise, that the monies were unlawfully obtained and (in the case of Mr Liu) intended to be used in some illegality, even if merely to avoid the currency processes"" (my emphasis).

20His Honour then said (at ROS 5):

""Leaving aside questions of the state of mind of the offender, her knowledge and her role, objectively, the unlawful movement of such sums of money is calculated to cause very serious economic and commercial damage to the Australian economy and to the interests of the Australian people"" (my emphasis).

21Finally (at ROS 8 - 9) his Honour said:

""The offences are serious, albeit charged as reasonable suspicion rather than as based on a more blameworthy mental state. The statute in question is structured so as to permit different levels of punishment for different levels of mens rea, if I can use that term, meaning moral culpability. I have no doubt she was aware the money was criminally sourced and that it was contrary to the law of Australia for her to do what she did"" (my emphasis).

Submissions of the applicant
22Having regard to the relevant legislative scheme (which is discussed further below) it was submitted that if the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime (as his Honour found was the case) she would be guilty of a far more serious offence than that with which she had been charged, and which required only that there be a reasonable suspicion that the money was the proceeds of crime. Counsel submitted that in these circumstances, the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge that the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime was in breach of the principle in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

23Counsel also submitted that it was apparent, from the multiplicity of references to the issue, that the sentencing judge treated, as an aggravating factor, what he found to have been the applicant's knowledge, and that this played a significant role on sentence. 

24Finally, counsel submitted that in any event, the conclusion that the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime was not supported by the evidence. 

Submissions of the Crown
25The Crown emphasised that the sentencing judge had not, at any stage, expressed the view that a state of mind higher than suspicion was required in order to commit the offence, nor had he specifically stated that he regarded what he found to have been the applicant's state of mind as an aggravating factor. The Crown submitted that when his Honour's reasons were read as a whole, they reflected a proper appreciation of the provisions of s. 400.9(1).

Consideration
General provisions of the Code
26Section 3.1 of the Code deals with elements of offences and is in the following terms:

3.1 Elements
(1) An offence consists of physical elements and fault elements. 

(2) However, the law that creates the offence may provide that there is no fault element for one or more physical elements. 

(3) The law that creates the offence may provide different fault elements for different physical elements.

27Section 4.1 prescribes the various physical elements in the following terms:

4.1 Physical elements 
(1) A physical element of an offence may be: 

(a) conduct; or 
(b) a result of conduct; or 
(c) a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs. 

(2) ....

28Division 5 of the Code (ss. 5.1 to 5.6) makes provision for the fault elements of:

(i)intention;
(ii)knowledge;
(iii)recklessness; and 
(iv)negligence.

The regime of money laundering offences created by the Code
29Part 10.2 (Division 400) of the Code, and in particular ss. 400.3 to 400.8, create a regime of offences of dealing in the proceeds of crime, such offences being generically described as ""money laundering"". Section 400.3 is in the following terms:

400.3 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc.--money or property worth $1,000,000 or more 
(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
(b) either: 
(i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or 
(ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years, or 1500 penalty units, or both. 

(2) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
(b) either: 
(i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
(ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
(c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
(d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 years, or 720 penalty units, or both. 

(3) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
(b) either: 

(i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
(ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 

(c) the person is negligent as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
(d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years, or 300 penalty units, or both. 

(4) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(c), (2)(d) and (3)(d). 

Note 1: Section 400.10 provides for a defence of mistake of fact in relation to these paragraphs. 

Note 2: Section 400.2A affects the application of this section so far as it relates to a person dealing with money or other property that: 
(a) is intended by the person to become an instrument of crime; or 
(b) is at risk of becoming an instrument of crime. 

30Sections 400.4 to 400.8 are in essentially the same terms as s. 400.3 but apply (in descending order) to different values of money or property. In keeping with that circumstance, the maximum penalties for offences contrary to ss. 400.4 to 400.8 are less than that prescribed for 400.3. 

31Each of ss. 400.3 to 400.8 creates 3 separate offences. In terms of the severity of each of the 3 offences created in each case, the provisions are ""cascading"" in nature according to the amount of money involved as well as the state of mind of the offender. 

32Subsection (1) of each of ss. 400.3 to 400.8 creates an offence of dealing with money or other property in particular circumstances. The physical element of that offence in each case is conduct. That conduct (i.e. the dealing) constitutes an offence where the value of the money or property exceeds the nominated amount, and where: 

(i)the money or other property is the proceeds of crime and the offender believes that to be the case (the applicable fault element being that of knowledge), or:

(ii)the offender intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime (the applicable fault element being that of intention). 

The offence with which the applicant was charged
33Section 400.9, under which the applicant was charged, creates an entirely separate offence of dealing with property which is reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime:

400.9 Dealing with property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime etc. 
(1) A person commits an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
(b) it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and 
(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 3 years, or 180 penalty units, or both. 
(1A) A person commits an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
(b) it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and 
(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is less than $100,000. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years, or 120 penalty units, or both. 
(2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(b) or (1A)(b), that paragraph is taken to be satisfied if: 
(a) the conduct referred to in paragraph (1)(a) involves a number of transactions that are structured or arranged to avoid the reporting requirements of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 that would otherwise apply to the transactions; or 
(aa) the conduct involves a number of transactions that are structured or arranged to avoid the reporting requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 that would otherwise apply to the transactions; or 
(b) the conduct involves using one or more accounts held with ADIs in false names; or 
(ba) the conduct amounts to an offence against section 139, 140 or 141 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 ; or 
(c) the value of the money and property involved in the conduct is, in the opinion of the trier of fact, grossly out of proportion to the defendant's income and expenditure over a reasonable period within which the conduct occurs; or 
(d) the conduct involves a significant cash transaction within the meaning of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 , and the defendant: 
(i) has contravened his or her obligations under that Act relating to reporting the transaction; or 
(ii) has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or 
(da) the conduct involves a threshold transaction (within the meaning of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 ) and the defendant: 
(i) has contravened the defendant's obligations under that Act relating to reporting the transaction; or 
(ii) has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or 
(e) the defendant: 
(i) has stated that the conduct was engaged in on behalf of or at the request of another person; and 
(ii) has not provided information enabling the other person to be identified and located. 

(4) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) and (1A)(b) and (c). 

(5) This section does not apply if the defendant proves that he or she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the money or property was derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from some form of unlawful activity.

34An offence contrary to s. 400.9 requires proof of three elements, namely that: 

(i)the offender deals with money or other property;
(ii)it is reasonable to suspect that the money or other property is the proceeds of crime; and
(iii)at the time of the dealing, the money and other property is $100,000.00 or more.

35As to each of these elements:

(i)the first, namely that of dealing, is a physical element, namely conduct (s. 4.1(1)(a));
(ii)the second and third are each physical elements, namely circumstances in which the relevant conduct occurs (s. 4.1(1((c)). 

36Section 400.9 does not specify fault elements for any of the three physical elements. In these circumstances, s. 5.6 provides as follows:

5.6 Offences that do not specify fault elements
(1) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element.

(2) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists of a circumstance or a result, recklessness is the fault element for that physical element. 

37The result of the application of s. 5.6 to the offence created by s. 400.9 is that: 

(i)intention is the fault element for the physical element of conduct, namely the dealing in s. 400.9(1)(a);
(ii)recklessness is the fault element for each of the two circumstances in ss. 400.9(1)(b) and (c). 

38As to intention, s. 5.2(1) provides:

5.2 Intention
(1) A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.
(2) ...
(3) ...

39As to recklessness, s. 5.4(1) provides:

5.4 Recklessness
(1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if:
(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and
(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.
(2) ...
(3) ...
(4) ...


40Division 6 deals with cases in which fault elements are not required. Section 6.2 makes provision for absolute liability in the following terms:

Absolute liability 
(1)... 
(2) If a law that creates an offence provides that absolute liability applies to a particular physical element of the offence: 

(a) there are no fault elements for that physical element; and 
(b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 is unavailable in relation to that physical element. 

(3) The existence of absolute liability does not make any other defence unavailable. 

41Because of the combined operation of s. 6.2(2)(a) and s. 400.9(4), absolute liability applies to:

(i)the requirement imposed by s. 400.9(1)(b), namely that there be a reasonable suspicion that the money and other property is the proceeds of crime; and
(ii)the requirement imposed by s. 400.9(1)(c), namely that at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000.00 or more.

42As a result, and unlike an offence contrary to s. 400.3(1), an offence contrary to s. 400.9(1) does not require proof of any knowledge or belief as to the money or other property being the proceeds of crime. 

Conclusion 
43The sentencing judge effectively found that the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime. As set out above, ss. 400.3 to 400.8 of the Code create offences of (inter alia) intentionally dealing in the proceeds of crime of a specified value, in circumstances where either:

(i)the money or property is the proceeds of crime and the offender believes that to be the case; or
(ii)the offender intends that the money or other property will become an instrument of crime

44Section 400.9(1) creates a completely different offence. It requires proof that the offender has dealt with money or other property of a value of more than $100,000.00 where it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is the proceeds of crime. As I have noted, absolute liability applies to the element of reasonable suspicion.

45The structure of Division 400 of the Code is such that the offence created by s. 400.9(1) falls at the lowest of the scale. The offence does not require proof of any subjective criminality at all. Although the sentencing judge acknowledged that the charge required proof of a reasonable suspicion, he found that the applicant had a far more blameworthy state of mind, namely that she knew that the money was the proceeds of crime. The effect of doing so was to find that the applicant had exhibited subjective criminality which was not an element of the offence with which she was charged. Moreover, when his Honour's sentencing remarks are read as a whole, it becomes apparent that he regarded the applicant's knowledge as a factor which aggravated her offending. 

46If the applicant in fact knew or believed that the money was the proceeds of crime, then in light of the amount involved she would have been liable to prosecution for an offence contrary to s. 400.3(1) of the Code. That is a substantially more serious offence than that created by s. 400.9 and carries a commensurately greater maximum penalty. Section 400.9(1) does not require a belief on the part of an offender that the money is the proceeds of crime. It requires only that there be a reasonable suspicion (to which absolute liability applies) that this is the case. 

47In R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383 Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Murphy JJ agreed) observed (at 389) that the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take into account all of the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, namely that no person should be punished for an offence of which he or she has not been convicted. Although such observations were made in the context of the provisions of the Criminal Code (WA) which required that circumstances of aggravation be pleaded, the stated principle is one of general application. 

48In my view, in the circumstances of the present case, the conclusions of the sentencing judge that the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime amounted to a breach of that principle. The commission of more serious offences within Division 400 required proof of the state of mind which his Honour found the applicant to have had. The commission of an offence contrary to s. 400.9(1) did not. The result of his Honour's conclusions was to punish the applicant for a far more serious offence than that with which she was charged. The multiplicity of references to the applicant's state of mind make it clear that his Honour regarded it as an aggravating factor on sentence. 

49Further, his Honour did not precisely identify the evidence which led him to conclude that the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime. His Honour's findings that the applicant was unsophisticated, and had performed her role ""without being told too much about it"", ran contrary to his conclusion as to her level of knowledge. Although his Honour found that the applicant had ""powerful reasons to suspect ... and ... to realise that the monies were unlawfully obtained"" those reasons were not precisely identified. The evidence given by the applicant as to her state of knowledge (to which his Honour did not refer) was also directly contrary to the conclusion his Honour reached. In these circumstances there is considerable force in the submission of counsel for the applicant that such conclusion was largely unsupported by the evidence. 

50Finally, and as I have noted, the applicant's evidence as to her knowledge of the source of the money was not the subject of cross-examination. Counsel then appearing for her made a submission consistent with both that evidence, and the requirement imposed by s. 400.9(1)(b). The Crown did not argue to the contrary. Nothing said by his Honour in the course of the sentence proceedings gave any indication that he did not accept that submission, much less that he was contemplating reaching a conclusion that the applicant knew that the money was the proceeds of crime. The applicant was not provided with any opportunity to address the issue. A combination of these various circumstances had the tendency to create an element of unfairness towards the applicant.

51For all of these reasons, this ground is made out. 

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the seriousness of each individual offence
The findings of the sentencing judge
52His Honour found (at ROS 7) that in all of the circumstances nothing other than a sentence of full time custody of a substantial kind would serve to satisfy relevant sentencing objectives. He then observed (at ROS 8):

""As I said before, the Courts recognise, as parliament has done, that the shifting of black money in this fashion poses very grave dangers for commerce and government in Australia. It is important that sentences of imprisonment be imposed so people who may be tempted to engage in such behaviour may be deterred. I take into account her alienation geographically from her mother and the fact imprisonment will be particularly onerous for the reasons that she is perhaps inadequate in English and she will not be able to receive visits from those from her homeland.""

53The sentencing judge also found (at ROS 8) that the role played by the applicant was significant. In particular he said:

""Although she was used as a dispensable tool and her role was low level, what she did was important. Her task of liaison and depositing of the money was a vital ingredient of the overall enterprise. The overall sum is thirty-five million dollars plus. That alone is not a reflection of her criminality but it is something that I take into account. I have no doubt she was deliberately chosen by higher ups in China, Australia and in particular by the woman who befriended her mother and assisted that lady with medical bills.""

Submissions of the applicant
54Counsel for the applicant relied upon two principal matters in support of this ground. 

55Firstly, counsel submitted that at no point in his reasons did the sentencing judge make express reference to the maximum penalties applicable to the offences. This, it was submitted, supported a conclusion that the sentencing judge failed to properly consider the individual offending.

56Secondly, counsel relied upon the fact that the same sentence was imposed for each of counts 1 to 10. It was submitted that the only relevant differences between the conduct and circumstances involved in each count were the amount of money and the number of transactions. Whilst acknowledging that the amount of money was an obviously significant factor, counsel submitted that there was no logical or principled basis for imposing exactly the same sentence in respect of each count. Counsel cited, as an example, the fact that count 3 involved a single transaction of just over half a million dollars, whilst count 9 involved 5 transactions totalling more than 7 million dollars. It was submitted that in these circumstances the sentencing judge had erred by making a ""blanket assessment"", rather than making an assessment of the individual criminality of the offences. 

57It was submitted that the combination of these factors gave rise to error. It was further submitted that such errors must necessarily have had a ""flow on"" effect upon the sentencing judge's assessment of the degree to which the sentences should be accumulated.

Submissions of the Crown
58The Crown submitted that his Honour was necessarily aware of the applicable maximum penalties. The Crown pointed, in particular, to the fact that his Honour had the benefit of written submissions from the Crown setting out the relevant provisions. It was also submitted that his Honour's reference (at ROS 8) to the structure of the offences for money laundering reflected an appreciation of the fact that the Parliament had provided for different levels of punishment and therefore different maximum penalties. The Crown submitted that in all of these circumstances, any assertion that the sentencing judge was not aware of the maximum penalties lacked any proper foundation.

59In terms of the complaint made by the applicant concerning the general approach of the sentencing judge, the Crown submitted that a similar complaint was rejected by this Court in R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131; (2013) 230 A Crim R 99. It was submitted that the reasoning in Glynatsis applied with greater force to the present case, and that no error arose as a consequence of the manner in which the sentences were structured. 

Consideration
60His Honour did not make any reference to the maximum penalties for the offences in his remarks on sentence. However, the written submissions which were provided by the Crown to his Honour set out, on the very first page, the relevant statutory provisions, including the applicable maximum penalties. At ROS 1 the sentencing judge made reference to those provisions (albeit without specific reference to the maximum penalties). At ROS 8 he made reference to the scheme of offences created by those provisions. I am satisfied in these circumstances that his Honour was aware of the applicable maximum penalties, notwithstanding the fact that he did not expressly refer to them.

61Further in my view, the applicant's complaint regarding the manner in which his Honour structured the sentences is not made out. In Glynatsis (which was a case of insider trading offences) it was argued that the approach of the sentencing judge in imposing identical sentences in respect of two counts was unsatisfactory because:

(i)the amount of the investment in respect of one count was 9 times the amount of investment in the other; and

(ii)the amount of gross profit yielded as a consequence of one count was 49 times that yielded in the other.

62In dealing with this argument Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Rothman and McCallum JJ agreed) said (at [63]:

""[63] The Crown's criticism of the sentencing judge's approach on this basis is misconceived. It involves an application of mathematical precision to what is a discretionary decision based on an intuitive synthesis of all the relevant factors to which his Honour referred. It is contrary to remarks in Pearce on which the Crown relied at [59] hereof. Given the similarity in the steps taken by the respondent in relation to each offence, it was well open to the sentencing judge to structure the sentences as he did.

[64] The Crown submitted that it was difficult to discern the basis upon which is Honour determined which sentences were to be concurrent and which were to be cumulative. Once again this was a discretionary exercise on the part of his Honour which was open to him because of the similar nature of the offending"" (emphasis in original).

63The observations in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 to which Hoeben CJ at CL referred were in the following terms (at [46]-[48]):

""[46] Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process.

[47] Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation. 

[48] Further, the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences"".

64In the present case the offending was almost identical in each case. The principal (and arguably only) differentiating factor was the amount of money referable to each individual count. His Honour took into account all relevant factors. Whilst there was an obvious need to assess the criminality involved in the offending, the decision in Glynatsis makes it clear that where the offending is essentially the same in respect of each count, it is open to a sentencing judge to approach the matter as the sentencing judge did in this case. 

65The applicant relied, in support of this ground, on the decision in R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199. That case involved a Crown appeal against sentences imposed for multiple counts of buggery and homosexual intercourse with a male. Grove AJ (with whom Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreed) emphasised (at [17]) the need for a sentencing judge to assess criminality for individual sentences. His Honour also observed (at [21]) that the remarks of the sentencing judge in that case made it difficult to determine how the criminality in respect of some counts was assessed as being identical to the criminality in others. Such difficulty had arisen, in part, as a consequence of the sentencing judge remarking that the offending in one particular count was of ""real gravity"", and in doing so inferring that the offending in other counts was of less seriousness. 

66In my view, the decision in Brown does not assist the applicant's position. It is limited to its own facts. In particular, in the present case the nature of the offending (leaving aside the differing amounts of money) did not vary between counts. The difficulties observed by Grove AJ in Brown (at [21]) simply do not arise. 

67For these reasons, ground 2 is not made out.

Ground 3 - The sentences, and in particular the overall effective sentence, infringe the principles of parity and/or proportionality when compared with the sentence imposed upon the co-offender Xuxiong Liu.
The sentence imposed upon Xuxiong Liu
68Xuxiong Liu (""Liu"") appeared for sentence before the sentencing judge at the same time as the applicant, having pleaded guilty to a charge contrary to s. 400.3(1) of the Code. The value of the property applicable to that offending was more than $5.8 million in cash. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 25 years or 1500 penalty units. In sentencing Liu, his Honour took into account (in accordance with s. 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)) an offence of possessing a controlled drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s. 308.1 of the Code, the prescribed maximum penalty for which was 2 years imprisonment or 400 penalty units.

69Liu was sentenced to a term of 5½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, both to date from 12 December 2012. This was the same sentence as the overall effective sentence imposed on the applicant. 

The findings of the sentencing judge
70When the matters were before the sentencing judge, counsel then appearing for the applicant said (at T45 L5 and following):

""Can I say your Honour that as far as these proceedings are concerned, whilst they are joint proceedings it is obvious that they are joint only by virtue of convenience as opposed to any issue of parity because immediately your Honour would recognise that the allegation that has been pleaded to by Mr Liu is significantly different in makeup and in penalty to that of my client and indeed I understand that there are, I think there are four matters if I could refer to them in NSW terms, the 16A matters for which we, as Ms Shi's representatives do not have. 

So the issue of parity can't loom large in these proceedings with respect but as a matter of, if I can say with respect your Honour, common sense, their respective roles in what appears to be a larger and wider standing criminal activity is important to hear together.""

71In respect of Liu's offending and his level of criminality, his Honour found (at ROS 10):

""In the case of Mr Liu there is one offence rather than a multiplicity of them. This is a case where the irrelevance in overall criminality of the number of separate offences charged is made clear. In this case, Mr Liu's role was brought to the attention of police by Ms Shi and I have made reference to that in remarking upon her willingness to assist. Police went to his house at Croydon Park and executed a search warrant. Exhibit SA sets out the extraordinary find that they made there, for example, five bundles of $50 notes
in a black grey backpack under the bed totalling $50,000; various bundles of currency in a brown box found under the bed totalling $10,000 plus; a black sports bag backpack containing sixty-nine bundles of Australian currency totalling $689,700; in the master bedroom again, for example, fifty bundles of Australian money in a blue cooler bag in the corner of a wardrobe totaling $499,950; another series of bundles of $499,000 plus a figure plainly
calculated to be less than $500,000; sixty-nine bundles of Australian currency in a white box on the floor of the ensuite bathroom totalling $689,050 and so on.

The money totalled on recount $5,829,130. Plainly, it was not derived from his income because his income tax return for various years showed roughly $20,000 in each case.""

72In terms of Liu's subjective case, the sentencing judge took into account the contents of a report of Olav Nielssen, Psychiatrist. His Honour found that it was ""plain"" that Liu had been a drug user and that whilst he did not appear to be mentally ill, he had acknowledged a history of substance abuse. His Honour also noted (at ROS 11) that there was no dispute that Liu had no prior criminal convictions, although he said (at ROS 11):

""...although his addiction to methamphetamine and his gambling makes it pretty clear that he was chosen by higher ups in this criminal conspiracy as a vulnerable person who could be used as a ""storeman"" (so to speak) while the money was moved
from point A to point B. He went voluntarily to police headquarters and when he spoke to police he conceded that the money was dubious. He said, ""I think it should be tax evasion or something else."" He denied that the money was from his own criminal activities. ""The money is not mine when the time is up I
will give it to someone who they told me to give to who they tell me to give to, I don't know.""

73His Honour found (at ROS 12) that Liu's role was to ""move"" the money and that he was ""plainly...not a kingpin"" (at ROS 12). He also found that Liu was a ""fairly disorganised character"" and described his arrangement of keeping money in his house as one that was ""on any view deeply stupid"" (at ROS 12).

74Importantly in terms of this ground, his Honour said the following (commencing at ROS 13):

""In terms of parity, both of these offenders have made some efforts to point the finger at the other one. As I said at the beginning of my remarks on sentence, it is not necessarily the case that criminality is measured in the number of charges much less in the quantity of money involved, nonetheless the amount of money being held at this man's house over $5 million is very substantial. The nature of the charge is different from that utilised against Ms Shi. For Liu it is a single charge of dealing with money to a certain value intending that the money would become an instrument of crime. There was a plea of guilty to that which acknowledges the criminality involved. I should add that in all stages of the proceedings where I have been involved both offenders have been represented by competent interpreters who have been able to assist them.

The role of Mr Liu was as a low level but important holder of very substantial quantities of money which no doubt were obtained as a result of tax evasion or some other criminal activity. His personal circumstances are, of course, different from those of Ms Shi and I accept that he was not au fait with the enterprise overall. Nonetheless, allowing a discount of twenty-five per cent for contrition and the plea of guilty and willingness to assist in the administration of justice, in my view the sentence I should impose on this man is the same as the sentence I impose on Ms Shi.""

Submissions of the applicant
75Counsel for the applicant submitted that although the applicant and Liu were charged with offences arising out of the same criminal enterprise, the offences themselves were quite different and were based on different facts. He submitted that whilst this created some practical difficulties, principles of parity nevertheless had application: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [30].

76Counsel pointed out that the subjective cases of the applicant on the one hand and Liu on the other were broadly similar, at least to the extent that each of them had no criminal history and had both pleaded guilty in the Local Court. However, he submitted that the relevant similarities ended at that point, following which there was a significant divergence which supported the conclusion that the sentences imposed upon the applicant infringed parity principles. In this respect, counsel for the applicant pointed, in particular, to:

(i)the respective ages of Liu and the applicant, and in particular the fact that Liu was almost 20 years older;

(ii)the fact that the offences charged against the applicant carried a maximum penalty of no more than 3 years imprisonment, whilst that charged against Liu carried a maximum penalty of 25 years;

(iii)the fact the Liu was aware that the money was proceeds of crime and intended it to be used as an instrument of crime; and

(iv)the fact that the assistance rendered by the applicant to the authorities had been assessed at a higher level than that of Liu.

77It was further submitted that the significantly higher degree of moral culpability which was involved in the commission of an offence against s. 400.3(1) called for the imposition of a significantly longer sentence. 

Submissions of the Crown 
78Counsel for the Crown submitted that on the applicant's own case, parity was not a relevant factor on sentence. It was submitted that even if parity principles did apply when the offending was different, the sentencing judge was entitled to form the view that the conduct relating to the multiple lesser offences committed by the applicant involved substantially the same overall criminality, and thus warranted the same outcome, as the conduct relating to the single, more serious offence committed by Liu. It was submitted that no error in the assessment had been demonstrated.

Consideration
79The approach taken by counsel for the applicant on sentence as to parity (set out in [70] above) was obviously a considered one. Generally speaking, a party will be bound by counsel's conduct of proceedings at first instance (see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [79]-[80] per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing). In any event, even if it is accepted that parity principles applied, his Honour's remarks on sentence do not disclose error in this respect. 

80In Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said (at [28] and following):

""'Equal justice' embodies the norm expressed in the term 'equality before the law'. It is an aspect of the rule of law. ... It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. ... Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is 'a reflection of the notion of equal justice' and 'is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice'. It finds expression in the 'parity principle' which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of 'equal justice', which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances"". 

81In the course of these observations their Honours made reference to the decision in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 where Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ had observed (at [65]):

""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect"" (emphasis in original).""

82His Honour considered all of the relevant factors in each case. He recognised that there were some factors which were relevant in one case but not in the other. In the exercise of his sentencing discretion, and having taken into account all such factors, he concluded that identical sentences were appropriate. But for the assessment of the applicant's assistance (which is the subject of ground 4) the approach of the sentencing judge was consistent with the principles set out in Green and no error is disclosed.

83It follows that this ground is not made out. 

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account, properly or at all, the degree to which the applicant had co-operated with Law Enforcement Agencies in the investigation of her offences, in particular, the offence of the co-offender Xuxiong Liu prior to sentencing.
The evidence before the sentencing judge
84A letter from the Australian Federal Police (Exhibit SSB) was tendered before the sentencing judge. A copy of that letter was also provided to this Court on the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and I have read its contents. There is some confidentiality attaching to the contents of that letter. However it is clear that the applicant provided police with information, on the basis of which a search warrant was obtained and executed. Almost $6 million in cash was seized. An arrest and prosecution followed. There is no suggestion at all that the police were aware of this information before it was provided to them by the applicant. 

The reasons of the sentencing judge
85The sole reference by the sentencing judge to the applicant's assistance appears at ROS 7 in the following terms:

""I note some assistance in the administration of justice as claimed as per exhibit SSB but in my view that is a modest factor indeed. This sequence of events occurred over some months and if she felt frightened or worried it was always open to her to approach Australian authorities and to seek help and protection. I know that as a person who is not a native of Australia, as a migrant she might not understand fully how the legal system works here. Nonetheless there is an obligation upon people who live in Australia not to participate in criminal schemes such as this. I do not believe she was so naive she would have been unable to withdraw if she had seen fit to do so. She did not.""

86His Honour then said (at ROS 9):

""Each of the sentences imposed has been discounted by twenty-five per cent to acknowledge the pleas of guilty and to reflect contrition and willingness to assist in the administration of justice"".

Submissions of the applicant
87Counsel for the applicant advanced three submissions in support of this ground. Firstly, he submitted that the information which had been provided by the applicant:

(i)was reliable;

(ii)directly resulted in the seizure of a substantial amount of money; and

(iii)led to the arrest and conviction of another offender. 

88It was submitted that in these circumstances his Honour's assessment that the assistance was ""modest indeed"" understated the true position, and reflected error.

89Secondly, counsel submitted that the fact (inter alia) that the applicant had not withdrawn from her criminal activities at an earlier point in time was irrelevant to an assessment of her assistance of that assistance. It was submitted that if the references of the sentencing judge to such matters were intended to support a conclusion that the applicant's assistance was modest, it followed that his Honour had taken into account one or more irrelevant considerations.

90Thirdly, counsel pointed to the conclusions of the sentencing judge that the sentence should be discounted by 25 per cent. He pointed out that the sentencing judge's reasons made no reference to any component of that discount being referable to the applicant's assistance, and made no reference to the s. 16A(2)(h) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which is in the following terms:

Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc.--federal offences 
...

(2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court: 

....

(h) the degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences;

..."" 

91In these circumstances, counsel for the applicant submitted that on a reading of the sentencing judge's remarks as a whole, the 25 per cent discount should be read as reflecting only the applicant's plea of guilty. He submitted that in these circumstances, it followed that either:

(i)no discount for assistance had been applied at all; or

(ii)an incorrect test, taking into account irrelevant considerations, had been applied in determining what discount might be appropriate. 

Submissions of the Crown
92The Crown submitted that any suggestion that the applicant's assistance was not taken into account at all by the sentencing judge could not be sustained. In this regard, the Crown pointed, in particular, to his Honour's specific reference to Exhibit SSB. It was submitted that in these circumstances, it was obvious that his Honour was aware of the evidence relating to the issue of assistance. 

93Accepting this to be the case, the Crown submitted that the substance of this ground was really a complaint about the weight which had been given by the sentencing judge to the applicant's past assistance. It was submitted that questions of weight were a matter for the sentencing judge and that any assessment should be overturned by this Court only on the basis of a demonstrable error. 

94The Crown further submitted that on a fair reading of the sentencing remarks, it was apparent that his Honour had applied a combined discount of 25 per cent to reflect the applicant's plea of guilty, her contrition and her assistance. It was submitted that his Honour's assessment of the applicant's assistance as ""modest"" simply reflected the fact that such assistance was forthcoming on arrest, and was confined to details about another offender. It was submitted that his Honour's reference to other matters was simply a way of pointing out that the applicant could have assisted the authorities sooner than she did. 

Consideration
95The applicant's assistance led directly to the discovery of a large quantity of cash, and the arrest and prosecution of another offender. As I have pointed out, there is no suggestion that the police were previously aware of the information the applicant provided. In these circumstances, his Honour's conclusion that the applicant's assistance was ""modest indeed"" understated its significance, and was reflective of error. 

96Further, given the terms of his Honour's sentencing remarks, I am left to conclude that his assessment of the applicant's assistance as ""modest"" was based, at least in part, upon the fact that that applicant had:

(i)engaged in offending for several months;
(ii)failed to disclose that offending to the authorities; and
(iii)failed to withdraw from such offending at an earlier time.

97Those considerations were not relevant to an assessment of the value of the applicant's assistance. Accepting that they were factors which led his Honour to conclude that such assistance was modest, it follows that such conclusion was infected by error. 

98I am also satisfied that the discount of 25 per cent which his Honour applied was referable only to the applicant's plea of guilty. I have come to that conclusion for two reasons. Firstly, it is one which is consistent with his Honour's assessment that the applicant's assistance was modest. Secondly, it is supported by the terms in which his Honour expressed the reasons for the discount. In particular, his Honour's reference to the applicant's ""willingness to assist in the administration of justice"" is generally consistent with the terminology adopted by the High Court when considering the effect of a plea of guilty in Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; (2002) 209 CLR 339 at [14]. 

99Accepting that the discount of 25 per cent was applied solely to reflect the plea of guilty, it follows that the applicant's assistance was given little or no weight in the sentencing process. That, in my view, reflects further error.

100For all of these reasons, this ground is made out. 

Ground 5 - The individual sentences and the overall effective sentence are manifestly excessive.
Submissions of the applicant
101Counsel for the applicant emphasised a number of factors which, he submitted, rendered the overall effective sentence imposed manifestly excessive. In particular, he pointed to:

(i)the low level of the applicant's role;

(ii)the short period over which the transactions referrable to a particular count were carried out;

(iii)the fact that the applicant conducted such transactions in her own name;

(iv)the absence of any finding that the applicant had derived a gain from the transaction;

(v)the finding that the applicant had been recruited by a family friend, to whom she owed a debt of gratitude, and had been, in effect, ""used"" by that friend;

(vi)the finding that the applicant was naïve, and was a person who found it difficult to refuse a request for help from an elder;

(vii)the finding that there was a degree of non-exculpatory duress arising from the threats made by the family friend;

(viii)the applicant's age and prior good character;

(ix)the applicant's contrition and (by implication) be good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of reoffending;

(x)the pleas of guilty; and

(xi)the applicant's level of assistance to the authorities.

102Counsel also pointed out that the nature of money laundering offences is such that they can be committed in a variety of ways, such that no particular sentencing range is able to be defined: R v Li [2010] NSWCCA 125 at [40]. It was submitted that in light of the maximum penalty of 3 years for each count, and despite the sums involved, the numerous factors in the applicant's favour were indicative of the manifest excess of the sentences imposed.

Submissions of the Crown
103The Crown submitted that this was not a case of ""low level"" offending. In support of that submission, the Crown pointed, in particular, to the substantial amounts of money involved, along with the fact that the offending was sustained. It was submitted that in these circumstances, the overall head sentence of 5½ years was not excessive, let alone manifestly so.

104It was further submitted that the applicant's complaint of manifest excess failed to recognise the discretion vested in the sentencing judge.

Consideration
105For the reasons previously expressed, I have found that grounds 1 and 4 have been made out. Accordingly, the Court's power in s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is enlivened. The function of this Court in those circumstances was explained by the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37 at [42]: 

""... When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence"". 

106The Court went on to say (at [43]): 

""After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal"".

107Because error has been found in respect of Grounds 1 and 4, the applicant (notwithstanding the terms of Ground 5) does not have to establish, for the purposes of the exercise of the Court's function under s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. As the judgment in Kentwell makes clear, it is the function of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh when, as in the present case, error is established. 

RESENTENCING
108In resentencing the applicant, I have had regard to the entirety of the evidence which was before the sentencing judge, as well as the submissions advanced in relation to Ground 5. I have also had regard to the contents of the affidavit of the applicant of 13 October 2014 which was read in the event that the Court came to consider the question of re-sentence.

109Money laundering is a serious criminal activity. The applicant's offending is no exception. It involved the sustained movement, over a period of two months, of large sums of cash. Whilst the applicant was, on the evidence before the sentencing judge, obviously acting at the behest of others in carrying out the acts which constituted her offending, the role that she played was vital to the conduct of what was obviously a significant illegal enterprise which had, as its primary objective, the movement of large amounts of cash from Australia. As his Honour properly pointed out (at ROS 8) general deterrence is an important factor in the consideration of an appropriate sentence.

110Whilst the sentencing judge made no reference to the issue of rehabilitation, the applicant's affidavit of 13 October 2014 sets out (at [6]) various courses which the applicant has completed since being taken into custody. The fact that the applicant has done so, and her expressed desire to enter into employment upon release, are factors which support a conclusion that her prospects of rehabilitation are favourable. 

111Leaving aside the absence of any reference to prospects of rehabilitation, and to a greater or lesser extent, the sentencing judge took into account the matters which are relied upon by counsel for the applicant in support of this ground (as set out at [101] above). To the extent that those matters incorporate findings made by the sentencing judge, no complaint is made about them. However, for the reasons I have previously expressed, the categorisation of the applicant's assistance as being ""modest"" was an error, as was the fact that such assistance was given little or no weight in the sentencing process. His Honour also erroneously elevated the appellant's subjective criminality by concluding that she knew that the money was the proceeds of crime. 

112In these circumstances I am satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law. The applicant must be sentenced on the basis that she held a reasonable suspicion that the money was the proceeds of crime, not on the basis that she knew or believed this to be the case. That necessarily reduces the level of her moral culpability.

113In re-sentencing the applicant I must also have regard to her assistance. In R v PPB [1999] NSWCCA 360 Kirby J (with whom Simpson J agreed) set out (at [29]) a number of the considerations relevant to discounts for assistance given to the authorities. Having made reference to the earlier decision of the Court in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, his Honour said (further citations omitted):

""The Court acknowledged that there was a clear public interest that offenders should be encouraged to supply information that will assist authorities to bring others to justice. The extent of the discount will depend, to a large extent, upon the willingness with which disclosures are made. If they are tailored to avoid uncomfortable subjects, the discount will plainly be less. It will rarely be substantial unless the offender discloses everything he knows. The discount is designed, amongst other things, to compensate the prisoner for the deprivations which will inevitably attend the need for him to be protected whilst in custody. The threat of reprisals, including after release, is a factor"". 

114Whilst the level of any discount is not fixed, a combined discount for plea and assistance should not normally exceed 50 per cent and a discount of that amount should be reserved for exceptional cases: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249. In the present case, there is no suggestion that the applicant's assistance was given unwillingly, nor is there any suggestion that it was tailored or less than full. Equally, there is no evidence that it has impacted adversely upon her conditions of custody. I have taken all of those factors into account and have concluded that the applicant's assistance in the present case warrants a discount of 5% in addition to that allowed for her plea of guilty. 

115In re-sentencing the applicant I have adopted the same ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period as that which was adopted by the sentencing judge. I also note the provisions of s. 16F of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides that where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and fixes a non-parole period, it must explain or cause to be explained, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of fixing that non-parole period. Having regard, in particular to the provisions of s. 16F(1)(a)-(d) I note the following:

(i)the service of the sentence that I propose will entail a period of imprisonment of not less than the non-parole period and, if a parole order is made, a period of service in the community (the parole period) to complete service of the sentence (s. 16F(1)(a));

(ii)if a parole order is made, the order will be subject to conditions (s. 16F(1)(b));

(iii)the parole order may be amended or revoked (s. 16F(1)(c)); and 

(iv)in the event that the applicant fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfill any conditions which are imposed on a parole order, the consequences could include the applicant being returned to custody in order complete the balance of the term of imprisonment that I propose (s. 16F(1)(d)). 

ORDERS
116I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal is granted.

(2)The appeal allowed. 

(3)The sentences imposed in the District Court of NSW are quashed.

(4)In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows: 

(i)in respect of each of counts 1, 2 and 3, imprisonment for 1 year and 3 months commencing 12 December 2012 and expiring on 11 March 2014, such sentences to be served wholly concurrently; 

(ii)in respect of each of counts 4, 5 and 6, imprisonment for 1 year and 3 months to commence at the expiration of the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3, i.e. 12 March 2014 and to expire on 11 June 2015;

(iii)in respect of counts 7 and 8, imprisonment for 1 year and 3 months to be served concurrently and to commence at the expiration of the sentences imposed in respect of counts 4, 5 and 6, i.e. 12 June 2015 and to expire on 11 September 2016;

(iv)in respect of each of counts 9 and 10, imprisonment for 1 year and 3 months to be served concurrently, to commence on 12 June 2016 and to expire on 11 September 2017; 

(v)the sentence imposed in respect of the offence against s. 400.9(1A) in the Court below, namely imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 12 December 2012 and expiring on 11 September 2013, is confirmed;

(vi)the overall sentence imposed is one of 4 years and 9 months;

(vii)a non-parole period of 2 years and 7 months imprisonment is imposed, commencing on 12 December 2012 and expiring on 11 July 2015.

2704183,R v Hopoi [2014] NSWCCA 263,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.
2R A HULME J:  I agree with Davies J.3DAVIES J: On 10 July 2013 the Respondent pleaded guilty at Burwood Local Court to robbery in circumstances of aggravation with wounding contrary to s 96 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment.
4On 23 July 2014 Judge Williams in the District Court sentenced the Respondent by adjourning the proceedings to 29 October 2014 pursuant to s 11(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  His Honour intended that by that date there would be a report from Probation and Parole or Community Corrections Service in respect of the matters provided for in s 11 and particularly the Respondent's rehabilitation progress.  
5The Sentencing Judge imposed a number of conditions on the deferral including abstinence from alcohol and illicit drugs, and participation in all programs required by the Respondent's case manager. 
6The Crown now appeals on the basis that the sentence is manifestly inadequate.  
7Some days after the appeal was argued, the parties informed the Court that when the matter came back before the Sentencing Judge for review on 29 October 2014 his Honour had adjourned the matter for sentence on 6 February 2015 and had ordered an assessment of the Respondent for an Intensive Corrections Order.  This Court required the parties to provide a transcript of the hearing on 29 October so that further consideration could be given to the disposition of the appeal.
8The parties filed further written submissions.  The Crown submissions proceeded upon an acceptance that the s 11 order had been revoked.  For reasons which follow, I do not believe that to be the case.  The Crown nonetheless pressed for the Court to deliver a judgment.  Senior counsel for the respondent argued that as the s 11 order was no longer ""on foot"" the Court was deprived of jurisdiction.
9The transcript confirms the order made for an ICO assessment and that the proceedings have been adjourned for sentence to 6 February 2015.  It is notable, however, that whilst there was discussion about the possibility of revoking the s 11 order, no such order was actually made.  Moreover, the adjournment was not ordered with the intention of obviating the need for a judgment from this Court on the appeal; indeed, it was ordered with the expectation that a judgment of this Court would be forthcoming.  Accordingly, orders will be made to dispose of the appeal on the basis that the sentence in question is a deferral under s 11.
Facts of the offending
10The agreed facts at the sentence hearing disclosed the following.
11At about 3:35 am on Sunday 1 April 2012, Hafizul Haque, was on shift working as a taxi driver. At this time, the driver acknowledged a radio job to pick up three passengers from a residence at Matraville with a destination of Campsie.
12The driver drove to Matraville where three men got into the taxi.  Benn Vakalahi sat in the front passenger seat, Steven Fonua sat behind Vakaiahi and the Respondent sat directly behind the driver. 
13As the driver drove towards Campsie, all three men provided directions. As they approached the end of the cul de sac in Reid Avenue, the driver said, ""Just here?"" to which the Respondent replied, ""Mmmmmm"".
14All three men opened the taxi doors and got out of the vehicle. The Respondent went to the driver's side of the taxi, opened the driver's door and reached in grabbing the keys and switching the engine off. The Respondent held on to the keys and said to the driver ""Where is your money?""
15The Respondent reached across the driver and felt around his right trouser pocket and said ""What is this? Take it out"".  The driver reached into his pocket and took out two fuel receipts and showed the Respondent who took them and threw them on the ground.
16The Respondent then raised his right hand and punched the driver with a closed fist on the chin. As a result of the punch the driver began to bleed from a wound to his chin.
17The Respondent repeated ""Where is your money?"" Fearing for his safety, the driver reached into his top shirt pocket and took out $800 - $900 in cash and EFTPOS receipts totalling $200. The Respondnent snatched the money and EFTPOS receipts from the driver's hand and fled the scene towards Jarrett Street with Vakalahi and Fonua.
18The driver pressed the emergency button in the taxi and called triple 0 from his mobile phone. Police arrived shortly afterward.
19The driver was conveyed to Canterbury Hospital and was treated for an open wound approximately 2 centimetres in length beneath his chin that required three stitches. The driver was in a lot of pain and need to have a tetanus shot.
20The driver felt very scared and intimidated when he was struck by the Respondent. 
21Police obtained CCTV footage stills from the taxi that showed the Respondent leaning over the driver's seat, and the other two men a short distance away as the Respondent assaulted the driver.
22On 3 August 2012 police obtained a warrant to intercept the Respondent's mobile telephone.
23On 9 August 2012 the Respondent spoke to Ben Vakalahi on the telephone.  Vakalahi advised the Respondent that police were looking for them as the taxi driver was in a coma.  In fact, the driver was never in a coma. In the course of the conversation the Respondent said:
I only jabbed him, I didn't knock him out. I just jabbed...him and then he handed me the money.I just jabbed him. When I jabbed him, he um, handed over the money and then he, when we were going he got out of the car and was looking at us.It wasn't like fuckin' seven punches, you know? It was just one jab.
24At about 7:00 am on Thursday 11 October 2012, police attended Room 216 at 9 Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross (Astoria Hotel) to execute a search warrant.  The Respondent was arrested and transported to Kings Cross Police Station.
25At Kings Cross Police Station, the Respondent was cautioned and agreed to participate in a recorded interview. During the interview when asked what he could tell police about a taxi driver who had been robbed in Reid Avenue, Clemton Park on 1 April, 2012, the Respondent:
informed police that he had been at a party in Matraville that night with Ben Vakalahi and Steven Fonuasaid he could not remember as he was intoxicated but did remember getting out and running from the taxi. He told police he went to the party between 6pm and 8pm on Saturday night with about $200 but spent it on alcohol. He said he was intoxicated that day and night and drank about 10 bottles of full strength beer and 10 glasses of bourbon or vodka mixed with cola at the party.remembered leaving the party in a taxi with Fonua and Vakalahi to go to his house in Troy Street, Campsie where he and Fonua lived. He assumed he or Fonua directed the taxi driver back to Campsie. When the taxi stopped at Reid Avenue, he stated he and Fonua ran back to their house as he had no money to pay for the taxi fare; andsaid he had no knowledge of the robbery and said he did not  commit the robbery.
26The Respondent pleaded guilty to this matter in the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court.
Subjective factors
27The Respondent was born on 29 June 1978 and was aged 33 years at the date of the offence.  
28The Respondent is of Tongan descent and was raised in Auckland with a relatively good childhood.  He went to year 11 at school and then came to Australia in 1999 where he worked as a security guard until about 2006.  Since 2012 he has been working as a forklift driver at Toll.  
29He started using cannabis at about age 16 or 17 and became a heavy drinker of beer as well.  He had a gambling problem from about 2000 and would spend up to $200 each time that he used the poker machines.
30He has been in a relationship with his wife Joyce for some years.  Five children live with them, the eldest of whom is his wife's son from a previous relationship.  He and his wife have four children, three boys aged 14, 13 and 10 and a girl aged 9.
31The Sentencing Judge accepted the Respondent's evidence that things started to fall apart in 2012 when his wife and the children left for some months as a result of her perception that drinking and gambling were becoming a significant problem for the Respondent.  It appears that they have now reconciled.
32The Respondent has three offences on his record prior to the offence under consideration.  On 21 December 2000 he was placed on a two year s 9 bond for being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence.  On 22 October 2007 he was fined $500 with court costs for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  There was a third offence of driving whilst his licence was suspended.  The two serious offences were also committed whilst he was under the influence of alcohol.  
33His Honour noted that the Respondent pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and he said that if a term of imprisonment was to be imposed then a 25% discount would be appropriate.
34The Sentencing Judge had before him a report from a psychologist, Dr Emma Collins, who had reviewed the Respondent and conducted psychometric testing.  The Respondent additionally gave evidence at the sentence hearing and confirmed that what he told Dr Collins was true.  
35It is apparent from reading the Remarks on Sentence that the Sentencing Judge was impressed with Dr Collins' report.  The Sentencing Judge said:
Dr Collins says that since his arrest he has returned to a pro-social lifestyle that includes rekindling with his wife, stable employment and a reduction of his substance abuse issues. He does not impress with significant needs as to treatment. His functioning is stable but ongoing observation of his substance abuse would be preferred. He is not at significant risk of recidivism and incarceration, according to Dr Collins, would undo his good efforts with regard to maintaining employment and providing for his family and the risk of substance abuse would probably increase after incarceration if he has difficulty securing employment. That opinion is a powerful factor in leading me to the view that I should today invoke the provisions of s 11.
36His Honour found that the Respondent was remorseful.  He accepted, however, the Crown's submission that a very guarded approach to rehabilitation and remorse should be taken.  His Honour went on to say that this submission was a significant factor that influenced him in adopting the course that he proposed under s 11.  
37His Honour appeared to accept the submission made on the Respondent's behalf that if a sentence had the effect of turning a offender towards a criminal way of life the protection of the community is to that extent impaired, whereas if the sentence induced or assisted the avoidance of further offending the protection of the community was to that extent enhanced.  
Submissions
38The Respondent submitted that a deferral under s 11 was clearly open to the Sentencing Judge and that his discretion did not miscarry.  
39In response to the Crown's submission that the Sentencing Judge ought to have assessed the objective seriousness of the offence, the Respondent submitted that the Sentencing Judge knew what the objective seriousness of the offence was because the facts of the matter were not disputed.  Further, the fact that the offence was objectively serious and would likely lead to a full time period of imprisonment did not make the deferral erroneous.  
40The Respondent submitted further that the overall effect of the evidence from the Respondent, his wife and the psychologist was that his Honour's view that he was guarded as to any position relating to the prospects of rehabilitation justified the deferral.  The prospects of rehabilitation would assist in determining the appropriate sentence and the length of that sentence.  
41The Respondent drew attention to a number of passages in the Crown's submissions before the Sentencing Judge in support of the proposition that his Honour ought to have a guarded view of the Respondent's rehabilitation because his problems with alcohol had not been addressed.  The Respondent also drew attention to a number of the conditions of the deferral in relation to abstinence from alcohol, the requirement for urine testing and the requirement to attend all programs directed by the case manager as supporting the view that there needed to be further time to assess his capacity and prospects for rehabilitation.  
42In relation to delay the Respondent said that this issue had less impact in the present case where there had already been significant delay and not through the fault of the Respondent.
43Finally, the Respondent submitted that in the exercise of the residual discretion the appeal should be refused.  It was significant that the matter was due to come back before the Sentencing Judge in a short time.  It was suggested that there might be fresh and/or other material before the Sentencing Judge at that time which would assist him in coming to the appropriate view of the sentence.  In that way it was more appropriate that the matter be left to the Sentencing Judge rather than for this Court to intervene.  
Consideration
44This Court's decision in R v Farrell [2014] NSWCCA 30 has identified the appropriate considerations in relation to a s 11 deferral:
(a) It is necessary for the Sentencing Judge to make findings of fact and an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence before adjourning a matter under s 11:  R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at [38];
(b) A Crown appeal is available under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) from a s 11 deferral: Farrell at [36];
(c) A deferral under s 11 will be manifestly inadequate if it is demonstrably obvious that a sentence was called for: Farrell at [36];
(d) A s 11 deferral should not be granted unless there are good reasons for concluding that it is likely to assist the Court in determining whether an offender should be sent to gaol or in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period: R v Trindall [2002] NSWCCA 364; 133 A Crim R 119 at [64];
(e) Unless the further delaying of the sentencing of the offender is wholly justified in order to ensure that the sentencing discretion is properly exercised, there will be a miscarriage of justice by reason of the delay: Palu at [30];
(f) A s 11 deferral is not confined to cases where something other than a full-time custodial sentence is contemplated by a sentencing judge if rehabilitation is successful: Trindall at [64]; R v Brown [2009] NSWCCA 6; 193 A Crim R 574 at [22].
45Bearing in mind those principles I consider that the Sentencing Judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in deferring sentence for the following reasons.
46First, the offence occurred on 1 April 2012.  The Respondent was arrested on 11 October 2012.  He pleaded guilty on 10 July 2013.  The matter came before the District Court for sentence on 12 May 2014.  It was adjourned.  The sentencing hearing took place on 23 July 2014 and on that day the Sentencing Judge deferred sentence.  
47In the first instance he stood the sentence over for a three month period indicating that:
Rather than making it 12 months at the moment ... my intention is that there will be three monthly reviews.
The strong inference is that his Honour was minded not to pass sentence for a period of 12 months from 23 July 2014.  The result would be that the Respondent would be sentenced more than three years after the offence was committed.  If at that time a custodial sentence was to be imposed it would involve unfairness to the Respondent and might result in a miscarriage of justice.  
48Secondly, there was ample evidence to indicate the state of the Respondent's rehabilitation at the time of the sentencing hearing and to enable the Sentencing Judge to assess the likelihood of future rehabilitation.  The Sentencing Judge relied in that regard on the report from Dr Collins and summarised a portion of it dealing with the Respondent's rehabilitation that is set out at [34] above.  
49However, as that summary of the report made clear, Dr Collins thought his position was stable, he did not impress with significant needs as to treatment of his substance abuse but ongoing observation would be preferred.  Accordingly, Dr Collins' opinion did not support a deferral.  The Sentencing Judge appears to have been impressed by Dr Collins' view that incarceration might undo the good work that had already been achieved, and for that reason moved to a deferral.  Dr Collins' view was more particularly directed to a final non-custodial sentence.
50The Crown's submissions concerning the guarded view about the Respondent's rehabilitation should not have been seen by the Sentencing Judge as supporting any position that the time had not yet arrived for the imposition of a sentence and suggesting a deferral. More than two years had passed since the offending.  The Respondent had been given ample time to demonstrate that he had adequately addressed his alcohol and gambling problems, the former being far more relevant to the offending.   At that time his rehabilitation was relevant at least for considerations of special circumstances and the likelihood of reoffending.
51Thirdly, the Sentencing Judge made no finding of the objective seriousness of the offence.  His Honour simply set out the submission of the Respondent's counsel that the offence was towards the lower end of the scale notwithstanding the vulnerability of the victim. The closest the Sentencing Judge came to making his own assessment of the objective seriousness was his statement that:
On any view it was a cowardly and despicable attack on a vulnerable victim which deserves severe punishment.
Whilst it may be accepted that the Sentencing Judge found the necessary facts because they were largely undisputed, it was still incumbent upon his Honour to assess the objective seriousness of the offending before considering whether a deferral was appropriate.  In failing to do so the Sentencing Judge's discretion miscarried.  
52Fourthly, given the nature of the offending and this Court's decision in R v Henry (1999) NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 there were no good reasons for concluding that a deferral was likely to assist the Court in determining whether the Respondent should be sent to gaol.  In Henry Spigelman CJ (with whom the four other members of the bench generally agreed) noted at [113] that this Court had consistently said that, except in exceptional circumstances, a fulltime custodial sentence for an offence of armed robbery should be imposed. .
53Henry is also the appropriate guideline in respect of offences contrary to s 96 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW); R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 at [22] and [91].  Most of the features identified in Henry at [162] were present in the offence under consideration.  Although a weapon was not used, actual violence was employed.  The maximum penalty for an offence under s 96 is 25 years imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for an offence under s 97(1) with respect to which the Henry guideline judgment was concerned is 20 years imprisonment.   In the light of that matter and the decision in Thomas it should be accepted, therefore, that exceptional circumstances need to be shown for the imposition of other than a fulltime custodial penalty for an offence against s 96.  Exceptional circumstances are not apparent on the materials placed before this Court.
54Finally, given the evidence before the Sentencing Judge concerning the Respondent, the period of time since the offending and the Respondent's subsequent rehabilitation it is difficult to see how a deferral would have assisted the Court in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period.   
55All of these matters make it apparent that a sentence, rather than deferral, was called for after the sentencing hearing had concluded.  The deferral of that sentence demonstrates a manifestly inadequate exercise of the sentencing discretion.  
56The Respondent's Senior counsel's further submissions invited the Court to exercise its discretion not to intervene on the basis that there was no utility in doing so having regard to the primary purpose of Crown appeals being to afford guidance to sentencing judges: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 XCLR 462 at [1] - [2], [36] and [43].
57I am not persuaded that there is any need to exercise the residual discretion.  There is no utility in doing so having regard to the nature of the order I propose to dispose of the appeal.
58I propose the following orders:
(1) Appeal allowed.
(2) Remit the matter to the District Court for sentence of the Respondent according to law.

2704194,MK v R [2014] NSWCCA 274,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceBetween 25 September and 4 October 2012 the applicant was tried before Quirk DCJ and a jury for the following offences:
Count 1 - Take without consent and with intent to obtain an advantage being an indecent assault contrary to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.
Counts 2 and 3 - Indecent assault on a person under 16 namely 6 years contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years and a standard non-parole period of 8 years.
2On 4 October 2012 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty of each offence.  On 23 July 2013 the applicant was sentenced for those offences as follows:
In relation to Count 1, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 9 April 2011 and expiring 8 April 2012.
In respect of Counts 2 and 3, imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 9 April 2011 and expiring 8 April 2013 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire 8 April 2014.  
3As can be seen, those periods of imprisonment have now expired.
4The applicant relies upon three grounds of appeal:
Ground 1 - The trial was not conducted according to law because the complainant and other child witness CL were not competent to give unsworn evidence.
Ground 2 - The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
Ground 3 - The trial miscarried by reason of the Crown and the trial judge reversing the onus of proof, misstating the identification evidence and inviting the jury to adopt false logic which overstated the probative force of the identification evidence.
Crown case and evidence at trial
5The Crown case was that on 6 February 2011 the applicant, who was a stranger to the 6 year old complainant, took her by the hand and pulled her underneath the unit block where she lived into a dark section where garages were located.  This occurred after the complainant had gone downstairs with her friend, CL, to collect a ball that had gone over the edge of the balcony of the family's apartment.  It was alleged that the applicant then removed her shorts and underpants and touched her genital area with his hands.  He then touched her bottom with his erect penis.
6The complainant described her assailant as having a distinctive facial decoration, being three pieces of jewellery, like earrings, on his cheek.  The applicant had such an adornment.  The complainant said he also had short black hair and described his clothing.
7A Mazda car bought by the applicant on 29 December 2010 was parked in front of the unit block where the complainant and her family lived on 6 February 2011 from some time in the afternoon on that day until a man (not the applicant) came and drove it away some time after the complainant disclosed the offences to her father.
8The Crown case was circumstantial and based on facts largely not disputed.  The complainant made immediate complaint of having been grabbed by a strange man in the undercover car-park beneath her family unit, dragged to a different part of the car-park where the offences took place.  Her playmate, CL, who was also 6 years old gave evidence that a strange man had told him to go and collect leaves and that when he returned, the complainant ran to him from a dark part of the car-park crying and told him that a man had put something like a rock in her mouth.  It was not suggested to either witness that the incident did not occur.
9It was also not in dispute that at about the same time a vehicle owned by the applicant, a grey Mazda, was parked in the building's car-park in a way that blocked access to a resident's garage.  Some time after the resident had called triple 0 to complain about the vehicle an unidentified man, who was not the applicant (and was said by the Crown not to be the applicant or the perpetrator), and who was attempting to sell ladies' handbags to residents, drove the vehicle away.  
10The applicant was interviewed by the police three days after the accident and denied any involvement.  He indicated that many other people regularly drove his car.  When police located the car that morning, it was being driven by the applicant's uncle and the applicant's mother was a passenger.
11The Crown's case relied upon three things:
(1)The extent to which the applicant fitted the various descriptions of the perpetrator given by the complainant and CL.
(2)The circumstance that a car owned by the applicant was at the location of the incident and removed by a person other than the applicant some time after the incident.
(3)The police record of interview with the applicant.
12The Crown relied upon identification evidence from the complainant and CL and upon hearsay evidence of descriptions given by the complainant and CL to others immediately following the incident.  The Crown case depended upon the jury rejecting parts of the complainant's evidence and that of CL to the extent that it was inconsistent with the appearance of the applicant.
13Before the jury and this Court was a 10 minutes video of the location of the incident (the residential building's car-park) (exhibit A).
14The complainant's record of interview was recorded less than 24 hours after the assault and was played to the jury.  The complainant gave little meaningful evidence during the first hour of the interview when she was on her own with a female police officer.  After a 25 minute break, the interview resumed, this time with the complainant's mother in the room.  On occasions the complainant appeared to communicate with her mother through non verbal signs and on occasions looked to her mother before answering questions about the incident.  On occasions her mother would prompt her by nodding with whispered words and signs.  From my viewing of the interview I would agree that in relation to the actual offending, her mother did prompt her by moving her hands in a downward motion as though pulling down the complainant's pants.
15In the recorded interview, the complainant said that the assailant had ""one of the things you put on your ears"" in his cheek and said there was ""one big one and one little, medium and one small"" (MFI 2 Q and A 366 and 367; MFI 4, Q and A 78 and 79).  The complainant was unable to remember which side of the face they were on but she appeared to specify the right side of her cheek a little above her mouth as the location of those items.
16She said that the assailant's hair was short, that he was wearing shorts which were black.  She said that the man was skinny and had white skin.  She could not remember if he had any other marks or earrings.  She said ""At the end, when I looked behind he was gone"" and she did not see where he went.
17In cross-examination the complainant said that she did not hear the man say anything to CL.  She said that she did not know where in the garage he took her, but it was not the area where there was a toilet.  She said that when she told her father what had happened on the night of the assault, she said that the man had three earrings, or three little bits of jewellery on his top lip.  Her memory was that the man had bits of jewellery on his lip and she said she remembered that the colour of the jewellery was silver.  She remembered that she did not see any other marks on his face and that he did not have any spots or freckles on his face.
18She did not remember telling her dad that the man had pictures on his arm and did not remember if he had pictures on his arm.  She said by comparison with her father, whom she described as ""in the middle"" in terms of being fat or skinny, that the man was skinny and shorter than her father.  She remembered saying the man had white skin and when asked said it was lighter skin than her own.  She said the man was not wearing anything on his head.
19In re-examination the Crown asked about the location of the jewellery on the man's face.  She pointed to ""her left cheek area"" which for the record the applicant's counsel described as ""just to the side of the mouth and just above - from the cheekbone - jawbone up"", to which the Crown responded ""I don't think it's meant to be precise"".  The complainant said there were three pieces of jewellery and agreed with the statement that they ranged in size.
20CL's interview with police, which was video recorded two days after the incident on 8 February 2011, was shown to the jury.  CL said:
""The day before yesterday I went to my friend's house and then, and then my friend and me were playing on the balcony with a ball and then fell on the ground and then we went to the garage and picked it, then a man came - he said that, he said to me that go and pick me some leaves from over there and then, and then he took and then he took my friend away.  - And when he, then I was looking for her and then I came up and said to my dad and my, and my, and my other friend said that I can't find my friend, they too went running down to find her.  And then she was crying and someone else and my friend said that the man put something like this in her mouth and then she spit it out.""  (At this point CL squeezed his lips open with his hand.)  (MFI 4, p 5-6)
21After more questions, the following exchange occurred (MFI 4, p 7):
""Q.78 Yeah.  Can you tell me what the man looked like?  Can you describe him from his head to his toes?A.  He is, his shirt was blue and he had a diamond here.  [He pointed with his hand to his forehead above his right eyebrow.]
Q.79 He had a what?A.  A diamond.
Q.80 Okay.A.  And his shorts were I think brown.
Q.81 Is there anything else you can remember about him?A.  (No audible reply)
Q.82 No.  Can you tell me more about his blue shirt?A.  There was nothing on it.
Q.83 Was it like short sleeved or long sleeved or something ...?A.  Short sleeves.  And shorts on.
Q.84 Do you know what colour hair he had?A.  He had black.
Q.85 Mmm.A.  But they were spikey.  [At this point CL pulled his hands straight up from his scalp indicating hair standing up.]
Q.86 Was the man tall or short or -?A.  Tall.
Q.87 Tall and was he a fat guy or a skinny guy or something else?A.  Like a little bit fat.  [CL gestured around his stomach]
Q.88 And can you remember what colour skin he had?A.  He had skinny.
Q.89 Do you remember what colour his skin was?A.  [No audible reply.]  [CL shook his head]
Q.90 No?  Was there anything else about him that you remember?A.  [No audible reply]  [CL shook his head]
Q.91 You said he had a diamond where ....A.  Here.  [CL again indicated the space on the right side of his forehead between his eyebrow and his hairline and clearly above his eyebrow.]
Q.92 ... Was that?  Okay do you remember what side of his face it was on?A.  No.
Q.93 Was there anything else on his face?A.  [No audible reply]  [CL shook his head.]""
22CL said that when he came back and was looking for the complainant, she and the man were hiding ""at the end of the garage, there's a door, they went in there"", although he did not see them go in there (MFI 4, p 9).  He said that the complainant was crying because the man put a rock in her mouth, but she spat it out and he, CL, knew this because she had told him (MFI 4, pp 10-11).  He did not see the man touch her (MFI 4, p 12).  He went upstairs to alert his and the complainant's fathers, who came down looking for the complainant.  After they found her, they went off in the car looking for the man around the neighbourhood.  
23In cross-examination CL said that the man grabbed the complainant's hand and he saw them ""go into this dark place where nobody goes.  It's like a secret place, and that's where they went"" (26/9/12 T.97).  He said the dark place is ""open in the middle"" (T.97).  (It was accepted that this would describe the corridor at the farthest point inside the garage, which had a bathroom down a long corridor to the right and a staircase leading to a patio and fenced garden, down a long corridor to the left - the corridor of which does appear to ""open in the middle"" (exhibit A). 
24CL said that the man was about as tall as the complainant's father and ""a little bit fat"" like the complainant's dad.  He gave evidence that the man had a diamond on his forehead and pointed to both sides of his face, but then said that it was on the right side of the man's face (26/9/12 T.99).  He said the diamond was ""up and next to"" the man's eyebrow when asked if it was above, next to, or below the eyebrow and said there was only one (T.99).  He said the man had a tattoo all around his right arm, which CL demonstrated by twisting his hand around his arm.  He said that this tattoo was closer to the man's shoulder than to his hand, that it was a picture not writing and that the man had no tattoos on his left arm or on his hands (26/9/12 T.99-100).
25The complainant's father, HR, gave evidence that on 6 February 2011 at about 8 or 8.30pm, the complainant told him she was going downstairs to collect her ball which had fallen over the balcony.  A few minutes later CL came up and said ""Someone is pulling [the complainant] around down there"" after which he and CL's father immediately ran down.  When he reached the last step of the staircase and turned into the garage [the complainant] was running up the car-park driveway towards him from the farthest area in the garage where the toilet is.  He said after the complainant calmed down, she told him that the man pulled her and put something in her mouth which she spat out.  He asked where the man was and she pointed to the garage area.
26HR waited for the man to come out and when no-one came out, went in to look for him and saw that it may have been possible for the man to exit out of the back of the car-park.  (The video, exhibit A, confirms this.)  HR, his wife, CL's father and the complainant and possibly CL got into CL's father's car to drive around the neighbourhood to try to locate the man.
27They returned home after 20-30 minutes driving around.  He cuddled the complainant on the sofa and she told him, in a mixture of English and Hindi, that the man ""touched my susu and put something in my mouth.  It was on a stick ... and I spit it out.  It was disgusting.""
28After this conversation, HR took the complainant back down to the car-park for a walk and to throw some rubbish out and noticed a car parked in front of two garages on the left hand side of the car-park.  He asked his neighbour if anyone owned the car and was told no-one knew who owned it and that it was blocking the garage of his neighbour who needed access to it.  He recorded the car's registration.  It was a grey Mazda 3 sedan.  He did not remember seeing it when he went down to look for his daughter in the first instance but did not positively remember that it was not there.
29HR's neighbour rang triple 0 to complain that a car was parked blocking his garage.  The call was played to the jury (exhibit D).  The neighbour also told the operator that someone had ""teased"" one of his neighbour's daughters.  HR gave evidence that his neighbour rang his doorbell to tell him a man had come to collect the car.  HR rushed back down and saw one man driving the car away.  The neighbour rang triple 0 again and reported the assault on the complainant.
30In chief, HR was asked if the complainant or CL told him anything about the man on the evening of the incident.  HR said ""About tattoos.  She mentioned about that and about the rings on eyebrows or something like that"" (27/9/12 T.114).  He said he thought that she told him when they were in the car.  He could not remember what CL told him about the man.  In cross-examination he said that the complainant told him about the piercings on the man's upper lip on the right side and about the tattoo on the man's right arm.  
31CL's father, SL, gave evidence consistent with HR's.  He said he could not recall which of the children gave the ""exact"" description because the children were talking together at the same time.  He made out that the man ""was wearing shorts and he was wearing I think a blue t-shirt or something ... and he had some piercing in his face, yeah, and some don't know a tattoo or so"" (27/9/12 T.130).
32Detective James gave evidence of responding to the triple 0 call.  He said that the complainant told him ""The man pulled my pants down.  He touched my privates.  He had pictures on his arms and three piercings on his face"" (T.137-138).  In cross-examination he agreed that a police ""SIDS"" record relating to the incident contained a description of a person of interest as ""tattoos on his right arm ... wearing white t-shirt with black pattern ... three piercings on right ear ... shorts and shoes"" (27/9/12 T.140-141).  In re-examination Detective James said that he had not been told anything about the earrings over the radio.  
33The applicant, who was aged 20 at the time,  was interviewed at the Auburn Police Station on the afternoon of 9 February 2011 by Senior Constable Williams, who had interviewed the complainant and CL, and Constable Bingham.  The ERISP was played for the jury (T.200 - exhibit J).
34In the ERISP the applicant appears to have dark, or very tanned skin, at least as dark as that of the complainant at the time of her interview on 7 February 2011.  In that regard the trial judge in her summing up said that his skin was ""much darker than the complainant at the time"" (SU 17).
35Other matters to emerge from the ERISP are that the applicant appears to be of average build, his hair was very short almost shaved and could not be described as ""spikey"".  He was wearing a white t-shirt with reflective silver writing on it.  He had words tattooed on the length of both sides of both forearms and across both hands.  He did not appear to have any band tattooed around his upper arms.  He appeared to have an earring in his right ear and he had a distinctive mole in the centre of his forehead.
36Most particularly, the ERISP showed that the applicant had three diamond like dermal implants, running from the corner of his left eye to the top of his cheekbone, extending for a distance of about 1-1 ½ inches (2.5-3.8 cms).  The top diamond implant is the largest in size, the second is smaller and the third is smaller again.  The applicant appeared to have no other jewellery on his face and no piercings were obvious.
37In the interview the applicant said he could not remember his movements on Sunday, 6 February 2011 (i.e., three days before the interview).  The applicant said his mate, Hussein or ""anyone"", could have had his car on that day.  He would not provide police with the last name of Hussein.  Later in the interview the applicant said that he did not drive or use the car at all.  He said that his family (his mother, uncle and brother) and Huss and a couple of other boys normally used the car.
38Towards the end of the interview, the applicant said that police were saying that his car was there at the relevant time but it had ""nothing to do with me because the car's not under my name and like everyone, a lot of people use that car you know what I mean"".  Correspondence and papers in the name of the applicant from the time period around February 2011 were located by police when the car was searched.  
Ground 1 - The trial was not conducted according to law because the complainant and other child witness CL were not competent to give unsworn evidence.
39In order to understand the submissions, it is necessary to set out s13 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and the evidence which was adduced from the complainant and CL in relation to their capacity to give evidence.
40Section 13 relevantly provided:
""13(1)   A person is not competent to give evidence about a fact if, for any reason (including a mental, intellectual or physical disability):
(a) the person does not have the capacity to understand a question about the fact, or (b)  the person does not have the capacity to give an answer that can be understood to a question about the fact,
and that incapacity cannot be overcome.
(2)   A person who, because of subsection (1), is not competent to give evidence about a fact may be competent to give evidence about other facts.
(3)   A person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is not competent to give sworn evidence about the fact if the person does not have the capacity to understand that, in giving evidence, he or she is under an obligation to give truthful evidence.
(4)   A person who is not competent to give sworn evidence about a fact may, subject to subsection (5), be competent to give unsworn evidence about the fact.
(5)   A person who, because of subsection (3), is not competent to give sworn evidence is competent to give unsworn evidence if the court has told the person:
(a)   that it is important to tell the truth, and (b)   that he or she may be asked questions that he or she does not know, or cannot remember, the answer to, and that he or she should tell the court if this occurs, and (c)   that he or she may be asked questions that suggest certain statements are true or untrue and that he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true and should feel no pressure to agree with statements that he or she believes are untrue. (6)   It is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a person is not incompetent because of this section.
...
(8)   For the purpose of determining a question arising under this section, the court may inform itself as it thinks fit, including by obtaining information from a person who has relevant specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience.""
41The relevant parts of the transcript are:
""HER HONOUR:  Well, the question is does the witness[understand] what ""under an obligation to give truthful evidence"" is.  Now, how is that elicited from a child?  I'm thinking might it be better that I actually watch some of the interview and ask some questions, because how am I going to assess her sophistication by just asking those questions that are routinely asked, really, to fit within the exception under s 13(5) I mean, have you got suggestions?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  No, no, I agree with that.  I think your Honour should watch at least part of the recorded interview with the child, and then your Honour should explore the likelihood that she would give evidence unsworn.  The likelihood is that she wouldn't be able to be give sworn evidence. 
HER HONOUR:  No, but in reality, even though the authorities say age alone is not sufficient, because every age - a person is assumed to be competent.  So I must actually have some other method assessing her.  Do you agree, Ms Hall, with all of this?
HALL:  I do.
HER HONOUR:  Yes  Should I ask her just a few questions, preliminary, just perhaps to make her feel comfortable?  Unfortunately, I can't sit beyond 4.00 this afternoon for other reasons but I can certainly watch some of the interview tomorrow morning before coming back on.  But if I ask her some questions now just to - or should I watch it in court now for ten minutes and then ask her some questions?  I don't mind either way.  Would that be sufficient, do you think?  Ten minutes?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I would have thought if you watched it for ten minutes, you would get a feel for how she is.
...
HER HONOUR:  I might just ask things like, ""Do you understand what obligation to give truthful evidence is?""  That might be some way of - well, that's a test.

CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Would your Honour be assisted by a transcript?
HER HONOUR:  I think that might be enough.  If you can just stop that now.  Can we switch through to [the complainant].
...""
(After some preliminary questions and remarks to put the complainant at ease, the following exchange took place between her Honour and the complainant.) 
""HER HONOUR:  Do you understand that it's very serious though.  Even though it's - it's quite serious.
COMPLAINANT:  Yeah.
HER HONOUR:  What you're going to be asked about.  How old are you today?
COMPLAINANT:  Eight.
...
HER HONOUR:  Sorry, XXX.  You're going to be asked questions about what you told the police lady a couple of years ago.
COMPLAINANT:  Yeah.
HER HONOUR:  You know that.  Do you understand what telling the truth is?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.
HER HONOUR:  But you don't understand what the word ""obligation"" is, do you?
COMPLAINANT:  No.
HER HONOUR:  You understand it's important to tell the truth.  Do you know why it's important to tell the truth?
COMPLAINANT:  No.
...

HER HONOUR:  If you're asked a question tomorrow and you don't know the answer, then what do you think you should say?  Say I say to you, ""What's 25 multiplied by 50?""
COMPLAINANT:  I don't know.
...
HER HONOUR:  ""I don't know.""  Right.  So if you're asked a question tomorrow about something that happened some time ago, those things that happened downstairs that you say that happened when you dropped the ball - remember those things?
COMPLAINANT:  Yeah.  
HER HONOUR:  So if you're asked a question and you don't know the answer, what will you say?
COMPLAINANT:  I don't know.
HER HONOUR:  You know that that's okay to say that, don't you?
COMPLAINANT:  Mm-hmm.  
HER HONOUR:  It's okay to say, ""I don't know.""  Is that okay?  You know that?  If you're asked a question and you can't remember the answer, you can't remember what happened, what do you think you should say to that?
COMPLAINANT:  I don't remember.
HER HONOUR:  That's very good.  That's what you should say.  It doesn't matter if you don't remember.  You understand that, don't you?  It doesn't matter if you [don't] know or you don't remember.
COMPLAINANT:  Yeah.  
HER HONOUR:  What if someone asks you a question, but you don't agree with it?  Say someone says, ""Your top is red?"" what do you say?
COMPLAINANT:  No.  
HER HONOUR: You say, ""No.  My top's blue.""  That's what you'd say, wouldn't you?
COMPLAINANT:  Yeah.  
HER HONOUR:  Do you understand that you can do that when you're asked questions?
COMPLAINANT:  Yeah.  
HER HONOUR:  Even if it's by a lady in a wig and who looks quite maybe serious.  Do you understand that?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.  
HER HONOUR:  You understand that if someone says to you, ""Your top is red,"" it's very important that if you don't believe that, that you should say so.  Do you understand that?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.  
HER HONOUR:  So if someone asks you questions - it's not just about silly things like your top, the colour of your top, but about what happened a couple of years ago, and you don't agree with what the question is, it's important that you don't have to agree.  You understand that, that you don't have to agree with what's in the question.  Do you understand what I'm saying or am I being a bit - going on too long?  What does that nod mean?
COMPLAINANT:  I understand.
HER HONOUR:  So you understand that you are under no pressure to agree with anything that's asked of you.  Do you understand that?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.  
HER HONOUR:  Mr Crown, do you think I've asked enough questions or is there some aspect  
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I don't know whether your Honour has covered 5A.  It's important to tell the truth.
HER HONOUR:  I thought I - yes, the most important, Mr Crown.  I might have overlooked that one.  XXX, do you understand that even though you don't have to agree with everything, and if you've forgotten something, you have to say you forgot it, and if you don't agree, you can say you don't agree, but do you understand that the most important thing is that you must tell the truth.  Do you understand that?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.
HER HONOUR:  Even if you don't know why that is but you understand that you must tell the truth.  Do you understand that?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.  
HER HONOUR:  You know it's very important that you tell the truth, do you?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.  
HER HONOUR:  Okay.  So what's the most important thing when you're answering questions tomorrow, when the lady with the wig and the glasses asks you questions?  What's the most important thing, do you think?
COMPLAINANT:  Um.
HER HONOUR:  Well, just tell me any of the things that you think, if you can remember, tomorrow, what you should do when you're asked questions tomorrow.
COMPLAINANT:  Telling the truth.
HER HONOUR:  That's right.  That's very good.  And there are some other things.  That's the most important.
..."" (25.9.2012 - T.51-55)
42Her Honour then delivered a brief judgment as follows:
""HER HONOUR:  Yes.  I am satisfied that although XXX is not competent under s 13, she fits within the exception under s 13(5) and is able to give unsworn evidence under that section.  I think it is 13(5), isn't it?  I had better use the right words, all right.  I was just trying to --
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  13(3), I think.
HER HONOUR:  Sorry.  Is it 13(3)?
...
HER HONOUR:  No, no.  I'm sure you're right.  Yes.  I find that under s 13(1) XXX is not competent to give evidence but is competent to give unsworn evidence under s 13 --
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  13(3).""  (25.9.2012 - T.55.21)

43In relation to the witness CL, the following evidence was adduced as to his competence.
""HER HONOUR:  I'll take ten minutes to go through these steps, then half an hour and any further questions, it will be close to 4.00.  So don't worry about it.

Q.  So what would you say if I said, ""Chris, can you tell me the date of Monday of this week?"" what would you say?CL.  I don't know.

45Her Honour gave a brief judgment in relation to the competency of CL:
""HER HONOUR:  I find under s 13 (1) that CL is not competent to give sworn evidence, but under s 13(3) that he is competent to give unsworn evidence.""  (26.9.2012 - T.90.36)
Submissions as to Ground 1
46The applicant submitted that in order for a witness to be competent to give unsworn evidence the Court must first conclude that the witness was not competent to give sworn evidence because the witness did not have the capacity to understand that in giving evidence he or she was under an obligation to give truthful evidence (Evidence Act 1995 - s13(3)).  He submitted that the starting point when assessing competence to give sworn evidence under s13(3) was the presumption that unless the contrary was proved, a person is not incompetent because of that section (s13(6)).
47The applicant submitted that if a prospective witness was found not competent to give sworn evidence, before being competent to give unsworn evidence that witness must also be given the directions required by s13(5) in full.  He submitted that both the finding of incompetence to give sworn evidence and compliance with s13(5) were strict requirements.  If either was not complied with, the witness will not be competent, the trial will not have been ""conducted according to law"" and any resulting conviction must be set aside (SH v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 79; 83 NSWLR 258 at [35] per Basten JA (Blanch and Hall JJ agreeing).
48Applying those principles to the facts of this case, the applicant submitted that neither the complainant nor CL were competent to give unsworn evidence because it had not been proved that they were not competent to give sworn evidence and in any event, in relation to both children, s13(5) was not fully complied with.
49By reference to the complainant, the applicant submitted that the three questions directed to her competence to give sworn evidence did not comply with s13(3).  Those questions were:
""HER HONOUR:  ... Do you understand what telling the truth is?
COMPLAINANT:  Yes.
HER HONOUR:  But you don't understand what the word ""obligation"" is, do you?
COMPLAINANT:  No.
HER HONOUR:  You understand it's important to tell the truth.  Do you know why it's important to tell the truth?
COMPLAINANT:  No.""  (See [39], p15 hereof)
50The complainant was aged 6 years and 7 months at the time of the offence and 8 years and 2 months at the time of trial.  The applicant accepted that her Honour had watched some 10 minutes of the complainant's record of interview made 19 months prior to trial.  The applicant noted that it was not clear what, if any, effect watching this material had had on her Honour.  In that regard, the applicant further noted that in MFI 2 (the complainant's interview of 6.02.2011) the following questions and answers were given:
""Q.27 ...  And what happens when somebody tells a lie?COMPLAINANT:  Umm, you get a punishment from ...
Q.28 You what, sorry?COMPLAINANT:  You get a punishment from God.
Q.29 Okay, so it's very important today that we only talk about the truth, which is things that really happened.COMPLAINANT:  Okay.""
51In relation to CL, the applicant submitted that the sequence of questioning was important.  CL was aged 8 years and 10 months at the time of trial.  The applicant submitted that her Honour appeared to have assumed that he was not competent to give sworn evidence and proceeded to ask a number of questions in accordance with s13(5).  It was only when that process was completed and when prompted by the Crown, that the following exchange took place between her Honour and CL:
""CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I may have missed it, your Honour, but subs (3) of s 13 requires your Honour to form a view about the obligation to give truthful evidence.
HER HONOUR:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr Crown.
Q.  CL, do you understand what these words mean, that you are under an obligation to give truthful evidence?  Do you know what those words mean?CL.  No.""  (See [41] p 20-21 hereof)
52The applicant noted that her Honour then gave judgment as to CL's competence to give evidence (see [43] hereof).
53The applicant submitted that the process followed by her Honour did not comply with s13. In that regard he relied upon that which was said by Campbell JA (with whom Latham and Price JJ agreed) in RJ v R [2010] NSWCCA 263 at [22] - [23]:
""22  A feature of the way section 13 operates, which is important for the present case, is that the occasion for telling a potential witness the things listed in paras (a) (b) and (c) of section 13(5) only arises if the judge has first decided that the person is not competent to give sworn evidence.
23  An effect of section 13(7) is that (as happened in Pease v R [2009] NSWCCA 136) a judge might be able to satisfy himself or herself of the matters necessary to decide whether a presumption of competency under section 13 has been displaced by listening to a recording of a police interview with the child. Even if an informal method of proof such as is permitted by section 13(7) were used, it would still be necessary for the judge to address the question posed by section 13(1) before finding that a person was not competent to give evidence about a particular fact, and to address the test posed by section 13(3) before finding that a person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is not competent to give sworn evidence about that fact.""
The applicant submitted that because her Honour did not follow the specified process of reasoning in relation to CL, the requirements of s13 were not met so that by allowing CL to give unsworn evidence, the trial miscarried.
54The applicant submitted that in addition, the questions asked by her Honour did not involve an assessment in accordance with s13(1) and 13(3) because her Honour had simply used the terminology in s13(3) when testing the capacity of the complainant and CL and did not otherwise make any assessment of their competence.  The applicant submitted that this was contrary to the observations of Latham J (McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing) in R v RAG [2006] NSWCCA 343 where her Honour criticised the trial judge's complicated and abstract questioning of a child witness, including asking the child to define ""truth"" and ""lie"", in order to determine her competence to give unsworn evidence.  It was held that it was not necessary for a child to be able to define ""truth"" and ""lie"" or other abstract concepts in order to demonstrate the ability to tell the difference between the two.
55The applicant submitted that in this case it was erroneous for her Honour to base her findings that the child witnesses were not competent to give sworn evidence on their inability to understand the meaning of the precise words of s13(3).  The applicant submitted that her Honour should have made further inquiries in simple and direct terms as to the witness' understanding of their obligation.  The applicant sought to contrast the questions put by her Honour with those of the police interviewers some 19 months previously when both children, then much younger, expressed an understanding of significant consequences if they told lies.  The applicant submitted that in the circumstances  the child witnesses were not given an opportunity to demonstrate their competence.
56The applicant submitted that s13(5) had not been complied with.  He submitted that even if it had been proved on the balance of probabilities that both children were not competent to give sworn evidence, there had not been a compliance with s13(5) and as a result, the evidence of both child witnesses was given contrary to law.
57The applicant submitted that s13(5) required the court to tell the complainant and CL six things:
(1)That it is important to tell the truth (s13(5)(a)).
(2)That he or she may be asked questions that he or she does not know the answer to and that he or she should tell the court if this happens (s13(5)(b)).
(3)That he or she may be asked questions that he or she cannot remember the answer to and that he or she should tell the court if this occurs (s13(5)(b)).
(4)That he or she may be asked questions that suggest certain statements are true or untrue (s13(5)(c)).
(5)That he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true (s13(5)(c)).
(6)That he or she should feel no pressure to agree with statements that he or she believes are untrue (s13(5)(c)).
58In support of that submission the applicant relied upon SH at [11] where Basten JA said:
""11 Dealing with the content of paragraph (c), it appears that there are two limbs to the required instruction, each involving the idea of a 'suggestion', reflecting a common form of cross-examination. The prospective witness is advised to agree with those suggestions which he or she thinks are true, but ""should feel no pressure to agree with"" statements believed to be false.""
The applicant submitted that in this case her Honour did not tell the complainant or CL that they should agree with the suggested statements which they thought were true.  The applicant submitted that her Honour also failed to tell the children, as required by s13(5)(c), that they may be asked questions that suggest certain statements were true or untrue.
59In relation to the s13(1) and s13(3) issue, the Crown submitted that her Honour under s13(8) was able to inform herself as she thought fit when determining the competence issue.  The Crown noted that her Honour had watched a portion of the complainant's recorded interview with the police for the purpose of assisting her in making that assessment.  The Crown had regard to the questions specifically put to the complainant in terms of s13(3).  By reference to those matters, the Crown submitted that the determination by the judge of whether the complainant was not competent to give sworn evidence was a matter of judgment and inevitably included assessment and impression.  On that issue, the Crown relied upon what was said by Grove J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Buddin J agreed) in Pease v R [2009] NSWCCA 136 at [8] - [11]:
""8  The issue of testimony from the complainant was raised before the learned trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor correctly informed him that it would be necessary to determine whether the complainant was competent to give sworn evidence, and, if not, whether she could give unsworn evidence as sanctioned by s13. His Honour was authorized to investigate the matter as he saw fit: s13 (7). 
9  His Honour first listened to an audio recording of an interview of the complainant by police. Near the conclusion of that interview she was asked some questions about ""telling lies"", ""fibbing"" and ""telling the truth."" After listening to the recording his Honour then asked a series of questions of the complainant (transcript 18 September 2007 pp 8-10). 
10  The material showed that the complainant understood the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie, but it is apparent from the terms of s13(1) and 13(2) that there is a difference between being able to discriminate between telling the truth and telling a lie, and understanding the obligation to give truthful evidence. 
11  The determination required by s 13(1) is a matter of judgment and inevitably includes assessment and impression. His Honour was able to listen to the complainant being interviewed and to observe her demeanour as she responded to his questioning. Although, as I have said, it would be erroneous to assume incapacity only by reason of age, it would nevertheless be potentially relevant to make an assessment of maturity. Nowhere did he say that he presumed that she was incapable simply because of her age and there is no reason to infer that he did. It has not been shown that his Honour's discretionary judgment has miscarried.""
60The Crown submitted that her Honour had the benefit of being able to watch the complainant's demeanour when answering questions in the police interview and also when responding to her own questioning.  She was able to make an assessment of any changes she could observe in the complainant between the time of the police interview and giving evidence before her and make an assessment of her overall maturity.  The Crown submitted that importantly, at the time of giving her evidence, the complainant had indicated to her Honour that she did not understand why it was important to tell the truth.  
61The Crown submitted that as a result there was material upon which it was open to her Honour to be satisfied that the presumption of competency under s13(5) had been displaced.  The Crown noted that there were no submissions made by the Crown or the applicant's counsel at trial to the contrary.
62In relation to CL, the Crown noted that he was aged just over 7 years when he was initially interviewed by police on 8 February 2011 and at the time of giving evidence was aged 8 years and 10 months.  The Crown noted that as in the case of the complainant, her Honour watched a portion of CL's recorded interview with the police for the purpose of informing herself on the issue of competence.  In his recorded interview, CL had been asked what happens if someone tells a lie and he responded ""You're in trouble"".
63The Crown submitted that her Honour had the significant benefit, which this Court does not have, of making an assessment of the maturity of CL when answering her questions.  In that regard, the Crown drew attention to the following exchange between her Honour and CL:
""HER HONOUR:  Q:  Do you know it's very important why you're here today?CL.  No.""
64The Crown accepted that it was only after it was pointed out to her Honour that she needed to form a view about the capacity of CL to understand that he was under an obligation to give truthful evidence that her Honour asked CL the following questions:
""Q.  CL do you understand what these words mean, that you are under an obligation to give truthful evidence.  Do you know what those words mean?CL:  No.""
The Crown submitted that despite the sequence in which questions were put to CL, there was material upon which it was open to her Honour to be satisfied that the presumption of competency under s13(5) had been displaced. The Crown submitted that even if the sequence of questioning was important, it was still open to her Honour on the basis of the questions which she had asked before using the words in s13(3) to reach an opinion as to CL's competency to give sworn evidence.
65In relation to compliance with s13(5) the Crown submitted that a proper reading of the questions put by her Honour to the complainant, in particular that even though she did not have to agree with everything which was suggested to her,  the most important thing is that she must tell the truth, were sufficient to satisfy the section.  The Crown submitted that the only matter relied upon by the applicant was that the complainant was not specifically told that she should agree with suggestions that were true if she believed them to be true.  The Crown submitted that the effect of SH was that s13(5)(c) did not impose an obligation to give instruction in a particular form, but to a ""particular effect"".  The Crown submitted that this had been achieved by her Honour's questions, in particular the emphasis on the need to tell the truth.
66The Crown submitted that while her Honour did not say to the complainant, that if a suggestion were made to her that she believed was true, she should agree with it, that information was conveyed by her Honour when the effect of other statements was taken into account.
67The Crown made the same submission in relation to CL.
Consideration
68I have a concern about the process followed by her Honour in relation to the conclusion that the complainant and CL lacked the capacity to give sworn evidence.  I appreciate that as in Pease, her Honour had watched some 10 minutes of the record of interview made by each of the children some 19 months before the trial.  When giving her reasons, however, her Honour made no reference to any aspect of what she had seen.  One is left with an impression that the primary basis for her Honour's conclusion were the questions which she put to the child witnesses.
69Those questions are also a cause for concern.  In the case of both the complainant and CL, they were brief in the extreme and expressed in terms of s13(3).  In the case of the complainant, the abstract proposition was put as to whether she knew the meaning of the word ""obligation"".  To the extent that there was any investigation of the complainant's understanding of the test in s13(3), it comprised the question ""Do you know why it's important to tell the truth?"".  In accordance with the guidance provided in RAG, I am of the opinion that some further testing of the child witness' understanding of the obligation to give truthful evidence should have been carried out by the use of simple and concrete terminology, such as that described in that case.
70In the case of CL, there is the additional problem of the sequence of reasoning.  As was pointed out by the applicant in submissions and by reference to the analysis of s13 in both RJ and SH, the section is expressed in obligatory terms and requires a sequential mode of reasoning for there to be compliance with it.  In the case of CL, as was properly conceded by the Crown, that sequential mode of reasoning did not take place.  Her Honour proceeded directly to the s13(5) issue and only engaged in the preliminary but mandatory investigation as to competency to give sworn evidence, when reminded by the Crown.  It was implicit in her Honour's approach that she had already reached a conclusion as to competency to give sworn evidence on the part of CL well before she asked the question expressed in terms of s13(3) to which reference has already been made.
71It is, however, unnecessary to reach a conclusion on those matters.  I have raised them not only in deference to the careful submissions made by the applicant, but also to note the concerns which I have as to the process which was followed by her Honour in determining the important preliminary issue of whether a witness was competent to give sworn evidence.
72A decision on that issue is unnecessary because there was a failure by her Honour to comply with the provisions of s13(5)(c).  The requirement of that subsection is clear.  The court is obliged to tell the potential witness ""that he or she may be asked questions that suggest certain statements are true or untrue and that he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true and should not feel pressure to agree with statements that he or she believes are untrue"".  Her Honour failed to give effect to the requirement to tell the child witnesses that he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true.  The important qualification to those ""statements"" is that they form parts of questions that suggest that they are either true or untrue.  That is a qualitatively different proposition to a simple admonition that in giving evidence a proposed witness should tell the truth.
73The requirement for strict compliance with the ""effect"" of s13(5) was stated in SH as follows:
""8 This ambiguity is to be resolved in favour of the conclusion that there is no discretionary power to refuse to allow a child to give unsworn evidence, if the court is satisfied as to the capacity to understand a question and give a comprehensible answer, in accordance with sub-s (1). That conclusion follows from both the structure of the section and by reading sub-ss (4) and (5) together. Thus, sub-s (5) does not use equivocal language, but, subject to identified preconditions, states that a person who is not competent to give sworn evidence ""is"" competent to give unsworn evidence. That language, together with the absence of any attempt to specify criteria relevant to the exercise of a discretion, demonstrate that no discretionary power was intended.
...
11 Dealing with the content of paragraph (c), it appears that there are two limbs to the required instruction, each involving the idea of a 'suggestion', reflecting a common form of cross-examination. The prospective witness is advised to agree with those suggestions which he or she thinks are true, but ""should feel no pressure to agree with"" statements believed to be false.
12 ... That report provides limited guidance, but the idea behind the provision is tolerably clear: it is designed to limit the danger that persons with a limited understanding of the concept of truth telling may be confused or intimidated by the fact that a person with apparent authority is seeking agreement to a proposition. Similar concerns underlay the formulation of the rules for interrogation of Aboriginal persons in R v Anunga (1976) 11 ALR 412 (Forster J). Forster J noted the difficulty in dealing with people who do not understand English very well, a remark which also applies in respect of the language used in courts. His Honour continued at 414:

""Another matter which needs to be understood is that most Aboriginal people are basically courteous and polite and will answer questions by white people in the way in which they think the questioner wants. Even if they are not courteous and polite there is the same reaction when they are dealing with an authority figure such as a policeman.""
13 Similar considerations may apply in respect of children. Although somewhat vaguely expressed, the key consideration underlying paragraph (c) appears to be a concern that the prospective witness should not feel under pressure to agree with statements put by adults in wigs and robes. Such instruction is required to be provided by the court, not by the person who is likely to be doing the questioning.
...
33 Despite the suggestion in the judgment on competence set out above, there is no doubt that the trial judge appreciated the need that he should give the instruction required by s13(5) and proceeded to do so. Although he did so by asking questions of the witness, that form of instruction should not be seen as inconsistent with the requirement of sub-s (5). However, what was missing from the final question in relation to suggestions was the exhortation not merely to say that a statement believed to be untrue is wrong, but that the witness ""should feel no pressure to agree"" with such a statement.
34 In my view that omission was a failure to comply strictly with the terms of sub-s (5). However, given the passage from the examination by counsel for the prosecution set out at [28] above in relation to not feeling under any pressure ""because we are grown-ups in funny clothes"", it is difficult to conclude that there was any substantial miscarriage of justice resulting from that omission.
35 On the other hand, to seek to avoid the consequences of non-compliance would be inconsistent with the approach referred to in the authorities discussed above. If reliance upon the statement by the prosecutor in the course of asking questions of the witness on the voir dire were to be treated as an adequate compliance with sub-s (5) in one respect, it would be difficult to draw a line in respect of other requirements of sub-s (5). On the other hand, ignoring the part played by the prosecutor, it would be difficult to draw a line based on the omission by the trial judge of some element of the instruction, as opposed to other elements. Rather than take such a course, the appropriate conclusion is that the complainant was not competent to give unsworn evidence because, it having been concluded that she did not have sufficient capacity to understand the obligation to tell the truth, she was not given the directions required by s13(5) in full. In the words of Doyle CJ in Starrett, the trial was not conducted according to law, as was the appellant's entitlement, and accordingly the conviction should be set aside.""
74A similar situation to that identified in SH has arisen here.  Ground of Appeal 1 has been made out on the basis that s13(5) of the Evidence Act 1995, in respect of the complainant and CL, has not been complied with.  It therefore follows that the trial was not conducted according to law, as was the applicant's entitlement, and accordingly the conviction should be set aside.
Ground 2 - The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
75The applicant submitted that the conflicts in testimony and inconsistencies in the description and identification of the applicant as the person who assaulted the complainant were such that the verdict against him was unreasonable.  
76The applicant sought to establish that proposition by a detailed analysis of the identification evidence.  He noted that in her record of interview, the complainant said that the man who assaulted her was white skinned, was skinny, had short black hair, wore black shorts and a white t-shirt with black writing, had three ""the things you put on your ears"" on his cheek, which she identified to be in the middle of her cheek above the lip and next to her nose, and that otherwise she did not remember any other marks or earrings.  The applicant submitted that the complainant did not describe anything that could have been tattoos, she did not describe someone with dark or tanned skin, she did not describe any notable moles or marks on the assailant's face and she did not describe diamond jewellery or piercings on the side of the face or near the eye.
77By reference to the complainant's evidence at trial, the applicant noted the following identification features:
The man had three pieces of silver jewellery above his lip or next to his mouth on his cheek that ranged in size.He was white skinned, having lighter skin than her.He had short dark hair.She could not remember if he had tattoos.He did not have any other marks on his face.
78The applicant noted that the complainant did not give any evidence as to whether it was a young man or an old man who assaulted her and gave no evidence as to whether a car was parked in the underground car-park at the time.  In that regard, the applicant submitted that according to her evidence of where the man took her, she would have walked past the Mazda if it were parked in the same location as it was found to be later in the day.  The applicant noted that the complainant gave no evidence that the man had tattoos on his hands.
79In relation to CL, the applicant submitted that the combined effect of his evidence, both at trial and in his police interview was as follows:
Short-sleeved blue shirt and brown shorts.Had a diamond above or next to his right eyebrow.Spikey black hair.Was tall.Was a little bit fat.Had no other marks on his face.Had a picture tattoo that looped around his upper right arm.Had no tattoos on his left arm or hands.
80The applicant submitted that the only identification evidence of CL which was consistent with that of the complainant was that the assailant had jewellery of some kind somewhere on his face, had black hair, had no other marks on his face and had no tattoos on his hands or left arm.
81HR's recollection of the complainant's description to him of her assailant was a man with a tattoo on his right arm, three piercings on his right upper lip (this changed to ""rings on eyebrows or something like that"" by the time he gave evidence two years later), a t-shirt with black shorts and shoes.  The evidence of CL's father was similar to that of HR.
82Taking those identification elements into account, the applicant submitted that most of them were inconsistent with his appearance.  He submitted that the following matters were not disputed and that taken together demonstrated the weakness of the Crown identification case:
He did not have white skin.He did not have piercings in his lip.He did not have piercings in his cheek near the mouth.He did not have piercings in the eyebrow or forehead.He did not have silver piercings.He did not have ring piercings.He did not have a single diamond in or above the eyebrow.He did have tattoos on the left arm and his tattoos consisted of writing.He did have tattoos on his hand.  He did not have a band tattoo on his upper right bicep.He did not have spikey hair.He was not particularly tall.He did have other marks on his face, being a prominent mole on his forehead and an earring.
83The applicant submitted that it was only when the identification evidence was treated with a level of generality which ignored specific details that it was consistent with his appearance.  He did have black hair and he did have three facial piercings of different sizes.  He was prepared to accept that the facial piercings were unique but stressed that they were not in any of the locations described by the witnesses, nor were they silver, nor rings, nor was there a diamond in the eyebrow.  He submitted that his tattoos were entirely inconsistent with the descriptions given by the complainant and CL.  He submitted that his tattoos and his dermal implants were both extremely distinctive.  In particular, the diamonds descended from the corner of his eye like teardrops.  He submitted that if he were the assailant, the omission to describe these very distinctive features, i.e. the tattoos and the dermal implants, was a significant omission.
84The applicant submitted that there were other persons who could have been the assailant.  He identified Mr Stapleton, whose fingerprint was taken from the bathroom door in the car-park.  Mr Stapleton's evidence was that he had worked in strata complexes, but he did not know whether he had ever worked in that building.  He had tattoos which the applicant submitted met the general description of those described by CL.  The applicant submitted that there was no evidence led as to whether any of his male friends or family had access to his car or had facial piercings or dermal implants.  The applicant submitted that there was no evidence led as to how many people in Sydney might have facial jewellery like his.  The applicant submitted that many of the physical features of the man who collected the Mazda, as described by the adult men who spoke with him, matched some of the identification features described by the complainant and CL. 
85The applicant noted that none of the adults was able to identify him from a photo array as the man who collected the car and that it was the Crown case that it was not him who collected the car.
86The applicant submitted that when taken at a level of generality, some of the identification evidence was consistent with him.  He submitted that on a careful analysis of that evidence, it could be shown that it was inconsistent with him in significant respects.  He submitted that even the evidence as to piercings could only be accepted if CL's evidence were rejected entirely.  He submitted that to find that the assailant's description matched his piercings, assumed that the complainant was wrong in her various descriptions of the piercings in other significant respects.  
87In relation to his ownership of the Mazda, the applicant submitted that the man who collected the car at the scene of the assault was selling handbags.  There was no other evidence as to why the vehicle would be in that area.  The applicant noted that the only evidence that the man who collected the car said he was collecting it ""for a friend"" was given by Mr Kharde, another resident of the unit complex, and that this evidence at trial contradicted his witness statement and the statement of others present when the car was collected.
88The applicant submitted that the highest that the ""Mazda evidence"" went was that he owned the vehicle, that it was left at or near the scene of the assault around about the time of the assault and was removed by a man other than him.  The vehicle was later found in the possession of his uncle and mother and contained documents and letters addressed to him and others who shared his address.
89The applicant submitted that the presence of the Mazda at the premises did not establish that he was there at the time.  He submitted that at no time did the Crown establish any motive for why he would be at those premises at that time.  He submitted that the presence of the person who was selling bags and who was observed to drive the Mazda away from the premises provided an adequate explanation for why the car was there.  He submitted that this explanation for the presence of the Mazda was consistent with him not being there.  He submitted that the presence of the person selling bags was not suggestive of someone there to pick up the car but of someone utilising the car to carry around a suitcase of bags.
90The Crown submitted that there was no issue that the complainant had been pulled to a dark area under the apartment block by a stranger and that he had committed the sexual acts which she described.  The issue at trial was the identity of the relevant offender.  The Crown submitted that this was adequately established by the circumstantial evidence.
91The Crown submitted that there was no issue that a car owned by the applicant was parked across the front of two garages in the bottom area of the complainant's unit block at about the same as the incident occurred.  There was evidence that the car owned by the applicant was seen at that location immediately after the incident by CL's father.  He described seeing the car when he came down the stairs immediately after CL had come to the apartment and told him that the complainant was missing (27.09.2012, T.132-133).
92Shortly after the incident, the complainant told the first police officer who attended, that the man ""had pictures on his arms and three piercings in his face"" (27.09.2012, T.138.1).
93In a recorded interview with police the next day the complainant described the following:
""A.366 And ah he had a, one of things you put on our ears.  Umm there was one big one and one little medium and one small.
Q.367 And where did he have those?A.  On the cheek.
Q.368 Oh, okay and how many did he have did you say?A.  Three.""  
94During the appeal the Court had the benefit of observing a DVD of the complainant answering those questions.  When the complainant referred to the ""cheek"", she demonstrated where the three items were on the cheek starting higher up on her cheek and then moving towards the lip.  During the trial when giving evidence, the complainant agreed that she had told her father after the incident that the man had three bits of jewellery on his top lip (26.09.2012, T.79).
95In re-examination she was asked to identify on her face where the jewellery was on the man's face and she pointed to her left cheek area.  The Court was able to also observe the DVD of the complainant giving this evidence.  What is clear from that DVD is that the complainant was moving her finger up and down on the left cheek opposite the nose and higher than the lip when giving that evidence.
96In re-examination the following evidence was given:
""Q.  XXX was it one piece of jewellery that was on the face or was it a number of pieces or you don't remember?A.  There were three pieces.
Q.  Did they range in size?  Were they all the same?A.  No.  They range in size.""  (26.09.2012, T.85.1)
97The Crown submitted that the difference in the descriptions by the complainant and CL was readily explained because the complainant had an opportunity to observe the man for much longer than CL and at much closer proximity.  In contrast, CL only saw the man briefly when he was told by him to go and pick up some leaves.  
98Even so the Crown noted that CL in his interview with police on 8 February 2011 described the man as having a diamond and pointed to a location just above the eyebrow.  In cross-examination at trial, he demonstrated on his face where the diamond had been.  He described it as being ""up and next to"" the eyebrow (26.09.2012, T.99).  The Court has had the benefit of viewing the DVD of CL giving this evidence.  What he demonstrated was not that the diamond was actually pierced through the eyebrow itself but was next to the eye.  The Crown submitted that the importance of the evidence of CL was that it confirmed the presence of facial jewellery on the assailant and that it described that jewellery as a diamond.  
99The Crown submitted that discrepancies between the evidence of the complainant and CL on the one hand and the appearance of the applicant on the other were readily explained. Given that the complainant was taken to a dark place, and would have been primarily looking at the assailant's face, she would not have had a good opportunity to view his skin colour.  In addition, it was clear from her evidence that she had difficulty answering questions about the colour of her own skin.  The Crown submitted that similar considerations applied even more to CL who had only brief contact with the assailant.
100The Crown submitted that there was evidence from others that initially the complainant had referred to the assailant having tattoos.  This evidence comprised that of the complainant's father and the first police officer she spoke to.  There was a reference to tattoos in the first triple 0 call.  The effect of the complainant's evidence at trial was that she could not remember if the man had pictures (tattoos) on his arms.
101The Crown submitted that the fact that the place where the assailant took the complainant was dark provided some explanation for why the facial jewellery would have stood out, but the tattoos which were in black ink writing might not.  The Crown submitted that allowance had to be made for the complainant's distressed state given the events which were occurring.  The Crown submitted that this provided an explanation for why some features would have been observed by her but not others.
102The Crown submitted that during the trial, the jury had the benefit of seeing witnesses such as Mr Stapleton.  The Crown noted that it was never suggested at trial that Mr Stapleton might have been the assailant.  Similarly, the Crown noted that it was never suggested at trial that the person who drove the Mazda away was the assailant.  The Crown also noted that one of the neighbours, Mr Kharde, gave the following evidence at trial:
""Q.  Did your friend Shankar then ask the man something about the car?A.  Yes, he did.  Because that person was staying there - he or his friend, I'm not sure, the word he used was that is not his car, but his friend has parked it and he has come to collect that car.""  (27.09.2012, T.166.7)
In referring to that evidence, the Crown accepted that Mr Kharde only gave evidence of this matter for the first time at the trial and had not mentioned it in his statement.
Consideration
103The principles to be applied by this Court when considering an unreasonable verdict ground are now well established.  In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) said in relation to the task of the Court of Criminal Appeal:
""11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""
104In Sami Kurdi v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 179 Bathurst CJ (with whom Hall and Harrison JJ agreed) said that in order to comply with M v The Queen:
""8 ... it is necessary for the Court to review the whole of the evidence available to the jury. That is not to say that a court of appeal conducts its own trial. The question which it must answer is whether it was open to the jury to reach the verdict which it in fact reached.  Further, as was pointed out in M v The Queen supra, the Court must pay full regard to the primacy of the jury as the fact-finding tribunal and to the fact that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the evidence.""
105In order to apply those principles, I have not only read the transcripts of evidence at trial but have also viewed the DVDs of the statements made by the complainant and CL and the DVDs of their evidence at trial.  Having done so I am firmly of the belief that despite the discrepancies in the identification evidence set out by the applicant, that it was well open for the jury to decide beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the person who assaulted the complainant.  My reasoning is as follows.
106The photographs taken of the applicant, after his arrest on 9 February (exhibit G), readily demonstrate that he had three diamanté studs, such as those that would be usually worn in the ears, embedded in his left cheek.  Those studs were located one beneath the other.  It can also be seen that in descending order there is a large diamanté, a medium and a smaller one.  This is a very striking feature of the applicant's face and it is fully consistent with the complainant's description when interviewed on the day following the assault.
107I note that at the trial the complainant was asked in cross-examination what colour the ""jewellery"" on the assailant's face was.  The complainant replied ""silver"".  This and the fact that the applicant at one point referred to the jewellery being on his lip were relied upon by the applicant as discrepancies in her evidence.  I do not agree.  When one looks at the photographs in exhibit G, the diamantes are consistent with the complainant's description of the colour silver.  It is difficult to see how else the colour could be described.  Far from the complainant's answer being taken as an assertion that the jewellery was made of the metal silver, it is clearly a description of the child's perception of the colour of the jewellery and in that regard, it is an accurate description of the colour.  Moreover, the DVD of the complainant giving this evidence shows her identifying the lower part of the cheek on the left side, just a little above the level of the mouth.  At no time did she indicated by gesture that the jewellery was in or on the lip of the assailant.
108The facial jewellery of the applicant was clearly distinctive.  In those circumstances, it was open to the jury to conclude based on their own experience, that three pieces of jewellery in descending order of size (large, medium and small) embedded in the cheek area of a male was relatively rare.  This was precisely what the complainant described the assailant as having and it was precisely what the applicant had. 
109When this is combined with the evidence that the applicant's car was in the garage area of the apartment block at the time of the incident, it presented a compelling circumstantial case supporting the proposition that the applicant was the assailant.  In that regard, the applicant was not assisted by his ERISP.  When asked on 9 February 2011, he could not remember his movements on Sunday 6 February, despite it being only three days earlier.
110The fact that neither the complainant nor CL was able to place the assailant's facial jewellery in precisely the correct location on his face is not determinative.  The location of those objects is really a matter of perspective, particularly in the case of a child.  The important consideration is that the complainant was definite that there were three such objects and that they were in a descending order of size and that they were on the assailant's cheek. 
111The large number of ""discrepancies"" identified by the applicant between the evidence of the complainant and CL and his photograph (see [82] hereof) is also not determinative.  On closer examination those discrepancies can be reduced to: skin colour, the location of the facial ornaments, the absence of spikey hair and an incorrect description of the applicant's tattoos.  As the Crown explained in its submissions, those ""discrepancies"" can be explained when one has regard to the circumstances in which the children saw the assailant, the brief period of such observations and the dark location to which the complainant was taken.
112As the Crown submitted, the difference in observations of the assailant by the complainant and CL is explained by the relatively brief exposure which CL had to him.  What is of particular significance, however, is that CL was able to say that the assailant had a diamond either over or next to his eye.  In later evidence, he put the diamond next to the right eye.  That is an important observation, given the unusual nature of such a facial decoration.  It provides important corroboration for the complainant's evidence, even though he did not recollect seeing three such objects.
113The similarity in the observations of the complainant and CL cannot be explained or dismissed as being at too high a level of generality.
114Criticism was levelled at the complainant's evidence on the basis that in her interview with the police she appeared to receive some prompting from her mother.  When assessing that criticism, it needs to be kept in mind that at the point in time when the interview took place, the applicant had not been interviewed and nothing was known of him or of his facial decoration.  Accordingly, any prompting given to the complainant by her mother could only have been based on information which the claimant had provided to her mother at an earlier point in time, but one which was still proximate to when the assault took place.
115Those matters persuade me that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant was the person who assaulted the complainant.  It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground of Appeal 3:  The trial miscarried by reason of the Crown and trial judge reversing the onus of proof, misstating the identification evidence and inviting the jury to adopt false logic which overstated the probative force of the identification evidence.
116The applicant submitted that the trial miscarried for the reasons specified in this ground of appeal.  On that issue, the applicant relied upon the following assertions which were made by the Crown in its closing address:""When you look at those two photographs, and in particular the second of those two photographs, you see three items of jewellery, one big, one medium, one small on the cheek of the face of the accused.  Members of the jury you might consider that that, it's entirely a matter for you, but you might consider that that evidence is highly persuasive and even ignoring the balance of the evidence that you might be looking at you might think that the likelihood that somebody else would be at those premises other than the accused would be fairly remote.  You no doubt would take into account in your ordinary day to day affairs the number of people that you might see with such jewellery on their face."" (3.10.12, T.2.16).
117The applicant submitted that this assertion involved false reasoning and grossly overstated the probative force of the eyewitness description.  The applicant submitted that the effect of the reasoning was to suggest that the probability that someone other than the applicant committed the offence was equivalent to the ratio of members of the public who had the same unique piercings when compared to the rest of the population.  The applicant submitted that the correct reasoning would be to assert that the probability that the applicant committed the offence was equivalent to the ratio of members of the public who had piercings matching both eyewitness' descriptions, i.e. silver studs or hoops on the lips and cheek to a diamond near the eyebrow when compared to the general public, a much larger group.
118The applicant was also critical of the assertion by the Crown in its address that:
""Now in examining that sort of material you might think that absent some satisfactory explanation from the accused the evidence is quite damning and we'll look at the accused's record of interview to see what explanation, if any, can be gleaned from that in due course.""  (3.10.12, T.2.27)
""...  What I'm saying there is is there anything in the accused's record of interview that would help you to exclude him as a possible person who might have committed this offence.""  (3.10.2012, T.4.8)
""To sum it up members of the jury you might think that it's not a great deal of assistance that the accused could take from his record of interview when it comes to explaining away any connection that he might have with the offence.  In essence he says to you, through his record of interview, look the car's not under my name and a lot of people use the car.  Well think about your own circumstances for those of you who have cars, and most people do these days, is it likely that you would not know where your car was at a particular point of time.  You might wonder to yourself well why would you buy a car in late December and you're not going to use it, just loan it to other people, does that ring true.  They're all matters for you and all matters that I'd ask you to take into account when considering the Crown case and when considering whether the accused provides any sort of satisfactory explanation for the presence of his car and the suggestion that he may be connected in the offence.""  (3.10.2012, T.5.25)
119The applicant submitted that these parts of the Crown address involved a reversal of the onus of proof and should have been specifically corrected by the trial judge.  In that regard, the applicant noted that his counsel at trial expressed her concern that the Crown had raised this issue with the trial judge at the conclusion of the Crown address.
120The applicant accepted that in her summing up the trial judge did give directions as to the onus and standard of proof, but complained that she did not do so by way of specifically correcting anything the Crown had said.  The applicant submitted that in fact the trial judge had made things worse when she said in her summing up:
""The Crown says you would accept the evidence of [the complainant], where she describes the jewellery on the man she says assaulted her because it is her description that most closely matches the piercings on the accused, that is, that he has three piercings.""  (3.10.2012, SU 18)
121The applicant submitted that the reasoning in this part of the summing up was fallacious in that it also reversed the onus of proof.  It did so by beginning with the presumption that the applicant was guilty and therefore the complainant's evidence could be more readily accepted because it more closely matched the applicant.
Consideration
122While it is true that her Honour did not in terms refer to what the Crown had said in its address when dealing with the onus of proof, she did state and restate that onus in clear terms on a number of occasions.
""You have already been told that the onus of proving the accused's guilt in respect of the charges is on the Crown, and that is beyond reasonable doubt. This means that in respect of each of the essential legal ingredients, or elements, of the charges you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established that element before you would be entitled to bring in a verdict of guilty on those charges.""  (3.10.2012, SU 13.5)
""The correct approach is first to determine what facts you find established by the evidence.  You then consider all of those facts together and ask yourself whether you can conclude from those facts that the accused is guilty of the offence charged.  If such a conclusion does not reasonably arise, then the Crown's circumstantial case fails because you are not satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, therefore, if that happens you must find the accused not guilty."" (3.10.2012, SU 15.5)
The Crown must then prove to you that the only reasonable inference or conclusion that can be drawn from a consideration of all the established facts, viewed as a whole, is that the accused is guilty of these offences.  If there is any other reasonable conclusion open on those facts that is inconsistent with the conclusion which the Crown asks you to find, then the Crown's circumstantial case has failed.""  (3.10.2012, SU 18.2)
""The most important and fundamental direction that I have to give you is concerning the onus and standard of proof. 
You must remember throughout your deliberations that because this is a criminal trial which is of a most serious nature, the burden of proving the guilt     of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown.  The accused starts from the position that he is presumed innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty.  The onus rests on the Crown in respect of every element of each charge.  There is no onus of proof on the accused at all. It is not for the accused to prove his innocence, but for the Crown to prove his guilt and to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.  It has always been a critical part of our system of justice, that persons tried in our courts are presumed to be innocent unless and until they are proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt, which is the presumption of innocence.  The Crown does not have to prove every single fact in the case beyond reasonable doubt, but has to prove the elements of the charges beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt in your minds.  Although he was not obliged to say anything to the police when they spoke to him at the police station, he did give a version of events in a recorded interview, which you have seen and which is in evidence.  He is entitled to rely on that account, and ask you to take it into consideration along with the other evidence called by the Crown.  However, he is not required to prove that this account is true.  The Crown, in discharging its obligation to prove the accused's guilt, must satisfy you that the accused's version of events could not reasonably be true.  You do not have to be satisfied that the accused is innocent before you could acquit him. ..."" (3.10.2012, SU 20.3 -21)
[Her Honour continued to stress the onus of proof in that passage and dealt specifically with the applicant's decision not to give evidence at trial (3.10.2012, SU 21-22).]
123It should also be noted that counsel for the applicant in her address said:
""It's for that reason members of the jury that contrary to what Mr Crown said to you earlier it is not for [the applicant] to exclude himself, he does not bear any onus of proof in this matter.  Now that's not simply a copout that we like to use at the end of the case, it's a basic principle, it's an important principle that applies to each one of us but it's simply part of that principle that you have to be satisfied of the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt.""  (3.10.2012, T.16.48)
124Because of what defence counsel had said in her address and the detailed directions of her Honour, it is not surprising that defence counsel did not seek a further direction from her Honour specifically addressing the issue of what had been said by the Crown at the conclusion of her Honour's summing up.  One can infer from that lack of complaint that defence counsel believed that the detailed directions given by her Honour had appropriately remedied the situation.
125The applicant's criticism of that part of the Crown's address directed to the unlikelihood of persons in the community generally having facial decorations of the kind identified by the complainant is not made out.  Properly read in its context, the Crown in this part of the address was dealing with the complainant's description of the assailant's facial jewellery.  He was saying that the jury would find it consistent with the applicant since she described three earrings on the cheek in a descending order of size.  The Crown then said, based on their experience, that the jury would conclude there were not many people who had facial decorations of such a kind as described by the complainant.  What the Crown was in fact describing was the unlikely scenario of encountering other people with facial jewellery as so precisely identified by the complainant.
126It is correct that the part of her Honour's summing up extracted by the applicant does reverse the onus of proof in that it includes an assumption that the applicant was the offender.  The extract needs to be read in context.  Firstly, her Honour was not expressing her own view but was purporting to summarise a submission by the Crown.  It is not without significance that immediately before this extract, her Honour had given the jury a strong direction as to the Crown having the onus of proof at all times.
127In fact her Honour had misquoted the Crown's submission.  The submission to which her Honour was referring was where the Crown sought to make a distinction between the evidence of CL and that of the complainant and submitted that the jury would consider the complainant's account more reliable because the complainant had a longer opportunity to observe the assailant and that the jewellery on his face might have been something which was quite prominent to the complainant as a young child looking at an adult in such a terrifying situation.
128Most particularly her Honour was not giving the jury a direction of law.  She was only summarising in short form a purported Crown submission.  I accept that the jury would have understood the summary of that submission in the context of the full argument which had been advanced by the Crown.  Moreover, the summing up needs to be read as a whole, including the lengthy and detailed directions as to the onus of proof to which reference has already been made.  The failure by defence counsel at trial to raise this aspect of the summing up is important.  Defence counsel was in a far better position than this Court to assess the atmosphere of the trial.  To the extent that the extract may in some way have been misunderstood by the jury, given the relatively insignificant position which it occupied as part of a much longer summing up, it is unlikely to have had any real influence on the jury's deliberations.
129It does not come close to satisfying the onus identified in FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 where McClellan CJ at CL (with whom R A Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreed) said in respect of rule 4:
""73 The critical issue for the applicant to establish, as she bears the onus of showing that leave should be granted, is that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R; R v Picken [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [21]. Another formulation of the test is that ""leave will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings"": R v Tripodina, supra, at 195.""
130The applicant has failed to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice and insofar as leave is required under rule 4 to rely upon that issue, I would refuse such leave.
131Ground 3 has not been made out.
Conclusion
132The applicant has succeeded in making out Ground 1 but has failed in establishing the other two grounds.  In those circumstances, this Court should follow the approach set out in SH.  Because the trial was not conducted according to law, the convictions must be quashed.  The proviso cannot be invoked by the Crown.  The appropriate order for this Court is to order a new trial.
133The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1)To the extent necessary, leave to appeal is granted.
(2)Ground of Appeal 1 is upheld but Grounds of Appeal 2 and 3 are dismissed.
(3)The convictions recorded against the applicant on 4 October 2012 are quashed.
(4)The matter is remitted to the District Court for retrial.
134FULLERTON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
135HAMILL J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL.
136I agree with his Honour's analysis and conclusion in relation to ground 1 and have nothing to add to his careful analysis of that ground of appeal.  It follows that the appeal must be upheld.
137In relation to ground 2, I agree with his Honour's conclusion that it was open to a properly instructed jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.
138I have considered the whole of the record and applied the principles enunciated by the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 and M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487.  I have also considered the approach adopted by the High Court in circumstantial cases where an appellate court is called upon to consider a ground that a verdict is unreasonable or unable to be supported: see Knight v Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495.  I have considered whether in the circumstances of this case the Court is in as good a position as the jury to decide on the proper inferences to be drawn from facts which are undisputed or which are clearly established by the findings of the jury: see, for example, Warren v Coombs (1979) 142 CLR 531 at 551.
139While this was a circumstantial case in which a number of factual circumstances were not in dispute, it was also a case in which the jury enjoyed the considerable advantage of having observed both children and a number of other witnesses give evidence.  The jury was in a far better position than this Court to make assessments of the kinds of criticisms made of the prosecution witnesses both by defence counsel at the trial and by senior counsel on the hearing of this appeal.  Those criticisms have been set out in some detail by the Chief Judge at Common Law and I need not repeat them.
140While there are many details of the descriptions of the assailant which do not match the appearance of the appellant, there remained before the jury a powerful circumstantial case based around the facial piercings of the appellant and the presence of his motor car at the scene of the crime.  Added to that was the description that the assailant had tattoos.  Whilst that description was inconsistent with the precise location of the tattoos worn by the appellant, it was nevertheless a matter which the jury was entitled to consider along with the various inconsistencies in determining whether or not the Crown had established its case beyond reasonable doubt.  It was for the jury to consider the significance of such inconsistencies bearing in mind the tender age of the child witnesses.   
141I am of the opinion that the evidence in the case was such that it was open (in the relevant sense) to a properly instructed jury to conclude that the prosecution had excluded all hypotheses consistent with innocence.  Put the other way, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the assailant.
142I agree with the analysis of the evidence which has been undertaken by Hoeben CJ at CL and I agree that ground two has not been established.
143I also agree with the Hoeben CJ at CL that ground 3 is not established.  I would take a slightly different path to that conclusion than has his Honour but that difference has no practical impact in the circumstances of this case.
144In view of the fact that defence counsel raised the problem with the Crown's address (transcript 3/10/12 at 15), I would not invoke rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules against the applicant.
145However, for the reasons given by Hoeben CJ at CL, I have come to the conclusion that neither the address of the Crown Prosecutor nor the summing up of the learned trial judge (particularly the impugned passage referred to by the Chief Judge at [120]) caused the appellant's trial to miscarry.
146I have come to this conclusion in view of the fact that the trial judge gave careful and firm directions in the course of her summing up which would have left the jury in no doubt whatsoever that the onus was on the prosecution and that the standard of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.  In view of the general tenor of the summing up, the infelicitous language employed by the trial judge in the impugned passage would not have caused the jury to approach the case in any other way than to consider whether every inference inconsistent with the appellant's guilt had been excluded by the prosecution.
147Accordingly I would reject ground 3.
148I have also considered the submission that it is appropriate to order an acquittal in circumstances where the appellant has fully served the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the primary judge.  In some cases that may be the appropriate order: see, for example, Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; 210 CLR 285 at [90] (Kirby J).  However, I am satisfied by the submissions of counsel for the respondent that the appropriate order in this case is for a retrial: and see Dyers v The Queen (supra) at [23] (Gaudron and Hayne JJ) and [135] (Callinan J).  It will be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether it is appropriate that the appellant be put on trial again in circumstances where he has fully served a sentence of imprisonment imposed following upon a trial which, through no fault of his, was not conducted in accordance with the law.
149For those reasons, I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

ex tempore Judgment

Jury Note


	
	At about 11.45 this morning, 18 November 2014, during the course of the morning tea break on the second day of this trial, the Court received a jury note which has been marked for identification 1. It is in the following form:
	


“I [name of juror] have known a witness that is at a trial which I am on the jury. He was a friend of my son and haven’t seen him for about four to five years. When I heard the names of the witnesses I believed the person was female from the pronouncing of the name.”


	
	At the time that the jury note was received, Mr Taras Spahic, a young man of about 22 years of age, was giving evidence. I have taken the jury note, as have both counsel, to be referring to Mr Spahic as the witness to whom the jury member was referring to.
	


Power to discharge Juror


	
	A question has arisen as to whether, in light of the content of the jury note, the Court should exercise its powers to discharge the juror in accordance with s 53B(b) of the Jury Act 1977. That section is in the following form:
	


“53B Discretionary Discharge of Individual Juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial … discharge a juror if:

(b) it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial …, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason ...”

Examination of Juror on Oath


	
	In considering the exercise of the Court’s discretion in accordance with that section, a preliminary issue has arisen as to whether it is appropriate to examine the juror on his oath with respect to the extent of his knowledge or relationship with the witness; whether he has by reason of past events formed any view about the reliability of the individual as a recounter of primary fact; whether he is or is not able to give impartial consideration to the case, and whether there is any reasonable apprehension of bias to the extent that his answers may reflect matters which fall within the relevant test.
	
	
	As I am giving this judgment, in the course of the trial, time does not permit me to examine in detail whether there is or is not a power to examine a juror with respect to the contents of a note such as the one which has been provided. Clearly, the Jury Act does not directly grant the Court that power. It is a more complex question as to whether, upon the proper interpretation of the Jury Act, the Court retains any power at law which it otherwise had to examine a juror. If such a power exists, then it must be that it is a matter of discretion for the trial Judge as to whether the power ought be exercised.
	
	
	In BG v R [2012] NSWCCA 139, Adamson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McDougall J agreed, said at [87], when considering a question as to whether the Judge should or should not have taken sworn evidence from the juror with respect to the contents of a jury note, this:
	


“There was, in my view, no reason for the judge to doubt the veracity of the report she received from the jury via its note and, accordingly, there was, in my view, no reason to require verification of the information by sworn evidence from the particular juror: See for example R v Arnott [2009] VSCA 299, where a challenge to the trial judge’s acceptance of a medical certificate in respect of a juror was rejected by the Victorian Court of Appeal at [133].”


	
	Here, I have no reason to doubt the veracity of what the juror is saying with respect to his knowledge of the witness. Nor do I have any reason to doubt the veracity of his explanation that he did not recognise the name of the witness at the time it was read out, he mistakenly believing that the name was female and not male.
	
	
	In those circumstances, even if I did have the power to examine a juror, I would not exercise my discretion so to do.
	


Legal Principles to be Applied


	
	I then turn to consider the question of whether, having regard to the contents of the note, the juror should be discharged. I keep in mind that the test, when considering the application of s 55B(b) of the Jury Act, encompasses both actual bias on the part of a juror as well as reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the juror.
	
	
	The principle to be applied is clear. It is one of longstanding. It is that in considering whether or not a juror may be biased it is important to keep in mind that it is the appearance of bias, or impartiality, as well as the fact of impartiality, which is necessary to retain, to promote and to advance confidence in the administration of justice. Not only the parties to the case, but also the general public must be satisfied that justice has not only been done but that it has been seen to be done: see Webb & Hay v R (1994) HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 50 per Mason CJ and McHugh J.
	
	
	Kirby J said in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v M A Bright [2000] NSWCCA 258 at [28], by reference to the decision of the High Court in Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association {1983} HCA 17; (1983) 151 CLR 288:
	


“A person should not sit as a juror if, in all of the circumstances, the parties, or a fair minded and informed member of the public, might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he or she might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the resolution of questions involved in the trial.”

Discernment


	
	In my view, given the particular circumstances of this case, namely that the Crown’s case depends in large part, but not exclusively, upon eye witness evidence, and given that there is some differences in the evidence of the eye witnesses, which is not unexpected and, further, given that one real issue in the proceedings is whether the accused was acting in self-defence or, at least, to put it another way, whether the Crown is able to disprove, beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was acting in self-defence, the accuracy, reliability and acceptability to the jury of the evidence of each of the eye witnesses is a matter of central importance.
	
	
	As senior counsel for the accused has submitted, he intends to argue to the jury, in due course, that much of what this witness says is accurate and reliable and is to be preferred to other witnesses’ evidence. He points to the fact that if the juror who has sent the note has a view either as to the reliability or lack of reliability of the witness because of earlier contact, then that might well affect the way in which the witness’s evidence is received and acted upon.
	
	
	It seems to me, as well, that the essence of the jury note is that had the juror recognised the person’s name correctly when it was first read out then he is likely to have been asked to be excused from being a member of the jury panel for the case.
	
	
	I am unable to, and do not, say from the content of the note that the juror is actually biased. However, I am abundantly satisfied that the content of the note and the fact of knowledge of an important witness as a friend of the juror’s son, combine to satisfy me that his continuing presence on the jury would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, sufficient to fulfil the longstanding test that in order to retain confidence in the administration of justice the appearance of impartiality is necessary, as well as impartiality itself.
	


Conclusion


	
	I am satisfied that the identified juror should not sit as a juror in this trial because the parties or a fair minded informed member of the public might, and probably would, entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an impartial, unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the questions.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied that, having formed the appropriate opinion, I should discharge the juror identified in the note from continuing as a member of the jury in the trial.
	


Discharge of Balance of the Jury


	
	A question then arises, in accordance with s 53C of the Jury Act as to whether, once a juror has been discharged, the court ought discharge the balance of the jury or else should continue with the remaining 11 members.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused submits the Court ought discharge the balance of the jury and empanel a new jury and commence the trial afresh. Senior counsel for the Crown accepts that it would be inappropriate for 11 members of the jury to continue to hear the balance of this trial, particularly having regard to the early stage of the trial.
	
	
	I am satisfied in all of the circumstances including the early stage of this trial, the fact that a second jury panel is readily available tomorrow morning, the fact that the possibility remains that the juror who has sent the note may have discussed with other members of the jury his knowledge of the witness, that continuing the trial with the balance of the 11 jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Accordingly, the appropriate course is for me to discharge the jury and recommence the trial and empanel a new jury.

2704210,R v Suh [2014] NSWDC 319,"Judgment -

Re admissibility of opinion evidence of Professor Susan Hayes

Introduction


	
	Jung Shik Suh is to be tried in relation to two counts of indecent assault allegedly committed on the complainant (EK) between 1 June 2010 and 4 October 2012 and on 4 October 2012. At the relevant time the complainant was either 3, 4 or 5 years of age.
	
	
	The trial commenced last Thursday, 13 November 2014, with a large number of issues to be resolved many of which have been dealt with along the way. The outstanding issue that this judgment primarily addresses relates to objection to the evidence of Professor Susan Hayes a “psychologist”, expressing opinions as to the observed “sexualised behaviour” of the complainant between May and December 2012 as particularised in a statement of the complainant’s school teacher Piera Lo Surdo, on the basis that she does not have “specialised knowledge” such as to satisfy s 79 Evidence Act (1995), as an exception to the “opinion rule” of exclusion of hearsay evidence. I gave a general ‘ruling’ on this matter late Monday afternoon.
	
	
	Evidence has been given on the voir dire by Professor Hayes last Thursday (the Court did not sit on Friday) and on Monday (17 November) counsel for the accused produced extensive written submissions in relation to this and other issues which are Exhibit 5 in the proceedings.
	
	
	In summary the issues raised by the accused in respect of the various objections are:
	


(i) Professor Hayes does not have the relevant experience, knowledge and/or training (“specialised knowledge”) required by s 79 Evidence Act 1995 to express the opinions contained within her report of 11 September 2013 and also expressed in her evidence of 14 October 2013 at an earlier trial.

(ii) Even if she had the relevant expertise the opinions she expresses are not admissible either as irrelevant or not otherwise satisfying the requirements of s 79.

(iii) Her evidence, if otherwise admissible “could not” substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the complainant (s 108C Evidence Act 1995).

(iv) Her evidence if otherwise admissible ought be excluded pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act 1995.


	
	The issues raised in the written and oral submissions from the evidence on the voir dire raise consideration of a number of sections of the Evidence Act.
	


The Legislation


	
	s 55 Relevant evidence:
	


“(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:

(a) the credibility of a witness, or

(b) the admissibility of other evidence, or

(c) a failure to adduce evidence.”


	
	s 79 Exception: opinion based on specialised knowledge
	


“(1) If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule (s 76 of the Act) does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.

(2) To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):

(a) a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their development and behaviour during and following the abuse), and

(b) a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:

(i) the development and behaviour of children generally,

(ii) the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences. “


	
	s 108C Exception: evidence of person with specialised knowledge
	


“(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence given by a person concerning the credibility of another witness if:

(a) the person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, and

(b) the evidence is evidence of an opinion of the person that:

(i) is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge, and

(ii) could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness, and

(c) the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.

(2) To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):

(a) a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their behaviour during and following the abuse), and

(b) a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of that kind, a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:

(i) the development and behaviour of children generally,

(ii) the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences.”


	
	s 137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings
	


“In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.”


	
	s 192 Leave, permission or direction may be given
	


“(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:

(a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and

(b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and

(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and

(d) the nature of the proceeding, and

(e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.”

The issues and submissions


	
	The evidence the subject of objection concerns opinions expressed by Professor Hayes in respect of what is said to be “sexualised behaviour"" exhibited by the complainant in the presence of Piera Lo Surdo, a kindergarten teacher of the complainant, which behaviour is said in the opinion of the Professor to reflect conduct consistent with the complainant having experienced “sexual abuse”. The evidence of the complainant is the only direct evidence of the assaults giving rise to the charges in the indictment. The accused was engaged in what were described as “pretext"" telephone conversations which were recorded and a recorded interview with police in which he allegedly made admissions concerning touching the complainant in the genital area, said to be consistent with the specific allegations in Counts 1 and 2, but that the “touching” was inadvertent or accidental. It will be suggested to the jury that the complainant's account of the accused's inappropriate touching of him was fabricated, reconstructed or was false.
	
	
	Ms Lo Surdo will say the complainant commenced school in kindergarten in 2012. He was described generally as “a well-behaved child”. In May 2012 after the Easter holidays, he did some “silly things”, such as on 11 May 2012 touching other children on their genital area for which he received a warning and was told that his behaviour was inappropriate and the matter was referred to the mother of the complainant. On 22 November 2012, after the accused had been charged, the teacher was told that the complainant had urinated on a student’s shoes. On 5 December 2012 the teacher saw the complainant “grab another student … on the genital area"". Professor Hayes, who gave evidence of her training, study and/or experience through her report and its attachments and in her evidence on the voir dire and upon documents produced by the defence (Exhibits 2 and 3), has said that the complainant's behaviour was consistent with “the research on the impact of child sexual abuse … most, if not all, children who exhibit problematic sexualised behaviour have been victims of sexual abuse; they appear to have learned abnormal sexual behaviour from the abuser and demonstrate inappropriate sexual acting out"".
	
	
	She said that the reported behaviour by the complainant may be classified as “problematic sexualised behaviour"" from her reference to research. She said that the “behaviours described by the teacher are strong indicators of (the complainant) having been the victim of sexual abuse”. She said that “the strongest indication that a child has been sexually abused is inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexual interest and sexual acting out by that child; other effects can include behaviour and/or performance problems at school, and non- participation in social and social activities”. She said that for a child so young “trying to touch another's genitals and not ceasing the sexual behaviour after adult intervention is atypical and problematic"". She expresses other opinions following upon the general analysis of the incidents the subject of evidence by Ms Lo Surdo. If Professor Hayes can give opinion evidence (in general or specific form) then Ms Lo Surdo’s evidence is admissible.
	
	
	Primarily, the submissions made on behalf the accused objecting to the evidence of Professor Hayes address the issue of her expertise in the context of her evidence about her relevant study, training and experience and the documents that were produced relating to her Curriculum Vitae and her publications (Exhibits two and three). Whilst it is conceded that the Professor is quite an experienced clinical psychologist (and) that she is highly renowned in the areas of intellectual disability and crime (that is offenders and victims of crime with intellectual disabilities), her evidence and her Curriculum Vitae do not identify her as “an expert in problematic child sexual behaviour"". Neither do her qualifications, her publications, or her clinical experience.
	
	
	The Court was taken to particular evidence she gave that in the last five years she had seen about 10 child victims of sexual abuse "" although she said “I have certainly seen many more adults who have been the victims of child sexual abuse"". Of the 10 that she saw, in “approximately 5 cases"", she had clients who “presented with behavioural indicators of sexual abuse"". She was criticised by counsel for the accused for volunteering in cross-examination that, beyond the period defined (by the question asked by the Crown) she had asserted that in fact seen hundreds of children exhibiting problematic sexual sexualised behaviour as a result of a claim of sexual abuse. It is submitted that the totality of the evidence in the contents of the report would not satisfy the Court that she had demonstrated the necessary “specialised knowledge"" of child problematic sexualised behaviour in order to provide relevant opinions. It was submitted ultimately that her “general experience"", that is her experience of 30 years clinically and academically dealing with the science of “human behaviour”, including over that time treating children who are the victims of sexual abuse, does not provide the necessary “specialised knowledge"".
	
	
	The Court was taken to SLS v The Queen [2014] VSCA 31 and specific submissions were made about that (at [23] - [24] of the written submissions). Although the circumstances in SLS were not on even footing with the circumstances in this trial, it was submitted that ultimately the “vice"" associated with the proposed evidence in SLS, was in effect the same “vice"" here. That is, that there was an assumption in the opinion of the conduct alleged against the accused having actually occurred and/or had been committed by the accused.
	
	
	The next general submission is that even if she had the relevant specialised knowledge the evidence she gives could not “substantially affect” the credibility of the evidence of the complainant (see s 108C Evidence Act 1995). Reference in the written submissions is made to MA v The Queen [2013] VSCA 20, where that Court drew a distinction between admissibility of general opinion evidence concerning how a child “may react to sexual abuse” and that usually an expert should not be invited to express an opinion as to the “actual behaviour of the alleged victim” (at [100]). It is submitted that given Professor Hayes’ expertise and if her opinions were otherwise admissible, she should not be permitted to give evidence about this particular complainant, having not examined the complainant. If she was to give evidence of a “non specific nature”, this evidence would not “substantially affect the credibility of the witness”. It is submitted amongst other reasons that it does not substantially affect the credibility of the complainant because it does not substantially support the complainant’s account of being sexually abused by the accused, nor the credibility of his claims as to the manner of the sexual assault.
	
	
	Alternatively, it is submitted that the evidence should not be admitted because the unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value, for the reason that the jury would give the evidence of Professor Hayes undue weight, the risk of the jury engaging in tendency reasoning and that the jury will use the evidence to bolster the complainant’s evidence relied upon by the Crown for “context” purposes.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions are that the witness has the relevant training experience and/or knowledge. When her description of her clinical experience, the details of her study and training and her general knowledge is understood in a proper context her opinion has its foundation, not just in a limited number of clinical experiences, but in a much wider field of training, knowledge and experience than suggested by the defence.
	
	
	The Crown, referring to SLS, noted that, putting aside general principles that arise from the case and the outcome of the case, the particular matters the subject of discussion in that case involve three significant areas of distinction from the current case. They were:
	


(i) the complainant was not the subject of the relevant opinions, it was the accused in SLS whose conduct was the subject of the opinion.

(ii) the opinions in part were concerned with prospective behaviour and what it meant in proof of guilt of the accused, rather than an examination of the implications of past behaviour and

(iii) s 108C Evidence Act 1995 was not relevant to consideration of the admissibility of the evidence.


	
	There was concern expressed by the Crown about whether the Professor could give evidence about sexualised behaviour generally, or about the particular sexualised behaviour of this complainant having regard to the judgment of the plurality in MA at [100].
	
	
	Counsel for the prosecution noted that leave was required pursuant to s 108C, but that with consideration of the matters arising under s 192(2) Evidence Act, there was no proper basis to exclude the evidence by not granting leave. The Crown submitted that, bearing in mind the Crown case was dependant upon the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant, the evidence of the Professor “could” … “substantially affect” the assessment of the credibility of the witness, with particular emphasis on the word “could” in that context.
	


Consideration


	
	I have concluded that Professor Hayes is relevantly qualified to express opinions about the fact that sexualised behaviour (such as that identified by Ms Lo Surdo) is consistent with the complainant having sexual experience, including sexual experience learnt from sexual touching from a third person and to give evidence of the causes and character of “problematic sexualised behaviour”. This evidence is to be led by the prosecution in the context of the complainant denying that anybody else other than the accused had sexually touched him and the allegation of the complainant and that the accused has sexually touched him “lots of times” “every Sunday” and “every holiday” “lots of times”.
	
	
	In the context of the way the Crown case is to be conducted, the establishment of the fact of being sexually assaulted is very closely connected to the identity of the accused as the person who sexually assaulted him in circumstances where the complainant only alleges that the accused had sexually dealt with him inappropriately.
	
	
	The objection taken to the expertise of Professor Hayes, particularised in the written submissions and in the oral submissions, involves an analysis that unnecessarily, or unreasonably, compartmentalises her “training, study or experience” and underestimates or unfairly categorises the manner in which her opinions are based upon the combination of specific reading on relevant studies and publications with regard to the topic of “problematic sexualised behaviour of sexual abuse victims” in the context of her “study” and “clinical experience”.
	
	
	The witness is a Professor of Behavioural Sciences in the School of Medicine at the University of Sydney. To summarise her qualifications, she holds a Doctorate in Psychology and in her Curriculum Vitae, tendered identified her research interests as “forensic psychology; offenders and victims of crime with intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder, sex offenders with intellectual disability … "". Both Exhibit 2 and the more expansive Exhibit 3 set out details of her career and selected lists of publications that she has been responsible for over the last 30 years. I accept that it could fairly be said that are generally speaking her major interest is in the area of “intellectual disability"" with a particular interest in offenders and victims of the crime suffering from what could be called intellectual disability. This has been the subject of many of her multitudinal publications. She has authored some of the leading Australian publications on the relationship between intellectual disability and offending, as either offenders or victims. Her “study” has (by reference to her bibliography, her research interests and the like) included research, treatment and counselling of victims of sexual assault. I accept from the evidence the witness is not only an “academic”, but has a long career in clinical examination of patients.
	
	
	She has been a consultant and reporter to courts over many years in the general area of “forensic psychology"". Whilst the witness indicated that in the last five years she had probably seen about 10 child victims of sexual abuse in respect of whom about 5 reported “sexualised behaviour” she had “certainly seen many more adults who have been the victims of child sexual abuse"" from a variety of sources. She gave evidence, which I accept, that over the at least 30 years had seen hundreds of child victims of sexual assault in a clinical setting, more particularly during a period of time when she worked with Professor Oates, the Head of the Paediatric Unit at the Camperdown Childrens Hospital a number of years ago. I also accept that, apart from a modest contribution in her writing on aspects of the effect of sexual abuse upon victims of child sexual assault, particularly as adults, including sexualised behaviour, over decades she had to keep up-to-date with the “literature"" concerning the effects of sexual assault. She had read “thousands” of papers upon the effects of child sexual assault.
	
	
	Her report to this Court refers to the specific sources of academic and other discussion on the relationship between sexualised behaviour in children and sexual assault and abuse and there can be no doubt with the combination of her academic and clinical experience, she would have no difficulty understanding and assessing writings by others on this topic. In fact the sources of that writing, the issues that arise and her understanding of them were not the subject of challenge. The ‘seven’ papers or articles she footnoted were “the most helpful” because of their reference to the “frequency” the behaviour was likely to appear if a child had been sexually abused and their clinical description and their clinical description.
	
	
	I accept, although it was not expressly submitted, that she is not a psychologist only working and studying in the area of sexualised behaviour of children arising from sexual experience/abuse/assault, if such a limited specialty exists. But in the context of her general academic qualifications, study and clinical experience she is an expert in assessing victims of crime, including those claiming to be sexually assaulted, and has sufficient clinical experience and understanding from her study and reading to express opinions about an aspect of the effects of sexual assault. This is what may be described as a “subset"" of the understanding of the effect of behaviour of “perpetrators"" of sexual assault upon their alleged “victims"".
	
	
	S 79 of the Act states that the “evidence of an opinion"" of the witness, is required to be “wholly or substantially based on (specialised) knowledge"" which is “based on (the witness’s) training, study, or experience"". “Specialised knowledge"" includes a reference to “specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour"" and a relevant opinion includes a reference to either/or the development of behaviour of children generally and/or the development and behaviour of children “who have been the victims of sexual offences or offences similar to a sexual offences"".
	
	
	Whilst the expert’s opinion may not need to meet some standard of probative value to be admissible, courts must be cautious in assessing claims of “special knowledge"" (Hannes v The Director of Public Prosecutions (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 370 at [292]). No issue was taken concerning the underlying thesis that sexual abuse or assault may and/or can cause sexualised behaviour in people otherwise too young to exhibit such traits.
	
	
	In this matter there was no issue that a person with relevant ""expertise"" could express opinions about the general subject matter and that the relevant subject matter was a matter of ""specialised knowledge"" in respect of which there were people qualified to express relevant opinions. It was not disputed in submission, or in the manner of the conduct on the voir dire, that the area of ""specialised knowledge"" in question lay within the expertise of appropriately qualified ""psychologist"" and/or ""psychiatrist"", being an issue concerned with those behavioural sciences which they are qualified, to varying degrees, to comment upon. There was no issue that either the study of behaviour by psychologists and/or medical practitioners was relevantly an area of ""specialised knowledge"" or was a “reliable body of knowledge and experience"" (cf HG v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 414 at [58] per Gaudron J: Veleski v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR of 402, at [82] per Gaudron J, [154] per Gummow and Callinan JJ). I am mindful that there are limits to professional qualification providing a basis for relevant ""specialised knowledge"" such as the illustrations from various authorities identified by the learned author Stephen Odgers SC: Uniform Evidence Law (11th Edition), at p 369 - 370.
	
	
	No issue was identified on the voir dire that would cause the Court to be concerned that the relevant opinions expressed were not ""wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge"". The issues that were identified in HG v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 414 (example at [39] - [44] per Gleeson CJ) were not raised or are not made out here. The real question turned upon the analysis of the evidence of the “training, study or experience"" of the witness that permitted the relevant opinion to be expressed.
	
	
	Part of an understanding of this issue on the evidence available to the Court was not just the question of her formal qualifications and training, as revealed in her evidence and Curriculum Vitae, but her evidence of her clinical experience over 30 odd years and the fact (which is not disputed) that she had read relevant publications identified in her report which gave rise to the assessment of the evidence of observation of the child by the teacher as part of the literature involving studies in this specific area, having kept ""up-to-date"" with the literature throughout her career.
	
	
	Criticism of her limited clinical experience in the last five years must be assessed along with her more extensive clinical experience of assessing victims of child sexual assault over an extended period of time, both adults and children. One of the criticisms of this aspect of her evidence was that her clinical experience of “victims of sexual abuse"" if concerned with “adults"" had no relevance to the assessment of her relevant knowledge training or study. The issue was not examined in detail in cross examination, but on the assumption that the Professor was referring to clinical assessment of adults who had suffered child sexual abuse or assault, this would not preclude experience or understanding of symptomology exhibited or identified by the patient when a child that could be attributed to childhood sexual assault, even if complained of or identified when an adult.
	
	
	The two authorities cited by the accused of SLS and MA ultimately were of limited assistance either in assessing the facts of this case relevant to “expertise” and in reaching a conclusion whether a witness had the relevant “specialised knowledge"" or not. As was conceded by counsel for the accused in the course of submission, and identified by counsel for the Crown, the matters for determination in SLS neither had relevance to the admissibility of the particular opinion by virtue of s 108C of the Act, nor required relevant opinion to be expressed about the conduct of the complainant and the purported relationship between the complainant’s behaviour and any particular sexual assault or experience. Further, the opinion sought to be admitted in SLS and excluded was directed at an evaluation of the likelihood of what was described as ""prospective behaviour"" on the part of the accused to prove his guilt, not an analysis of proven behaviour and its relationship with prior sexual experience.
	
	
	As to MA, the Crown identified from [100] of that judgment the caution that may need to be exercised in permitting a specific opinion to be given concerning the particular complainant as opposed to expressing a general opinion about the relationship between sexualised behaviour and sexual assault.
	
	
	In MA the majority said at that paragraph:
	


“We should say before leaving the question of expert evidence bearing upon the credibility of complainant that one would … ordinarily expect an expert to be asked to express an opinion concerning the complainant’s actual behaviour after the alleged offending conduct, or the reasons for a parent in the case before the Court for not accepting the complainant's claim all the complainant’s actual reaction to the rejection of her claim. These are questions which are within the jury's province to resolve. The occasion should be relatively rare were an expert should be invited to express an opinion as to the actual behaviour of the victim or the victim's parent and whether it advanced the probabilities of a fact in issue. Where a party seeks to have an expert go so far, the obligation of the trial judge under s 137 … to exclude evidence if its probative value was outweighed by its prejudice may assume greater significance. Such questions do not arise in this trial"".


	
	The relevant evidence in that case with which the Court was concerned was evidence that a psychiatrist gave on behalf of the Crown with respect of the behavioural framework within which the evidence of the complainant's reactions to the alleged abuse should be assessed and understood. The defence in that matter had relied upon what was said to be “counter intuitive behaviour"" as reflecting adversely upon the complainant’s credibility (MA at [1]-[3], [17]-[21]). The doctor gave evidence to the jury where he addressed the question of why a child may not call out for help when sexual offending is being committed against him or her when other persons were close by, the nexus between ""common parental reactions to complaints about sexual assault"", ""common behavioural responses of victims"" and why a parent might not accept complainant’s allegation of sexual abuse by persons within the family unit and the continuation of family relationships after such a claim [41]-[48]. 
	
	
	Each of the Judges of the Victorian Court of Appeal regarded the relevant evidence as admissible under s 108C Evidence Act as an exception to the credibility rule, leave ought be granted pursuant of that section and that no issue as to the reliability of the evidence arose such as to enliven s 137 of the Act (noting that the Court was relying upon the reasoning of Dupas [2012] VSCA 328 at [125]-[128], which reasoning is not been adopted in New South Wales: cf XY [2013] NSWCCA 121). Having regard to what has been cited from SLS and MA , noting the basis of exclusion of the evidence in SLS but the approval of the admission of the relevant evidence in MA, ultimately there was nothing identified within those judgments that provided a basis for exclusion of the objected evidence.
	
	
	Here the evidence “could substantially affect the credibility of the evidence of the complainant” given that there may be no other reason for the claimed “sexualised behaviour” other than the alleged conduct of the accused having regard to the admitted opinion of Professor Hayes.
	
	
	Although I am satisfied by the Crown that the witness has relevant ""specialised knowledge"" to express opinions about the relationship between ""problematic sexualised conduct"" and experience of sexual assault or abuse, having regard to the terms of the evidence, her report, and the material which she relied upon as relevant to establishing such a nexus, it is not open to the witness to express opinions as set out in her report that the material provides quite “strong evidence” of a particular nexus or fact, or to express any qualitative analysis of the likelihood of a nexus. The witness is entitled to express opinions that particular behaviour of a young child which could be categorised as ‘sexualised behaviour’ is consistent with particular events that might include conduct that could amount to sexual assault.
	
	
	When I gave my ruling in relation to the matter I did not specifically rule as to whether the expert might comment upon the particular facts of the case. Given the witness has not conducted any clinical examination of the child and relies upon the findings from general studies, I have concluded that the witness should only be permitted to express opinions as to what sexualised behaviour is and whether particular sexualised behaviour is consistent with conduct that may constitute sexual assault. Although the opinion in relation to the particular facts case may be relevant, and otherwise admissible under s 108C, it ought be excluded pursuant to s 137 in the context of the caution express by the majority in MA at [100].
	
	
	There is one other matter that arises that is relevant to limiting the effect of the opinion. The teacher’s evidence of the dates of particular events is very specific as to dates. The complainant’s account of events before 4 October 2012 is very general. It seems to me that a factual issue for the jury to resolve is whether the complainant’s conduct observed by Ms Lo Surdo is sexualised conduct, then, if it has a temporal connection with the proven conduct of the accused. These are factual issues that go to the reliability of the observations of Ms Lo Surdo as they relate to the opinions of Professor Hayes and the reliability of the complainant. The reliability of the evidence of Ms Lo Surdo and Professor Hayes (given that it is otherwise admissible as relevant) is not a relevant matter to the assessment of its probative value (XY [2013]). Otherwise, leave should be granted to lead the evidence relevant to credibility, as no issue arises pursuant to s 192 of the Act to decline the grant of leave, for the reasons advanced by the prosecution in submission.
	
	
	There is one other aspect of this. Although the nub of her opinion could not reasonably be categorised as “general knowledge"" or knowledge of matters that fall within lay understanding and experience, the proposition that a child aged between three or four and six, who reasonably would not otherwise have learnt or experienced “sexual behaviour"", would mimic or imitate sexual conduct towards that child by another person such as the conduct involved in sexual assault, is not very far from commonsense or common experience. Anyone who has had children knows the children imitate others, and are capable of considerable mimicry of adults under whose authority they live, play or learn. That sexualised behaviour is consistent with having learnt that behaviour from another source is really no great surprise. Of course, it does not prove that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant. The evidence is limited to the issue of “credibility"" and it is not evidence to can be used to “support"" the truth of the allegations, because it is not independent evidence, merely evidence assessing the observed conduct of the child as consistent with an event that the child alleges to have occurred.
	


Section 137


	
	The probative value of the evidence of Professor Hayes is not out weighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the accused. The matters identified by counsel for the accused as constituting “unfair prejudice"" when pressed were matters which can be addressed by appropriate direction. The risk of the evidence being contorted to serve an improper purpose, such as involving some form of “tendency reasoning"", does not stand up to close inspection when the limited purpose of the evidence of opinion is understood. In any event, as with the context evidence, the jury will be warned that the evidence cannot be used for that purpose. Thus the evidence is not to be excluded by exercise of the rule of exclusion available under s 137, nor by the exercise of the discretion available under s 135 Evidence Act 1995. I cannot see how it is established that the evidence would be misused in any way.
	


Context evidence


	
	The judgment above is relevant to evidence I permitted to be admitted from the recording of the interview with the complainant which will be the complainant's evidence “in chief” of conduct by the accused over a period of time allegedly before the specific event on 4 October 2012 giving rise to Count 2 in the indictment. The matters to which the complainant referred in answer to Q 116 and then between Q 282 and Q 319 of the electronic interview conducted with the complainant on 10 October 2012, I earlier ruled were admissible as “context evidence”, at least in respect of establishing what is alleged against the accused relevant to Count 1.
	
	
	The Crown case against the accused is that the complainant and his parents started attending the church with the accused was a Deacon on 1 June 2010, the complainant alleges the accused touching him on a number of occasions every Sunday and in the holidays for a period of time before the interview in October 2012 and that the accused admitted in the course of the recorded “pretext"" calls that he had accidentally touched the complainant in the area of his genitals ""a number of months before"". It is in this context that Count 1 is pleaded. Count 2, particularising 4 October 2012, is based upon a representation by the complainant that the accused had inappropriately touched him the day before he told his parent of being touched by the accused, which occurred on 5 October 2012. He also said then that the accused had touched him many times before. This “complaint” would appear to be a representation (or representations) made when they were fresh in the memory of the complainant (cf s 66 Evidence Act 1995). Thus, the general allegations, in answer to Q 116 and Q 282 - Q 319, against the accused provide a context for the particularization of Count 1 and its relationship to Count 2. The evidence of the other touchings serves the purpose of context at least in that limited way, to establish the fact of a relevant touching that coincided with the “admission” of the accused, in the context of the complainant’s allegation that the touching constituted an indecent assault.
	
	
	The ruling I have made about the admissibility of the opinion evidence, bearing in mind it is agreed that if the opinion evidence is admitted the evidence of Ms Lo Surdo is permitted, makes the “context"" evidence admissible on a further basis. That is to provide a “context” for the observations of the teacher upon which the opinion of the doctor is introduced, even in a general way and not necessarily in comment upon the particular observations (I note my observations in para 44 above). Whether the context evidence is available for a wider purpose, such as explaining delay in complaint, explaining the true relationship between the parties and the like, is a matter that will need to be resolved later in the trial when all the evidence has been admitted and/or heard.

		06 May 2015",2014-11-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704215,New South Wales Crime Commission v Elsage [2014] NSWSC 1648,"Judgment

1By summons of 19 November 2014, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (""the Act"") in relation to the interest in property of the defendant, Ryad Elsage, also known as Riad Elsaj and Ryad El Sage. Ancillary orders under s 12(1) of the Act were also sought, as well as orders under s 10B and s 27. 

2The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 19 November 2014 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission's Director, Financial Investigations and an authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.

3For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made, together with the orders which appear at the conclusion of this judgment. 

4The property sought to be restrained is identified in schedules to the summons. It includes one property located at Casula and another located at Green Valley, of which the defendant is the registered proprietor, as well as a third property located at Austral, of which he is one of the tenants in common (schedule one to the summons). It also includes funds held in an accounts belonging to Mr Elsage held in the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (schedule two to the summons) and a Harley Davidson and a Lamborghini, which are registered in his name (schedule three to the summons).

5The particulars sought to be provided by Mr Elsage under s 12(1)(c1) appear at schedule four of the summons.

6Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Elsage had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of ""serious criminal offences"" in s 6 of the Act, namely, supplying a prohibited drug (3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).

7Mr Spark gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of a Police Facts Sheet prepared by Senior Constable Smithers of the New South Wales Police Force in relation to Mr Elsage's anticipated arrest on 20 November; answers provided to questions he asked of Senior Constable Smithers about the Facts Sheet; information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers on the COPS, RMS and LPI databases and information provided by ANZ.

8Amongst other things these searches disclosed the value of the Lamborghini on ownership records disclosed to be $50,000, while the website www.carsellout.com.au disclosed advertisements for similar models (second-hand) for prices ranging from $149,990 to $158,000.

9The Facts Sheet disclosed that Mr Elsage has come to the attention of a strike force established to investigate the supply of MDMA, as being involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. Investigators have lawfully intercepted various telephone communications in August and September 2014 between Mr Elsage and his co-accused in which it is alleged that he agreed to supply various amounts of MDMA tablets, which he later supplied to the co-accused, as arranged. 

10Mr Spark deposed that he believed the circumstances to require that the New South Wales Police be authorised to seize and take possession of the property specified in schedules two and three to the summons and that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of all of Mr Elsage's interest in the Lamborghini, for which the Police did not have facilities for long term storage.

11Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate, to dispose of motor vehicles or backdate forms notifying RMS of the disposal and to dispose of funds held in bank accounts very quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that if the Lamborghini were returned to Mr Elsage, it may be concealed or disposed of. 

12Given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Elsage is apparently involved, Mr Sparks deposed that he believed that Mr Elsage should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit. 

13Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. 

14I am satisfied that the material relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the ancillary orders sought. 

15On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days' notice. 

16Given that Mr Elsage is but one of the tenants in common of the Austral property, of which there are also joint tenants, I take the view that the orders which I propose to make should also be served upon the other tenant in common and the joint tenants of that property and that they, too, should be given liberty to apply to the Court on three days' notice. In coming to that view, I have had regard to their rights under s 10C of the Act.

Orders

17I accordingly make orders in the terms sought and also order and direct that:
(1)The orders be served on the other tenant in common and joint tenants of the Austral property.

(2)They have liberty to apply to the Court on three days' notice.

(3)That a copy of the reasons be served with the orders.

2704217,R v Suh [2014] NSWDC 233,"Judgment - Re admissibility of opinion evidence of Professor Susan Hayes

Introduction

1Jung Shik Suh is to be tried in relation to two counts of indecent assault allegedly committed on the complainant between 1 June 2010 and 4 October 2012 and on 4 October 2012. At the relevant time the complainant was either 3, 4 or 5 years of age. 

2The trial commenced last Thursday, 13 November 2014, with a large number of issues to be resolved many of which have been dealt with along the way. The outstanding issue that this judgment primarily addresses relates to objection to the evidence of Professor Susan Hayes a ""psychologist"", expressing opinions as to the observed ""sexualised behaviour"" of the complainant between May and December 2012 as particularised in a statement of the complainant's school teacher, on the basis that she does not have ""specialised knowledge"" such as to satisfy s 79 Evidence Act (1995), as an exception to the ""opinion rule"" of exclusion of hearsay evidence. I gave a general 'ruling' on this matter late Monday afternoon. 

3Evidence has been given on the voir dire by Professor Hayes.  Counsel for the accused produced extensive written submissions in relation to this and other issues which are Exhibit 5 in the proceedings. 

4In summary the issues raised by the accused in respect of the various objections are:

(i) Professor Hayes does not have the relevant experience, knowledge and/or training (""specialised knowledge"") required by s 79 Evidence Act 1995 to express the opinions contained within her report of 11 September 2013 and also expressed in her evidence of 14 October 2013 at an earlier trial. 

(ii) Even if she had the relevant expertise, the opinions she expresses are not admissible either as irrelevant or not otherwise satisfying the requirements of s 79. 

(iii) Her evidence, if otherwise admissible ""could not"" substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the complainant (s 108C Evidence Act 1995).

(iv) Her evidence if otherwise admissible ought be excluded pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act 1995. 

5The issues raised in the written and oral submissions from the evidence on the voir dire raise consideration of a number of sections of the Evidence Act. 

The Legislation

6s 55 Relevant evidence:

""(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.
(2) In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:

(a) the credibility of a witness, or
(b) the admissibility of other evidence, or
(c) a failure to adduce evidence.""

7s 79 Exception: opinion based on specialised knowledge

""(1) If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule (s 76 of the Act) does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.
(2) To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):

(a) a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their development and behaviour during and following the abuse), and
(b) a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:

(i) the development and behaviour of children generally,
(ii) the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences. ""

8s 108C Exception: evidence of person with specialised knowledge

""(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence given by a person concerning the credibility of another witness if:

(a) the person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, and
(b) the evidence is evidence of an opinion of the person that:

(i) is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge, and
(ii) could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness, and
(c) the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.
(2) To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):

(a) a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their behaviour during and following the abuse), and
(b) a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of that kind, a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:

(i) the development and behaviour of children generally,
(ii) the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences.""

9s 137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

10s 192 Leave, permission or direction may be given

""(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.
(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:

(a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and
(b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and
(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and
(d) the nature of the proceeding, and
(e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence."" 

The issues and submissions

11The evidence the subject of objection concerns opinions expressed by Professor Hayes in respect of what is said to be ""sexualised behaviour"" exhibited by the complainant in the presence of a kindergarten teacher of the complainant, which behaviour is said in the opinion of the Professor to reflect conduct consistent with the complainant having experienced ""sexual abuse"". The evidence of the complainant is the only direct evidence of the assaults giving rise to the charges in the indictment. The accused was engaged in what were described as ""pretext"" telephone conversations which were recorded and a recorded interview with police in which he allegedly made admissions concerning touching the complainant in the genital area, said to be consistent with the specific allegations in Counts 1 and 2, but that the ""touching"" was inadvertent or accidental. It will be suggested to the jury that the complainant's account of the accused's inappropriate touching of him was fabricated, reconstructed or was false. 

12The teacher will say the complainant commenced school in kindergarten in 2012. He was described generally as ""a well-behaved child"". In May 2012 after the Easter holidays, he did some ""silly things"", such as on 11 May 2012 touching other children on their genital area for which he received a warning and was told that his behaviour was inappropriate and the matter was referred to the mother of the complainant. On 22 November 2012, after the accused had been charged, the teacher was told that the complainant had urinated on a student's shoes. On 5 December 2012 the teacher saw the complainant ""grab another student ... on the genital area"". Professor Hayes, who gave evidence of her training, study and/or experience through her report and its attachments and in her evidence on the voir dire and upon documents produced by the defence (Exhibits 2 and 3), has said that the complainant's behaviour was consistent with ""the research on the impact of child sexual abuse ... most, if not all, children who exhibit problematic sexualised behaviour have been victims of sexual abuse; they appear to have learned abnormal sexual behaviour from the abuser and demonstrate inappropriate sexual acting out"". 

13She said that the reported behaviour by the complainant may be classified as ""problematic sexualised behaviour"" from her reference to research. She said that the ""behaviours described by the teacher are strong indicators of (the complainant) having been the victim of sexual abuse"". She said that ""the strongest indication that a child has been sexually abused is inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexual interest and sexual acting out by that child; other effects can include behaviour and/or performance problems at school, and non- participation in social and social activities"". She said that for a child so young ""trying to touch another's genitals and not ceasing the sexual behaviour after adult intervention is atypical and problematic"". She expresses other opinions following upon the general analysis of the incidents the subject of evidence by the teacher. If Professor Hayes can give opinion evidence (in general or specific form) then the teacher's evidence is admissible. 

14Primarily, the submissions made on behalf the accused objecting to the evidence of Professor Hayes address the issue of her expertise in the context of her evidence about her relevant study, training and experience and the documents that were produced relating to her Curriculum Vitae and her publications (Exhibits two and three). Whilst it is conceded that the Professor is quite an experienced clinical psychologist (and) that she is highly renowned in the areas of intellectual disability and crime (that is offenders and victims of crime with intellectual disabilities), her evidence and her Curriculum Vitae do not identify her as ""an expert in problematic child sexual behaviour"". Neither do her qualifications, her publications, or her clinical experience. 

15The Court was taken to particular evidence she gave that in the last five years she had seen about 10 child victims of sexual abuse "" although she said ""I have certainly seen many more adults who have been the victims of child sexual abuse"". Of the 10 that she saw, in ""approximately 5 cases"", she had clients who ""presented with behavioural indicators of sexual abuse"". She was criticised by counsel for the accused for volunteering in cross-examination that, beyond the period defined (by the question asked by the Crown) she had asserted that in fact seen hundreds of children exhibiting problematic sexual sexualised behaviour as a result of a claim of sexual abuse. It is submitted that the totality of the evidence in the contents of the report would not satisfy the Court that she had demonstrated the necessary ""specialised knowledge"" of child problematic sexualised behaviour in order to provide relevant opinions. It was submitted ultimately that her ""general experience"", that is her experience of 30 years clinically and academically dealing with the science of ""human behaviour"", including over that time treating children who are the victims of sexual abuse, does not provide the necessary ""specialised knowledge"". 

16The Court was taken to SLS v The Queen [2014] VSCA 31 and specific submissions were made about that at [23] - [24] of the written submissions. Although the circumstances in SLS were not on even footing with the circumstances in this trial, it was submitted that ultimately the ""vice"" associated with the proposed evidence in SLS, was in effect the same ""vice"" here. That is, that there was an assumption in the opinion of the conduct alleged against the accused having actually occurred and/or had been committed by the accused. 

17The next general submission is that even if she had the relevant specialised knowledge the evidence she gives could not ""substantially affect"" the credibility of the evidence of the complainant (see s 108C Evidence Act 1995). Reference in the written submissions is made to MA v The Queen [2013] VSCA 20, where that Court drew a distinction between admissibility of general opinion evidence concerning how a child ""may react to sexual abuse"" and that usually an expert should not be invited to express an opinion as to the ""actual behaviour of the alleged victim"" (at [100]). It is submitted that given Professor Hayes' expertise and if her opinions were otherwise admissible, she should not be permitted to give evidence about this particular complainant, having not examined the complainant. If she was to give evidence of a ""non specific nature"", this evidence would not ""substantially affect the credibility of the witness"". It is submitted amongst other reasons that it does not substantially affect the credibility of the complainant because it does not substantially support the complainant's account of being sexually abused by the accused, nor the credibility of his claims as to the manner of the sexual assault. 

18Alternatively, it is submitted that the evidence should not be admitted because the unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value, for the reason that the jury would give the evidence of Professor Hayes undue weight, the risk of the jury engaging in tendency reasoning and that the jury will use the evidence to bolster the complainant's evidence relied upon by the Crown for ""context"" purposes.

19The Crown's submissions are that the witness has the relevant training experience and/or knowledge. When her description of her clinical experience, the details of her study and training and her general knowledge is understood in a proper context her opinion has its foundation, not just in a limited number of clinical experiences, but in a much wider field of training, knowledge and experience than suggested by the defence. 

20The Crown, referring to SLS, noted that, putting aside general principles that arise from the case and the outcome of the case, the particular matters the subject of discussion in that case involve three significant areas of distinction from the current case. They were:

(i) the complainant was not the subject of the relevant opinions in SLS, it was the accused in SLS whose conduct was the subject of the opinion.

(ii) the opinions in part were concerned with prospective behaviour, and what it meant in proof of guilt of the accused, rather than an examination of the implications of past behaviour and

(iii) s 108C Evidence Act 1995 was not relevant to consideration of the admissibility of the evidence. 

21There was concern expressed by the Crown about whether the Professor could give evidence about sexualised behaviour generally, or about the particular sexualised behaviour of this complainant having regard to the judgment of the plurality in MA at [100]. 

22Counsel for the prosecution noted that leave was required pursuant to s 108C, but that with consideration of the matters arising under s 192(2) Evidence Act, there was no proper basis to exclude the evidence by not granting leave. The Crown submitted that, bearing in mind the Crown case was dependant upon the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant, the evidence of the Professor ""could"" ... ""substantially affect"" the assessment of the credibility of the witness, with particular emphasis on the word ""could"" in that context. 

Consideration

23I have concluded that Professor Hayes is relevantly qualified to express opinions about the fact that sexualised behaviour (such as that identified by the teacher) is consistent with the complainant having sexual experience, including sexual experience learnt from sexual touching from a third person and to give evidence of the causes and character of ""problematic sexualised behaviour"". This evidence is to be led by the prosecution in the context of the complainant denying that anybody else other than the accused had sexually touched him and the allegation of the complainant and that the accused has sexually touched him ""lots of times"" ""every Sunday"" and ""every holiday"" ""lots of times"". 

24In the context of the way the Crown case is to be conducted, the establishment of the fact of being sexually assaulted is very closely connected to the identity of the accused as the person who sexually assaulted him in circumstances where the complainant only alleges that the accused had sexually dealt with him inappropriately. 

25The objection taken to the expertise of Professor Hayes, particularised in the written submissions and in the oral submissions, involves an analysis that unnecessarily, or unreasonably, compartmentalises her ""training, study or experience"" and underestimates or unfairly categorises the manner in which her opinions are based upon the combination of specific reading on relevant studies and publications with regard to the topic of ""problematic sexualised behaviour of sexual abuse victims"" in the context of her ""study"" and ""clinical experience"". 

26The witness is a Professor of Behavioural Sciences, in the School of Medicine at the University of Sydney. To summarise her qualifications, she holds a Doctorate in Psychology and in her Curriculum Vitae tendered, identified her research interests as ""forensic psychology; offenders and victims of crime with intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder, sex offenders with intellectual disability ... "". Both Exhibit 2 and the more expansive Exhibit 3 set out details of her career and selected lists of publications that she has been responsible for over the last 30 years. I accept that it could fairly be said that are generally speaking her major interest is in the area of ""intellectual disability"" with a particular interest in offenders and victims of the crime suffering from what could be called intellectual disability. This has been the subject of many of her multitudinal publications. She has authored some of the leading Australian publications on the relationship between intellectual disability and offending, as either offenders or victims. Her ""study"" has (by reference to her bibliography, her research interests and the like) included research, treatment and counselling of victims of sexual assault. I accept from the evidence the witness is not only an ""academic"", but has a long career in clinical examination of patients. 

27She has been a consultant and reporter to courts over many years in the general area of ""forensic psychology"". Whilst the witness indicated that in the last five years she had probably seen about 10 child victims of sexual abuse in respect of whom about 5 reported ""sexualised behaviour"" she had ""certainly seen many more adults who have been the victims of child sexual abuse"" from a variety of sources. She gave evidence, which I accept, that over the at least 30 years had seen hundreds of child victims of sexual assault in a clinical setting, more particularly during a period of time when she worked with Emiritus Professor Oates, the Head of the Paediatric Unit at the Camperdown Childrens Hospital a number of years ago. I also accept that, apart from a modest contribution in her writing on aspects of the effect of sexual abuse upon victims of child sexual assault, particularly as adults, including sexualised behaviour, over decades she had to keep up-to-date with the ""literature"" concerning the effects of sexual assault. She had read ""thousands"" of papers upon the effects of child sexual assault. 

28Her report to this Court refers to the specific sources of academic and other discussion on the relationship between sexualised behaviour in children and sexual assault and abuse and there can be no doubt with the combination of her academic and clinical experience, she would have no difficulty understanding and assessing writings by others on this topic. In fact the sources of that writing, the issues that arise and her understanding of them were not the subject of challenge. The 'seven' papers or articles she footnoted were ""the most helpful"" because of their reference to the ""frequency"" the behaviour was likely to appear if a child had been sexually abused and their clinical description and their clinical description. 

29I accept, although it was not expressly submitted, that she is a psychologist not only working and studying in the area of sexualised behaviour of children arising from sexual experience/abuse/assault, if such a limited specialty exists. But in the context of her general academic qualifications, study and clinical experience she is an expert in assessing victims of crime, including those claiming to be sexually assaulted, and has sufficient clinical experience and understanding from her study and reading to express opinions about an aspect of the effects of sexual assault. This is what may be described as a ""subset"" of the understanding of the effect of behaviour of ""perpetrators"" of sexual assault upon their alleged ""victims"". 

30S 79 of the Act states that the ""evidence of an opinion"" of the witness, is required to be ""wholly or substantially based on (specialised) knowledge"" which is ""based on (the witness's) training, study, or experience"". ""Specialised knowledge"" includes a reference to ""specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour"" and a relevant opinion includes a reference to either/or the development of behaviour of children generally and/or the development and behaviour of children ""who have been the victims of sexual offences or offences similar to a sexual offences"".

31Whilst the expert's opinion may not need to meet some standard of probative value to be admissible, courts must be cautious in assessing claims of ""special knowledge "" (Hannes v The Director of Public Prosecutions (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 370 at [292]). No issue was taken concerning the underlying thesis that sexual abuse or assault may and/or can cause sexualised behaviour in people otherwise too young to exhibit such traits. 

32In this matter there was no issue that a person with relevant ""expertise"" could express opinions about the general subject matter and that the relevant subject matter was a matter of ""specialised knowledge"" in respect of which there were people qualified to express relevant opinions. It was not disputed in submission, or in the manner of the conduct on the voir dire, that the area of ""specialised knowledge"" in question lay within the expertise of appropriately qualified ""psychologist"" and/or ""psychiatrist"", being an issue concerned with those behavioural sciences which they are qualified, to varying degrees, to comment upon. There was no issue that either the study of behaviour by psychologists and/or medical practitioners was relevantly an area of ""specialised knowledge"" or was a ""reliable body of knowledge and experience"" (cf HG v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 414 at [58] per Gaudron J: Veleski v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 402, at [82] per Gaudron J, [154] per Gummow and Callinan JJ). I am mindful that there are limits to professional qualification providing a basis for relevant ""specialised knowledge"" such as the illustrations from various authorities identified by the learned author Stephen Odgers SC: Uniform Evidence Law (11th Edition), at p 369 - 370. 

33No issue was identified on the voir dire that would cause the Court to be concerned that the relevant opinions expressed were not ""wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge"". The issues that were identified in HG v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 414 (example at [39] - [44] per Gleeson CJ) were not raised or are not made out here. The real question turned upon the analysis of the evidence of the ""training, study or experience"" of the witness that permitted the relevant opinion to be expressed. 

34Part of an understanding of this issue on the evidence available to the Court was not just the question of her formal qualifications and training, as revealed in her evidence and Curriculum Vitae, but her evidence of her clinical experience over 30 odd years and the fact (which is not disputed) that she had read relevant publications identified in her report which gave rise to the assessment of the evidence of observation of the child by the teacher as part of the literature involving studies in this specific area, having kept ""up-to-date"" with the literature throughout her career. 

35Criticism of her limited clinical experience in the last five years must be assessed along with her more extensive clinical experience of assessing victims of child sexual assault over an extended period of time, both adults and children. One of the criticisms of this aspect of her evidence was that her clinical experience of ""victims of sexual abuse"" if concerned with ""adults"" had no relevance to the assessment of her relevant knowledge training or study. The issue was not examined in detail in cross examination, but on the assumption that the Professor was referring to clinical assessment of adults who had suffered child sexual abuse or assault, this would not preclude experience or understanding of symptomology exhibited or identified by the patient when a child that could be attributed to childhood sexual assault, even if complained of or identified when an adult. 

36The two authorities cited by the accused of SLS and MA ultimately were of limited assistance either in assessing the facts of this case relevant to ""expertise"" and in reaching a conclusion whether a witness had the relevant ""specialised knowledge"" or not. As was conceded by counsel for the accused in the course of submission, and identified by counsel for the Crown, the matters for determination in SLS neither had relevance to the admissibility of the particular opinion by virtue of s 108C of the Act, nor required relevant opinion to be expressed about the conduct of the complainant and the purported relationship between the complainant's behaviour and any particular sexual assault or experience. Further, the opinion sought to be admitted in SLS and excluded was directed at an evaluation of the likelihood of what was described as ""prospective behaviour"" on the part of the accused to prove his guilt, not an analysis of proven behaviour and its relationship with prior sexual experience. 

37As to MA, the Crown identified from [100] of that judgment the caution that may need to be exercised in permitting a specific opinion to be given concerning the particular complainant, as opposed to expressing a general opinion about the relationship between sexualised behaviour and sexual assault. 

38In MA the majority said at that paragraph:

""We should say before leaving the question of expert evidence bearing upon the credibility of complainant that one would ... ordinarily expect an expert to be asked to express an opinion concerning the complainant's actual behaviour after the alleged offending conduct, or the reasons for a parent in the case before the Court for not accepting the complainant's claim all the complainant's actual reaction to the rejection of her claim. These are questions which are within the jury's province to resolve. The occasion should be relatively rare were an expert should be invited to express an opinion as to the actual behaviour of the victim or the victim's parent and whether it advanced the probabilities of a fact in issue. Where a party seeks to have an expert go so far, the obligation of the trial judge under s 137 ... to exclude evidence if its probative value was outweighed by its prejudice may assume greater significance. Such questions do not arise in this trial"".

39The relevant evidence in that case with which the Court was concerned was evidence that a psychiatrist gave on behalf of the Crown with respect of the behavioural framework within which the evidence of the complainant's reactions to the alleged abuse should be assessed and understood. The defence in that matter had relied upon what was said to be ""counter intuitive behaviour"" as reflecting adversely upon the complainant's credibility (MA at [1]-[3], [17]-[21]). The doctor gave evidence to the jury in that matter where he addressed the question of why a child may not call out for help when sexual offending is being committed against him or her when other persons were close by, the nexus between ""common parental reactions to complaints about sexual assault"", ""common behavioural responses of victims"" and why a parent might not accept complainant's allegation of sexual abuse by persons within the family unit and the continuation of family relationships after such a claim [41]-[48]. 

40Each of the Judges of the Victorian Court of Appeal regarded the relevant evidence as admissible under s 108C Evidence Act as an exception to the credibility rule, leave ought be granted pursuant of that section and no issue as to the reliability of the evidence arose such as to enliven s 137 of the Act (noting that the Court was relying upon the reasoning of Dupas [2012] VSCA 328 at [125]-[128], which reasoning is not been adopted in New South Wales: cf XY [2013] NSWCCA 121). Having regard to what has been cited from SLS and MA , noting the basis of exclusion of the evidence in SLS but the approval of the admission of the relevant evidence in MA, ultimately there was nothing identified within those judgments that provided a basis for exclusion of the objected evidence. But the caution expressed in [100] will limit the manner in which the opinion will be permitted to be expressed.

41Here the evidence ""could substantially affect the credibility of the evidence of the complainant"" given that there may be no other reason for the claimed ""sexualised behaviour"" other than the alleged conduct of the accused having regard to the admitted opinion of Professor Hayes.

42Although I am satisfied by the Crown that the witness has relevant ""specialised knowledge"" to express opinions about the relationship between ""problematic sexualised conduct"" and experience of sexual assault or abuse, having regard to the terms of the evidence, her report, and the material which she relied upon as relevant to establishing such a nexus, it is not open to the witness to express opinions as set out in her report that the material provides quite ""strong evidence"" of a particular nexus or fact, or to express any qualitative analysis of the likelihood of a nexus. The witness is entitled to express opinions that particular behaviour of a young child which could be categorised as 'sexualised behaviour' is consistent with particular events that might include conduct that could amount to sexual assault, speaking in general terms. 

43When I gave my ruling in relation to the matter I did not specifically rule as to whether the expert might comment upon the particular facts of the case. Given the witness has not conducted any clinical examination of the child and relies upon the findings from general studies, I have concluded that the witness should only be permitted to express opinions as to what sexualised behaviour is and whether particular sexualised behaviour is consistent with conduct that may constitute sexual assault. Although the opinion in relation to the particular facts case may be relevant, and otherwise admissible under s 108C, it ought be excluded pursuant to s 137 in the context of the caution express by the majority in MA at [100]. 

44There is one other matter that arises that is relevant to limiting the effect of the opinion. The teacher's evidence of the dates of particular events is very specific as to dates. The complainant's account of events before 4 October 2012 is very general. It seems to me that a factual issue for the jury to resolve is whether the complainant's conduct observed by the teacher is sexualised conduct, then, if it has a temporal connection with the proven conduct of the accused. These are factual issues that go to the reliability of the observations of the teacher as they relate to the opinions of Professor Hayes and the reliability of the complainant. The reliability of the evidence of the teacher and Professor Hayes (given that it is otherwise admissible as relevant) is not a relevant matter to the assessment of its probative value (XY [2013]). Otherwise, leave should be granted to lead the evidence relevant to credibility, as no issue arises pursuant to s 192 of the Act to decline the grant of leave, for the reasons advanced by the prosecution in submission. 

45There is one other aspect of this. Although the nub of her opinion could not reasonably be categorised as ""general knowledge"" or knowledge of matters that fall within lay understanding and experience, the proposition that a child aged between three or four and six, who reasonably would not otherwise have learnt or experienced ""sexual behaviour"", would mimic or imitate sexual conduct towards that child by another person such as the conduct involved in sexual assault, is not very far from commonsense or common experience. Anyone who has had children knows the children imitate others, and are capable of considerable mimicry of adults under whose authority they live, play or learn. That sexualised behaviour is consistent with having learnt that behaviour from another source is really no great surprise. Of course, it does not prove that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant. The evidence is limited to the issue of ""credibility"" and it is not evidence to can be used to ""support"" the truth of the allegations, because it is not independent evidence, merely evidence assessing the observed conduct of the child as consistent with an event that the child alleges to have occurred. 

Section 137 

46The probative value of the evidence of the general opinions of Professor Hayes is not out weighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the accused. The matters identified by counsel for the accused as constituting ""unfair prejudice"" when pressed were matters which can be addressed by appropriate direction. The risk of the evidence being contorted to serve an improper purpose, such as involving some form of ""tendency reasoning"", does not stand up to close inspection when the limited purpose of the evidence of opinion is understood. In any event, as with the context evidence, the jury will be warned that the evidence cannot be used for that purpose. Thus the evidence is not to be excluded by exercise of the rule of exclusion available under s 137, nor by the exercise of the discretion available under s 135 Evidence Act 1995. I cannot see how it is established that the evidence would be misused in any way.

Context evidence

47The judgment above is relevant to evidence I permitted to be admitted from the recording of the interview with the complainant which will be the complainant's evidence ""in chief"" of conduct by the accused over a period of time allegedly before the specific event on 4 October 2012 giving rise to Count 2 in the indictment. The matters to which the complainant referred in answer to Q 116 and then between Q 282 and Q 319 of the electronic interview conducted with the complainant on 10 October 2012, I earlier ruled were admissible as ""context evidence"", at least in respect of establishing what is alleged against the accused relevant to Count 1. 

48The Crown case against the accused is that the complainant and his parents started attending the church with the accused was a Deacon on 1 June 2010, the complainant alleges the accused touching him on a number of occasions every Sunday and in the holidays for a period of time before the interview in October 2012 and that the accused admitted in the course of the recorded ""pretext"" calls that he had accidentally touched the complainant in the area of his genitals ""a number of months before"". It is in this context that Count 1 is pleaded. Count 2, particularising 4 October 2012, is based upon a representation by the complainant that the accused had inappropriately touched him the day before he told his parent of being touched by the accused, which occurred on 5 October 2012. He also said then that the accused had touched him many times before. This ""complaint"" would appear to be a representation (or representations) made when they were fresh in the memory of the complainant (cf s 66 Evidence Act 1995). Thus, the general allegations, in answer to Q 116 and Q 282 - Q 319, against the accused provide a context for the particularization of Count 1 and its relationship to Count 2. The evidence of the other touchings serves the purpose of context at least in that limited way, to establish the fact of a relevant touching that coincided with the ""admission"" of the accused, in the context of the complainant's allegation that the touching constituted an indecent assault. 

49The ruling I have made about the admissibility of the opinion evidence, bearing in mind it is agreed that if the opinion evidence is admitted the evidence of the teacher is permitted, makes the ""context"" evidence admissible on a further basis. That is to provide a ""context"" for the observations of the teacher upon which the opinion of the doctor is introduced, even in a general way and not necessarily in comment upon the particular observations (I note my observations in para 44 above). Whether the context evidence is available for a wider purpose, such as explaining delay in complaint, explaining the true relationship between the parties and the like, is a matter that will need to be resolved later in the trial when all the evidence has been admitted and/or heard.

		15 December 2014",2014-11-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704221,Application by Jason Clive McCall pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1620,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1Jason Clive McCall (""the applicant"") makes application pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon him following his conviction for the murder of Robert Ljubic (""the deceased"").
BACKGROUND2On 17 September 2007, following a trial before a jury, the applicant was found guilty of the murder of the deceased, an offence contrary to s. 18 of the Crimes Act 1900.  On 16 November 2007 Barr J sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 22 years imprisonment, commencing on 1 January 2006 and expiring on 31 December 2027.  He set a balance of term of 7 years and 4 months imprisonment, expiring on 30 April, and ordered that the first day upon which the applicant would become eligible for release on parole would be 31 December 2027:  R v McCall [2007] NSWSC 1269.
3An appeal against conviction, and an application for leave to appeal against sentence, were both filed out of time.  The Court of Criminal Appeal refused leave in each case: McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174.
4The applicant now submits that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  In making that application, the applicant has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  
5The principles which apply to an application under the Act are set out in full in The Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 NSW [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5]-[6].
The CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE APPLICANT'S OFFENDING6The circumstances in which the offence was committed by the applicant are set out in full at [1] of Barr J's reasons.  In summary, the applicant, in the company of a Mr Petrou (""Petrou"") and a person known by the pseudonym ""X"", formed a plan to kidnap the deceased for the purposes of extorting money from him.  They met with the deceased on the evening of 23 March 2005 and kidnapped him at gunpoint.  The deceased was restrained and bound, before being taken by X and the applicant to The Gap at Watson's Bay.  In the course of travelling to that location, the deceased was told that he was being taken to see a friend, the implication being that he was going to be tortured, although Barr J was satisfied that at that stage, the applicant and X had no intention of inflicting any serious injury on the deceased.    
7When the vehicle stopped at Watson's Bay the deceased's bonds were cut, other than those binding his wrists.  He was walked up the path to the fence at The Gap and with the assistance of X, the applicant lifted the victim up and over the fence, placing him on the edge of the cliff face overlooking the ocean.  The reasons why the deceased was lifted over the fence were not entirely clear.  Barr J had some doubt as to whether, at that stage, either the applicant or X was minded to push the deceased over the edge, although he found that the risk of the deceased falling to his death in the course of a struggle must have been obvious.
8When the deceased was standing on the edge of the cliff face the applicant demanded money from him.  The applicant then lost his temper, took hold of the deceased, and threw him over the edge and into the water.  The body of the deceased was found in the sea several days later, some kilometres south of the point at which it had entered the water.  The condition of the body was such that the forensic pathologist could not come to a firm view about the cause of death, although he thought that the deceased had probably drowned.THE REASONS OF BARR J9Having summarised the circumstances of the applicant's offending, his Honour reached the following conclusion as to its objective seriousness (at 17]):
""Objectively, the murder was very serious. The offender did it with intent to kill. That intent was formed suddenly but after a violent and cruel kidnapping done in the hope of financial gain. The planning for the kidnap was meticulous and the steps taken were calculated to divert suspicion from the perpetrators. They were persistent in their enterprise. They took on hired help. When the first attempt failed they persevered and set up a further meeting so as to carry their plan into action. They put the deceased into a position that was fraught with danger. All those things were done in company, first three on one and then two on one, up the point immediately before the offender did the act causing death. The deceased never had a chance to avoid danger, to protect himself or to defend himself.""
10His Honour then turned (commencing at [18]) to consider the applicant's subjective case.  In doing so he comprehensively summarised (commencing at [20]) a report of a psychologist which had been tendered on sentence.  His Honour also found (at [23]) that the applicant needed a proper opportunity to rehabilitate himself although he was not persuaded that a case had been made out for an adjustment of the prima facie relationship between the non-parole and the parole periods.  
11Having considered the objective seriousness of the offending and applicant's subjective case, his Honour concluded (at [25]):
""In my opinion the findings I have made demonstrate that this offence was a very serious one, above the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of its kind. I propose to impose a non-parole period bearing in mind that conclusion and the standard non-parole period for murder of twenty years.""
THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL12Following his sentence, the applicant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction and sentence.  Only one ground was sought to be agitated in support of the appeal against conviction which related to a decision given by the trial judge to allow the Crown to cross-examine X pursuant to s. 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 without notice.  This was said to be an error resulting in a substantial miscarriage of justice.  
13McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the court agreed) said (commencing at [26]):
""[26] In so far as the applicant's counsel says being caught by surprise he was disadvantaged I am not persuaded the argument has merit. Every opportunity was offered to counsel to address any problem which had arisen. However, no application was made to have Mr ""X"" recalled and counsel was able to cross-examine Mr Petrou. 
[27] Accordingly I am satisfied that the trial judge was correct in granting the prosecutor leave to cross-examine Mr Petrou and in the circumstances no injustice was occasioned to the applicant. 
[28] Both because the applicant has not established exceptional circumstances and the ground advanced is so lacking in merit in my view the application for leave to appeal out of time should be refused.""
14In terms of the application for leave to appeal against sentence, his Honour said (at [34]-[35]):
""[34] His Honour found that the murder was very serious and above the mid range of objective seriousness. The offence of murder has a standard non-parole period of 20 years. To my mind the sentence which his Honour imposed was entirely appropriate. 
[35] In my opinion leave to appeal the conviction should be refused. Leave to appeal against the sentence should also be refused.""
The BASIS OF THE PRESENT APPLICATION15The basis of the present application is that the sentence imposed by Barr J was infected by Muldrock error.  
16In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being framed in mandatory terms, which required the court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  17The High Court concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period, and that the correct approach was to identify all relevant factors, including any prescribed standard non-parole period, and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.
18The Court specifically rejected (at [28]) the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which is longer or shorter than that prescribed.
19In arriving at these conclusions, the Court held that R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 had been wrongly decided.  
Submissions of the parties20It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the standard non-parole period had operated as a dominant factor in the sentencing and reasoning of Barr J.  It was submitted that on a reading of the sentencing remarks as a whole, it was evident that his Honour's reliance on the decision in Way had infected the sentence.
21In advancing these submissions, and in the course of submissions filed in reply, the applicant's solicitor made it clear that the point which was sought to be made on behalf of the applicant, with respect to both the approach of Barr J and that of the Court of Criminal Appeal, was that standard non-parole period had been given primary, or perhaps even determinative, significance.  The applicant's solicitor emphasised that in sentencing an offender the court is required to consider all relevant factors: Muldrock at [27]; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.  
22It was submitted that when all relevant factors were properly taken into account, the only available conclusion was that contrary to the decision in Muldrock, inappropriate weight had been given to the standard non-parole period during the sentencing process.  It was submitted that the standard non-parole period was used more than a guideline or yardstick, and that this was evidenced by his Honour's finding that the circumstances of the offending were above the mid-range.
23Counsel for the Attorney-General submitted that nothing in the judgment of Barr J was reflective of error.  Counsel submitted that even having regard to the decision in Muldrock, the standard non-parole period remains a guide post and that Barr J's reasons should be construed as a reference to adopting that approach.  Accepting that this was his Honour's approach, it was submitted that no error was made out.  
24Counsel further submitted that there was nothing in the decision of Barr J which suggested that primary, much less determinative, significance had been given to the standard non-parole period and that on the contrary, the language employed by his Honour clearly indicated that he used the standard non-parole period as a guide.
25Counsel also submitted that the reasoning of Barr J did not disclose his Honour having applied a two-stage approach to sentencing.  It was submitted that when his Honour's reasons were read as a whole, the approach that was adopted was consistent with the principles applied in Muldrock, and that all relevant factors were taken into account in determining sentence.
26Finally, counsel submitted that in circumstances where the basis of the application focused on the reasons of Barr J, any reference to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was unnecessary.  
Consideration27In considering the application and the submissions made in support of it, a number of fundamental principles must be borne in mind. 
28Firstly, when considering whether or not a Muldrock error has been made out, it is necessary to view the reasons for sentence as a whole.  Confining examination to one particular passage or sentence which is said to reflect error is not the correct approach: Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265 at [41] and the authorities cited therein; Application by Hoai Vin Tran pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 394 at [22].
29Secondly, merely demonstrating that a sentencing judge sentenced pre Muldrock, following the dictates of Way, will not be sufficient to demonstrate error.  What is to be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on the decision in Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that some intervention is required.  Put simply, the fact that Way was wrongly decided does not mean that all sentences passed before Muldrock, relying upon the decision in Way, are necessarily vitiated by operative error: Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [2]; Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26]; Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117; (2013) 84 NSWLR 328 at [73]; [110]; and [161]-[162].
30Thirdly, the use of the prescribed standard non-period as a guide or yardstick is perfectly permissible.  It reflects an approach which is entirely consistent with the decision in Muldrock: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [43] per Johnson J.
31Finally, the suggestion that the words ""yardstick"" or ""guideline"" might carry some different emphasis or meaning as a consequence of Muldrock is to apply an overly analytical approach to the use of those terms: Butler (supra) at [27].
32The submissions filed in support of the application made it clear that the applicant relied on the fundamental proposition that error lay in the fact that the standard non-parole period was given primary or determinative significance by both Barr J and by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  In my view, for a number of reasons, there is no merit in that submission.  
33Firstly, a reading of Barr J's judgment as a whole makes it clear that in imposing sentence he had regard to all relevant factors, including the circumstances of the offending and the applicant's subjective case.  That approach was entirely consistent with Muldrock and Markarian.  
34Secondly, there is nothing in his Honour's judgment which indicates that he gave the prescribed standard non-parole period primary or determinative significance, nor is there any indication that he applied a two-stage approach to sentencing of the kind described in Muldrock.  His Honour did not focus upon the prescribed standard non-parole period.  On the contrary, his reasons make it plain that he took all relevant factors into account.
35Thirdly, it is clear from his Honour's remarks at [25] that he used the prescribed standard non-parole period as a guide or yardstick.  His Honour's use of the words ""bearing in mind...the standard non-parole period for murder of 20 years"" bespeaks of no other possible interpretation.  That approach was perfectly permissible.
36Finally, his Honour found that the offence was a ""very serious one"" which fell above the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of its kind.  On the facts, that finding was well open to him.  The sentence was imposed following a consideration of all relevant factors.  
37The sole reference to the standard non-parole period made by McClellan CJ at CL in the Court of Criminal Appeal was at paragraph [34] (set out in [14] above).  It amounted to nothing more than a statement that the offence carried a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  That statement does not suggest that the standard non-parole period was given primary or determinative significance, nor does it suggest that a two-stage process was applied to sentencing.  
CONCLUSION38For the foregoing reasons I do not entertain any doubt or question as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance in the applicant's case.
ORDERS39I make the following order:
(i)The application is refused.

		20 November 2014",2014-11-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704225,R v Curtis [2014] NSWSC 1582,"Judgment
1On 3 January 2013 the Defendant was charged by a Court Attendance Notice which alleged that he conspired to commit an offence being a contravention of s 1311(1) and s 1043A(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
2On 11 November 2013 the Defendant's committal commenced in the Downing Centre Local Court.  On 19 December 2013 the Defendant was committed for trial in this Court.
3On 24 March 2009 the Defendant was the subject of a compulsory examination pursuant to s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth).
4On 24 February 2010 an alleged co-conspirator with the Defendant, John Hartmann, pleaded guilty to various insider trading offences.  On 31 March 2010 Mr Hartmann provided his first statement to ASIC for use in proceedings against the Defendant.  On 26 March 2012, after his release from prison, Mr Hartmann provided a second statement to ASIC for use in proceedings against the Defendant.
5On 13 December 2013 the High Court granted special leave from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Lee v The Queen; Lee v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 68.  
6On 22 January 2014 the Defendant's solicitors wrote to ASIC in relation to the possible ramifications of Lee for the proceedings concerning the Defendant.  On 30 January 2014 David Lusty of ASIC emailed the Defendant's solicitors confirming that ASIC officers had read the transcript of the s 19 examination that the Defendant was required to undergo on 24 March 2009.  The email set out details of the further distribution of the transcript within the prosecution team.  
7On 5 February 2014 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) confirmed that the CDPP officers and counsel had or may have read the transcript of the Defendant's s 19 examination.  
8On 7 February 2014 the Defendant was arraigned in this Court.  On that day the trial was set down to commence before me and a jury of 12 on 3 November 2014.  
9Further correspondence passed between the Defendant's solicitors and the CDPP in relation to Lee and its implications for the present proceedings.
10On 21 May 2014 the High Court handed down judgment in Lee v The Queen; Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20.
11On 30 May 2014 the CDPP wrote to the Defendant's solicitor advising that a new case officer had assumed carriage of the matter and that the new case officer had not read the s 19 transcript of the Defendant.  Further correspondence passed between the CDPP and the Defendant's solicitors.  
12On 11 July 2014 the Defendant filed a Notice of Motion seeking a temporary stay of the indictment based on the High Court's judgment in Lee.   The Notice of Motion was heard by Fullerton J on 18 August 2014.  
13On 3 October 2014 Fullerton J ordered by consent that the commencement date of the trial was moved to 17 November 2014.  Later that day Fullerton J made the orders sought in the Defendant's Notice of Motion.  On 10 October 2014 Fullerton J published her Reasons for Judgment: Curtis v R [2014] NSWSC 1392
14On 17 October 2014 the CDPP filed and served a Notice of Appeal from the orders of Fullerton J.  
15From the date Fullerton J published her Reasons, correspondence passed between the CDPP and the Defendant's solicitors with regard to the prosecution team and particularly John Davidson, the principal legal officer with the CDPP who had the carriage of the Defendant's prosecution.16On 24 October 2014 the CDPP filed a Motion to vacate the trial date of 17 November.  The principal reason for that was the pendency of the appeal from Fullerton J's orders.  A subsidiary reason was that Junior Counsel for the Crown was unavailable until 24 November 2014.  
17The Motion came before me for hearing on 31 October 2014.  In written submissions filed two days earlier the Defendant indicated that he consented to the vacation of the trial date on the basis that the Crown agreed to pay costs thrown away.  If the Crown did not so agree the Defendant opposed the application.  In oral submissions Senior Counsel for the Defendant accepted that the trial needed to be vacated because at the time of hearing of the Motion the Crown did not have what Senior Counsel described as a Team B ready to run the trial.  However, the Defendant pressed for the costs thrown away by reason of the vacation of the trial.  
18There was no serious prospect that the Crown would have been ready to run the trial commencing 17 November.  In any event, it wished to pursue its appeal rights because resolution of the issues decided by Fullerton J were likely to impact on the way the trial was run.  In those circumstances I vacated the trial date and stood the matter into the Arraignments List on 6 February 2015.
19The basis for the costs application was that the Crown had done nothing from as early as the beginning of this year when it was put on notice about the High Court having granted special leave in Lee.   The Defendant asserted that the Crown ought to have appreciated how a successful outcome for the Appellant in Lee would impact on the Defendant in the present case.  Further, after the judgment in Lee was handed down the Crown did nothing about engaging a new prosecution team that was untainted by knowledge, derivative or otherwise, of the material in the s 19 examination transcript.  
20The Defendant particularly complained about the failure of the Commonwealth subsequent to the making of Fullerton J's orders.  The Defendant submitted that even if the Commonwealth wished to challenge Fullerton J's orders it could have organised a new prosecution team so that the trial could have proceeded.  This was said to be the case because there was an absence of evidence before Fullerton J from the Crown that could have shown that the prosecution team needed the transcript at the trial.  It was also argued that the transcript was irrelevant to the trial itself.  Accordingly, if the Crown wanted to test the legal position with regard to the ASIC Act it ought not to do it at the expense of the Defendant.  Had the Crown engaged a new trial team the trial could have proceeded.  
21The Defendant also criticised the CDPP for making the present application late after further costs were incurred.  
22The Crown pointed to the terms of a letter from the Defendant's solicitors to the CDPP dated 7 October 2014 to show that the issue was said by the Defendant to be wider than simply organising a fresh prosecution team.  The letter relevantly says this:
Our letter dated 28 May 2014 also noted our view that a conspiracy charge required special contemplation in light of Lee. We noted our assumption that as a conspiracy charge required your consent, we assumed that the content of the examination had been referred to you by those recommending the charge, or that at the least those recommending the charge had the content of the examination in contemplation at the time of recommendation.
On 11 September 2014, we again sought confirmation of our assumption that the examination was taken into account for the purposes of laying the charge against our client, including by you. We received a response on 19 September 2014 informing us that no assumptions about how prosecutorial decisions were made in this case ought to be made and indicating that it was inappropriate for further comment to be given on the matter given our client's notice of motion (referred to above) was yet to be determined. As the notice of motion has now been determined, we request a full response to the matters raised in our letters dated 28 May 2014 and 19 September 2014 now be provided without further delay.
In our view, two possible implications arise from the use of our client's examination transcript for the purposes of laying the charge.
Firstly, if our client's examination transcript was used indirectly by the case officer and/or counsel in making a recommendation that a conspiracy charge be laid, the evidence to substantiate the charge requires fresh consideration. We submit that this consideration ought be limited to the contents of the trial brief and the committal transcript, in particular the evidence of Mr Hartman and Ms Van Heughten. In our view, a review conducted on those terms would confirm that there are no reasonable prospects of conviction. For the avoidance of any doubt, an indirect use of the examination referred to above would include circumstances where the content of the examination was in the case officer and/or counsel's contemplation during the course of preparing any submission to you on the charge but was not directly annexed, excerpted or otherwise referred to in that submission.
Secondly, and alternatively, if our client's examination or a summary of it was used directly by the case officer and/or counsel in making a recommendation that a conspiracy charge be laid, and as a consequence was directly used by you in your consideration of whether or not to consent to the charge, it is our submission that any fresh consideration as to the charge cannot be conducted by an officer within the CDPP's office. Either the charge is unable to be proceeded with in the interests of justice as the statutory power to consent to a conspiracy charge under section 11.5(8) of the Criminal Code (Cth) is non-delegable, or the charge ought to be referred to a State or Territory Director of Public Prosecutions for fresh consideration on the terms outlined above.
We ask that urgent consideration be given to these matters, given the trial is listed to commence on 17 November 2014.
3. Evidentiary implications
Finally, in our letter dated 28 May 2014, we informed the CDPP that in our view all statements taken by those who had access to the details of our client's examination were now tainted and evidence gathered as a result of ASIC or the CDPP's reference to our client's examination has been unlawfully obtained and ought to be inadmissible at trial. Our client's right to challenge admissibility on this basis at trial is expressly reserved.
23The Crown submitted that the effect of that letter is that even if there was a fresh prosecution team the Defence would submit that the Crown had an onus to establish that the materials that formed the basis of the Crown case had not been obtained pursuant to any unfairness caused by the access to the transcript.  That might extend to evidence of the Crown's chief witness, Mr Hartmann.  The Crown submitted that the letter and its implications highlighted that the trial could not proceed until there had been a resolution of the question about whether or not access to and procedural delivery of the transcript is something which is permissible prior to the trial commencing.  
24Subject to limited statutory exceptions, the general rule is that, in criminal proceedings, orders for costs are not made:  Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 557; R v Mosely [1992] 28 NSWLR 735 at 738.  Section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) may be taken to reflect the general rule: R v Mosely at 739.
25Nevertheless, there are procedural ways around the problem.  An adjournment might be granted if a party agrees to pay the costs or undertakes to do so with the result that any remedy would be in contract: R v Mosely at 738.  A similar way of achieving the same result is for the criminal proceedings to be stayed until a costs order is paid.  It would be appropriate to do this where there is fundamental unfairness in permitting the Crown to proceed to trial where the costs have been incurred by the Crown's fault of a relatively serious kind: R v Fisher [2003] NSWCCA 41; (2003) 56 NSWLR 625 at 2 and [46]-[47].
26It is necessary, however, to point to some fault on the part of the prosecution.  Unfairness cannot be established without proof of fault: Petroulias v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 154; (2007) 176 A Crim R 302 at [25]; R v Selim [2007] NSWSC 154.  The power to stay proceedings in circumstances such as for the payment of costs is only to be exercised in the most exceptional of circumstances: Petroulias at [17].
27It seems to me, therefore, that if some delinquency, unconscionability or unfairness on the Crown's part can be demonstrated the Court in the control over its own processes would have the power to stay the trial until such time as the costs are paid.  In the present case, it does not seem to me that there is any such delinquency, unconscionability or unfairness on the Crown's part.  
28The present difficulty that led to the vacation of the trial date was largely brought about by the unfortunate timing in the development of the law as a result of the High Court's decision in Lee v The Queen and its application in the circumstances of the present case by Fullerton J in her judgment.  Three time periods should be briefly considered.  
(a) Prior to the judgment in Lee v The Queen
29Reliance is placed on letters from the Defendant's solicitors to the CDPP of 22 January 2014, 31 January 2014 and 19 February 2014.  These letters sought to ascertain who on the prosecution's side had read or had access to the s 19 transcript.  They made reference to the appeal in Lee v The Queen and its implications for the present proceedings.  The letter of 19 February 2014 concluded by saying:
However, having squarely placed the CDPP on notice of the issue, any application by the CDPP to delay the commencement of the trial arising from a decision in Lee which is favourable to our client will be vigorously opposed.
30However, the position with regard to the law was uncertain throughout this period and until the High Court handed down its decision on 21 May 2014.  It seems to me that it was entirely premature to expect that the CDPP should have an alternative plan in place in case the judgment in Lee was favourable to the Defendant.  Indeed, the CDPP may even have had a cautious view, based on Lee v NSW Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; (2013) 302 ALR 363, that a decision in the pending appeal would be unfavourable to the present Defendant.  
31I do not consider there was any fault on the Crown's part prior to the High Court's judgment in Lee v The Queen.
(b) From Lee v The Queen to Fullerton J's judgment
32After the High Court's judgment in Lee v The Queen further correspondence ensued between the Defendant's solicitors and CDPP.  In a letter anticipating the issues contained in the letter of 7 October 2014 (set out in [22] above), the Defendant's solicitors in a letter dated 28 May 2014 first asked for a new prosecution team to be assembled with those team members being persons who had not had access to the s 19 transcript.  The letter went on to say:
We also view the Lee decision as possibly affecting two further aspects of the prosecution. 
Firstly, in circumstances where a conspiracy charge has been laid, requiring the Director's personal consent, it is reasonable to assume that those recommending the institution of such a charge referred the Director to the content of the examination, or had the content of the examination in contemplation when referring the charge. Please let us know if our assumption is incorrect. If our assumption is correct, in our view the charge is unable to be proceeded within the interests of justice and ought to be discontinued.
Secondly, we contend that all statements taken by those who had access to the details of our client's examination are now tainted and evidence gathered as a result of ASIC or the CDPP's reference to our client's examination was unlawfully obtained and ought be inadmissible at trial. We place you on notice that once those officers who read or were aware of the content of our client's examination are identified, we will seek full details of those persons involved in taking statements in this matter and continuity evidence in relation to each exhibit proposed to be tendered at trial such that an appropriate challenge to admissibility may be brought.
33Thereafter on 11 July 2014 the Defendant filed the Notice of Motion seeking a temporary stay of the indictment based on the High Court's judgment in Lee v The Queen.  The basis for that appears to have been the view taken by the Defendant's solicitors that the responses received from the CDPP were not satisfactory in relation to the persons who were involved in the handling of the prosecution subsequent to the decision in Lee v The Queen.  One reason for the ongoing dispute appears to be the reliance placed by the CDPP on the decision of the Western Australian Supreme Court in R v Catena (No 3) [2013] WASC 97 that was said to demonstrate the distinction between the position with the Defendant's prosecution and that in Lee v The Queen.  That position was argued by the CDPP before Fullerton J but her Honour respectfully disagreed with the judgment of Corboy J in that case.  
34It does not seem to me that any fault can be demonstrated on the part of the Crown in this period.  In particular, once the matters in the letter of 28 May 2014 had been raised by the Defendant, it was necessary for the determination of the matters which ultimately came before Fullerton J.  Organising an alternative prosecution team was not going to solve those matters.  
(c) The period after Fullerton J's judgment
35As noted earlier, Fullerton J made her orders on 3 October 2014 and published her Reasons on 10 October 2014.  The CDPP filed and served a Notice of Appeal on 17 October 2014.  
36I was informed by Senior Counsel for the Crown that there had been some hope that a Bench could be assembled by the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear the appeal a very short time after it was filed.  In that regard the appeal was placed in the Call Over List on 23 October 2014.  However, a timetable for submissions was ordered and the matter was adjourned for further mention to 6 November 2014.  
37Correspondence continued between the parties from the time Fullerton J pronounced her orders.  On 14 October 2014 the Defendant's solicitors wrote saying (inter alia):
... [W]e note that the trial date remains listed to commence on 17 November 2014 and therefore seek for all deficiencies to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
Further, it is imperative that the Crown informs of the new trial team, including counsel without further delay.
38It was in the course of this correspondence that the letter of 7 October 2014 was written, the important parts of which I have extracted above at 22].
39On 17 October 2014 further material and information was supplied by the CDPP in response to the letter of 14 October 2014.  However, the issue of Mr Davidson's involvement remained unresolved.  In a letter of 20 October 2014 the Defendant's solicitors complained that the CDPP had not properly responded to their letters of 7 and 14 October and they noted therefore that:
It is premature for us to bring any application as to the exclusion of evidence, or to be in a position to properly inform the Court of any expected increase in trial length.
40On 23 October 2014 Mr Davidson sent an email to the Defendant's solicitors in these terms:
[F]urther to our discussion about certain matters before court this morning. As indicated, this office is giving serious consideration to making an application to vacate the trial date of 17 November 2014, before the trial judge Justice Davies early next week. As you are aware we have filed a Notice of Appeal against the orders of her Honour Justice Fullerton made on 3 October 2014. The Registrar this morning set a timetable for written submissions and it is next listed before him for mention on 6 November 2014. That leaves between 7 -14 November 2014, for the appeal to be heard, if indeed the Chief Justice agrees to convene a special bench to do so. If the matter is heard, no matter which way it goes, it will leave us little time to prepare for trial given the issues that still need to be resolved between the parties. We have also been informed today that our junior counsel who has been in this matter for some time, Lincoln Crowley, is in a trial in the District Court that has gone well over the estimate and he will not now be available until 24 November 2014, at the earliest. Thus our serious contemplation of making an application to vacate the trial date.
41The following day the Notice of Motion was filed.
42Contrary to the Defendant's submissions, the issue raised as a result of the High Court's judgment in Lee v The Queen and Fullerton J's judgment in these proceedings was never going to be easily resolved by the provision of a new prosecution team.  So much is made clear in the letters of 28 May 2013 and 7 October 2014.  Until the issues determined by Fullerton J have been clarified finally on appeal, whether in the Court of Criminal Appeal or in the High Court, what will be under challenge at any trial will itself not be clarified.  Where the actual laying of the charges against the Defendant is said to be affected by the material from the s 19 examination, let alone the evidence that will be put forward, the provision of a new prosecution team was always going to need to deal with those matters.  It would have been inappropriate for the trial to proceed on the assumption of the correctness of Fullerton J's judgment when there was an appeal pending.  A different outcome in an appeal court would mean that the course of events taken at the trial might then need to be reviewed.  
43There does not seem to me to be any fault in the way the Crown has behaved in the period following Fullerton J's orders.  An appeal had always been contemplated and was promptly instituted.  The Crown relies on R v Catena (No 3).  The legislation considered by Fullerton J was not the same legislation as the High Court determined in in Lee v The Queen.  I mention these matters not to cast any doubt on Fullerton J's judgment but only to highlight the fact that the Crown's approach to an appeal cannot be considered to be an unreasonable one, nor the appeal regarded as hopeless.  
44The timing of events has been unfortunate but that has been brought about by the date on which the High Court delivered judgment and the need to consider the present legislation in the light of that judgment when the trial had been fixed for November 2014.  Once there was to be a challenge based on Lee v The Queen, maintaining the present trial date was always doubtful.  
45In circumstances where no fault has been established on the part of the Crown, there is no basis for an order for costs against the Crown or for any order for a stay until costs are paid.
46I endeavoured to obtain some idea of what costs had been thrown away by the Defendant by reason of the vacation of the trial date.  Nothing was clearly put before me in that regard but the impression I obtained from Senior Counsel for the Defendant was that at best they concerned preparation costs which might be duplicated and, maybe, cancellation fees.  It does not seem likely that the costs thrown away would be very considerable.  
47I accept that the need to vacate the trial is most unfortunate from the Defendant's point of view when he was first charged almost two years ago.  However, at least part of the reason for that was the Defendant's desire to benefit, if possible, from the High Court's decision in Lee v The Queen.  There was nothing unreasonable in that approach on his part but it necessarily led to the present delay.  
48I am not satisfied that any actions or omissions on the part of the prosecuting authorities were unconscionable or unfair that resulted in the Defendant throwing away costs by reason of the vacation of the trial.  
49It is not strictly necessary to consider the subsidiary reason put forward by the Crown for a vacation of the date, namely, the unavailability of the Crown's junior counsel.  That is not the reason the trial date has been vacated.  I would not have considered that counsel's unavailability would have been a proper basis for vacating the date.
50The application for costs by the Defendant and for any further stay until such costs are paid is accordingly dismissed.

2704226,R v Baker; R v Lane; R v Law [2014] NSWDC 267,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing three young men who, after an afternoon and night of drinking, committed a series of very serious crimes. Each of them comes from a relatively stable background and has good employment prospects.
	
	
	The young men I am sentencing are William Peter Baker, Jarrod Mark Law and Ian Lane. Mr Baker has been charged with four offences, Mr Law with three offences and Mr Lane with two offences.
	
	
	All three have been charged with the offence of aggravated break and enter the house of Liam Tomlinson and committing a serious indictable offence, namely, assaulting him and causing him actual bodily harm. They did that whilst in company. That crime is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards it as such a serious crime that it has fixed a maximum of twenty years imprisonment to the offence. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to that offence.
	
	
	Mr Baker, Mr Law and Mr Lane are also charged with assaulting Dominic Faranda, causing him actual bodily harm. Again, they were in the company of each other. That is a crime against s 59(2) of the Crimes Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of seven years imprisonment to that offence.
	
	
	Mr Baker alone is charged with assaulting Kieran Catsicus, occasioning him actual bodily harm. That offence is against s 59(1) of the Crimes Act and has a maximum of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	Mr Baker and Mr Law are together charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, whilst they were in company with each other, to Kieran Catsicus. That offence has a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. Again, Parliament regards that as so serious that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	I formally convict each man of the crimes that I have just recited.
	
	
	Each of the men has pleaded at what Mr H Fitzhardinge, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, agrees is the earliest available opportunity. That means that in due course there will be a discount of 25 per cent in any sentences which will be imposed.
	
	
	Each man was bailed after his arrest, so any sentences would date from today.
	
	
	It is important for a judge to set out in remarks on sentence just what happened to bring about the charges which the judge is sentencing the offenders for. In this case there is an agreed statement of what happened contained in exhibit A.
	
	
	The three men started drinking at about 3 o’clock in the afternoon of 30 November 2013. They drank over a period of about nine hours, consuming two bottles of spirits and a further half bottle of vodka mixed with Red Bull energy drink. At about half past ten that night the three of them left where they were, which was at Singleton Heights. Mr Law and Mr Baker left first. Mr Lane followed and caught up with them. When asked what they were doing, Mr Law replied, “I am going to fight Chris Chaplin.”
	
	
	They got to Mr Chaplin’s house which was also in Singleton Heights. There were a few people inside, including Liam Tomlinson and Dominic Faranda. They were sitting in the lounge room watching a movie. As it happens, Chris Chaplin was not at home. The front door and screen door were closed. Mr Law knocked on the screen door but no one answered. Mr Lane opened the screen door and, as the facts record, “then kicked the main door once with his foot. The main door to the premises flew open”.
	
	
	Mr Law went in first. He was followed by the other two. As they went in Mr Lane told those inside to stay sitting on the lounge. Mr Tomlinson and Mr Faranda did as they were told. Mr Law asked, “Are you Liam Tomlinson?” Mr Tomlinson agreed that he was. In response to that, the facts record that Mr Law “moved forward and repeatedly punched the victim Tomlinson in the head”. Mr Baker “also punched Tomlinson”. Mr Lane remained standing in the lounge, watching the others punch Mr Tomlinson in the head.
	
	
	That assault on Mr Tomlinson, primarily by Mr Law and Mr Baker but with Mr Lane close by, constitutes the aggravated break, enter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which is the main offence which all of the men are charged with.
	
	
	Mr Faranda understandably was concerned for Mr Tomlinson. He stood up and said, “What do you think you're doing?” Mr Lane’s response to that reasonable question was to move towards Mr Faranda and punch him “about five times in the head with a closed fist”. Mr Faranda fell to the floor. Mr Tomlinson broke free and the situation calmed.
	
	
	That punching of Mr Faranda constitutes the second offence that all three men have pleaded guilty to of assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst in company.
	
	
	The assaults on Mr Tomlinson and Mr Faranda were such that they went to Singleton hospital. Mr Tomlinson suffered a swollen and bruised eye and Mr Faranda received bruising and swelling to his face, eyes and head as well as a cut lip.
	
	
	Mr Tomlinson and Mr Faranda returned to the house. By that time Mr Chaplin had turned up. The agreed facts go on to record that about “half an hour later Baker and Law returned” to the house. They walked back there with somebody else. Others arrived. Mr Baker and Mr Law stood outside and called out asking about a Mr Kieran Catsicus. Kieran Catsicus acknowledged who he was and Mr Baker said, “I hear you want to fight me?” Mr Catsicus reasonably replied, “No, I don't want to fight. Why did youse bash Liam?” Mr Law claimed that Mr Liam Tomlinson had threatened to kill him. Mr Chaplin, who, as I said, had come back to his house, called out, “I don't want this shit near my house.” Mr Baker ignored that. He went on, as the facts record, “badgering Catsicus to fight him”. Mr Catsicus repeatedly said, “I don't want to fight you.”
	
	
	There was another man there with Mr Baker and Mr Law. His name was Greg Flynn. It was at his house earlier in the evening that the three had had so much to drink. The facts record that Mr Flynn at this later time “encouraged Baker and Law to bash Catsicus”. They were told that Mr Catsicus was not inside. Mr Baker decided to look for himself and they went through the house with Mr Tomlinson. Mr Catsicus was found in the backyard.
	
	
	The facts then go on to record that Mr Baker “approached Catsicus and said, ‘Don't worry. I just want to talk.’ Catsicus said, ‘I don't want to fight,’ and Baker immediately punched him with his right fist to the victim’s left jaw and he fell to the ground. He felt one his back teeth was loose and he was coughing blood.” In response to that, the facts go on to record that Mr Catsicus “was punched a couple of more times as he lay on the ground”. Mr Baker said, “I’m going to fucking kill you. If you go to the cops I’ll fucking kill you!” Mr Catsicus said that he would not do that. Not content, Mr Baker “punched him to the left cheek with a swinging right punch”. I should add that Mr Baker is a trained boxer.
	
	
	Mr Baker then walked back into the house. He “walked up behind Faranda, punched him on the side of the face” and claimed that he was a liar for not being able to find Mr Catsicus when he went inside. That assault on Mr Catsicus by Mr Baker constitutes the assault occasioning actual bodily harm that Mr Baker alone is charged with.
	
	
	Mr Catsicus walked outside the house. He called triple 0. Mr Baker walked up to him and asked who he was phoning. When he replied, “No one,” Mr Baker responded by punching him to the left cheek with his right fist. Mr Catsicus stumbled backwards. He crouched down near a wall. He protected his head with his arms and body with his knees. In response, Mr Baker “pulled him up by the shirt collar and said, ‘If you go to the cops we will fuck kill you’.” Mr Catsicus said that he would not and he was punched under the right eye for his efforts. He fell to the ground. The facts record that Mr Law “grabbed him by the shirt and dropped him”. Mr Catsicus saw both Mr Law and Mr Baker punch him to the head. Mr Baker “took hold of Catsicus by the hair and the victim felt a kick to his head. Catsicus was dropped to the ground and he feigned being unconscious. He heard Law say, ‘Good night, sweetheart’.” He heard voices moving away. He sensibly lay there for five minutes or so. Mr Faranda came to help him.
	
	
	That last assault jointly by Mr Baker and Mr Law amounts to the crime that they are jointly charged with of being in company recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Kieran Catsicus. The grievous bodily harm is a reference to the fact that not only did Mr Catsicus receive cuts to his nose, lips and head and bruising to both eyes but he received a fractured lower jaw. He had to have surgery to his jaw and “now has a permanent plate and screws in his jaw”. He lost one of his back teeth.
	
	
	Mr Baker and Mr Lane were arrested on that day, 1 December 2013, and Mr Law nearly a week later on 6 December 2013. They were co-operative with the police and generally made appropriate admissions.
	
	
	In this case there is a victim impact statement from Mr Catsicus. It is important for me to read it out because a judge, in sentencing offenders, takes into account the injuries sustained by a victim and the impact on the victim. It repeats that he sustained a broken jaw which required surgery and a plate. He says that he could “not eat properly for an extended period of time, causing weight loss and fatigue”. It records that he still cannot eat properly and the “plate causes considerable ongoing pain”. At the time of his statement he had lost a partial amount of taste and smell, which is part of an ongoing medical investigation to see how to correct it. His headaches have “increased”. Medication is used to help. This happens daily. His jaw clicks and cramps on a daily basis and is very uncomfortable and painful. He talks with a lisp. He is harder to understand. He notes that he has sustained nerve damage and “partial loss of feeling in face”. Not surprisingly, he has nightmares of what happened and flashbacks when he is awake. He has difficulty in sleeping. He has stopped training. He has become less trusting of others and more unsure of himself and is constantly aware of changes in his facial physiology. His behaviour and coping skills have deteriorated. He is much quieter and reserved. He avoids going out. He has a low tolerance and is prone to anger. He prefers to stay alone. He is seeing a counsellor.
	
	
	I have some information about the criminal records of each man. Significantly, Mr Baker has a conviction which was recorded in the Children's Court in 2011 for recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. He was put on probation for a period of two years.
	
	
	Mr Law has on his record a common assault but I should note that no conviction was recorded and he was put on a good behaviour bond. He also has a conviction for possessing a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Mr Lane has a conviction for larceny and the equivalent to trespass.
	
	
	There is for each offender a presentence report. Mr Baker lives in Singleton. He is still nineteen. He turns twenty this Thursday. He is in a relationship with a woman. It is a strong and supportive relationship. He has a child from a previous relationship. He is a first year apprentice carpenter working in the local area. He is well regarded in that work. He told the officer that he recalls being “extremely intoxicated” and attributed the violence which he got engaged in to the use of the alcohol. He appeared to accept that his actions were wrong and had arranged to see a psychologist. The case manager who prepared the report thought that he was a “low risk of re-offending”.
	
	
	Mr Law’s presentence report notes that he is now twenty. He turned twenty earlier this year. He too was therefore nineteen when he committed this offence. He has a “supportive, pro-social family”. He has worked fulltime since leaving school. He “disclosed having substance abuse issues in the past and suffered from a major depressive episode in 2013”. I will return to that. The reporting officer thought that he was a “low/medium risk of re-offending”. He too admitted the use of alcohol at the time. He is an automobile spray-painter apprentice. The report notes a breakdown in a relationship in early 2013 and an employment difficulty and the commencement of prohibited drugs. It records an admission to Lingard private hospital for treatment “after three suicide attempts”. It notes a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder and an acknowledgment by him that “on the night of the offence he did not take his medication deliberately so he could consume alcohol, as he was aware that his medication and alcohol should not be consumed at the same time”. He acknowledged feeling terrible about the offences.
	
	
	The officer preparing Mr Lane’s report assessed him as a “low risk of re-offending”. He had turned twenty in August last year and is now twenty-one. He also comes from a “supportive, pro-social family”. He has been actively involved in sport and “has been employed fulltime since leaving school in 2010”. He acknowledged the wrongness of his actions and articulated the victims’ experiences. Indeed he wanted to speak to the victims directly and to apologise.
	
	
	For Mr Baker, there are very many personal references. They are from people who have known him for many years, some of them all of his life. They also know his family. He is obviously very well regarded as a young man and the references record the remorse which he expressed in being involved in these offences.
	
	
	For Mr Lane, there is a reference from someone who has known him “almost all of his life”. The referee has known the family and Mr Lane’s reflection of the family values of “working hard and being courteous and decent to people he comes into contact with”. The referees in all cases were surprised and disappointed by the behaviour which they were told about.
	
	
	Mr Law has references from his employer and from friends of the family. Again, he is well regarded, as is his family.
	
	
	I need to say something more about Mr Law. Mr Law is the offender who has a psychiatric diagnosis of a major depressive disorder in partial remission. That diagnosis comes from a forensic psychiatrist Dr Christopher Bench. Dr Bench acknowledges the history of three suicide attempts and an admission to a private hospital for some three weeks afterwards. During that period in hospital he was treated with antipsychotic medication. Dr Bench was able to note that his mental health at the time of offending was below normal and that he felt down. There was no note of any psychotic symptoms at the time of the offences. There is no current evidence of any psychotic symptoms. He also has a diagnosis of polysubstance dependence, having abused drugs such as alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines. Dr Bench thought it likely that his dysfunction resulted from his substance abuse and was contributory to the onset of his depressive episode and led to his psychotic symptoms at the time of his admission to hospital. Because of his alcohol consumption, it was obvious that he behaved more impulsively. I imagine all of the three of them did.
	
	
	Mr Law has suffered from a speech defect and I have material about that. I have material about his admission to Lingard private hospital, including confirmation of the prescription of antipsychotic medication. There is a favourable reference from his employers and from a family friend who has known him for some sixteen years, as well as a local man who has known him for some ten years.
	
	
	All three were called to give evidence. Mr J Fitzgerald of counsel called his client Mr Law who disclosed his breakdown in early 2013 linked to a relationship ending and pressure and bullying at work. He has suffered bullying over the years because of his speech defect. Mr Law confirmed his suicide attempts. Mr Law confirmed that he did not follow up with a psychiatrist or a psychologist after he left the hospital. He has good employment and is living at home with his parents. He exhibited contrition for his offending behaviour.
	
	
	Mr I Gray called his client Mr Lane. He is living in a house which he shares. He has a good job as a supervisor at a local abattoir. He has been employed there for over a year. He has never been unemployed. He too appreciates what he put the victims of his crimes through.
	
	
	Mr T Healey of counsel called his client Mr Baker, who also immediately expressed his contrition and regret for what he had done. He was familiar with the victim impact statement. He too is a father and has a three year old daughter Laylah. His employer and his family were present in court, as indeed are relatives and friends of the other offenders. He is good at sport, in particular, as I said, is a trained boxer.
	
	
	Mr Baker’s mother, Janelle King, confirms her son’s contrition and says he understands the seriousness of what he has done. It has affected the whole family, which is an otherwise hardworking family of which Mr Baker is part.
	
	
	Mr Fitzhardinge helpfully provided written submissions in respect of each offender and I heard the legal representatives of each offender in their submissions to me. I have reviewed all of those submissions over the last few days and have taken them into account.
	
	
	I agree that the initial offending of breaking in and assaulting those inside was not a well-planned event but nor was it spontaneous or impulsive. All three men set off and made their way to the house knowing that there was likely to be some violence. The violence occurred in the home of the victims, which itself is an aggravating feature.
	
	
	In addition, Mr Lane was in breach of conditional liberty because he was on a good behaviour bond at the time that he committed these offences. In other words, he had been given a good behaviour bond instead of a prison sentence by another court and he abused that by committing these further offences.
	
	
	To my mind, Mr Fitzhardinge’s submission about the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences is accurate. The first offence committed by all three men falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The assault on Mr Faranda, as Mr Fitzhardinge said, was on a person who was moving to protect somebody else from assault and involved the infliction of a large number of blows. It falls towards the middle of the range of objective seriousness; by that I mean it falls within that range.
	
	
	Mr Catsicus received a blow to the face and fell to the ground, where he was attacked further. In inflicting that offence, Mr Baker committed an offence which fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for that kind of crime.
	
	
	Mr Fitzhardinge submitted that the offence committed by Mr Baker and Mr Law of grievous bodily harm to Mr Catsicus “falls below the middle of the range for offences of its type”, but I accept it did involve “a significant assault upon a defenceless victim whilst on the ground”.
	
	
	I accept that all men are contrite, and genuinely so. I accept their backgrounds and the references which are provided for all of them. The consumption of alcohol does not mitigate their offending at all. The only impact is that it means it was not a cold and calculated crime committed by sober criminals. It was impulsive but, as I have said, nevertheless it had a degree of planning and was not spontaneous.
	
	
	Mr Baker has on his record another offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	All men have good jobs and are well regarded in the workplace.
	
	
	All men will receive a benefit of 25 per cent off the sentences which they would have otherwise received because they have pleaded guilty and the justice system is able to work more efficiently because of those pleas.
	
	
	The men are aware of their need to rehabilitate themselves and their behaviour and they are taking steps in that direction. Their likelihood of re-offending I assess as estimated by the presentence reports.
	
	
	Mr Lane I am sentencing for only two offences, not three or four. Mr Fitzgerald pointed to his client’s reduced culpability as distinct from criminality. He was involved in the same criminal behaviour but his culpability was reduced, so argues Mr Fitzgerald, because of his psychiatric vulnerability. I think there is some force in that, although that force is reduced because of the period of some months between his psychotic episode and the offending. I do not think that his mental health provides, as Mr Fitzgerald argued, substantial mitigation. I will make some very modest allowance for it.
	
	
	Some submissions were made for all three men concerning suspended sentences and intensive correction orders. As Mr Fitzhardinge correctly pointed out and as the Court of Criminal Appeal points out, my job is first to fix the appropriate sentences and then to determine how they should be served. There are points at which the options of suspended sentences or intensive corrections orders are not available. I turn now to fix the what I regard as appropriate sentences.
	
	
	I will first indicate overall sentences and then indicate the discounts. In respect of Mr Baker for the first offence I would regard an appropriate penalty as four years imprisonment; for his second offence, three years imprisonment; for the third offence, three years imprisonment; and the fourth offence, four years imprisonment. Those are the offences contained in counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the indictment.
	
	
	In respect of Mr Law, I would have regarded an appropriate sentence given his engagement in count 1 as four and a half years imprisonment but I am going to reduce it to four years imprisonment because of a slight adjustment concerning his psychiatric condition. For count 2, an appropriate sentence is three years imprisonment; and for count 4, four years imprisonment.
	
	
	For Mr Lane, an appropriate penalty for count 1 is four years imprisonment; and for count 2, three and a half years imprisonment.
	
	
	Each man, as I said, has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I would therefore discount each of those appropriate sentences that I have indicated by 25 per cent.
	
	
	So the discounted sentences are these for Mr Baker. Count 1, three years imprisonment; count 2, two years and three months imprisonment; count 3, two years and three months imprisonment; count 4, four years imprisonment. [Sic. This should be three years imprisonment.]
	
	
	For Mr Law, the appropriate discounted sentences are count 1, three years imprisonment; count 2, two years and three months imprisonment; count 4, three years imprisonment.
	
	
	For Mr Lane, for the first count, count 1, his discounted sentence is three years imprisonment; and for count 2 his discounted sentence is two years and six months imprisonment.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind that there were separate crimes and in some instances separate victims of these crimes. It is open to accumulate the sentences but that would mean that sentences imposed would far outweigh the totality of the criminal activity which the men engaged in. I will accumulate the sentences in one moment. In due course I will fix an aggregate sentence for each of the offenders.
	
	
	For Mr Baker, I would accumulate the sentences for count 1 and count 2 by three months, so that the sentence would be three years and three months. I would accumulate count 3 for Mr Baker by six months, so that the ongoing total would be three years and nine months imprisonment. For the final count 4 for Mr Baker, I would accumulate that by three months, so that the total sentence for Mr Baker will be four years imprisonment.
	
	
	For Mr Law, I would accumulate the first two sentences by three months, so that the sentence would be three years and three months. The last sentence I would accumulate by six months, so that for Mr Law his sentence will be three years and nine months.
	
	
	For Mr Lane, I would accumulate the sentences by three months, so that for Mr Lane his overall sentence will be three years and three months imprisonment.
	
	
	Normally for Mr Baker’s four years of imprisonment a non-parole period would be three-quarters of that period. However, there are special circumstances which allow me to reduce that non-parole period. Instead of 75 per cent, I will fix each non-parole period at 50 per cent.
	
	
	The factors which are relevant in this case in making that adjustment are these. For each man it is his first time in custody. For each man he is quite young, not recently adult. And for each man there needs to be an opportunity for supervised parole to help with the rehabilitation.
	
	
	For Mr Baker, I would regard the non-parole period as therefore being two years imprisonment.
	
	
	For Mr Law, the non-parole period will be one year and ten months imprisonment.
	
	
	For Mr Lane, the non-parole period will be one year and six months imprisonment.
	


HIS HONOUR: Gentlemen at the Bar table, in a moment I am going to sentence your clients. Mr Healey, the sentences will date from today. Your client’s is, and I say this with respect, relatively straightforward. It’s four years with a two year non-parole period. Mr Ramsland, you're appearing for Mr Law, am I right?

RAMSLAND: Yes, your Honour, yes.

HIS HONOUR: Your client’s 50 per cent is one year and ten months. I'd just like you to check that. And Mr Gray, I'd just like you to check your client’s non-parole period of one year and six months. In each case I have halved it but where it is a half month I’ve gone down by a month rather than up. Do you mind both checking that, please? Just tell me when you've done that. Mr Ramsland, have I got--

RAMSLAND: Yes, if you're rounding down, your Honour, that’s correct.

HIS HONOUR: I’ll round it down to one year and ten months.

RAMSLAND: Otherwise it would be twenty-two months point five, so that’s correct.

HIS HONOUR: Exactly, okay. Mr Gray? Take your time.

GRAY: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: No, look, I might have that wrong.

GRAY: I think there’s a month--

HIS HONOUR: No, look, you're right, you're right.

GRAY: One year five--

HIS HONOUR: It should be one year and seven months.

GRAY: Seven months.

HIS HONOUR: Yeah. It should be one year and seven months for Mr Lane. Does that sound right? Yep, all right.


	
	Mr Baker, I have indicated the sentences I would have imposed for each of the four offences. I impose an aggregate sentence for each of those offences of four years imprisonment and I specify a non-parole period of two years. Your sentence will commence today, which is 11 November 2014, and will expire on 10 November 2018. The non-parole period will commence today, 11 November 2014, and will expire on 10 November 2016.
	
	
	Mr Law, I have indicated the individual sentences I would have imposed for your three crimes. I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of three years and nine months imprisonment. There will be a non-parole period of one year and ten months. Your sentence commences today, 11 November 2014, and expires on 10 August 2018. Your non-parole period of one year and ten months commences today and will expire on 10 September 2016.
	
	
	Mr Lane, I have indicated the individual sentences I would have imposed for you. Instead of those, I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of three years and three months. That commences today, 11 November 2014, and will expire on 10 February 2018. The non-parole period for you is one year and seven months. It commences today and will expire on 10 June 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR: Mr Fitzhardinge, Mr Healey, Mr Gray and Mr Ramsland, if you would please take your time to check the figures.

RAMSLAND: I’ve done that, your Honour. They're correct.

HEALEY: Yes, I’ve had a look, your Honour, and mine are correct, your Honour.

GRAY: I agree, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And the non-parole periods?

GRAY: Yes, your Honour.

FITZHARDINGE: I agree, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, good. I don't fix conditions of parole because they're all over three years.

FITZHARDINGE: That’s right, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I’m going to explain again in a moment but anything else

Mr Fitzhardinge? I don't think so.

FITZHARDINGE: The only potential issue is whether the report of Dr Bench might--

HIS HONOUR: You are right. You are quite right. Thank you for reminding me.

FITZHARDINGE: --accompany the offender Law.

HIS HONOUR: You are quite right. Dr Bench’s report, that was Mr Law and you're appearing for him, Mr Ramsland?

RAMSLAND: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Would you get your client’s instructions? It could be today or in the next day or so. The question is this, whether the medical material which was tendered, particularly Dr Bench’s report--

RAMSLAND: I think it’s appropriate.

HIS HONOUR: --should accompany him?

RAMSLAND: Yes, your Honour, I understand that.

HIS HONOUR: You have instructions to tell me that?

RAMSLAND: He’ll be satisfied with that, yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. I’ll make arrangements for that to go, perhaps not in custody with him today but there’s a fax number which we have which will be sent to those who assess.

RAMSLAND: Yes, your Honour. Thank you.


	
	Mr Baker, you are eligible for parole on 10 November 2016, two years from today. The Parole Authority will assess your eligibility. Once you are released on parole, your overall sentence sends on 10 November 2018.
	
	
	Mr Law, your non-parole period will end on 10 September 2016. You are eligible for parole then. The Parole Authority assesses your eligibility. Once released on parole, your overall sentence will expire on 10 August 2018.
	
	
	Mr Lane, your non-parole period will expire on 10 June 2016. You too will be eligible for parole on 10 June 2016. The Parole Authority assesses your eligibility at that stage, and your overall sentence will expire on 10 February 2018.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I do not think there is anything else, apart from the fact that it is now ten past six and there are a lot of people who are here well beyond the time that they expected to be here, and I should record my appreciation for that.

		12 February 2015",2014-11-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704228,Carolan v State of New South Wales [2014] NSWSC 1566,"Judgment
1In the evening of 11 August 2011 in the foyer of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, Mr Sean Carolan (the plaintiff) was found to be in possession of a wheeled suitcase. Inside that suitcase was $702,000 in cash, comprised of $50 Australian notes bundled together with rubber bands (the cash). The cash was seized by officers of the New South Wales Commissioner of Police (the second defendant, to whom I shall refer simply as the defendant). They have retained it ever since. The plaintiff has not been charged with any offence.  Nor are there any civil proceedings on foot with regard to the cash.
2Pursuant to ss 219 and 229 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) (LEPRA), the plaintiff seeks an order that the cash be returned to him. The issue for determination by me with regard to that claim is: am I satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff is ""a person who appears to be lawfully entitled to the property""?
3Furthermore, incidental and ancillary orders are sought, pursuant to s 219(2)(e) of LEPRA, for interest on the cash from the date of its seizure at the rates prescribed by the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
4In the alternative, the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the cash has been ""wrongly detained"" by the defendant. That claim is based upon the proposition that the plaintiff has proven on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has committed the intentional torts of detinue or conversion.  The questions for determination by me in that regard are: has the plaintiff established either of those torts on the balance of probabilities?  If so, should I exercise my discretion to grant a declaration to that effect?
Basis of application
5The position of the plaintiff as to the provenance of the cash may be summarised as follows.  It is derived from documentary and oral evidence placed before me.
6Mr Andrew McManus, an Australian concert promoter, wished to bring the well-known Texas trio ZZ Top to Australia for a series of concerts. Mr McManus was short of funds due to various issues he had had with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). He arranged for a Mr Owen Hanson, ""a very good friend of a friend"" of Mr McManus who was based in Los Angeles, California, to pay Mr Harold Colfman, the manager of the band, the sum of US$700,000 in cash. Mr Hanson arranged for that sum to be delivered to a ""runner"" of Mr Colfman. No receipt, or other record of that transaction, was sought, or provided, or otherwise generated.
7The result of Mr Hanson paying Mr Colfman US$700,000 in order to advance the business interests of Mr McManus was that Mr McManus owed Mr Hanson that sum. It was arranged between Mr McManus and Mr Hanson that the sum would be repaid from cash gate receipts derived from the tour once it concluded.
8Mr Hanson came to Australia and stayed in an apartment in Kent Street Sydney. In order to repay the debt, Mr McManus arranged for Mr Craig Haeusler, who worked in ""security"" for Mr McManus, to deliver AU$702,000 in cash to Mr Hanson at his apartment (that unusual sum reflected the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the US dollar at the time). That occurred in May 2011. Mr Hanson counted the money in the presence of Mr Haeusler and was satisfied with it. The debt was thereby repaid, with the result that Mr Hanson was in a foreign country with a suitcase containing AU$702,000 in his possession. Again, no receipt or other documentary record of the transaction whereby Mr McManus repaid his substantial debt to Mr Hanson was generated.
9Whilst in Australia and in possession of the cash, Mr Hanson decided to visit his aunt, who lived in Perth, Western Australia. He flew there, and remained in that city for at least several days. Whilst several thousand kilometres from Sydney, he was content to leave the cash hidden in the roof cavity above the bathroom of the apartment in which he had been staying in Kent Street.
10Later, Mr Hanson returned to Los Angeles. He did not seek to deposit the cash in an account with any financial institution in Australia or in the United States. Nor did he seek somehow to take it with him to California. Nor did he entrust it to anyone else in Australia. Instead, he adopted the same procedure as before: he hid it above the bathroom in the rented apartment. On that basis Mr Hanson travelled to the other side of the Pacific Ocean and stayed there for some weeks. After that, he returned to Sydney. 
11At that time, Mr Hanson was attending the Fitness First gym in Bond Street Sydney. Through two American women known by the nicknames of ""Soul"" and ""Barb"", he was introduced to the plaintiff, who was employed as a personal trainer there. Over several weeks, Mr Hanson trained intensively with the plaintiff. They got to know each other, and the plaintiff explained that he had a plan to develop ""effortless"" weight loss clinics. Mr Hanson realised that the technology available in Sydney was less advanced than the technology available in such places as Beverly Hills, California. He decided to invest in the business of the plaintiff, including by way of purchasing a particular electronic device and having it shipped to Sydney.
12The result was that Mr Hanson decided to invest very substantial sums in the business of a personal trainer whom he had known for several weeks in a country far from his home.
13Mr Hanson decided that he would invest somewhere between $150,000 to $250,000 of the $702,000 in the business of the plaintiff. And he would do so by giving the plaintiff that sum in cash. In order to do so, on 11 August 2008 Mr Hanson invited the plaintiff to his apartment in Kent Street. 
14Earlier that day, the red motorcycle of the plaintiff had broken down outside a restaurant in Woolloomooloo. The plaintiff had left it there and checked into the Hilton Hotel. He walked from the Hilton Hotel to the apartment of Mr Hanson in Kent Street. There Mr Hanson provided the plaintiff with the suitcase full of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. The plaintiff caught a taxi from the apartment back to the hotel. Bearing in mind that his motorcycle had broken down, he was intending somehow to travel to his home near Penrith and keep the cash there. In due course, he was proposing to set up accounts in which the money could be retained more securely.
15In the meantime, an anonymous caller had telephoned the police and told them that the person staying in a certain room at the Hilton Hotel was in possession of a pistol. The police attended and discovered that the name of the plaintiff was registered against that room number. The police met the plaintiff when he arrived in the foyer wheeling the suitcase behind him. They searched him and located the cash in the suitcase. He was arrested on suspicion of having committed the offence colloquially known as ""Goods in Custody"", pursuant to s 527C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The suitcase was seized. The plaintiff provided the police with a version of events by way of a recorded interview in the early hours of the morning of 12 August 2011. No charge was preferred against the plaintiff, and he was permitted to leave the police station. As I have said, the cash remained behind, and it has been with the police ever since.
16The foregoing constitutes a very broad outline of the case for the plaintiff. It is convenient now to set out the legislation upon which the primary application is founded.
Applicable legislation
17Although the application was originally said to be founded on ss 218 and 219 of LEPRA, in discussion it became clear that the former section, based as it is on demonstration of a particular state of mind of a police officer about which there is no evidence before me, is not directly relevant.
18Section 219 of LEPRA is as follows:
219   Disposal of property on application to court
(1)  A court may, on application by any person, make an order that property to which this Division applies:
(a)  be delivered to the person who appears to be lawfully entitled to the property, or
(b)  if that person cannot be ascertained, be dealt with as the court thinks fit.
(2)  In determining an application the court may do any one or more of the following things:
(a)  adjust rights to property as between people who appear to be lawfully entitled to the same property or the same or different parts of property (including adjusting rights by extinguishing, whether in whole or in part, any interests in the property of such persons),
(b)  make a finding or order as to the ownership and delivery of property,
(c)  make a finding or order as to the liability for and payment of expenses incurred in keeping property in police custody,
(d)  order, if the person who is lawfully entitled to the property cannot be ascertained, that the property be forfeited to the Crown,
(e)  make any necessary incidental or ancillary orders.
(3)  Property ordered to be forfeited to the Crown:
(a)  in the case of money, is to be paid to the Treasurer for payment into the Consolidated Fund, or
(b)  in any other case, may be sold by or on behalf of the Commissioner at public auction and the proceeds of sale are to be paid to the Treasurer for payment into the Consolidated Fund.
(4)  If the property is not money or is not fit or suitable for sale, or fails to sell at public auction, it is to be disposed of in accordance with the directions of the Commissioner.
(5)  An order under subsection (2) (a) that provides for the extinguishment, whether in whole or in part, of any interest in property operates to extinguish the interest according to its tenor.
19It can be seen that the plaintiff relies in particular on ss 219(1)(a), 2(b) and (2)(e).
20The solicitor for the defendant did not submit that I would make any alternative order such as forfeiture to the Crown, pursuant to s 219(2)(d).  Nor did he dispute that, in light of the value of the cash, the application had been brought appropriately in this Court, in accordance with s 229 of LEPRA.  He simply submitted that the test in s 219(1)(a) had not been made out.
21I turn now to consider the evidence, which was in the main placed before me by way of affidavits and included the cross-examination of the plaintiff, in a little more detail.  
Aspects of evidence considered broadly chronologically
22Detective Sergeant Grant Findley swore an affidavit on 11 June 2013 that was read before me by the defendant.  The affidavit attaches a number of documents that disclose the following chronological background.
23According to a COPS entry that was exhibit GF-1 to the affidavit of Detective Sergeant Findley, on arrest the plaintiff told police that ""he didn't know what was in the bag and that [Mr Hanson] gave him the bag to mind for the night"". That is in sharp contrast to the position of the plaintiff before me.
24As I have said, the plaintiff engaged in a recorded interview in the early hours of 12 August 2011, and a transcript of it became exhibit GF-2 to the same affidavit.
25In summary, the plaintiff explained that he worked as a personal trainer and had known Mr Hanson for a short period of time. He was expecting to receive between $100,000 and $250,000 as a cash investment, and was surprised to be informed by the police that in fact the suitcase contained very much more than that.
26His intention if he had not been arrested had been to take the money to his home in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. He would have been unable to bank the money, because he had no appropriate account set up. The business in which Mr Hanson had invested was to be called ""Change for Life"", and the plaintiff was trying to get it ""off the ground"".
27The plaintiff claimed that Mr Hanson told him that he had lost a lot of money gambling at the Star Casino, and that he wished the plaintiff to take possession of all of the cash so that Mr Hanson did not lose any more of it.
28The plaintiff believed that Mr Hanson was involved in the ""money trade, sport trade, overseas"".
29When the plaintiff picked up the bag, he did not have a ""sneak peek"" in it.
30In the process of setting up his business, the plaintiff had consulted a man whom he believed to be a solicitor, Mr Nigel Cade.
31On 20 December 2011, Mr Hanson signed a statutory declaration that was provided to the police (exhibit GF-7 to the affidavit of Detective Sergeant Findley). However, because Mr Hanson was not available for cross-examination before me as requested by the defendant, the statutory declaration was not read by the plaintiff as going to the truth of its contents, and accordingly I shall not discuss them.
32On 14 March 2012, Mr McManus sent an email marked ""without prejudice"" to the solicitor for the plaintiff (exhibit GF-4). Mr McManus explained that ""the funding that is currently being held by the NSW police is monies that were loaned to me by Owen Hanson covering off on the ZZ Top tour held in May of 2011."" Mr McManus also explained that ""I now need these funds back urgently to fund Lenny Kravitz tour as I have had to repay Owen [Hanson] separately."" 
33In short, it seems that at that stage Mr McManus was asserting that the money seized from the plaintiff in fact belonged to Mr McManus.
34On 4 April 2012, Mr McManus engaged in a recorded interview with police (exhibit GF-5). The last time he had seen Mr Hanson was ""in Aspen, then LA"" in February 2011 (Q106). In summary, the position of Mr McManus was that the money was ""not the proceeds of crime, it's the [proceeds] of Andrew McManus"" (Q293).  A little later, Mr McManus said ""it's pretty obvious, though. I gave some one 700 large, and you've found someone with 700 large"" (Q339).
35On 12 April 2012, Mr Haeusler engaged in a recorded interview with police (exhibit GF-6). In a nutshell, his position was that he was employed by Mr McManus. He explained the circumstances in which he had delivered the $702,000 on behalf of Mr McManus to Mr Hanson at the apartment in Kent Street. He himself had received the cash from Mr McManus contained in ""just bags"". Mr Haeusler kept the money hidden in his own apartment for four to five days before delivering it to Mr Hanson.
36On 24 April 2012, Mr Hanson sent some taxation records to the solicitor for the plaintiff (exhibit GF-8). They were an unsigned US individual income tax return for the year 2011. Under ""total gross receipts"" is an entry for $725,000. Under ""total other expenses"" is an entry for $707,115.
37On 5 June 2012, Mr Nigel Cade made a statement to police (exhibit GF-9). In short he explained that he was a ""qualified Loss Adjuster/ Insurance Assessor"".  He explained that he had developed a friendship with the plaintiff about two years before then, and that in late June or early July 2011 he had provided the plaintiff with advice about setting up a weight loss business. Although his statement referred to a number of handwritten notes of Mr Cade that were attached to it, they were not placed into evidence before me.
38Mr Cade said of Mr Hanson that he ""was never staying in the same hotel for more than about 3 nights in a row, or he would have more than one hotel booked at the same time."" He also referred to a meeting with Mr Hanson after the cash had been seized. At that meeting Mr Hanson told Mr Cade that, the evening before, Mr Hanson and the plaintiff had been at the Star Casino in Sydney, and the plaintiff had had a heated argument with a gentleman known as ""Robinhood"".
39On 4 July 2012, Mr Hanson engaged in a recorded interview with New South Wales police by telephone from Los Angeles (exhibit GF-10).
40He explained that the first time he arrived in Australia was on 11 May 2011. He met the plaintiff at the end of May or the beginning of June. He departed Australia on 19 June 2011 for the United States, and then returned on 7 July 2011. He departed for good, after the money had been seized, on about 15 August 2011.
41 He explained how he had shipped over an $80,000 machine called the ""Zerona Laser"" (Q64). He was planning to invest ""about $100,000"" (Q83).
42When asked by the Detective to provide the details of the provenance of the $702,000, Mr Hanson replied ""Do you want me to tell you the, the full story of how basically this money was laundered and et cetera?"" (Q102)
43Mr Hanson explained that the arrangement whereby he would provide the money to Mr Colfman, and thereafter be reimbursed by Mr McManus, was a ""sweetheart deal"" for Mr Hanson (Q103-4). He recounted how he met Mr Haeusler in a bar before Mr Haeusler delivered the cash from Mr McManus (Q114). Mr Haeusler delivered that cash at ""the end of May. Maybe June"" (Q120). Mr Hanson recalled that the suitcase weighed ""eighty pound"" (Q135). After that, he visited his aunt in Perth.  Thereafter he departed Australia for the first time, on both occasions leaving the cash behind in the location and circumstances that I have already recounted.
44He explained that the entry on the 2011 tax return that referred to ""total gross receipts of $725,000"" related to the cash found in the possession of the plaintiff (Q189). He denied that he knew a man who called himself ""RobinHood"", although he did recall meeting a man who seemed to be ""from Italy"" in the company of the plaintiff (Q199). He also had a memory of the advisor Mr Cade (Q211-7).
45Mr Hanson denied that he had said anything to the plaintiff about needing to give money to the plaintiff in order to avoid Mr Hanson losing any more of it in the Sydney Casino (Q223-5). He told the police that he told the plaintiff that ""I wanted [him] to take the money because I'm moving back to the US and I want it in a safe spot. And I told him to put it in his farm in Penrith"" (Q226). 
46On 25 May 2013, the plaintiff swore an affidavit. His position in short was that he believed that the money given to him by Mr Hanson was legitimately obtained. He had been informed by Mr Hanson ""that he wished to invest these monies in a company"" of which the plaintiff was a director. He explained that his position was that he is ""responsible and liable to the investor for these funds"", and was seeking the return of them.
47In cross-examination before me, the plaintiff accepted that in his original recorded interview he had not mentioned that, to his knowledge, Mr Hanson was involved in the promotion of music tours.
48He agreed that he had not known Mr Hanson for very long when he received the suitcase. He also agreed that he was surprised to discover that it contained over $700,000 in cash, because he was expecting ""somewhere between 100 and 250"".
49The plaintiff agreed that it was ""extraordinary"" for somebody to give a suitcase containing that amount of cash to ""a person who was their personal trainer"".
50He confirmed that, if he had not been arrested, he would have taken what he believed to be something in the order of $250,000 cash to his home. No accounts had been set up to receive the funds at the time of receipt, even though he was expecting to receive the investment monies from Mr Hanson.
51The plaintiff confirmed that it was his position that Mr Hanson had told the plaintiff to take the money because Mr Hanson was concerned about losing more of it at the Sydney Casino.
52The plaintiff confirmed that he believed ""at the time that the money was legitimate, absolutely.""
53Finally, the solicitor for the plaintiff gave evidence before me.  He was cross-examined about the state of the evidence, including the unavailability of some witnesses; I consider that those exchanges do not require further analysis in this judgment.
Submissions of the plaintiff
54Counsel for the plaintiff accepted that the way business was done as outlined above was ""unorthodox"". He also accepted that aspects of the evidence were ""extraordinary"".
55Nevertheless, he submitted that it is significant that no charges have been laid; that any previously available summary charges are now statute barred; that no civil forfeiture proceedings are on foot; and that there is no explicit evidence that an investigation of any kind is ongoing.
56With regard to the latter, he invited my attention to authorities to the effect that the police cannot retain items in the hope that one day they may become part of a prosecution: see generally Gordon v Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police (1910) 2 KB 1080 at 1096-7; McQueen v Hawi [2008] NSWSC 136 at [19]; Fantakis v Commissioner of Police [2013] NSWSC 685 at [30].
57In short, his position was that there is nothing to gainsay the proposition that his client was in possession of the money lawfully, remains entitled to it, and should have it returned to him. 
58He also submitted that, in cross-examination of the plaintiff, the solicitor for the defendant had not sufficiently complied with the well-known rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 HL to permit me to find against the application on the basis of rejecting the credibility of the plaintiff.
59In support of the proposition that the police had committed an intentional tort, he queried whether the police in truth acted lawfully when they searched the plaintiff, arrested him, and seized the cash on 11 August 2011.
60In discussion between Bench and Bar table, he accepted that in order to make out detinue or conversion, one must demonstrate a lawful right to the property in question.  In that regard, he accepted that it is inconceivable that, for example, a person could sue in this Court if he or she entrusted a large quantity of heroin to another person for a certain period pursuant to an agreement, and the other person refused to return it at the end of that period. 
Determination
61Turning first to the submission that the police did not behave lawfully on 11 August 2011, I respectfully reject that proposition on the evidence placed before me.  I do so for the following reasons.
62As a result of the phone call and its particularity with regard to the room in which the plaintiff was staying, I consider that the police had reasonable grounds to suspect that he was in possession of a pistol, and could therefore stop, search and detain him pursuant to s 21(1)(b) or (c) of LEPRA. Once they located $702,000 in cash in the possession of the plaintiff in a suitcase in a hotel lobby, I consider that they were soundly within their rights to arrest the plaintiff with regard to a charge pursuant to s 527C of the Crimes Act, and to seize the cash pursuant to s 23(1)(c) or (d) and s 23(3) of LEPRA.  I respectfully reject the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff on those topics.
63As for the rule in Browne v Dunn, it is true that the solicitor for the defendant did not explicitly put to the plaintiff in the witness box that his evidence was a lie.  But I consider that the cross-examination fairly and sufficiently made clear to the plaintiff that the position of the solicitor for the defendant was that the plaintiff was not lawfully entitled to the cash.
64Turning to the central issue, it was not in dispute between the parties that, pursuant to s 219 of LEPRA, the plaintiff bears the onus of persuading the Court that he appears to be lawfully entitled to the cash: see Application of Hampton (1972) 3 DCR 59 at 61; Anderson v Judges of the District Court (NSW) (1992) 27 NSWLR 701 at 710-11.  To state my determination succinctly, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities of that proposition.
65Of course, I have not determined to the criminal standard, the standard discussed in Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336, or indeed the civil standard, that anyone has told lies to the police, or indeed to the Court by way of affidavit or in the witness box. It is simply a matter of not being satisfied of the affirmative proposition for which counsel for the plaintiff contends on the balance of probabilities.  I have come to that view for the following reasons.
66First, despite the absence of direct evidence to that effect, I am prepared to infer that an investigation by the police into the provenance of the cash may be continuing. I accept that it can be harder to follow transfers of money and to locate and speak to individuals internationally than domestically. Having said that, I also accept that the situation cannot remain in abeyance indefinitely, and that eventually the police will have to state determinatively whether or not they propose to bring any proceedings either against the plaintiff or with regard to the money. However, whilst it is true that over three years have passed since the money was seized, I do not consider that that point of determination has yet been reached.
67Secondly, there is no satisfactory explanation why very large sums of money were being transferred in cash and without any documentary trail.  I include in that the transfer by Mr Hanson to Mr Colfman; the transfer by Mr McManus to Mr Hanson via Mr Haeusler; and the transfer from Mr Hanson to the plaintiff.
68Thirdly, there is no satisfactory explanation why Mr Haeusler would choose to keep hundreds of thousands of dollars in a rented apartment for a number of days before providing it to Mr Hanson.
69Fourthly, there is no satisfactory explanation why Mr Hanson would invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in the business concept of a personal trainer who resided in a foreign country and whom he had known for no more than several weeks.
70Fifthly, there is a lack of consistency in the evidence as to whether Mr Hanson was investing the whole $702,000, or merely a part thereof in the business of the plaintiff, and if the latter, the actual amount.
71Sixthly, although the investment from Mr Hanson was not unexpected by the plaintiff, the latter had not set up any business accounts in order to receive those sums and hold them securely. He was content to intend to transport the cash to his home in the Penrith area, and thereafter keep it there until those accounts could be created.
72Seventhly, the things recorded as having been said by the plaintiff when he was originally arrested are not consistent with his subsequent position.
73Eighthly, the events at the Star Casino on the afternoon and evening in question remain shrouded in mystery.
74Ninthly, the open reference by Mr Hanson to the cash having been ""laundered"" hardly instils confidence that the plaintiff is lawfully entitled to it.
75Tenthly and most importantly, it is extraordinary that one would leave over $700,000 in cash hidden in the ceiling cavity above the bathroom of a rented apartment in Sydney whilst one travelled across the Australian continent in order to visit a relative.  And it is even more extraordinary to leave it there when one subsequently returned to the United States for a number of weeks.
76In short, the combined effect of those aspects of the evidence that underpins the application of the plaintiff has failed to persuade me on the balance of probabilities that he is lawfully entitled to the $702,000. It follows that the plaintiff has not established the state of affairs required by the statute.
77It follows that the test in s 219 of LEPRA has not been made out, and accordingly I do not propose to order that the cash be delivered to the plaintiff by the defendant.
Contingent analysis
78Even if I am wrong in my evaluation of the evidence that founds the application of the plaintiff, and my determination of whether it should lead to me being satisfied on the balance of probabilities of the state of affairs required by the statute, it must surely be the case of the plaintiff that Mr Hanson, not the plaintiff, is entitled to the vast bulk of the cash. 
79After all, it is the position of the plaintiff that he was merely looking after the majority of the money for Mr Hanson, and at most $250,000 of it was an investment. I consider that it follows that $452,000 at the least should be returned to Mr Hanson if the thesis of counsel for the plaintiff were accepted. But in any event, because of my primary finding, that contingent question does not require further consideration.


Declaration with regard to intentional torts?
80The written and oral submissions of counsel for the plaintiff in support of the proposition that I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that officers of the defendant had committed detinue or conversion were very concise.  I propose to adopt a similarly summary approach in dealing with this claim.  I am not prepared, pursuant to the common law principles of trespass to goods, to make a declaration that the cash is being wrongfully detained and should be returned to the plaintiff.  That is so for the following reasons.
81First, for the reasons discussed above, I consider that the police were entitled to seize the cash.
82Secondly, it is well established that, when investigations are continuing or the item in question may be required as evidence in a prospective prosecution, it is legitimate for the item to be detained by police: see Gollan v Nugent (1988) 166 CLR 18 at 43-44; Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1980] QB 49.  As discussed above, I am prepared to infer that investigations may be continuing.
83Thirdly, to the extent that a plaintiff must show a right to immediate possession derived from some proprietary or possessory interest in order to pursue a claim in detinue or conversion, that must mean a lawful interest: see generally Gollan v Nugent at 32, 36-37, 44 and 46.  As I have indicated, there is a question about that issue that has not been answered in the affirmative.
84Finally, it is well known that a declaration is a discretionary remedy.  In the totality of the circumstances that I have set out, including the very limited cross-examination that took place, even if I am wrong in my foregoing analysis of legal principle, I am not inclined to exercise that discretion in favour of the plaintiff.   
Costs
85No submission was made by either party contrary to the usual position that costs should follow the event.
Orders
86I make the following orders:
(1)Orders one to seven in the further amended statement of claim filed 12 November 2013 are dismissed.
(2)The plaintiff must pay the costs of the second defendant before me.

2704234,Wills v R [2014] NSWCCA 253,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.

2R A HULME J: I agree with Davies J.

3DAVIES J: After a trial lasting more than three months a jury found the Applicant guilty on 7 September 2012 of:

(1) Fourteen counts of receiving a benefit corruptly, as an agent of Woolworths Ltd, for showing favour to an Israeli company Az-Ben Electronics Ltd contrary to s 249B(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty is seven years' imprisonment.

4The corrupt benefits totalling $1,395,950.50 were received between June 1997 and December 1998.

5The Sentencing Judge imposed an aggregate sentence of seven years consisting of a non-parole period of four years to commence on 18 January 2013 and expire on 17 January 2017. The indicative sentences were as follows:

Count 30: On 7 October 1997 receive a corrupt benefit of $24,000 - 6 months.

Count 33: On 29 August 1997 receive a corrupt benefit of $557,551 - 4 years.

Count 35: On 10 September 1997 money laundering $250,000 - 3 years.

Count 36: On 3 December 1997 receive a corrupt benefit of $67,000 - 1 year.

Count 37: On 11 December 1997 receive a corrupt benefit of $25,000 - 6 months.

6The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal on two grounds as follows:

1. His Honour erred in failing to afford procedural fairness to the offender in the sentencing proceedings.

2. The total sentence is in all the circumstances is manifestly excessive.

Facts concerning the offences

7In addition to the offences in respect of which the Applicant was sentenced, he was also charged as follows:

Count 1: That the Applicant and the Hendersons conspired with each other and other persons to cheat and defraud Woolworths Ltd in respect of supply and installation of computer hardware. This was a common law offence.

Counts 3, 4 and 5: As an officer of a public company act with the intent to cheat and defraud contrary to s 176A Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.

Count 20: Money laundering contrary to s 73(2) Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989.

8The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on counts 1, 3 and 4. The jury failed to agree on counts 5 and 20 and there were no further proceedings in relation to those offences. In relation to the alleged co-conspirators, the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on all counts relating to Peter Henderson and on most of the counts relating to Caroll Henderson.

9The Applicant was a senior executive at Woolworths in charge of its Management Services Division. In the mid-1990s he was looking for a new Point of Sale system for all Woolworths supermarkets. He proposed that Woolworths should develop their own in conjunction with an Israeli company, Az-Ben. The company's principal was Benzion Weissman. Az-Ben was represented in Australia by the co-accused Peter Henderson who, through his company Smart Retail Terminals, provided Woolworths with computer software and hardware. The second co-accused, Carroll Henderson managed SRT with her husband Peter. The Az-Ben product was known as APOS 2000.

10The Sentencing Judge recognised that the jury, by its verdicts, did not accept that the Applicant's decision to push Az-Ben's product, APOS 2000, was corrupt from the outset. However, he noted that the jury must have accepted that, having chosen Az-Ben and APOS 2000, the Applicant received corrupt benefits from Az-Ben's principal, for having shown favour to Az-Ben in its dealings with Woolworths. The payments to the Applicant were funded by money that Az-Ben received from Woolworths. 

11In respect of many of the offences, the corrupt benefits were paid by the Hendersons. The Sentencing Judge found that the jury gave the benefit of the doubt to the Hendersons but he said that they must have accepted that the corrupt benefits were paid by other co-conspirators in the money laundering conspiracy. The jury must have accepted that the Applicant received corrupt benefits from Mr Weissman for having shown favour to Az-Ben associated with the continuation and implementation of contracts with Woolworths.

12The conspiracy involved the use of companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and bank accounts in Jersey to hide the source and receipt of the corrupt benefits.

13The money laundering transaction involved the use of overseas accounts to hide the source of funds that were used to purchase a $250,000 Mercedes Benz car. 

Subjective features

14The Applicant is aged 64 years. Apart from one drink driving offence he had not come to the notice of the courts. His Honour took into account his good character although noting that he used his position to commit the offences. The Probation and Parole report noted that the Applicant had worked all his life most often in senior corporate positions or in his own businesses. He is now retired.

15The Sentencing Judge noted that he had some assets but what he had was likely to be spent on legal expenses or seized to compensate his victim. 

16The Sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant had significant health problems including severe coronary artery disease. He also suffered from Type II Diabetes. The Sentencing Judge found that there was no evidence his reasonable needs could not be met in custody. He said, however, that he did not overlook the fact that the realities of prison life would, because of his health, make his time in custody harder and more burdensome than most other prisoners. 

Remarks on Sentence

17Having made the factual findings summarised above the Sentencing Judge then proceeded to consider matters relevant to the sentence. He said that it was appropriate to fix an aggregate sentence. This was because the way the Crown had run its case, with the corrupt benefits received as particulars of a conspiracy it failed to prove, the counts which resulted in convictions had to be seen as an example of individual payments for a variety of continuing corrupt acts by the Applicant. His Honour said that it was hard to distinguish one corrupt benefit from another apart from the amount of money received.

18In relation to accumulation and concurrence his Honour said that there was a single, albeit extended, episode of criminality and in some instances 
a sentence for one offence could comprehend those for another. However, he said that there had to be some accumulation given the period of time over which the offences occurred, the different nature of the corrupt benefit and the money laundering offences.

19The Sentencing Judge took account of the considerable delay in the bringing of the charges in the matter due in part to a lack of police resources. He noted, however, that one reason for the delay was the complexity of the arrangements put in place by the Applicant to prevent discovery of the offences and to thwart any investigation. 

20With regard to the Applicant's submissions the Sentencing Judge said:

[40] It is clear from his submissions that Mr Wills not only fails to appreciate the reasons for the jury verdict but also shows no insight into the serious criminality of his conduct. His justifications for his criminal action do not accord with the evidence led at trial and accepted by the jury. I cannot take account additional factual matters [sic] raised only in submission and inconsistent with the jury verdicts....

21In relation to the objective seriousness of the offending, the Sentencing Judge said that each crime individually and/or in total:

(i) involved a gross breach of trust;

(ii) took place over a lengthy period of time;

(iii) was motivated by extreme greed;

(iv) involved considerable sums of money;

(v) while initially opportunistic, involved planning and significant planned efforts to avoid detection;

(vi) had a considerable impact on the Applicant's employer;

22In addition, the Sentencing Judge said that the Applicant exploited his senior position in the company and used that position to avoid detection and to commit the crimes. 

23The Sentencing Judge said that the maximum penalty for an offence gave some indication of the seriousness with which the community viewed the offences and provided some guidance to a sentencing judge. He noted that the s 249B offences had a maximum penalty of seven years. He noted, wrongly, that the s 73(2) offence had a penalty of ten years when it was in fact 20 years. 

24The Sentencing Judge said that he was satisfied that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate. That was because the offending involved deliberate, calculated, systematic and repeated crimes by a respected and senior executive in breach of trust, and resulted in very large losses to Woolworths over a period of time.

Ground 1: The Sentencing Judge erred in failing to afford procedural fairness to the offender in the sentencing proceedings

25The Applicant had been represented by counsel throughout the trial. However, he was not represented at the sentence hearing and he did not give evidence. He prepared written submissions in response to the Crown's submissions. Those written submissions proceeded on the assertion by him that he was innocent of the charges notwithstanding the jury's verdicts. 

26The matter first came before the Sentencing Judge on 14 November 2012 for the sentencing hearing. On that occasion, in addition to the Crown and the Applicant being present, Woolworths was present through its counsel in respect of the compensation claim made by it. 

27The Sentencing Judge asked the Applicant if he was ready to proceed with the sentence proceedings on that day. The Applicant said that he was not. He said he had ""received some very significant issues"" relating to his health and that he was facing a triple bypass and very significant surgery ""which has already started"". He had been in hospital the previous day and he said he had a full medical report in regard to what his treatment would entail over the next two months. It would involve multiple surgical procedures involving his heart and possible liver surgery. The Applicant informed his Honour that he had been told he needed to have the operation by Christmas or he would not last the year. He said he would like the sentence proceedings adjourned until he was in a better position to represent himself.

28The Applicant tendered a medical report from Dr Nigel Grebert, a general practitioner, which appeared to be a referral by Dr Grebert to a specialist at the San Clinic at Wahroonga. It diagnosed severe coronary artery disease, a fatty liver and Type II Diabetes. The medical report did not, as the Sentencing Judge pointed out to the Applicant, give any timetable for any operations so that, if he was minded to do so, the Sentencing Judge would be in a position to choose an appropriate adjournment date. His Honour also informed the Applicant that the sentence hearing had been adjourned for a lengthy period of time after the verdict to enable the Applicant and his lawyers to prepare material for sentence and to provide a pre-sentence report. 

29In the face of continuing opposition from the Crown because of the inadequacy of the material provided by the Applicant the Sentencing Judge said he was prepared to adjourn the sentence proceedings to 18 January. His Honour went on to say this:

I can indicate this, that unless you are actually in intensive care, and even if you are, it would be necessary for me to have a full and comprehensive medical report with a timetable and prognosis, do you understand that?

30His Honour also said:

If it's as urgent as you say they should be completed by January and we can only be optimistic as I'm sure you will be. But if there are complications I will need to know in advance, as will the Crown, of any medical reports that you wish to rely upon. Do you understand that?

31The Sentencing Judge then received material in relation to the compensation application. His Honour advised the Applicant that he ought to go through that material before January and provide a response to it in writing. His Honour provided detailed information to the Applicant about the nature of the compensation claim and matters that the Applicant should relevantly consider in relation to it. He went on to say:

I can say that subject to the most extraordinary medical evidence this matter will be proceeding on 18 January.

32On 14 January 2013 the Sentencing Judge's Associate received a report from Dr Anil Aggarwala dated 21 December 2012 apparently sent by the Applicant. The report in its entirety read:

Mr Wills underwent angioplasty and stenting to his right coronary artery yesterday. It was a long and difficult procedure. He was being discharged from hospital today and I plan to see him in about a month's time and he will require further angioplasty and stenting procedures to the left anterior descending artery.

33The matter then came back before the Sentencing Judge on 18 January 2013. The Applicant again appeared in person. The report of Dr Aggarwala was marked as an exhibit. His Honour also noted that his Associate had received an email from the Applicant saying that he had received treatment for colon cancer and that he wished to make an adjournment application. The Sentencing Judge asked him if he had any medical reports that would support his application for an adjournment apart from the report of Dr Aggarwala but the Applicant said that he did not.

34In the circumstances, the Sentencing Judge refused the Applicant's adjournment application.

35The Applicant submitted that by not participating in the sentencing proceedings or the compensation proceedings he showed that he was not able to represent himself properly at that time. The Applicant pointed to the Sentencing Judge's assessment of his submissions (set out at [20] above) as demonstrating his lack of capacity. That lack of capacity on the Applicant's part exacerbated by his serious health issues at the time amounted to a lack of procedural fairness. 

36In Weir v R [2011] NSWCCA 123 Garling J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed) said:

[65] The particular form which procedural fairness dictates may vary. That is because the content of the requirement of fairness may be affected by what is said and done during the proceedings: Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [34] per Gleeson CJ. ...

[66] The key to determining whether there has been a breach of the requirement of procedural fairness is to ascertain the consequence of any departure from the dictates of proper procedure because what is ultimately in issue is whether unfairness has resulted from the process: See Lam at [34]. The concern of the law is to avoid practical, and not merely theoretical, injustice: Lam at [37]. 

[67] One common basis for demonstrating that practical injustice and unfairness has occurred is where an individual has lost the opportunity to make submissions to the decision maker in opposition to a proposed course and in support of a course which he urges: Lam at [36]; Button at [18]. 

37A reading of the transcript of both 14 November 2012 and 18 January 2013 shows that the Applicant did address the Court on both occasions about the substance of the charges brought against him. In those circumstances, and in the light of the written submissions he prepared and relied upon, it cannot be said that he did not participate in the hearing. 

38At no stage did the Applicant seek an adjournment in order to obtain legal representation. Nor did the Applicant assert that he did not understand what was put against him in the Crown's written submissions. His own written submissions answered paragraph by paragraph what was contained in the Crown's submissions. It may be accepted that the Applicant's written submissions do not accept his guilt as the jury found, and they contain the sort of assertions and allegations against those who gave evidence against him that are not uncommonly seen in cases where the convicted person does not accept any wrongdoing on their own part. None of this material suggests any lack of capacity on the part of the Applicant who was obviously a person of considerable intelligence, ability and business acumen as his position with Woolworths demonstrated and was highlighted by the complexity of the wrongdoing. 

39In the absence of an application for an adjournment to obtain legal advice and in circumstances where it cannot be said the Applicant was under any relevant incapacity, the matters discussed in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 are not applicable.

40There was no procedural unfairness in not adjourning the sentencing proceedings for a second time in circumstances where the Applicant had no further medical evidence to justify such an adjournment. This is particularly so since it had been made clear to him, when his first application for adjournment was granted, what would be necessary in the event that a further application was made. 

41I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 2: The total sentence is in all the circumstances manifestly excessive

42The Applicant submitted that because the main conspiracy charge was not proved against him he stood only to be sentenced for receiving corrupt payments from a supplier to his employer. These payments arose after that supplier's contract with his employer was entered into, and in circumstances where it could not be said that the supplier did not provide a good product or proper services to the employer. The Applicant drew attention to other matters noted by his Honour including the delay in bringing the charges, the Applicant's age, illness and behaviour since the offences so that the Sentencing Judge was confident he would not re-offend, his prior good character, his difficult personal circumstances in relation to his divorce and the fact that his assets would be likely to be spent on legal expenses and compensation. 

43All of these matters were said to mean that the aggregate sentence of seven years with a non-parole period of four years was manifestly excessive, particularly when regard was had to fraud type offences in cases considered by this Court at or about the time of the offending. 

44It is necessary to say something briefly about the cases upon which the Applicant relies. 

45In R v Egerton (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 8 August 1997, Unrep) the applicant on appeal had been convicted on five counts, while being a director of a body corporate, of misapplying the company's cheques and cash for his own purposes. The total amount misapplied was in the order of $3 million. He was sentenced to a minimum term of 18 months with an additional term of six months. The criminal enterprise lasted only about five weeks and was relatively unsophisticated with a clear money trail left. His appeal was dismissed with the Court saying that the Judge imposed the most lenient sentence the circumstances allowed. 

46Subsequently, in R v Houghton [2000] NSWCCA 62 the respondent to a Crown appeal sought to rely on the sentence in Egerton. Houghton involved 26 counts of fraudulently applying company property whilst being a director. The maximum penalty was 10 years' imprisonment. He was sentenced to 26 concurrent terms each of two years' imprisonment consisting of an 18 month minimum term and an additional term of six months. The total amount defrauded over a three and a half year period was $1,376,293. The Court said that the sentences imposed were below the bottom of the available range of sentencing discretion. However, the residual discretion was applied on the Crown appeal and the Court did not interfere with the sentence. When discussing the sentence in Egerton the Court said that that case produced a sentence which, if the Crown had appealed, would have merited serious consideration for being increased by this Court. They added that Egerton should not be used as a yardstick in a case of this kind. 

47R v Lambrinos (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 17 July 1998, Unrep) was a Crown appeal against a sentence of 12 months periodic detention for obtaining a cheque in the sum of $598,952.16 from the Australian Tax Office payable to a corporation and applying the funds for his own purposes. The sentence on the appeal was increased to a period of three years periodic detention. Two of the Judges of this court (Smart J and Ireland J) said that in their opinion a period of full time custody was required but because it was a Crown appeal they were prepared to agree that the imprisonment be served by periodic detention. It should be further noted that this was a one-off offence and did not involve a scheme, a conspiracy or systematic offending. 

48In R v Battiato [1999] NSWCCA 44 the applicant on the appeal had defrauded amounts totalling $490,000 over a period of three years. She was an employee of a bank and used her position to alter the nature of certain accounts so that she could access the funds. She was sentenced to a minimum term of two and a half years and an additional term of two years. The sentence was reduced on appeal only because the Sentencing Judge had not given sufficient discount for the assistance provided by the Applicant. The sentence was reduced to a minimum term of two years and three months with an additional term of one year and nine months. Simpson J said that the sentence imposed at first instance was relatively lenient having in mind the duration and continuity of the offences. Smart J would have dismissed the appeal but for the material concerning the Applicant's assistance. It may be observed that the amount defrauded was less than one third of the amount in the present case. 

49R v Giam (No 2) [1999] NSWCCA 378 cannot be considered a comparable case by reason of its procedural complications. The respondent to that Crown appeal was only sentenced to a minimum term of 14 months with an additional term of 16 months on one count where he was awaiting retrial on six other counts in respect of which he had served a ten month custodial sentence. Allowance was made for that time in the imposition of the new sentence. 

50R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 183 was a Crown appeal in respect of a sentence of three years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention for five counts of fraudulent misappropriation for which the Respondent pleaded guilty. The maximum penalty was 7 years imprisonment. The Respondent received what the Sentencing Judge described as ""the greatest discount"" for the plea of guilty. The considerable delay in bringing the criminal proceedings to a conclusion was also taken into account. There were also very strong subjective features. By the time the appeal was heard the Respondent had served a not inconsiderable part of the sentence of periodic detention. In all of those circumstances this Court declined to uphold the Crown appeal. The amount of the defalcations was approximately $347,000.

51Bearing in mind the maximum penalty for the money laundering offence, that the maximum penalty for the conspiracy was at large, the amounts involved, the planning and the period of the offending, I do not consider that these cases are of any assistance in determining whether the present sentence fell within the appropriate range of sentences open to the Sentencing Judge.

52Two other cases suggest that the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge was well within the range of appropriate sentences. In R v Newey (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 23 August 1990, Unrep) the Applicant pleaded guilty to 23 counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception. The maximum penalty was penal servitude for five years. The overall minimum term was imprisonment for four years six months with an additional term of one year and six months. The total sum dishonestly obtained was $818,299.00. This Court was of the view that there could be no possible challenge to the overall sentence and that the Applicant had been treated favourably. The sentence was said to be well within a legitimate exercise of sentencing discretion. 

53In R v O'Neill (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 24 July 1996, Unrep) the Applicant sought leave to appeal against a minimum term of six years and six months with an additional term of three years and six months in respect of 12 counts of dishonestly obtaining money by deception from his employers. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for five years. The amounts involved $1,063,000 and were committed over a period of approximately three years. This Court said that in looking at other cases they were unable to find by reference to those cases that the sentences imposed by that Sentencing Judge were outside his Honour's sentencing discretion.

54The Applicant sought to distinguish these cases, particularly because the offending occurred well before the commission of the present offences, because of the different offences charged and because of the different circumstances of the offending and the offenders. Those distinctions may be accepted. However, they both involved systematic dishonesty by persons in a position of trust. The offences carried lower maximum penalties than all the offences charged in the present case and the amounts involved were considerably less than in the present case. They are at least an indication that the sentence imposed by Judge Haesler was well within his sentencing discretion. The Judge's misapprehension of the maximum penalty for the money laundering offence was favourable to the Applicant. The sentence was not manifestly excessive.

55I would also reject this ground of appeal.

Conclusion

56I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

		25 November 2014",2014-11-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704247,R v Dawson [2014] NSWDC 260,"Judgment


	
	Glen Wayne Dawson has a long criminal record. He is only 35 and, as graphically pointed out by Ms Suters who appears for him, since becoming an adult at the age of 13 he has spent only about 10 and a half months in the community at liberty. He has committed yet another offence and I am sentencing him for that today. Ms Suters has very helpfully focused her submissions on three aspects of the sentence.
	
	
	First I should say briefly what happened to bring Mr Dawson before me. He was involved in a break, enter and steal. It was at a property at Laguna with two other men overnight on 7-8 January 2014. He broke into the house. They ransacked the house and stole three firearms from a safe. They stole some other items as well. They were returning the next morning to collect some of the larger items when the police were there. They were not quick enough to work out a consistent explanation as to where they were going so when the police searched later in the day, they found some of the stolen goods.
	
	
	Mr Dawson was arrested a month later on 6 February 2014. He was charged with aggravated break, enter and steal. That is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards it as a very serious offence. One can tell that by the fact that Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment to the crime. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years’ imprisonment to the same crime.
	
	
	I formally convict Mr Dawson of that crime.
	
	
	Ms Suters called her client to give evidence before me last week on 6 November. I must say, I was impressed by his evidence. He is employed in custody. He works in textiles and textiles despatch. In that section he works five days a week starting at 6 in the morning. He is a C1 classification which is minimum security with supervision. He is on protection. He has had gaol disciplines in the past in the long periods he has spent in gaol but this time he has none. He has a history of substance abuse, particularly heroin and the drug known as ice. This time in custody he has avoided contact with illegal drugs smuggled into gaol and is attending Narcotics Anonymous. Not only that, he is wanting to enrol in the Ngara Nura program which Ms Suters provided the information about in exhibit 2. It is a rehabilitation program which commences in custody.
	
	
	Mr Dawson’s motivation is focused on his children. As I said, he is now 35. He has five children, the eldest is Ethan, a boy aged 11. He also has a son named Stevie aged 8, a daughter named Brock aged 7, a daughter Gypsy aged 3 and a baby Jack who is one or two. He maintains good relationships with the mothers of his children. He also gets support from his family. His mother, two brothers and a niece were present in court last week.
	
	
	Mr Dawson acknowledges the assistance he needs when he is released from custody to remain drug free and proposes to move away from the Cessnock area where unhelpful associations exist. He acknowledged the stupidity of his criminal behaviour and apologised.
	
	
	In cross-examining him, Mr Fitzhardinge elicited that the last time Mr Dawson had an offence of break, enter and steal was almost 20 years ago when he was under 18. Mr Dawson, when he committed this offence, was on parole for another offence. That is an aggravating factor which I need to take into account.
	
	
	Ms Suters made three points. They were related to parity, the commencement date of the sentence and special circumstances for altering the usual relationship between a non-parole period and the balance of parole.
	
	
	So far as parity is concerned, there were two co-offenders. Ms Suters fairly abandoned any comparison with one of them who was affected by mental health issues. However she pointed out that the sentence of three years and nine months to the co-offender Robertson had to be seen in the context that Mr Robertson had spent time in custody for break, enter and steal offences and indeed was on conditional liberty relating to one of those when he committed this. He has more break, enter and steal offences on his record, which increases the need for specific deterrence in Mr Robertson. I accept that submission.
	
	
	So far as the commencement date is concerned, Mr Dawson is in fact serving another sentence for an unrelated crime. The non-parole period for that sentence expires on 5 June next year. I would be entitled to commence the sentence for the crime that I am sentencing him for from 6 June next year and totally accumulate the sentences, because of the separate nature of the crimes. However, Ms Suters argues that I could backdate the sentence for this crime, perhaps to 6 November - the date that he gave evidence last week. That would mean that he has served about five months in fulltime custody solely related to the other matter that he is presently in custody for. It would also mean that I fairly take into account in favour of her client the principle of totality. She urged me to view his sentence holistically. Her point here regarding the commencement date is linked to her third point about there being special circumstances for altering the usual relationship between a non-parole period and the balance of the sentence. This is where her point about the time her client has spent at liberty in the community is relevant. I repeat, he has only spent a little over 10 months at liberty since he became an adult, some 17 years ago.
	
	
	Ms Suters points out that her client is at risk of becoming institutionalised. As she said, there have been only four occasions when he received a sentence other than custody and most of those were when he was under 18. She argued that a longer period of parole would assist her client in breaking the cycle of moving in and out of custody which is, again I say, graphically illustrated by exhibit 1 which she produced.
	
	
	Ms Suters fairly and realistically acknowledges that she cannot say that her client’s prospects of rehabilitation could be described as good and therefore favourably taken into account under the statute law. But she points to the Ngara Nura program which her client is already enrolled in. I have read the material which she tendered about that. It seems to be a very positive program and commences before an offender is released from custody. I think she has made out a case for there being special circumstances to alter the normal relationship in her client’s case.
	
	
	It seems to me, taking into account various matters, that an appropriate sentence for the crime that Mr Dawson has committed would be four years’ imprisonment. However, he pleaded guilty at what is acknowledged to be the earliest available opportunity. I would therefore discount that four year sentence to a sentence of three years’ imprisonment. That is the sentence which I would shortly impose, three years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	For a sentence of three years’ imprisonment, the non-parole period envisaged by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is three-quarters, which would be about two years and three months. Mr Robertson received a non-parole period which was just over 60% of his head sentence. I might add that the three year sentence which I have imposed on Mr Dawson is some months less than Mr Robertson’s sentence because of Mr Robertson’s worse criminal record relating to break, enter and steal. I have in mind that a non-parole period for Mr Dawson of 22 months - that is one year and 10 months - would be appropriate. That represents 61 per cent of the full sentence.
	
	
	The special circumstances are those pointed out by Ms Suters of the need for her client to be supported once he is released on parole and for his parole work to be effective, given the preparation he will have had during the Ngara Nura program before his release.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I am going to sentence you now Mr Dawson, stay there.


	
	I sentence you to three years’ imprisonment. I accept the submission of Ms Suters and I will backdate it to 3 November 2014 so the three year prison sentence commences 3 November 2014. It will expire on 5 November 2017. I fix a non-parole period of one year and 10 months. That also commences on 6 November 2014 and will expire on 5 September 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Please if you would both check those figures.

FITZHARDINGE: Content with the figures your Honour, there was just a slip of the tongue in relation to the commencement of the three year sentence. Your Honour said 3 November.

HIS HONOUR: I meant the 6th thank you.


	
	That will commence on 6 November 2014 and expire on 5 November 2017.
	


HIS HONOUR:   There is a back-up offence, my associate reminds me. Is it withdrawn or what is the situation? Exhibit A says yes back up charge to be withdrawn at conclusion of sentence.

FITZHARDINGE: Yes your Honour.


	
	I note that the back-up charge has been withdrawn by the Director and I should acknowledge, returning to my reasons, Mr Fitzhardinge had nothing to add regarding Ms Suters’ submissions.
	
	
	Mr Dawson you have got a three year prison sentence. I have backdated it to last week when you gave evidence. So it started on 6 November 2014. Your three year prison sentence will therefore expire on 5 November 2017, do you understand? I fixed a non-parole period - normally 75 per cent as you probably know. That would be two years and three months, but I have reduced that to one year and 10 months, that is 22 months, one year and 10 months. That also commenced 6 November 2014. That will expire on 5 September 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Fitzhardinge, Ms Suters it is a three year prison sentence so I fix parole under s 50 don’t I?


	
	I make an order directing Mr Dawson to be released on parole on 5 September 2016. Conditions of parole are these:
	



	
	that he be of good behaviour;
	
	
	that he notify the Registrar of this court of his address and any change of that address;
	
	
	that he attend court if he receives a notice to do so;
	
	
	that he accept supervision from Community Corrections and all reasonable recommendations and directions from an officer of that service.
	



	
	Mr Dawson I have ordered you to be released on parole on 5 September 2016. That is a court order for your release on that day. You have got four conditions of parole. You have got to stay out of trouble, that is the most important one. Let the Registrar of the Newcastle District Court know where you are living, that is just so they can track you down if need be and if you change your address you let them know. Do you understand? If you get a notice to come to court you turn up, you do not clear off so that the sheriffs and the police do not have to chase you and the most important or the second most important is to allow yourself supervision by Community Corrections and if they give you recommendations and directions then comply with them. You know better than I do from your past experience that they are experienced, they know what they are doing. You are going to come out primed by this program which, to your credit, you are undertaking. It looks as though you have taken a real turn for the better at this stage of your life. It is going to be much tougher when you are out than when you are in, because one of the points made by Ms Suters is you have spent so much time in gaol that that is why it is going to be important to let them help you. They know what they are doing and they will help you once you are out do you understand that?
	


OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right good luck.

		12 February 2015",2014-11-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704260,Ortiz v R [2014] NSWCCA 260,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: Armando Salinas Ortiz (the applicant) was sentenced by his Honour Judge Norrish QC in the District Court at Sydney on 22 August 2013 for two offences of being an accessory before the fact to robbery in company that were committed on 30 May and 12 June 2012. 

3The offences are contrary to ss 97(1) and 346 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.

4For the offence committed on 30 May 2012 the sentence was a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with effect from 21 June 2012. For the second offence the sentence was imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months with effect from 21 December 2013. 

5The total effective sentence was 6 years and 9 months with a minimum custodial component of 4 years.

6The sole ground of appeal is that the applicant has a justified sense of grievance arising from a lack of due proportionality between the sentences imposed on the applicant and the sentence imposed upon a co-offender. The co-offender in question is a man called Horacio Javier Laguna Cantor who was sentenced by the same judge four months later.

Facts

7The offence on 30 May 2012 involved the robbery in company by persons unknown of a man called Jian Wei Li of $200,000 worth of jewellery. The offence on 12 June 2012 involved the robbery in company by persons unknown of two persons, Chi Ho So and Po Seng Choi, of $740,000 worth of jewellery, $20,000 in cash, the victims' passports, a laptop computer, a printer and a watch worth $6,000. 

8The judge noted that the applicant was aged 25 at the time of the offences and was a citizen of Columbia. He came to Australia on 10 February 2012 with a Mexican passport in a false name (R/S 3). However, there was no evidence that he came to this country with a view to committing crime (R/S 22). 

9According to a statement of agreed facts, two cars bought from private sellers at Cabramatta and Maroubra on 28 and 30 May 2012 were used in the offence committed on 30 May 2012 (the two cars). At about 1.30pm that day the victim entered the carpark of a large shopping centre in Parramatta. He had a business involving wholesaling jewellery to shops in the shopping centre. One of the two cars entered the carpark about half an hour later. It was driven by an unknown person (the unknown driver) but the front passenger was the co-offender, Horacio Javier Laguna Cantor (the co-offender). Mr Li entered the shopping centre with a suitcase containing about $200,000 of jewellery. The unknown driver and the co-offender Cantor entered immediately after. 

10CCTV footage captured the applicant, the co-offender and the unknown driver carrying out surveillance of Mr Li in the ensuing two hours as he moved about the shopping centre. When he left he was followed by the applicant and the co-offender. He drove out of the carpark and was followed by the two cars. 

11At about 5.00pm Mr Li entered a shopping centre at Rhodes. The applicant, the co-offender and the unknown driver were seen carrying out further surveillance of him. Mr Li returned to the carpark via a lift. The applicant accompanied him in the lift but remained in it when Mr Li exited. 

12Mr Li drove out of the carpark at about 6.13pm. He was followed by the two cars. The applicant was not seen again in relation to this incident. 

13Mr Li drove to his home. When he parked in the driveway an unknown person smashed the driver's side window, reached in and removed the key from the ignition. That person then punched Mr Li repeatedly to the face. Another person smashed the rear window of the car and stole Mr Li's jewellery. The offenders ran off.

14Mr Li sustained some bleeding to the corner of an eye, a cut to one hand and pain in the back and shoulder region. 

15One of the two cars was found a week later abandoned a block away from Mr Li's home. 

16The offence on 12 June 2012 was committed in much the same way. The two victims attended a large shopping centre in Burwood for the purpose of selling wholesale jewellery. When they drove into the carpark they were followed by two cars (different to the ones used on 30 May - a Camry and a Commodore). 

17CCTV footage captured the applicant following the victims into the shopping centre. He was wearing an earpiece. He returned a short time later to the Commodore which was driven out of the carpark. The victims were in the shopping centre for about 45 minutes. When they drove out of the carpark they were followed by the Camry. 

18The victims drove to a jewellery store in Haberfield. When they stopped their car, the Camry suddenly parked diagonally in front of them. Three people got out of the Camry and approached. Two of them went to the driver and front seat passenger and pointed handguns at them. The third man smashed the rear window of the victim's car and took two backpacks and a briefcase. The backpacks contained $740,000 worth of jewellery. A computer and a printer that were in the car were also taken. The offender who confronted the passenger took his Rolex wristwatch worth $6000. $20,000 in cash and the victim's passports were also taken.

19The Camry was later found abandoned in a nearby street.

20The agreed facts include that the applicant had assisted unknown persons by making them aware of the victims' movements and whereabouts, thereby facilitating the robberies. The prosecution conceded that the applicant was not present when the robberies took place. The applicant conceded that he knew the victims were jewellery sellers and that they were to be robbed by persons acting in company. It was an agreed fact that the applicant knew the victims would have in their possession assorted jewellery and cash but he was unaware as to the exact amount or value.

21The agreed facts also included that the applicant maintained that he was unaware that any of the robbers was going to be armed with any weapon. The prosecution conceded that there was no evidence to the contrary.

22The learned sentencing judge concluded that, given the degree of planning that went into each offence and the time taken to execute them, the applicant must have known that there would be substantial property taken. This was even more the case in relation to the second offence after the applicant had participated in the first.

23The applicant was arrested on 21 June 2012 and remained in custody thereafter.

24The judge made a number of findings about the seriousness of the offences, particularly with regard to the degree of planning involved. There is no need to explore the detail, given that there is no assertion of error in the judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, and there is no contention that the sentences, individually or in their cumulative effect, are manifestly excessive.

Personal circumstances of the applicant

25There is nothing to be achieved by reviewing the evidence concerning the applicant's background and personal circumstances. The submissions in support of the ground of appeal do not suggest there is any real distinction between the applicant and Mr Cantor in such respects aside from the fact that Mr Cantor had a criminal record and the applicant had no previous convictions. 

26It is worth noting, however, that the judge found that the applicant was a person of otherwise good character. The evidence was not sufficiently reliable for his Honour to conclude that he was unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation. He accepted that the applicant had expressed regret but was not prepared to accept that he was genuinely remorseful. 

27The judge allowed a discount of 25 per cent upon the sentences that would otherwise have been imposed to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's early pleas of guilty. 

28Special circumstances (s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) were found, they being the fact that the second sentence was partially accumulated upon the first; that the applicant would require ""an extended period of supervision to adjust to community living"" following release on parole; and the hardship the applicant would experience being in custody in a country away from his family and with language difficulties (R/S 23). 

Sentencing of the co-offender

29Horacio Javier Laguna Cantor was sentenced by the same judge four months later, on 20 December 2013. He, too, had arrived in Australia on 10 February 2012 with a Mexican passport in a false name.

30Mr Cantor was charged with the offence of 30 May 2012. The agreed facts in his case closely followed those in the applicant's case and he played a role that is, for present purposes, indistinguishable from that played by the applicant.

31Mr Cantor signed a Form 1 document and asked that a further, similar offence committed on 20 April 2012 be taken into account. It involved him, and two unknown co-offenders, carrying out surveillance on two victim wholesale jewellery sellers in the Cabramatta shopping district. Sometime later the victims were followed to their motel accommodation in Haberfield where they were confronted by several unknown offenders. One of the victims was threatened. Suitcases containing jewellery worth $640,000 were taken.

32In respect of both offences, the prosecution made the same concessions as in the applicant's case: that Mr Cantor was not present at the scene of the robberies and that he was aware that the victims would be in possession of jewellery but was not aware of the exact amount or value.

33Mr Cantor was arrested at Sydney International Airport on 15 September 2012 as he attempted to leave the country on a Colombian passport in a false name. A goods in custody charge was on the Form 1 document; this related to him being found on arrest to be in possession of a mobile phone that had been stolen in April 2012.

34Mr Cantor had a criminal history in the United States of America for larceny, aggravated robbery and resist officer charges. He received a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. 

35The judge reduced Mr Cantor's sentence from 6 years to 4 years 6 months on account of the utilitarian value of his early plea of guilty. He said that the sentence was assessed with regard to that which he had imposed upon the applicant for the offence of 30 May 2012 but also with regard to the additional matter on the Form 1 and different (worse) criminal history (AB 50). 

36The judge referred to the guideline judgment in relation to how a court is to take into account further offences on a Form 1: Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146.

37His Honour was obviously mindful of the need to have regard to the manner in which the applicant was sentenced. Immediately after his reference to the Form 1 guideline judgment he said:

""Ordinarily the Court would not be required to measure the extent to which the sentence for the principal offence has been increased. But in this matter, of course, the Court has to have very close regard, as the parties no doubt would themselves, to the fact I sentenced the co-accused Armando Salinas Ortiz on 22 August 2013 for the same offence for which I am sentencing this prisoner, that is accessory before the fact to robbery in company committed on 30 May 2012. 

The starting point of any sentence to be imposed on him was deemed to be five years imprisonment. There are distinctions between this prisoner and Mr Ortiz. Some are cosmetic in some respects, particularly matters of a subjective character in relation to employment and the like. But one matter of substance is of course the fact that this prisoner has a prior criminal history whereas Mr Ortiz appeared before the court without any known convictions at the time of sentence."" 

38The judge referred to observations he made in the sentencing of the applicant about matters pertinent to the objective seriousness of the offence and said that they were all relevant in the case of Mr Cantor (AB 54-55). His Honour identified a point of distinction between the two cases being that at the time of committing the offence of 30 May, Mr Cantor had already committed the offence of 20 April whereas the applicant had not (AB 55). After referring to the facts concerning the 20 April offence he said that they required ""an increase upon the appropriate sentence"" in comparison to that which was imposed upon Mr Ortiz for the same crime (AB 56). 

39The judge referred to the parity principle and cited relevant authorities: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen [1997]; 189 CLR 295; and Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540. He continued:

""The complication here in sentencing is that this offender is not being sentenced for two offences, as was the [applicant]. The role of offences on a Form 1, as the Chief Justice said in the guideline judgment, forms a much less salient role in the sentencing process as [sic - than] if the matters on the Form 1 stood to be the subject of separate sentences."" 

40As to the other offence on the Form 1, the offence of goods in custody, the judge described it as ""a comparatively minor matter"" (AB 57). (Counsel for the applicant did not suggest that there was any error in this assessment. Accordingly, I will disregard it for the purpose of considering the ground of appeal.)

41The judge accepted evidence that, although he had come to this country with a false name, Mr Cantor had been issued with a student visa and had paid to undertake a language course (AB 57). Similar claims were advanced on behalf of the applicant in his sentence proceedings but were not accepted as they were unsubstantiated. 

42Reference was made to Mr Cantor's criminal history, the judge saying that it was not an aggravating factor but meant that he was entitled to ""less leniency"" than the applicant (AB 58). It did, however, along with the need to take into account the Form 1 offence, warrant greater weight being given to the need for personal deterrence (AB 63).

43The judge was prepared to accept that the co-offender had provided a genuine expression of contrition but said this was ""not a very strong mitigating factor when one weighs up the lack of cooperation with the authorities"" (AB 63). 

44The judge referred to the observations about the various purposes of sentencing which he had discussed in sentencing the applicant and said they applied as well to the case of the co-offender. He said the same applied in relation to his consideration of the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. 

45Special circumstances were found on the basis that the co-offender would need an extended period of supervision on parole.

46The judge concluded his sentencing remarks by returning to his comparison with the cases of the applicant:

""Ultimately, when all is said and done, although it has taken some time to get to this point as I am obliged to do of course, the sentencing of Mr Ortiz, which now remains unchallenged, is clearly a highly relevant matter, clear issues of parity so far as the objective culpability of the prisoner is concerned.

Whilst the prisoner may have some favourable matters that Mr Ortiz has, such as recognition of his remorse and contrition, these matters are minor matters in the context of the matters that weigh against him in dealing with this offence which are firstly the prior criminal history and secondly the consideration of the matter on the Form 1.

...

It should be fairly said in relation to this prisoner, if it needs to be said with regard to mitigating factors, in addition to the contrition aspect, the plea of guilty is a mitigating factor. But for that the prisoner receives the discrete discount which I have identified but there is very little else to be said by way of mitigating factors.

I could not conclude even with the assistance of the reference from the lady from the Seventh Day Adventists that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation. Unlike Mr Ortiz this prisoner does not have no record of prior convictions, he is not a person of good character, to be fair, having regard to his prior convictions in the United States. Ultimately the starting point of any sentence for this prisoner must be greater than the starting point of any penalty identified for Mr Ortiz.

Unlike Mr Ortiz however this prisoner does not have to concern himself with a separate sentence being passed in relation to separate offending. I have no comment to make about the matter, it seems to me a rather strange situation where the two offenders should come forward at separate times, being treated somewhat differently. But that is the reality of the situation and certainly there is nothing sinister about it."" 

Submissions 

47The submissions for the applicant involved two broad propositions. First, that the difference between the overall sentence imposed upon him (6 years 9 months) and the sentence imposed upon Mr Cantor (4 years 6 months) was too great. Secondly, the differentiation between the sentences imposed for the offence that they had in common (the 30 May 2012 offence) should have been greater. For that offence, there was a sentence of 3 years 9 months, reduced from 5 years on account of the plea of guilty in the applicant's case, whereas in Mr Cantor's case there was a sentence of 4 years 6 months, reduced from 6 years on account of his plea. In other words, the applicant had a legitimate sense of grievance in that his sentence was not less than Mr Cantor's by a greater degree.

48It was submitted that the objective criminality of the applicant and Mr Cantor did not differ significantly. The principal difference between the respective cases was that the applicant had two offences for which he stood for sentence whilst Mr Cantor had the one offence with the other taken into account on a Form 1 document. 

49The fact that the co-offender had been imprisoned previously for similar offences was submitted to be a significant point of distinction. For this reason, specific deterrence, retribution and protection of society warranted greater weight in his case: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477. As a result, the difference between the pair's criminal histories warranted a greater difference between their respective sentences. 

50In relation to the applicant's offence of 30 May 2012, there was not the need, as there was in Mr Cantor's case, for greater weight to be given to retribution and personal deterrence on account of there being a further offence on a Form 1 to be taken into account: Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW (No 1 of 2002) (the guideline judgment). Counsel referred to Spigelman CJ there having said (at [18]) that ""it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small""; and ""sometimes it will be substantial"". 

51Accordingly, as it was submitted, due proportionality required a greater difference between the sentence imposed upon the applicant for the common offence and that imposed upon Mr Cantor. 

52Counsel accepted that the totality principle had no application in the sentencing of Mr Cantor. That acceptance was in accordance with authority: see, for example, R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5; 118 A Crim R 131 at [7]; R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [82]; and the guideline judgment itself at [34].

53Senior counsel for the Crown pointed out that the applicant stood for sentence for two very serious offences. Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 and the totality principle applied. The fact that the co-offender's two matters were dealt with by way of one being on a Form 1 was said to necessarily impact upon the sentencing discretion in a manner which diminished the relevance of parity and due proportion. 

54The Crown accepted that the co-offender's sentence for the principal offence stood to be increased because of the need to take into account the Form 1 offence, but submitted that such increase could never approach the magnitude that would be appropriate if a separate sentence had to be imposed. In this regard, the Crown pointed to the sentencing judge's awareness of the imbalance in the sentence exercise which he expressed in the final paragraph of the extract I have set out above (at [46]).

55The Crown also pointed out that the applicant alone stood for sentence for the offence of 12 June 2012; an offence which the judge regarded as more serious than that of 30 May 2012 because it was aggravated by the use of a gun and the value of the property taken was significant. 

Consideration

56The starting point for the determination of the ground of appeal is to recognise that sentencing is not a mathematical exercise of predetermining a sentence and then adding to or subtracting from it in order to take into account aggravating and mitigating features so as to arrive at the sentence to be imposed. Rather it is a matter of instinctively synthesising all relevant facts and circumstances: see Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [74]-[76]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [39]. Accordingly, the sentencing task facing Norrish QC DCJ when dealing with Mr Cantor's case was not one of starting with the sentence imposed in the applicant's case and then adding to or subtracting from it so as to take into account the relevant differences.

57Where this Court is deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity it is necessary to have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [32] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ). In this case, that requires consideration of the manner in which his Honour approached the task of sentencing the co-offender Cantor in the two respects that were the focus of the applicant's submissions: how the offence on the Form 1 and the prior criminal history were factored into the assessment of sentence.

58The correct approach in taking into account further offences on a Form 1 document was described by the former Chief Justice in the guideline judgment as follows:

""[42] The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.

[43] I did not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. However, no additional elements for which that could be so have been identified in submissions to this Court. The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence.""

59In R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5; 118 A Crim R 131, Simpson J said (at [7]):

""[A]n offender who adopts the procedure [of having additional offences taken into account] is entitled to expect that the additional penalty will be significantly less than would have been imposed had separate charges been prosecuted.""

60Spigelman CJ referred to this in the guideline judgment, observing (at [34]) that it was ""recognition that using the Form 1 procedure will generally result in a lower effective sentence than would have been imposed in the case of a conviction followed by a separate sentence"". The sentencing judge adverted to this when sentencing Mr Cantor. 

61The learned judge's sentencing remarks in Mr Cantor's case make it abundantly clear that he was aware of, and applied, the relevant principles in relation to the Form 1 offence. He indicated that it was a basis for imposing a higher sentence in Mr Cantor's case than was imposed upon the applicant. With no error in his Honour's approach as to the application of correct principles, the only question is one of degree.

62As to Mr Cantor's criminal history, the submissions for the applicant overstate the influence it had, or should have had, on the sentence. The judge did not find that the record should be regarded in the sense described in Veen v The Queen (No 2); namely that it showed that Mr Cantor had ""manifested in his commission of the instant offence[s] a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law"" such that ""retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted"" (per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 477). The judge took a more benign view, finding the prior record meant that Mr Cantor was entitled to ""less leniency"". That was a view that was well open to his Honour.

63The applicant may well feel aggrieved that he received an overall sentence that is significantly longer than that which was imposed upon Mr Cantor. However, for him to succeed he must establish that he has a justifiable sense of grievance when an assessment is made by objective criteria: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [31]. The difference in the lengths of the sentences is explained by the fact that the judge was required to apply the principle of totality in the applicant's case and not Mr Cantor's case.

64I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

65DAVIES J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2704266,WorkCover v JVC Holdings trading as Get Fast Waste [2014] NSWDC 378,"SENTENCE


	
	On 1 July 2011 at Mortdale, Mr Basil Albaseri, an employee of JVC Holdings Pty Limited, fell from the top of a skip when he was attempting to spread canvas tarpaulin on the top of the skip. He fell nearly three metres and suffered serious and permanent injuries
	
	
	The defendant, JVC Holdings Pty Limited, pleads guilty to a charge that it failed to comply with its duties pursuant to section 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 to ensure the health, safety and welfare of Mr Albaseri.
	
	
	The accident could and should have been averted. The employer should have required Mr Albaseri to use a side ladder, or a portable work platform, on which he could stand while placing the tarpaulin. Alternatively it should have provided a tarpaulin which may have been hydraulically lifted up and placed across the bin. Further in the alternative,s the defendant could have provided telescopic poles, by which the tarpaulin could have been drawn across the skip bin.
	
	
	The defendant is an operator of waste bins and at the time employed eight full-time staff and four casuals. It had no formal Occupational Health and Safety Program in place. There was no documentation nor risk statements addressing any part of the defendant’s operations.
	
	
	Although the company had operated for seven years without any injury more serious than a sprained ankle that would appear to be as much a question of luck as anything else.
	
	
	The gravity of the offence is reflected not only in the serious injury suffered by Mr Albaseri but in the simplicity with which the injury could and should have been avoided.
	
	
	There is a need for general deterrence in an industry which employs machines and plant of considerable size.
	
	
	There is a limited need for specific deterrence because the defendant has now devised and documented safe working procedures directed to every aspect of its operation.
	
	
	Since the accident the defendant has employed a Mr Angelo Kouis as a traffic and safety coordinator in the yard and has published safe working procedures.
	
	
	I accept that Mr Panetonio, the director and owner of the company, is a man of good character. I accept that the company, through Mr Panetonio, has expressed contrition and remorse. In all the circumstances I think an appropriate penalty is $50,000.
	
	
	The defendant is entitled to a 20% reduction in this amount in consideration of its early plea and cooperation with the prosecutor.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted and fined $40,000. I order that the prosecution have a moiety of the fine.
	
	
	I order that the defendant pay the prosecution’s costs agreed at $15,000.

		17 February 2016",2014-11-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704267,WorkCover Authority of NSW v Sneddon [2014] NSWDC 372,"For 37 years Mr Andrew Tressider Sneddon has operated the sawmill, Tamworth Treated Timbers, at Kootingal.
	
	
	On 20 June 2013 a 16 year old employee, Mr Stephen Caslic, suffered a broken leg and pelvis at the defendant’s premises when his clothing was caught in an unguarded shaft of a chain conveyor. The risk was obvious and nothing had been done by the defendant to obviate or minimise that risk.
	
	
	In consequence, the defendant pleads guilty to the charge that on 20 June 2013 he, being a person conducting a business and having an Occupational Health and Safety duty under section 19(1) of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, failed to comply with this duty to protect Mr Caslic from injury.
	
	
	The offence was grave, not so much in the injuries suffered to Mr Caslic, which fortunately were not severe, but that the danger was obvious and nothing had been done to prevent its occurrence.
	
	
	Before the injury the employer had prepared a three page document entitled Occupational Health and Safety Policy directing employees to follow “All Health and Safety Policies and Procedures”.
	
	
	This pithy document addressed the dangers of “workplace bullying” and the need for “harmonious relations” between the business, the community, and amongst its workers. Unfortunately it did not describe any safety policies and procedures relating to the actual work.
	
	
	I think it appalling, given the publicity given to the need to establish safe workplaces, that the defendant did not institute any formal assessment of the risks faced by the employees and devise systems to prevent those risks coming home.
	
	
	After the injury the employer responded to a direction from the Inspector to take remedial action, and also created and documented policies relating to safe procedures to be followed at the mill.
	
	
	The need for the application of the principle of deterrence cannot be overstated in the present case, as was said in a previous judgment of the IRC:
	


“The presence of unguarded machinery constitutes one of the most pernicious and infamous dangers to health and safety of persons in the workplace. It is this very type of danger that prompted persistent and ongoing legislative attempts by governments to compel the correction of such obvious and serious faults in systems and plants.”


	
	I believe that the need for specific deterrence is not great because the employer has responded appropriately to the dangers revealed by this accident.
	
	
	After some initial reservation, I think it relevant that the business operated by the defendant is currently not profitable, and that it is one of the few providers of employment in the area. It would not be in the public interest for a fine to be imposed of such proportion that it threatened the viability of the continued operations of the defendant.
	
	
	I accept that the defendant is a person of good character and has no prior convictions.
	
	
	In all the circumstances an appropriate penalty prima facie is $50,000.
	
	
	The defendant is entitled to a reduction of 20% in recognition of his contrition and remorse and cooperation with authorities and his early plea of guilty.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted and fined $40,000.
	
	
	I order that WorkCover have a moiety of the fine and order the defendant pay the prosecutor’s costs and disbursements agreed at $7,700.
