GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
On 22 May 1989 or thereabout, a group of companies owned and/or controlled by one William Goei sold some substantial properties at Goldhill Plaza (collectively called `Goldhill properties') to a group of companies owned and/or controlled by an Indonesian businessman, Lauw Siang Liong for a sum of approximately $93 millions and the sale was completed on 22 October 1989 or thereabout. Under the sale agreements, a commission in aggregate in the sum of $465,388.26 representing +% of the total purchase price was payable by the vendors to the defendant. The commission was paid to the defendant in full only in early March 1990 or thereabout. The plaintiff claimed that she was entitled to , of the commission amounting to $116,347 and on the defendant's refusal to pay this amount, she instituted this action against him claiming the sum of $116,347. The action was heard before me, and at the conclusion I found that the plaintiff had established her claim and I gave judgment to her in the sum of $116,347 with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment. I also awarded her the costs of the action. I now give my reasons.
By her statement of claim, the plaintiff averred that in April 1989 she became aware that the Goldhill properties were for sale and found a potential buyer but did not approach the vendors directly; she introduced the buyer to the defendant and requested the defendant to introduce the buyer to the vendor and the defendant did so and in consequence the buyer purchased the properties from the vendor. She further averred that it was a term of the sale that a commission at +% of the purchase price was to be paid to the defendant; that it was agreed between her and the defendant that she would be paid , of the commission received by the defendant, and that the commission was received by the defendant who refused to pay to her the share thereof as agreed.
The defence was one of denial of the plaintiff's claim. The defendant averred that the plaintiff became aware that the Goldhill properties were for sale from the plaintiff's associate, Lena Wong, and that it was Lena Wong who introduced the buyer to him. He admitted that the amount of the commission was $465,389 but denied that the plaintiff was entitled to any commission at all.
The pleadings of both the parties were quite inadequate as the evidence unfolded showed that a great deal of the material facts relied upon on by their counsel were not pleaded. Be that as it may, the issue before me was basically whether there was an oral agreement by the defendant express or implied to pay to the plaintiff , of the commission which he received from the sales of the Goldhill properties. The issue essentially involved my findings of fact on the evidence adduced. It is necessary to set out and deal with in some detail the evidence.
First, there was the evidence of the plaintiff which, so far as material, was this. She was and is an estate agent and the sole proprietress of Queensfield Properties. In April 1989, she knew that the Goldhill properties were for sale; she heard of this through market rumours and from her associate, Lena Wong and one Tony Sim. She then got in touch with Lauw Siang Liong (`Lauw') who was in Indonesia and informed him that the properties were for sale and suggested that he should have a look at them. Lauw then came to Singapore and she showed him the properties in one evening. Lauw had been her long term client and most of the properties he purchased in Singapore were purchased through her. She did not approach William Goei directly, and could not do so, because her associate, Lena Wong, had previously bribed the property manager of the group of companies of William Goei. At that time, she and Lena Wong were sharing the same office in Tan Chong Tower at Queen's Street. She and Lena Wong discussed about the Goldhill properties and they decided to use the defendant to front for them. Arising from the discussion, Lena Wong spoke to the defendant who agreed to act as the front for them. The discussion as to the terms on which he would front for them was initially conducted through Lena Wong since she was the one who approached him. Subsequently, it was agreed that the commission should be divided into four equal shares: , for the defendant, , for Lena Wong, , for Tony Sim and , for the plaintiff herself. All of them agreed to this. Tony Sim was on friendly terms with William Goei and it was through him that they could arrange for a meeting between William Goei and Lauw. It was quite well known in the market that William Goei would not see any agent unless the agent was known to him. The defendant himself could not have met William Goei. Tony Sim was the one who arranged the meeting between William Goei, Lauw and the defendant.
The plaintiff testified in no uncertain terms that she introduced Lauw to the defendant and the introduction was made at the Sheraton Tower where Lauw was then staying. Lauw could not have used the defendant without her introduction. She said that she contacted Lauw first and that without her involvement, the transaction would not have been effected. Lauw would not have acted with Lena Wong without her involvement and the sharing of the commission was known to Lauw. She had shared commissions with Lena Wong in previous sales of properties to Lauw.
The plaintiff said that on the date of signing, she sent Lauw to UOB Building (the sale agreements were signed in the office of Khattar Wong & Partners in UOB Building) and she waited for him in her car by the roadside. After the agreements were signed, she sent Lauw back to the hotel. She, Lena Wong and the defendant went back to her office at Queen's Street and they were very happy. They decided to buy four jade necklaces to be presented to the Goddess of Mercy to thank her for the good fortune. The four were meant to be one for the defendant, one for Lena Wong, one for Tony Sim and one for the plaintiff herself and the presentation was to be made at the Waterloo Street temple. She did purchase the four jade necklaces.
The plaintiff further testified that at or about the time of the signing of the agreements, all the four parties agreed to share the commission equally. After the sale was completed, she made several attempts to call the defendant and Lena Wong but they refused to talk to her. By then the relationship between her and Lena Wong had already turned sour; there was a quarrel between her and Lena Wong in her office. Lena Wong subsequently moved out and took away all the files in her office. The defendant and Lena Wong subsequently wanted to reduce her share of the commission to 18%. She refused to accept it. She was quite emphatic in her evidence that Lauw would not have bought the Goldhill properties through the defendant or through Lena Wong. Lauw did not appear to give evidence. According to the plaintiff, he was at the time of the hearing ill and was in Hong Kong.
Next, there was the evidence of Ms Lam Siat Khevn (known as Mrs Eng), the financial controller of the group of companies owned and/or controlled by William Goei. She testified that she was instructed by William Goei to handle the payment of commission for the sale of the Goldhill properties and was told by him that Tony Sim should be given a share of the commission and the commission was +% of the total sale price. She saw the defendant and Tony Sim in her office on 13 October 1989 when she told them that Tony Sim was the agent the vendors recognised and that the commission would be split between the defendant and Tony Sim. They told her that she should make out to them the cheques for the commission on the basis of `50/50' and each party would take care of his partner. In response she said that as the contract was under the defendant's name, she asked the defendant to give a letter authorising the payment to Tony Sim, and that both of them were happy; she told the defendant that she would give him a draft to be signed by the defendant on his letterhead. Subsequently, Tony Sim called and informed her that his portion would be split between him and the plaintiff and gave her the plaintiff's name. Accordingly, she made out three cheques, one in favour of the defendant for 50% of the commission, one in favour of Tony Sim for 25% and the third cheque for the plaintiff for 25% of the commission. She telefaxed the draft letter to the defendant. Tony Sim and the defendant subsequently came to her office and the defendant said that he could not sign the letter because there were `tax implications'. Accordingly, she did not release the cheques to Tony Sim and the defendant as she insisted that the letter was to be signed. After that, they left her office. She said that the defendant knew that one cheque was prepared in favour of the plaintiff for 25% of the commission, and he did not object to the commission being split with Tony Sim.
Tony Sim also gave evidence, which, so far as material, was this. In early 1989, he knew that certain properties in Goldhill Plaza were for sale and this was told to him by William Goei himself. William Goei was a friend of his; he had known William Goe since 1979. William Goei told him that if anyone wanted to buy the properties, he could refer the purchaser to William Goei. Tony Sim knew the plaintiff and also knew Lena Wong as a partner of the plaintiff. He got to know them around 1989. He informed them that the properties were for sale and asked if there was any buyer, and Lena Wong told him that she had a potential buyer, an Indonesian man, and he followed that up with Lena Wong. At that time, there was no way William Goei would deal with Lena Wong because of her involvement in bribing the sale manager of William Goei's companies. Lena Wong suggested to him that he should introduced the defendant to William Goei as the front man. The plaintiff was also involved in the transaction. She was `in the thick of it together with Lena Wong'. The plaintiff knew the Indonesian buyer and was liaising with him together with Lena Wong.
Tony Sim said he brought the defendant to see William Goei first and thereafter he arranged for a meeting between the defendant, Lauw and William Goei. He played the part of an intermediary between William Goei on the one hand and plaintiff and Lauw on the other. He was aware that on successful completion of the transaction, there was a commission of +% of the total sale price payable. He said that the +% was to be shared between the defendant, Lena Wong, plaintiff and himself. He said that all three of them, namely, Lena Wong, plaintiff and the defendant, played a part and the plaintiff had an important role to play in the transaction. It was Lena Wong who initiated the sharing of the commission amoung the four of them. At that time, he was in Government service - he was then an officer of CPIB - and was not sure whether he should receive a commission. He expressed his doubt to William Goei who said that that was a proper transaction and no corruption was involved. The four of them were happy with the arrangement on the signing of the sale agreements. They even had a dinner at Swatow Restaurant to celebrate the signing.
In cross-examination, Tony Sim confirmed that he had instituted an action against the defendant to recover his share of the commission. He said that Lena Wong initiated the sharing of the commission among the four of them after the second meeting between William Goei, the buyer and the defendant and himself. He denied that William Goei had agreed to pay an additional +% commission to him and the plaintiff and that the plaintiff's share was for the credit of Lauw. It was suggested to him that the +% commission under the agreement was to be shared between the defendant and Lena Wong only, and to that he replied that Lena Wong was in the background and if she was entitled to it, so would all four of them, and there was no reason for the +% to be shared between Lena Wong and the defendant leaving him and the plaintiff out.
Tony Sim also confirmed that he gave the name of the plaintiff to Mrs Eng Siat Khevn and requested that in respect of his portion of the commission, one cheque should be made out in his name and the other in favour of the plaintiff. The cheques were made out but were not given because the defendant refused to sign the document requested by Mrs Eng. He was also cross-examined on his request to Mrs Eng to make out a cheque giving a share of the commission to the plaintiff. His answer for so doing was that he was afraid `that things like this happened and it really happened'.
The last witness for the plaintiff was Ong Chong Yam who was an employee of the plaintiff. His evidence was not very material and was based essentially on hearsay and was this. He said that he heard from the plaintiff and Lena Wong of the sale of the Goldhill properties to an Indonesian client. He was told that there were some problems in negotiating and that they had decided to ask the defendant to act as the middle man. He was told subsequently - he did not say by whom - that the commission would be shared equally between the four parties. He did say that on the day the agreements were signed the plaintiff, Lena Wong and the defendant came back to the office and that they purchased some jade necklaces through a friend of his called Yap Chi Wee. He also testified that he subsequently heard from Lena Wong that the plaintiff's share of the commission would be reduced.
The defendant himself gave evidence. He said that he knew the plaintiff. She was his sale assistant at Tong Eng Brothers Pte Ltd. Subsequently, the plaintiff set up her own firm called Queensfield Properties. Prior to the sale of the Goldhill properties, he had handled a sale with the plaintiff, and in that sale he was the purchaser and the property was a unit at the Golden Mile Complex. The plaintiff played a role in that sale and he paid her a commission. Beside that transaction, he said he had not handled any transaction with the plaintiff. In respect of two other transactions referred to by the plaintiff, he dealt with Lena Wong and not the plaintiff. He knew that Lena Wong was an associate of the plaintiff at the time. They shared the same office. He accepted that in respect of these two transactions he received the cheques for payment of his commissions from the plaintiff but he issued his invoices and his receipts to Lena Wong's firm, Kingsfield Properties.
The defendant said that he came to know that the Goldhill properties were for sale around May 1989. He was approached to be the agent for the sale of Goldhill properties by Lena Wong who told him that she had a buyer. On being so approached, he `sized her up' by introducing her a property, 53/55 New Bridge Road and arranged for a site meeting. The meeting was arranged on 15 May 1989 and he was introduced to Lauw at the site. Present there at the meeting were also the representative of the seller and the plaintiff. The buyer made an offer but the seller refused to sell. Immediately thereafter, they worked on the Goldhill properties. Lena Wong told him that as the sale of the Goldhill properties was a big transaction, it involved difficult negotiation and suggested that he should be the negotiator for the deal to which he agreed. He wanted to get in touch with William Goei but Lena Wong said that `things would be made easier' if Tony Sim was involved. Lena Wong told him that Tony Sim knew William Goei personally and that she would get Tony Sim to speak to William Goei to appoint the defendant as the agent for the sale. The defendant initially objected to Lena Wong using Tony Sim as it was not necessary and the Goldhill properties were in the open market. He subsequently relented because Lena Wong told him that it would not affect their deal or commission since Tony Sim did not want any money. He therefore agreed. That conversation took place at about the time when they were discussing the sale of New Bridge Road property and nobody was present except him and Lena Wong. Lena Wong then arranged for an appointment for him to see William Goei. That first meeting was only between him, Tony Sim and William Goei. He was brought there by Tony Sim. At that meeting, they discussed the value of the properties and also the commission payable. It was agreed that the commission should be 1%. After that meeting, he went to see Lauw and explained to him the Goldhill properties. Subsequently, through Tony Sim, a meeting was set up for William Goei to meet Lauw. On that occasion, he, Tony Sim and Lauw met William Goei. The meeting was on 16 May 1989. At that meeting, agreement was reached between William Goei and Lauw on the sale and purchase of the Goldhill properties.
The defendant said that after the completion of the sales, he was not paid the commission as agreed. He sent invoices to William Goei for payment. His commission was officially +%. After some events which happened before completion of the sale, Tony Sim wanted a share of the commission and so did the buyer. This was communicated to him through the plaintiff, and that was before the buyer made his decision to purchase the property. He had no choice but to agree, and Tony Sim again arranged for him to see William Goei. He saw William Goei again and it was then agreed that the +% was to be stated in the contract and the additional +% to be on `a gentleman's agreement'. William Goei specifically said that Tony Sim would collect the additional +% from him and the +% commission appearing on the sale and purchase agreement was specifically for the defendant. As Lena Wong was his co-broker, he would share the +% with Lena Wong. The other +% was to be shared between Tony Sim and the buyer. After the completion, he sent the requisite invoices for the commissions. But he received a letter from Goldhill Properties (Pte) Ltd stating that they only agreed to pay the +% commission as provided in the sale agreement. They went to the office of Goldhill Properties (Pte) Ltd and saw Mrs Eng and had a conversation with her. She wanted him to confirm in writing the authorisation for payment of the commission to Sim and plaintiff but he disagreed and refused to sign the letter because she refused to answer when the other +% commission would be forthcoming. He refused to give a letter stating full and final settlement of the commission. He subsequently sued for his +% commission and obtained summary judgment for the amount. He confirmed that he had not agreed at any stage to share the +% with the plaintiff; nor had he agreed to share any commission with Tony Sim.
He denied that the plaintiff was involved in any discussion relating to the transaction and said that she only appeared at lunch and dinner which Lauw hosted. He conceded that the plaintiff had a special relationship with Lauw who liked her and Lena Wong very much and that the plaintiff was closer to Lauw than Lena Wong.
Lena Wong gave evidence for the defendant and so far as material her evidence was this. She was and is the sole proprietress of Kingsfield Properties. She knew both the plaintiff and the defendant. She and the plaintiff were business associates and they shared the same office and the expenses. The plaintiff was the sole proprietress of Queensfield Properties. There were times when they were co-brokers in transactions. She knew Lauw since mid-1988 and she was introduced to him by the plaintiff. Lauw had made purchases of properties through her. The first transaction was the sale of two units in Tanglin Park and one unit at Pinewood. She was the broker for the sale of these properties to Lauw. She said that the plaintiff had special relationship with Lauw; the plaintiff addressed him as `father' in Mandarin. In the first transaction, she had to share commission with the plaintiff, and she did so also in respect of the second transaction and that was the sale of nine units in Casa Rosita to Lauw. In that transaction, she took the commission on the sale of the five units and the plaintiff took the commission on the sale of the four units directly from City Development Limited. She came to know that the Goldhill properties were for sale in June 1988 when she first dealt directly with William Goei in connection with renting of 12,000 sq. ft. of office space at Goldhill Plaza. She was the broker for the renting of that office space and she came to know William Goei personally. Subsequently, she said she was involved in bribing one Vincent Chong who was the property manager of Goldhill group of companies by paying him $3,000 so that he could expedite the processing of the lease of the property to the tenant. The matter was investigated by the CPIB and she was the witness for the CPIB in connection with the prosecution of Vincent Chong. As a result of that case, she came to know Tony Sim.
Lena Wong said that later she became friendly with Tony Sim. She understood from him that William Goei was still interested in selling the Goldhill properties. She told Tony Sim that she would not have a chance with William Goei but Tony Sim said that he knew William Goei very well and would be able to assist her as a friend. Tony Sim suggested that she should look for someone to front for her and accordingly she approached the defendant for the purpose. The defendant agreed. She told the defendant to write to potential buyers in Hong Kong but there was no response. In the meantime, the defendant told her that he had a building for sale and that was 53/55 New Bridge Road and she told him that she had a buyer. She thereupon telephoned Lauw and got in touch with him. She said she shared the same office with the plaintiff and it was she who telephoned Lauw. Lauw came to Singapore on 14 May 1989 and on the following day, she, the plaintiff and Lauw went to see the building, 53/55 New Bridge Road. The defendant and the seller's representative were there. At the site, she introduced Lauw to the defendant. The purchase of the property did not go through. She then casually told Lauw that the Goldhill properties were for sale and that she had a friend who was close to William Goei who could assist. Lauw appeared to be interested and accordingly, she asked Tony Sim to fix an appointment with William Goei and bring the defendant to meet him. Accordingly, an appointment was fixed and Tony Sim brought the defendant to meet William Goei. Thereafter, she told Tony Sim to fix another appointment for Lauw to meet William Goei together with the defendant. The appointment was fixed. She was advised by Tony Sim that neither the plaintiff nor she herself should appear as they might jeopardise the deal.
The hearing of this case was not concluded on the date as originally scheduled and was adjourned. At the continued hearing, Lena Wong recounted substantially what she had said earlier. She said that the plaintiff was never involved in the transaction and that the plaintiff was `a girlfriend' of the buyer. The plaintiff was always with the buyer right from the minute he was in Singapore and that had been the case from the first day she met Lauw. Lena Wong further said that initially Tony Sim did not want a share of the commission; just before the sale, Tony Sim said that he wanted a share of the commission and the plaintiff also said that the buyer wanted a share too. Lena Wong therefore got in touch with the defendant and the defendant said there would be legal complications especially when the CPIB officer was involved and he did not wish to pay the CPIB officer and the buyer. The defendant therefore arranged for cash payment. Thereafter, Tony Sim made an appointment for the defendant to see William Goei to discuss about the matter. The meeting was arranged and that was probably four days before the sale was made. The defendant and Tony Sim attended the meeting with William Goei and she said that after the meeting she was informed that William Goei suggested to split the commission into two portions: +% to be spelled out in the contract and +% to Tony Sim and the buyer which would not be so spelled out.
Lena Wong said she knew Lauw in mid-May 1988. She was introduced to Lauw by the plaintiff and had put through two deals with Lauw after she met him. The first deal was the sale of two units in Tanglin Park and one unit in Pinewood and the second deal was the sale of nine units in Casa Rosita. In both the deals, she shared the commissions with the plaintiff. That was a normal practice. She claimed that in respect of the three sales, she was the one who made the recommendation to Lauw to buy. Around that time, she was sharing the premises with the plaintiff and she was paying most of the bills, rentals, telephone bills and even advertisements. Subsequently, she and the plaintiff split up. She moved out of the premises. Her relationship with the plaintiff had deteriorated before she moved out. That took place before the Goldhill properties deal which was in May 1989.
Lena Wong further testified that on the matter of the Goldhill properties she contacted Lauw and did not revert to the plaintiff. She said that the plaintiff was trying to jeopardise the sale by telling Lauw that the defendant was not a good valuer. She did not agree to share the commission with the plaintiff.
In addition to the viva voce evidence, the parties had produced before me two bundles of documents. In one bundle were affidavits used in the application for summary judgment. Counsel for both parties agreed to these bundles of documents being admitted without formal proof. As for the affidavits they were relied upon by counsel where appropriate, and the deponents thereof confirmed what they had deposed to and were cross-examined thereon. These affidavits therefore formed part of the evidence.
I now turn to the main issue before me: whether there was any agreement by the defendant to pay to the plaintiff , of the commission he had received from the vendors of the Goldhill properties. The factual background and the surrounding circumstances are highly relevant, and I made the following findings. First, until the breakdown of their relationship, the plaintiff and Lena Wong worked very closely together. Both were estate agents; the plaintiff was the sole proprietress of Queensfield Properties and Lena Wong the sole proprietress of Kingsfield Properties; and each regarded the other as her associate; they carried on their respective businesses at the same office and shared the expenses incurred and in several transactions they worked together and shared the commissions earned. This happy and close relationship subsequently broke down; Lena Wong claimed that this happened before the sale of the Goldhill properties. That was highly unlikely; and I think that happened after the sale was concluded but before the sale was completed. Lena Wong moved out of the plaintiff's premises in August 1989 and that happened soon after the plaintiff and Lena Wong had a very heated quarrel in the office at which, according to the plaintiff, Lena Wong threw an ash tray through the glass partition and police was called. That was not denied by Lena Wong.
Secondly, the plaintiff had a long and very close relationship with Lauw and Lauw was regarded as her client. She knew Lauw since 1982. She was the one who introduced Lauw to Lena Wong and that was in mid-1988. In her evidence, Lena Wong said that the plaintiff had a special relationship with Lauw and that she was extremely close to Lauw; right from the minute Lauw was here, the plaintiff was always with him and that had been the case from the first day Lena Wong met Lauw.
Thirdly, there were three transactions, namely, the sales to Lauw of two units in Tanglin Park, one unit in Pinewood and nine units in Casa Rosita, where the plaintiff and Lena Wong shared the commissions. The plaintiff claimed that Lauw bought these properties through her, whereas Lena Wong claimed that these transactions were handled and finalized by her and that she had to give the plaintiff a share of the commission because of the close relationship the plaintiff had with Lauw. I did not accept the evidence of either of them in toto. I think that both of them were involved in those transactions as agents either for the vendors and/or purchasers, and for that reason, they shared the commissions. They were then working very closely together.
Lastly, the defendant also knew the plaintiff well. She was his assistant when she first started at Tong Eng Brothers Pte Ltd and when she started her business, he used to assist her. She even said that he was her `boyfriend'. There was certainly no denying of the fact that they knew each other well. On the business side, they had also dealt with each other. There was certainly one transaction in which the defendant had paid to the plaintiff a share of the commission and that was in relation to his purchase of a unit at Golden Mile Complex. In addition, there were the sales of one unit in 6, Ardmore Park and one unit in Beverly Mai where the three of them, the plaintiff, Lena Wong and the defendant shared the commissions. It is true that in respect of these transactions, the defendant issued his invoices and receipts to Kingsfield Properties. However, he must have known, and my inference was that he was fully aware, that the payments to him were made by Queensfield Properties and that the plaintiff was involved in those transactions, though as a matter of contract, he would look towards Lena Wong for payment of his share of the commissions.
With this factual background and surrounding circumstances, I turn to the findings on the main issue. I was disposed to accept the evidence of the plaintiff that she was aware that the Goldhill properties were on the market for sale sometime in April or May 1989 and that she discussed the properties with Lena Wong. It must have dawned on both of them that Lauw would be a potential buyer for such substantial properties and that both of them would have difficulties in approaching William Goei because of Lena Wong's involvement in bribing William Goei's sale manager. They must have discussed the means of overcoming such difficulty and considered enlisting the help of the defendant to front for them. By that time, Lena Wong must have spoken to Tony Sim who had offered to help her. I was also disposed to accept the evidence of the plaintiff that she was the one who telephoned Lauw and got in touch with him and informed him of the Goldhill properties and that in response he came to Singapore. He came on 14 May 1989. The plaintiff said she introduced Lauw to the defendant at the Sheraton Tower where Lauw was staying and that Lauw could not have used the defendant as a broker without her introduction. That evidence I also accepted. As Lauw was such a strong potential buyer, it was very likely that upon his arrival in Singapore, Lena Wong and the defendant went to the hotel to see him and discussed with him the Goldhill properties, and there the plaintiff (who probably was with Lauw upon his arrival in Singapore) introduced Lauw to the defendant.
I rejected the evidence of Lena Wong that it was she who got in touch with Lauw in connection with the Goldhill properties. Lena Wong's testimony on this point was wholly unconvincing to me. She said that she heard from Tony Sim in April 1989 that William Goei was interested in selling the Goldhill properties; that Tony Sim suggested that she should get someone to front for her; that in early May, she approached the defendant who was agreeable; that she told him to write to potential buyers in Hong Kong but there was no response; that in the meantime, the defendant told her that the building, 53/55 New Bridge Road, was for sale to which she said that she had a buyer; that she got in touch with Lauw in respect of that property; that Lauw came to Singapore on 14 May 1989; that on the following day she brought him to see the building, and that it was there that she introduced the defendant to Lauw. That deal did not go through, and she then `casually' mentioned to Lauw that the Goldhill properties were for sale. I found Lena Wong's evidence here too contrived; it was intended to fit in with the evidence of the defendant that Lena Wong introduced Lauw to him at the site meeting at 53/55 New Bridge Road.
I also did not accept the evidence of the defendant that he was introduced by Lena Wong to Lauw on 15 May at the site meeting when they inspected the building, 53/55 New Bridge Road. According to the defendant, when Lena Wong approached him to be the agent of the Goldhill properties and told him that she had `a substantial buyer', he tried `to size her up' by introducing the property, 53/55 New Bridge Road property, and a meeting at the site was arranged, and it was there that Lena Wong introduced Lauw to him. That indeed was incredible. The defendant at that time knew Lena Wong. They had dealt with each other before and had shared commissions on certain transactions. There was hardly any need for the defendant `to size her up' in respect of either her intention or her connection. I accepted the evidence that Lauw, the plaintiff and Lena Wong went to see the building, and the defendant and the representative of the sellers were present at that meeting. That probably was not the first time Lauw met the defendant. It was possible and indeed, in my view, probable that Lauw being a substantial buyer from Indonesia and having arrived in Singapore, the defendant upon meeting him at the hotel in connection with the Goldhill properties would also have mentioned to him that another property was for sale, and following that the defendant arranged to show him that property.
It was clear to me that in respect of the Goldhill properties, the defendant was requested to front for the plaintiff and Lena Wong as neither of them would be able to secure an appointment to see William Goei even with the assistance of Tony Sim. At that time, certainly Lena Wong did not have any good relationship with William Goei and the plaintiff was an associate of Lena Wong and if either Lena Wong or the plaintiff or both were to act as the agents, William Goei would probably not deal with either of them. If both or either of them could do so, they would not have enlisted the help of the defendant for the purpose. The defendant said that the sale of Goldhill properties was a big deal involving difficult negotiations and Lena Wong suggested that he should be the negotiator, and he agreed. I had great difficulty in accepting such evidence. The defendant certainly did not strike me as possessing such superior skill in negotiation which both the ladies were lacking. In particular, Lena Wong appeared to me to be a very able and astute business woman. It was also clear to me that but for Tony Sim's participation, William Goei would probably not be prepared to see the defendant and discussed with him the Goldhill properties. Tony Sim enjoyed good relationship with William Goei and it was through Tony Sim's introduction that the defendant met William Goei. The defendant was brought along to see William Goei by Tony Sim. Following that, Tony Sim brought Lauw and the defendant to see William Goei and introduced Lauw to William Goei.
Tony Sim in his evidence said that the plaintiff was involved in the transaction, that she was `in the thick of it together with Lena Wong' and that she was liaising with Lauw together with Lena Wong. I accepted his evidence. I also accepted his evidence that it was agreed that the +% commission was to be shared between him, the plaintiff, the defendant and Lena Wong equally. In accepting Tony Sim's evidence, I had borne in mind that he was in a way an interested party in the sense he has instituted an action against the defendant seeking to recover his share of the commission and the action is still pending. I think that initially Tony Sim did not want a share of the commission. This was borne out by the evidence of Lena Wong and Tony Sim himself. Later, he changed his mind. It was in evidence that just before Lauw concluded his negotiations with William Goei, Tony Sim said he wanted a share of the commission and so did the buyer. The inference I drew was that when the prospect of the transaction being concluded became imminent, Tony Sim changed his mind and wanted a share of the commission and Lauw intervened to ensure that the plaintiff would get her share of the commission. Clearly there was an agreement reached then, if it had not been reached earlier, and I so found, that the commission payable by the vendors would be shared by the four of them equally, namely, the plaintiff, Tony Sim, the defendant and Lena Wong.
I think that the evidence of Mrs Eng did shade some light on the issue before me. It was her evidence that the first time when the defendant and Tony Sim came to her office, she explained that the +% commission was to be paid to Tony Sim and the defendant and they agreed to the cheques being made out for payment as to 50% thereof to Tony Sim and the balance of 50% to the defendant and they told her that each of them would look after `his partner'. At that point, Mrs Eng requested the defendant to give a letter authorising payment to Tony Sim and both of them were happy with the suggestion. At that time there was no mistake on the part of the defendant as to what commission Mrs Eng was referring to: it was the +% commission as provided in the sale agreements. My reason for saying this was that prior to that date, on 29 September 1988 the defendant sent to William Goei, among other things, an invoice for the additional +% commission, and Mrs Eng by a letter dated 30 October 1989 wrote to the defendant referring to the invoice and stating in clear terms that the vendors only agreed to pay the +% commission as provided in the sale agreements. Hence, in so far as the payment of the commission was concerned, all three of them were ad idem.
It was also the evidence of Mrs Eng that subsequently Tony Sim telephoned her and said that his portion of the commission would be split between him and the plaintiff and that Tony Sim requested for three cheques to be made out; one cheque in favour of the defendant for 50% of the commission and one in favour of Tony Sim for 25% of the commission and one in favour of the plaintiff for the balance of 25%. On that basis, a draft letter of authorisation was telefaxed by Mrs Eng to the defendant which he was to type on his letterhead. The material part of the draft was as follows:
Please note that we have agreed to share half of the commission with the following persons since they assisted us in the abovementioned sale:

Please therefore issue a cheque of $232,694.00 made in our favour and 2 cheques for $116,347.00 each to the abovenamed.
According to Mrs Eng when Tony Sim and the defendant called again to collect the commission, the defendant only said that he would not sign the letter because of `tax implication'. It is significant that at that moment the defendant never said that the plaintiff whose name appeared on the draft letter was not entitled to any commission. This evidence of Mrs Eng was consistent with the claim of the plaintiff.
It must be borne in mind that by that time the close and happy relationship between the plaintiff and Lena Wong had broken down and there must have been some apprehension on the part of the plaintiff that she might not get her full share of the commission. It must have been agreed between Tony Sim and the plaintiff that she should get the 25% out of the portion that would be paid to Tony Sim. During the cross-examination of Tony Sim, he was asked whether it was his suggestion that the plaintiff should have her share of the commission paid out of his portion to which he replied that he was afraid `that things like this happened and it really happened'. That spontaneous answer was extremely significant and accounted for the reason for Tony Sim's portion to be divided between him and the plaintiff.
I think that the evidence of the plaintiff that after the completion of the sales of the Goldhill properties, the defendant and Lena Wong wanted to reduce her (the plaintiff's) share of the commission had an element of truth. I accepted her evidence. It was corroborated by the evidence of Ong Chong Yam who heard of this from Lena Wong. This reinforced the claim of the plaintiff; if she was not entitled to a share of the commission, there was no question of Lena Wong seeking to reduce her share.
I was unable to accept substantially what the defendant said in his evidence. First, the defendant seemed to have made sweeping statements without too concerned with their truth. In his affidavit filed in opposing the application for summary judgment, he stated more than once that he had never had any business dealing with the plaintiff and sought to give the impression that the plaintiff was a stranger to him. That, as the evidence had shown, was far from the truth. Secondly, the defendant had an inflated notion of himself and his evidence was highly exaggerated. He said that when he was approached by Lena Wong to be the agent for the Goldhill properties, he `sized up' her intention by introducing to her a property, 53/55 New Bridge Road. That, for reasons which I have given, was truly incredible. Further, he said that the sale of the Goldhill properties being a big deal involved difficult negotiation and Lena Wong suggested that he should be the negotiator for the deal. That again was incredible. Both the plaintiff and Lena Wong testified that the defendant was approached to act as the front man. In so far as negotiation is concerned, as I have said, there was no doubt in my mind that Lena Wong was sufficiently capable of negotiating on her own `a big deal'. The defendant also said that he initially objected to Lena Wong using Tony Sim as it was not necessary and the Goldhill properties were on the market, thus implying that he himself could have approached William Goei and introduced the buyer without Tony Sim's involvement. That was most unlikely or improbable, as according to the evidence that emerged, William Goei was a difficult person and would not see any agent whom he did not know. As regards his evidence of the additional +% which he was seeking to obtain from William Goei, I found that he prevaricated; I was not sure whether his evidence was that he was seeking the additional +% for himself or Tony Sim and if it was for the latter, why he had do it. His evidence on this aspect of the transaction was immaterial to my findings but it cast a grave doubt on his credibility and character as a witness and on the veracity of his evidence.
It is significant that the defendant had not at any time prior to the commencement of this action denied that the plaintiff was entitled to a share of the commission. Even when he was confronted with Khattar Wong & Partner's letter of 24 November 1989 which, among other things, set out the plaintiff's and Tony Sim's shares of the commission, there was not the slightest hint or suggestion that neither Tony Sim nor the plaintiff was entitled to the share of the commission as stated therein. At a later stage, in response to Khattar Wong & Partner's subsequent letter seeking a clarification of such sharing of commission, his solicitor wrote and stated, among other things, the following:
We have already stated out clients' position in our last letter. Our clients will pay the parties in question appropriately. The contract to pay the +% commission is between our clients and yours. Your clients have no contractual obligation to the two parties in question. How and when our clients pay the said parties is the responsibility of our clients.
Implicit in this para was an admission that he would pay the parties in question their shares of the commission.
In conclusion, I was unable to accept the evidence of Lena Wong and the defendant that the plaintiff was not involved in the sales of the Goldhill properties to Lauw and that she played no part in the transaction. As I have said, I found that she had discussed with Lena Wong the Goldhill properties and the use of the defendant to front for them; that she was the one who first got in touch with Lauw on the Goldhill properties; that she was the one who introduced Lauw to the defendant at the Sheraton Hotel; that she was `in the thick of it' together with Lena Wong, and that she liaised with Lauw together with Lena Wong. If she was not involved in the transaction at all, there was no reason for her to bring Lauw to UOB Building at the time of signing of the sale agreements and waited for him in her car by the road side - her evidence on this was not challenged or disputed - and there was also no reason for her to celebrate with them on the signing of the sale agreements and to purchase the jade necklaces for the religious purpose. It may be that her participation was not as aggressive and active as Lena Wong's and that she played a lesser role than Lena Wong. But a role in that transaction she did play. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I found that there was an agreement made between all the four of them, the plaintiff, the defendant, Lena Wong and Tony Sim to share the commission equally. I therefore found that her claim had been established.
