On 7 July 1992, the respondent, L Edward Epiphany D`Crus, pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to the following charge: 
 
You, L Edward Epiphany D`Crus, M/28 yrs NRIC 1542826, are charged that you, on or about 18 November 1990 at about 2.45pm at the void deck of Blk 13, Bedok South Road, Singapore did have in your possession a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 1.16g (nett) of cannabis, without any authorization under the said Act or Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 
 
 
The respondent was fined $2,000 with a default term of two months` imprisonment. The drugs were confiscated. On appeal by the public prosecutor, I allowed the appeal. A sentence of two years` imprisonment was substituted. I now give my reasons.
Section 8(a) read together with s 33(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`MDA`) stipulates a minimum sentence of two years` imprisonment where the person found guilty has a previous conviction for that offence. The respondent had a previous conviction for such an offence before a subordinate military court. In the court below, the learned district judge was of the view that the previous conviction before a subordinate military court could not be regarded as a previous conviction for the purpose of sentencing.
There are two issues at hand. The first is the general question whether a conviction before a subordinate military court can be regarded in a civil court (that is, a court of ordinary criminal jurisdiction) as a previous conviction for the purpose of sentencing. The second is specific to the present appeal - whether the MDA allows one to treat a conviction before a subordinate military court for an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA as a previous conviction for the purposes of s 33(2).
On the first issue, the learned district judge was of the view that a conviction before a subordinate military court could not be regarded as a previous conviction by a civil court for the purposes of sentencing. His reasons can be summarized as follows. First, the subordinate military court is not mentioned in s 3(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) nor in s 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) as a court of criminal jurisdiction `within Singapore`. Secondly, the subordinate military court as a creature of s 80 of the Singapore Armed Forces Act (Cap 295) (`SAFA`) has a unique status. Thirdly, by virtue of s 11(3) and (5) of the CPC the power to enhance sentence applies only to the civil courts exercising criminal jurisdiction.
As the first two reasons are interlinked I shall deal with them together. Article 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore states: 
 
The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force.
 
 
 
The word `court` is defined in s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) as: 
 
... any court of competent jurisdiction in Singapore.
 
 
 
Both the subordinate military court and the civil subordinate courts would fall under this general umbrella, a point acknowledged by the learned district judge.
The subordinate military court is not a `subordinate court` as defined in s 2 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). Further, it is not within the definition of subordinate courts within Singapore in s 3(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321), nor is it a court `for the administration of criminal justice within Singapore` under s 6 of the CPC. The subordinate military court is a creature of the SAFA. As such, there is a distinct dichotomy between the ordinary civil courts and the military courts: the SAFA relates only to persons subject to military law; it does not apply to civilians, and the High Court may only interfere in its operation by way of review and not appeal. Appeals from subordinate military courts lie to the Military Court of Appeal which constitutes a superior court of record from which there is no further appeal.
However, these observations do not inevitably lead to the conclusion drawn by the learned district judge that the clear distinction between the jurisdiction of the subordinate military courts and other subordinate courts must mean that a previous conviction by the subordinate military courts would be irrelevant to civil courts. In fact, the two spheres are not mutually exclusive. The statutes show two distinct and separate procedures that should be followed by each court once jurisdiction is assumed. However, the jurisdictions of the military and the civil courts are not entirely distinct and separate. The SAFA applies to all persons subject to military law, and by virtue of s 4 of the SAFA, the military court has exclusive jurisdiction where the offence is a military one. Additionally, however, under s 112 of the SAFA, the military court also possesses the jurisdiction to try a person subject to military law for any offence punishable by the law of Singapore. Thus where a person subject to military law commits an offence ordinarily tried by the civil courts, both the military and the civil courts would have concurrent jurisdiction as s 6 of the SAFA causes the jurisdiction of the civil court in such circumstance to remain unaffected. However, by virtue of s 108 of the SAFA, he may not be tried in both courts for the same offence. Thus, in certain circumstances, it would be a matter of chance whether an accused person is tried by a civil or a military court. As such, it would not be rational if the accused who is tried by the subordinate military courts is in a better position than another accused who is tried by the civil courts.
As for s 11(3) and (5) of the CPC, the proviso to s 11(3) states: 
 
Provided that where a District Court has convicted any person and it appears by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents, a punishment in excess of that prescribed in this subsection should be awarded, then the District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and shall record its reason for so doing.
 
 
 
Section 11(5) is a similar provision for the magistrate`s court. The terms `convictions` and `antecedents` are not defined in the CPC.
It seems clear that these sections merely prescribe generally the maximum punishment that the two courts are empowered to impose and have nothing to do with prescribing minimum sentences for particular offences on the basis of recidivism. The fact that they do not extend to subordinate military courts does not affect this latter issue.
The learned district judge thought that owing to the fact that s 6 of the CPC mentions only the High Court, the district court and the magistrate`s court, the terms `convictions` and `antecedents` in s 11(3) and (5) must mean only those arising from the courts so mentioned. This reading of the subsections in question is not the most apparent one. It would seem rather that s 6 omits to mention the military courts because those courts are creatures of the SAFA and as such the procedures in the CPC apply only insofar as they are provided for by the SAFA. There is nothing on the face of s 11(3) and (5) that forbids the inclusion of a previous conviction before the military court within the terms `previous conviction` and `antecedents`. Even if one restricts `previous convictions` to those courts defined by s 6 of the CPC, the word `antecedents` should not be given such a narrow construction.
This interpretation is supported by s 372 of the CPC which provides methods for proving previous convictions. As pointed out earlier, the subordinate military court is a court of competent jurisdiction as defined by the Interpretation Act. Owing to the fact that the CPC does not define `court`, the subordinate military court must be within the meaning of the word `court` in s 372(1)(a) of the CPC. It follows that a previous conviction before a subordinate military court may be proved by the methods prescribed by s 372, and it would be perverse to assume that a method of proof was provided for no purpose.
I now turn to the second issue - whether the MDA allows such a conviction to be considered for a s 8(a) offence.
Section 8 creates two types of offences: s 8(a), the offence of `possession` in question, and s 8(b), offences of `consumption`.
At the crux of the dispute is s 33 of the MDA, which prescribes the punishment for each offence. Section 33(1) states: 
 
Except as provided in subsection (3), the second schedule shall have effect, in accordance with subsection (2), with respect to the way in which offences under this Act are punishable on conviction.
 
 
 
Section 33(3) states: 
 
If a person convicted of an offence under s 8(b) is again convicted of such an offence, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 3 years; and in this subsection, `convicted of an offence` includes a conviction by a subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act.
 
 
 
Thus while the punishment for a s 8(a) offence is governed by s 33(2) and the second schedule, punishment for a s 8(b) offence is governed by s 33(3) which specifically mentions previous convictions under the SAFA.
The learned district judge reached two conclusions from this discrepancy. The first was that the legislature accepted that s 33(3) is an `importing provision` that enables an otherwise irrelevant conviction before a military court to be relevant in a civil court for repeat offences under s 8(b) of the MDA. The second was that by restricting the importing provision to the s 8(b) offence, the legislature intended that a conviction before the subordinate military court should have no such effect in cases of repeated offences under s 8(a). This was by application of the maxim 
 expressio unius est exclusio alterius 
 : the premise that the mention of some matters warrants an inference that other cognate matters were intentionally excluded.
The discrepancy between s 33(3) and s 33(2) can however be explained by looking at the whole history of s 33(3). In the original MDA (Act 5 of 1973), there was no equivalent of the present s 33(3). Section 33(2) and the second schedule of the MDA provided only for enhanced punishment for repeated offences of drug possession under s 8(a). The equivalent of s 33(3) was inserted later by the amending Act 12 of 1977 to provide for enhanced punishment for repeated offences of drug consumption under s 8(b) committed by the accused while being subject to supervision. The proviso regarding convictions by the subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal was added at the time as a cautionary measure to make clear that the term `supervision` covered both supervision by civil authorities as well as military supervision. This section was later amended by Act 38 of 1989, by which the requirement of the accused being subject to supervision was deleted, but the reference to the subordinate military court and the Military Court of Appeal was not.
It is against this background that one should examine the applicability of the maxim 
 expressio unius est exclusio alterius 
 . This maxim is an aid to construction and operates only where it is not outweighed by other interpretative factors. As such, the court must be open to any other avenues that might better explain the exclusio. The correct approach was well illustrated by Wills J in 
 Colquhoun v 
 
 Brooks 
 1 at p 406: 
 
... the method of construction summarized in the maxim 
 expressio unius exclusio
 
 alterius
 is one that certainly requires to be watched. Perhaps few so-called rules of interpretation have been more frequently misapplied and stretched beyond their due limits. The failure to make the expressio complete very often arises from accident, very often from the fact that it never struck the draftsman that the thing supposed to be excluded needed specific mention of any kind; and the application of this and every other technical rule of construction varies so much under differing circumstances, and is open to so many qualifications and exceptions, that it is rarely that such rules help one to arrive at what is meant. ...
 
 
 
In my view the reference to the subordinate military court and the Military Court of Appeal in s 33(3) does not have the emphasis that the learned district judge placed upon it. Section 33(2) and (3) were not drafted at the same time. Further, when s 33(3) was drafted, the reference to the military courts served a purpose peculiar unto itself, a purpose now obsolete but nonetheless outliving its original expression despite express amendment. It would appear that the words were left by oversight rather than by design. The expressio unius principle is inapplicable here.
For these reasons, I allowed the appeal, set aside the previous order and sentenced the respondent to the minimum two years` imprisonment.
