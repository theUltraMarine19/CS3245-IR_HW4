     REGINA v DAVID BERG 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: In the early hours of Monday 24 February 2003 the applicant, David Berg, was driving his motor vehicle when it left the edge of the roadway and came to rest on the passenger’s side of the vehicle. As a result the passenger in the motor vehicle was killed. At the time of the accident the applicant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. A blood sample taken a short time later showed an alcohol reading of 0.2. The applicant was charged with an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act. This is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence in the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court. 
     
      
    2 He appeared in the District Court at Lismore where he adhered to the plea of guilty. As a result Judge Phelan sentenced him to imprisonment totalling 5 years dating from 19 December 2003. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 18 December 2006, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. There is a balance of the term of 2 years. His Honour also disqualified the applicant for a period of 3 years from the date of the commencement of the sentence. 
     
      
    3 The applicant appeals against the severity of his sentence on grounds asserting that his Honour Judge Phelan erroneously took into account aggravating factors when assessing the seriousness of the offence and therefore a lesser sentence than that imposed is warranted in law. 
     
      
    4 There was no dispute as to the facts and they can be stated briefly. At the time of the accident the applicant was driving a Toyota Hi-Ace light goods van along New Ballina Road. It was raining and the road surface was wet. The vehicle left the passenger-side of the roadway and in doing so the front of the vehicle collided with an earth embankment. The impact caused the vehicle to roll and it came to rest on the passenger’s side. The deceased, who was not wearing a seat belt, was partially ejected from the vehicle as it rolled over and she died as a result of injuries occasioned when the vehicle came to rest across her body. There did not appear to be any other vehicle involved in the collision. A later examination of the vehicle revealed that the tyres displayed tread depths below the minimum legal requirement. The braking system was also in a poor condition. 
     
      
    5 A sample of the blood of the applicant revealed not only the presence of alcohol in the high range of PCA but also the existence of other drugs including morphine and cannabis. The expert evidence, however, was that, although the applicant would have been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision, it was unlikely that he would have been affected to any significant degree by the other drugs. 
     
      
    6 A reading of 0.2 is substantially over the lower limit for high range PCA. There was also evidence that the applicant was showing signs of intoxication when he was spoken to at the scene and later in hospital. He was described by a police officer as being well under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
     
      
    7 The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing but there was a psychological report tendered on his behalf that contained an account of the circumstances leading up to the offence. The applicant had been in a relationship with the deceased since November 2002, although they had not lived together. He described her as “a mate with similar goals and interests to his own”. He and the deceased agreed to meet at the deceased’s home on Sunday afternoon so that he could assist her nephew repair his motor vehicle. He remembers taking four bottles of beer to share with her. At about 1 a.m. the nephew wanted some food and they decided to drive to a nearby service station to purchase some. The accident occurred on the return journey. The applicant told the psychologist that he believed that an animal ran across the road and he swerved to miss it. He expressed disbelief to the psychologist that his blood alcohol reading was as high as was proved to be. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was aged 45 years at the time of sentence. He has a record for criminal offences and traffic matters dating from November 1978. His criminal antecedents include principally matters of dishonesty. He was sentenced to imprisonment in 1981 for charges of imposition and break, enter and steal offences in Queensland. In 1984 he was sentenced to imprisonment for burglary in Victoria. In 1985 he was placed on a good behaviour bond for an armed robbery in Victoria on condition that he attend Odyssey House, a drug rehabilitation centre. In 1988 he was placed on recognizance for 3 years under the NSW Probation and Parole Service for an offence of malicious wounding. In May 2001 he was placed on a good behaviour bond by the Albury Local Court for break, enter and steal and burglary. In May 2001 he was given a community based order by the Wodonga Magistrates Court for an offence of exceeding the prescribed concentration of alcohol after a breath test. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was first licensed in NSW in November 1989. At the time of the accident he had an unrestricted Class C licence. There was no traffic history recorded against him in this State although as I have already indicated there were some matters in Queensland and Victoria. 
     
      
    10 The psychologist reported that, although the applicant had abused both alcohol and drugs until his early 20’s, he settled down after he completed a rehabilitation programme and was, thereafter, able to maintain a steady relationship and constant employment. However, in 1988 he was injured in what was described as a “near-fatal accident” in his work place and as a result he became severely depressed and disorganised. He was unable to maintain his employment and his then relationship fell apart. In the years leading up to the accident the applicant had been trying to cope with depression and residual symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder for which at one time he was receiving medication and counselling. 
     
      
    11 At the time of the offence the applicant was engaged in a welfare programme called “Meals on the Street – Caring and Sharing” and was operating the “Communal Five Loaves Mobile Soup Kitchen”. In evidence before his Honour was a letter from the Mayor of Lismore dated February 2002 stating that the applicant was involved with providing free meals for homeless people and the distribution of second hand furniture for the needy. The applicant’s charitable works were funded by public donations. As a result of his efforts he received a number of service awards including in 1988 the Australia Day Award for Community Services and in 2000 he was Citizen of the Year. There were testimonials before his Honour as to the applicant’s general good character and the high regard in which he was held in the community. 
     
      
    12 There was also evidence as to the effect upon the applicant of the death of the deceased. The psychologist reported that the applicant was deeply traumatised and guilt-ridden over the accident and had contemplated suicide at times. The applicant told the psychologist that he was resigned to spending a period in prison and could cope with such a sentence. 
     
      
    13 Judge Phelan accepted that the applicant had shown considerable remorse. His Honour did not indicate the extent of the discount given for the plea or contrition but one can only assume that it must have been towards the top of the range as the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. The sentencing judge accepted that generally the applicant was a responsible, caring and mostly law-abiding person. 
     
      
    14 In light of the attack made upon his Honour’s use of the guideline judgment in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 and s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is appropriate to quote in full two passages from the Remarks on Sentence which, it is asserted by the applicant, disclose error. His Honour said 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the decision in  
        [Whyte] 
        , he does not fall particularly into the profile referred to there, as he is no longer young. He has a fairly long list of convictions, even up to the recent past. Other factors which I accept, such as genuine remorse and his plea of guilty, are of perhaps limited utilitarian value having regard to the high reading and the state of the car. I take into account the aggravating factors listed in  
        [Whyte]. 
         The degree of intoxication was very high. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the matters for consideration under s21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 
         the aggravating features which I have to consider include: the record of previous convictions; the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial; the offence was committed without regard for public safety. As regards mitigating factors, clearly the deceased’s relatives suffered emotional harm. If the offender undertakes substantial rehabilitation in relation to his alcohol it seems likely that he will not re-offend. He has good prospects of rehabilitation, as it has been demonstrated in the past that he has been able to overcome a drug problem, and with the same perseverance and the support of his network of friends he may be able to do the same.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour also stated: 
       
       
        
        In the circumstances it seems to me that the high reading and the state of the tyres in the rain place this in an intermediate category of seriousness.  
        
       
      
    15 The relevant factors influencing an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence were to be found in three distinct but related areas: the elements of the offence of aggravated dangerous driving; the guideline judgment in Whyte; and s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There was a degree of overlap in the areas and the relevant considerations arising under each. Section 52A(7) makes it a matter of aggravation that the applicant’s blood alcohol concentration was more than 0.15. The fact that there was a death was also an element of the offence. The presence of these two facts meant that the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    16 In Whyte this Court indicated the features of a frequently occurring case of an offence under either s 52A(1) or s 52A(3) that made it a typical instance of the offence of dangerous driving causing death. These features were:  
     
      
       
      (i) Young offender. 
       
        
        (ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions. 
         
        (i) Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
         
        (ii) The victim is a stranger. 
         
        (iii) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates. 
         
        (iv) Genuine remorse. 
        
       
      (vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 
       
       
      The Court then identified a number of matters that aggravate the offence as being: 
       
       
      (i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
       
        
        (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
         
        (iii) Degree of speed. 
         
        (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 
         
        (v) Erratic driving or aggressive driving. 
         
        (vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
         
        (vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
         
        (viii) Ignoring of warnings. 
         
        (ix) Escaping police pursuit 
         
        (x) Degree of sleep deprivation. 
        
       
      (xi) Failing to stop. 
       
       
      Matters numbered (iii) to (xi) were viewed as affecting the offender’s moral culpability. 
       
      
    17 The guideline in Whyte is to the effect that for an offence under s 52A(3) and where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time sentence of less than 3 years would not be appropriate. It was also stated that, in the aggravated form of the offence, it would be necessary to reflect the increased maximum penalty and the higher level of culpability. The applicant of course was sentenced for the aggravated offence and clearly a sentence of more than 3 years was warranted. 
     
      
    18 Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires the sentencing judge to take into account the presence of nominated aggravating or mitigating factors in determining the seriousness of the offence. These considerations reflect matters that would have been taken into account under the common law and the stated factors have to be read in light of the fact that Parliament by reason of the terms of s 21A(1) and s 21A(4) was not intending by the section to alter the common law approach to sentencing: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193. 
     
      
    19 In respect of the guideline in Whyte, Judge Phelan noted that the applicant did not fall into the typical case because the applicant was not young and had a criminal record. Those observations were with respect apposite. His Honour also said that he was taking into account the aggravating factors referred to in the guideline judgment and added the observation that “the degree of intoxication was very high”. 
     
      
    20 It is argued on behalf of the applicant, that his Honour was in error in not taking into account that the applicant fell outside the typical case because the deceased was not a stranger and that the applicant suffered psychological injury as a result of the accident. This argument however misunderstands the effect of the first limb of the guideline in Whyte which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment. 
        
       
      
    21 But the factors in the list set out in Whyte, as indicative of a typical case, do not operate as a checklist, the presence or absence of characteristics having some mathematical relationship with the sentence to be imposed. They merely describe the typical case and were not intended to circumscribe the sentencing judge’s discretion in the way the applicant suggests. If the applicant does not fall within a typical case for whatever reason, then the guideline is of less assistance than it might otherwise have been. The applicant fell outside the typical case of an offender to be sentenced for dangerous driving for a number of reasons and, therefore, the guideline had less influence upon the exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    22 In any event, to my mind the matters stated by his Honour were of more relevance than those omitted in this particular case. To take into account the effects of the accident upon the offender is really no more than to recognise that, as a matter of common humanity, the offender might have already been grievously punished by the consequences of his or her actions. But such feelings must give way to the importance of denunciation and general deterrence where appropriate. In my view that was the appropriate approach in the present case. 
     
      
    23 It was submitted further that his Honour erred in having regard to the aggravating features stated in Whyte because the only two of such features that were applicable were the level of intoxication and death. But, so the argument ran, as both of these matters were elements of the offence for which the applicant was to be sentenced, they could not be taken into account as aggravating factors because of the application of s 21A(2). 
     
      
    24 As I have already indicated, s 21A sets out aggravating and mitigating factors to be considered by a sentencing court. After listing the aggravating features to which a court is to have regard, s 21A(2) states: 
     
      
       
        
        The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
        
       
       
      It is submitted that his Honour breached this provision. 
       
      
    25 I do not agree. I see no error in his Honour referring in general terms to the aggravating factors identified in Whyte or in mentioning the level of the blood alcohol reading in particular. The fact that the applicant had a reading that was 30 per cent higher than the reading that would have made him liable for the aggravated offence was a highly relevant matter. Whyte accepts that generally the level of intoxication is an aggravating factor and, in my view, there is nothing in s 21A that prohibited his Honour taking that particular reading into account. 
     
      
    26 Nor do I accept that intoxication and death were the only matters of aggravation. The number of persons put at risk was a relevant factor and in this case the applicant knew he had a passenger in the motor vehicle who was in danger from his inability to control the vehicle because of his intoxicated state. The risk was increased by the wet conditions, the state of the tyres of the vehicle and the fact that the deceased would not wear a seat belt. In respect of this last matter, the applicant was in fact in breach of s 47B of the Road Transport Safety and Traffic Management Road Rules 1999. In my view these were all matters that went to the moral culpability of the applicant driving in his intoxicated state. 
     
      
    27 However, I believe that there is more merit in the criticism based upon his Honour’s consideration of the aggravating features under s 21A. In Wickham, above, it was pointed out that a sentencing court needs to exercise some care in considering s 21A(2), particularly having regard to the limitations found in subsection 2 itself and also in subsection 21A(4). It was noted that some of the aggravating factors mentioned in the section could not be taken at face value because they were limited in their scope by the application of common law principles. After referring to terms of s 21A(2), it was stated: 
     
      
       
        
        24. This provision can operate in one of two ways. Firstly, it can impose a limitation on the use to be made of a particular factor not otherwise apparent in the provisions of s 21A(2) or (3). For example, s 21A(2)(d) provides that an aggravating feature is that the offender has a record of previous convictions. 
        
       
       
        
        On its face that provision would indicate that a prior criminal record is a matter of aggravation by making the offence more serious. Yet the common law rule is that a prior record does not have the effect of aggravating an offence but it may either deprive the offender of leniency or indicate that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community:  
        R v Shankley 
         [2003] NSWCCA 253 at [31]. It has been held that s 21A(2)(d) should be read according to that common law principle:  
        R v Johnson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 76. 
        
       
       
        
        25. Similarly the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(g):  
        
       
       
        
        The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial would be limited by the rule that the effect upon persons of the death of the victim is not an aggravating feature of an offence such as murder:  
        R v Previtera 
         (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. It would also be limited by the common law rule that the court is only to have regard to the consequences of an offence that were intended or could reasonably have been foreseen:  
        Wise v R 
         [1965] Tas SR 196;  
        R v Boyd 
         [1975] VR 168. 
        
       
      
    28 The other way in which the limitation in the section can operate is so that a factor cannot be taken into account if to do so would be to punish the offender for some more serious offence than the one charged. This is not a matter that is of concern for the present application. 
     
      
    29 With respect, however, it appears to me that at least his Honour gave insufficient consideration to the factors listed in the sub-section and how they impacted on the particular case before him having regard to the relevant facts proved in evidence. There were two factors which his Honour took into account as aggravating features in relation to s 21A(2). The first was the applicant’s criminal record. Much of that record was, in my view, irrelevant. However, there was one matter which was relevant to a consideration of the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant and that was the fact that in 2001 the applicant had been convicted of an offence which appears to have arisen from his use of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. That was a matter which his Honour would have been entitled to take into account as indicating, in accordance with the principle in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 that personal deterrence was a matter which was to be given more significance than might otherwise have been the case. 
     
      
    30 The other matter raised was under s 21A(2)(g) in relation to whether “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. Although his Honour quoted the terms of that provision, he did not indicate what it was that was being taken into account as an aggravating factor. If his Honour meant by that reference, that he was taking into account that death was occasioned to the deceased, then clearly he was in error because, as has been pointed out, that is an element of the offence with which his Honour was sentencing the applicant and was not a matter his Honour could take into account additionally having regard to s 21A(2). 
     
      
    31 If his Honour was referring to the emotional harm suffered by the deceased’s relatives, there is some question as to whether his Honour had sufficient evidentiary material on which to make that finding. There was in this case, unusually perhaps, no victim impact statement. Nor was there any other material that indicated to any particular degree the effect upon the relatives of the deceased by her death. Clearly, one can presume that it would have had an impact. However, this is an aggravating factor and if it is to be taken into account there must be appropriate evidentiary material on which his Honour could be satisfied to the appropriate degree that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage was substantial. In my view, the criticism made of his Honour’s sentencing remarks in this regard in the exercise of his sentencing discretion has been made out and, in my view, this Court is required to reconsider the exercise of his Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
    32 In that regard the Court has been provided with material as to courses the applicant has undertaken during the period of his custody. We have before us, for the purpose of considering the re-sentencing of the applicant, a number of certificates awarded to him during the course of his custodial progress to date. They incorporate most relevantly that he has completed a course in lifestyle incorporating a component of alcohol abuse and one in respect of relapse prevention that also concerns the misuse of alcohol. 
     
      
    33 It is significant in sentencing the applicant that he has a substantial and lengthy period of rehabilitation following a start in his earlier life that might otherwise have augured badly for him. As I have already indicated, the psychologist noted that after his difficulties caused by, apparently, alcohol and drugs in the early twenties, he recovered and rehabilitated himself until met by another crisis in 1988 that apparently resulted in his lapse again to the misuse of alcohol. 
     
      
    34 In those circumstances, it seems to me that his Honour was correct in finding that there were special circumstances in relation to fixing the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence. 
     
      
    35 Another very significant consideration in the present case is the applicant’s history of social service, as indicated in the letter of the Mayor of Lismore and, as I have already indicated, in such a case as this, an offender is entitled to call upon the bank of credit arising from his community welfare support that has mounted over the years by way of mitigation. 
     
      
    36 The Court should grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal, quash the orders made by Phelan DCJ and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and three months, that period to commence on 19 December 2003 and to expire on 18 March 2006, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. There should be a balance of the term of imprisonment of one year nine months which is to commence on 19 March 2006. 
     
      
    37 SPIGELMAN CJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J and with his Honour’s reasons. I wish to add observations of my own on three matters. 
     
      
    38 First, Howie J referred to the sentencing Judge’s treatment of s21A(2)(g) with respect to injury, emotional harm, loss or damage being substantial. I agree with what Howie J has said that there was no evidence upon which the emotional harm suffered by the relatives of the deceased could have been assessed as substantial by his Honour. 
     
      
    39 There is, however, one other factor which his Honour may have been referring to when indicating in his reasons that s21A(2)(g) was relevant, namely, that injury by way of death to the deceased was substantial. This is the only other matter that, in my opinion, could have answered that description. If his Honour was intending to take that matter into account, then his Honour was prohibited from doing so by the concluding words of s21A which state that additional regard may not be had to a factor which is an element of the offence. Death was an element of the offence of which the appellant was charged. 
     
      
    40 The second matter to which I wish to refer is the reference to the prior convictions as a relevant aggravating factor under s21A(2)(d). Howie J has referred to his judgment to Wickham and has set out in his judgment pars [24] and [25] thereof. In par [24] his Honour made reference to a suggestion that a prior criminal record is a matter of aggravation by making the offence more serious. In his judgment today, Howie J has referred to the principles set down by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 which indicates the circumstances in which prior convictions become material to sentence. It is not necessary for me to decide in this case whether or not that part of the High Court’s judgment was intended as a comprehensive statement of those circumstances. It is sufficient to note that there are such relevant circumstances and that the terms of s21A(2)(d) of the Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 identify aggravating circumstances which, as the introductory words of the subsection state, are “to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence”. This is a different test to that stated in Wickham to the effect that a matter of aggravation makes the offence more serious. As Veen v The Queen makes clear, and as Howie J’s judgment today indicates, there are such matters which become relevant to the process of “determining the appropriate sentence”. 
     
      
    41 I agree with what Howie J has said, that in the present case there was only one relevant conviction. That was the conviction in 2001 for an offence involving drinking and driving. This did suggest that considerations of personal deterrence were relevant to the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    42 The final matter to which I wish to refer is the case of R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 which is referred to in par [25] of Wickham. That case does suggest that a victim impact statement is not relevant to the sentencing exercise, at least in the circumstances considered in that case, where there had been a death. 
     
      
    43 The reasons given in Previtera may need to be reconsidered in an appropriate case, by reason of the inclusion of the statement of the purposes of sentencing in s3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act 1999. I refer particularly to the reference in s3A(g) “To recognise the harm done to ... the community.” (See Re Attorney General’s Application under s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 2 of 2002) (2002) 136 A Crim R 196 at [57]-[59].) 
     
      
    44 It appears to me strongly arguable that the recognition of this purpose of sentencing would encompass the kind of matters which are incorporated in a victim impact statement. It may in some cases, be appropriate to consider the contents of such statements in the sentencing exercise. This was not a purpose of sentence recognised by Hunt CJ at CL in Previtera, see at p86. 
     
      
    45 The terminology considered by Hunt CJ at CL in Previtera which confers a discretion on the Court to consider the contents of the victim impact statement, which was present in the legislation then under consideration, is still contained in the reference to “if it considers it appropriate to do so” in s28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Whether or not Previtera needs to be re-visited in terms of its specific reasoning on the role of the victim impact statement, and more generally on the apparent application of s21A(2)(g) to the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence to third parties, need not be determined on this occasion. There is no victim impact statement in this case. Nor, for the reasons given by Howie J, was there evidence capable of satisfying the particular statutory test in this case. 
     
      
    46 I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J. 
     
      
    47 WOOD CJ at CL: I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J and with the reasons therefor stated by his Honour. I also agree with the additional observations of Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    48 However, I would sound a note of caution in relation to the proper approach to fact-finding concerning the impact of a crime upon other members of the community or, upon the victim. If that is to be achieved by way of victim impact statements, then an injustice may occur in relation to a person standing for sentence, in so far as the maker of the statement would not normally be available for cross-examination. 
     
      
    49 I add that caution in support of the general proposition that extreme care needs to be taken by those who prosecute and defend these cases, and also by trial Judges in always ensuring that there is a proper evidentiary basis for any findings of fact which go towards aggravating or mitigating a sentence. 
     
      
    50 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is as indicated by Howie J.

     REGINA v Craig Anthony REID 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: On 5 July 2004 Craig Anthony Reid pleaded guilty to a charge that on or about 7 August 2002 he murdered Samantha Meredith. The matter came before Justice Hulme for sentencing. His Honour was asked to refer the matter to a different judge for sentencing. 
     
      
    2 This application was based on the fact that on 13 May 2004 Justice Hulme had sentenced Sharon Louise Ward for being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Samantha Meredith. Counsel for Mr Reid asked that Justice Hulme disqualify himself from sentencing the Applicant on the basis of his remarks on sentence in the case of Ward. In a judgment of 23 July 2004 Justice Hulme refused to disqualify himself.  
     
      
    3 Before this Court is an application under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal from the decision of Justice Hulme. The Applicant submits that his Honour made an interlocutory judgment or order, within the meaning of s5F.  
     
      
    4 It is necessary to set out some sections of the remarks on sentence of Justice Hulme on 13 May 2004 in the case of Sharon Louise Ward: 
     
      
       
        
        “[42] So far as the Prisoner’s demeanour during the course of her evidence is concerned she was upset and seemed genuine. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [46] … Although the deceased was wrapped in a coat belonging to the Prisoner, there is no evidence how this came about and I am not persuaded to the requisite standard that the Prisoner was involved in the wrapping of the body or in the placing of it in the boot. Nor am I satisfied that when she drove the vehicle to ’Greg Greg’ that the body was in the boot or, if it was, the Prisoner knew that. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [48] Undoubtedly, insofar as her actions were the result of threats by, and fear of Craig Reid, her subjective criminality is lessened. However it is not avoided. Very commonly if not almost universally, participation in offending by accessories after the fact is inspired by some emotional relationship with a principal offender, e.g. love, affection, loyalty or fear. Such offending commonly represents a choice to place the interests of the principal offender ahead of those of the victim and/or the public generally. 
        
       
       
        
        [49] It did so in this case. It is implicit in the Prisoner’s actions that she preferred to help Mr Reid, who she knew had bashed one woman with a hammer and slit her throat, to avoid detection and to remain in the community where he could do the same again, as he, to her knowledge, seemed willing to contemplate, than to either tell the truth when asked or remain silent. ( I do not of course, suggest that, at least so far as the offence of being an accessory after the fact is concerned, the Prisoner was obliged to speak, either to the relatives or friends of the deceased or the police.) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [51] It seems likely that the Prisoner’s past experiences of violence predisposed her to acquiesce in Mr Reid’s demands. Her inherent or acquired nature as revealed by her willingness, however reluctantly, to continue relationships in which she was subjected to violence was probably a reinforcement in that regard. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [53] Nevertheless, there remains the fact that,  
        on the evidence before me 
        , the prisoner had no reason to clean up the murder scene unless it be the threats she said were made by Mr Reid. Once implicated of course, that provided a reason for lying in the interview of 23 November although the probability is that at that time and at the time of her second interview, both those threats and the decision to help Mr Reid, were still operative. [Emphasis added] 
        
       
       
        
        [54] Her ability and failure to inform the authorities prior to and on 23 November argues in 2 directions. On the one hand it may indicate the force on her of Mr Reid’s threats. On the other hand, it argues for her willingness not to do the right thing. And even when, in her statement of 22 January she did implicate Mr Reid, her lies on that occasion mean that that statement could by no means be regarded as an unequivocal attempt to redeem herself. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [58] Notwithstanding that I accept the Prisoner’s actions were at least to a substantial extent inspired by fear, it seems to me that an appropriate starting point in the determination of the final sentence is imprisonment for 7 years. But for that factor of fear, that starting point would have been higher. I draw attention also to the fact that 7 years is only marginally more than one quarter of the 25 year maximum for which Parliament has provided and that, as a general proposition, once regard is had to the impact on offenders’ lives, imprisonment for a longer period is more than proportionately severe than that for shorter periods.”  
        
       
      
    5 Of particular importance is par [4]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] It follows from the Prisoner’s plea that, as between the Crown and the Prisoner, all the facts implicit in her plea are established. It follows from the absence of challenge to the Statement of Facts that I am entitled to regard them also as established.  
        Of course, none of those matters are evidence against Mr Reid and the remarks made herein do not represent findings so far as he is concerned… 
        ” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    6 His Honour’s judgment in the parts I have emphasised from par [4] and par [53] indicate an awareness on his part, at the time of sentencing Ms Ward, that his Honour was proceeding on a basis of an assumed and agreed set of facts, rather than on the basis that he made independent findings of fact based on contested proceedings. 
     
      
    7 In his Honour’s judgment in these proceedings, from which leave to appeal is sought, his Honour made the following observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “[5] It is necessary to say something more about the sentencing proceedings involving Mrs Ward. The first point which should be made is that Mrs Ward had indicated that she would give evidence for the Crown against Mr Reid and,  
        as commonly happens in that situation, there was no, or no appreciable, dispute about the evidence or the conclusions which should be drawn from it. 
         … 
        
       
       
        
        [6] In addition Mrs Ward gave evidence and was cross-examined. In chief, she gave evidence of threats and violence towards her by Mr Reid. Asked why she had assisted Mr Reid, she said, ‘I didn’t have a choice. I had been threatened by Mr Reid. If I didn’t do it he would kill my son and then he would kill me’. She said that she remained willing to give evidence against him. This willingness had been first made manifest in January 2003 Mrs Ward after her second interview with police officers investigating Ms Meredith’s death. 
        
       
       
        
        [7] The Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination of her extended over only 2 pages. It included questions directed to obtaining a re-affirmation of her willingness to give evidence and questions whether she had received any threats since Mr Reid’s arrest. There were also some questions directed to evidence she had given of a view that the police could not protect her.  
        There was no challenge to her evidence of threats by Mr Reid or as to her having been influenced by them or directed to her having any involvement in Ms Meredith’s death otherwise than as an accessory. 
        ” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour also noted at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[17] … My findings in the proceedings involving Mrs Ward … were on the basis of evidence which was neither contested nor contradicted.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour was asked to recuse by applying the test in a form often repeated in the authorities, which was accepted by both parties and in this Court to be the particular formulation in Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association of New South Wales (1983) 151 CLR 288, where the High Court said at 293-294: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle is that a judge should not sit to hear a case if in all the circumstances the parties or the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question involved in it.” 
        
       
      
    10 It is agreed that this is the appropriate test to be applied.  
     
      
    11 Before Hulme J the Crown took the position that it agreed to the application, so that some other sentencing judge would proceed to sentence the Applicant. However, in this Court, whilst the Crown remains of that view, it does direct the Court’s attention to the fact that there is a very real question as to whether or not this Court has jurisdiction to determine the application now before the Court. 
     
      
    12 The doubt about jurisdiction arises by reason of the Court of Appeal decision in Barton v Walker (1979) 2 NSWLR 740. The reasoning in that case has been applied to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in the case of Rogerson v R (1990) 45 A Crim R 253, especially at 255. The judgment in that case was delivered by Gleeson CJ, with whom Wood and Brownie JJ agreed. The decision in Barton v Walker has been subject to criticism, see Brooks v Upjohn Company (1988) 85 FCR 469 at 472-476. It has been described as “controversial” by Heydon JA, when his Honour was a member of the Court of Appeal, in Witness v Marsden (2000) 49 NSWLR 429 at [96]. A question has also been raised about its continued applicability in the light of the Pinochet case (R v Bow Street Magistrate: Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 2) [2000] 1 AC 119) in Wentworth v Graham [2003] NSWCA 104 at [13]. It is possible to distinguish Pinochet on the basis that the reasoning applies to a final court of appeal because there could be no further appeal. 
     
      
    13 In my view, for reasons I will presently expound, this is not an appropriate case to determine whether or not Barton v Walker, as applied in Rogerson, should continue to be followed. There has been no submission to this Court that Barton v Walker was wrong. Mr Dalton, who appeared for the Applicant, did however submit that Barton v Walker could be distinguished. 
     
      
    14 He put forward two propositions. First he submitted that the case was not applied in the judgment of this Court in Australian National Industries v Spedley Securities Limited (1992) 26 NSWLR 411. However, it is clear that in that case the parties proceeded on the basis that neither would take the point. They were civil proceedings and, as was reasonably clear, there would be substantial costs involved in a long trial, which could be rendered entirely valueless if a judge who should have disqualified himself, proceeded to conduct the entire proceedings. 
     
      
    15 Whatever may be said of the appropriateness of the Court not determining its jurisdiction, I do not regard that to be an appropriate procedure in a criminal trial. I would not follow the option taken in ANI Securities, despite the agreement of the parties. I do not regard ANI Securities as an authority undermining the binding force of Barton v Walker.  
     
      
    16 The second basis on which Mr Dalton submitted that Barton v Walker could be distinguished was on the basis of an underlying principle discernible in Barton v Walker which, he submitted, was that it only applied in a case where there was the possibility of a final appeal in which the issue of bias could in fact be raised. He submitted that that was not possible in a sentencing appeal, by reason of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act and the contrast with s6(1) 
     
      
    17 Section 6 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “6(1) The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under section 5(1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    18 This submission turns upon the proposition that s6(3) is a comprehensive statement of the bases upon which the Court will intervene in sentencing proceedings. That is to say it is a statement of a statutory character identifying in a comprehensive way the basis on which this Court will both grant leave and intervene. I do not read s6(3) in that way, notwithstanding the contrast with s6(1). 
     
      
    19 It is true that s6(3) requires the Court to form an opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law. However, the practice of the Court has long been that there is a primary inquiry as to whether or not the exercise of the sentencing discretion has in some relevant manner miscarried. The general principles of when an appellate court will intervene in the exercise of a discretion, set out in House v King (1936) 55 CLR 499, have long been applied to the exercise of the discretion constituted by the task of sentencing. In that respect a number of principles have been identified. A relevant question in a sentencing appeal has always been whether any error in the exercise of discretion has occurred. The fact that s6(3) does not expressly refer to such error does not, in my view, indicate that such are not relevant considerations and, indeed, determinative considerations, subject to the additional factor mentioned in s6(3). These matters are to be found encompassed within the terms of s5(1)(c), as the basis on which a person is entitled to appeal, with the leave of the Court, against sentence. 
     
      
    20 Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act does not purport to state the grounds on which leave to appeal against sentence may be sought. Those grounds are the traditional grounds involved in an appellate court hearing an appeal from a discretionary decision. One such ground is an error in the nature of a refusal to recuse by a sentencing judge, in circumstances where recusal was the correct and proper course. Accordingly, I am not able to distinguish the line of authority in Barton v Walker and Rogerson in this Court on the basis propounded by Mr Dalton.  
     
      
    21 As I have indicated, I do not regard this to be an appropriate case in which to review Barton v Walker. The High Court has on a number of recent occasions outlined the very special basis upon which factual findings are made for purposes of sentencing. I refer particularly to The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, especially at [16]; Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [20]; and GAS v The Queen (2004) 206 ALR 116 at [30]. 
     
      
    22 Amongst these special factors is the recognition that there are limitations on the judge’s capacity to find potentially relevant facts, particularly the frequency with which relevant facts are agreed, so that it cannot be said that a sentencing judge has made a finding in respect of any assessment of the facts by the judge. As the High Court said in Weininger at [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a sentencing hearing is not an inquisition into all matters that bear upon the circumstances of the offence or matters personal to the offender … Some matters will remain unknown to the sentencing judge”. 
        
       
      
    23 Mr Dalton, in his submissions, placed emphasis on the findings of fact and credit about Ms Ward, and particularly those findings that may be seen – whether they do or not is a matter for the sentencing judge – as affecting the applicant’s level of criminality, particularly regarding the alleged threats by the Applicant towards Ms Ward. Mr Dalton also submitted that these matters became part of his Honour’s published findings and that an independent observer may find some grounds for doubting the independence and impartiality of Justice Hulme from the very fact that they were published findings. Further, such findings may have at least a subconscious effect on his Honour when his Honour comes to sentence the Applicant. 
     
      
    24 Mr Dalton placed particular emphasis on a statement which went beyond the recognition of the agreed facts in the present case, in which Justice Hulme did, from his own observations, draw the conclusion that Ms Ward “seemed genuine”. With respect to this matter, the reference “seemed genuine” is hardly a ringing endorsement of Ms Ward’s credit, and in any event, it is offset by a number of findings that his Honour made at various times during his reasons to the effect that he found Ms Ward had lied in statements she had made over the period. An independent, reasonable observer would be aware of his Honour’s findings in that respect. 
     
      
    25 In my view, Justice Hulme’s conclusion was correct. In large measure the findings were based on agreed facts that were put before him. If those issues are to be contested in future sentencing proceedings involving the Applicant, then this experienced trial judge will have no difficulty in proceeding on the basis only of the evidence in the case before him. This is a matter which judges often have to do, and indeed, direct juries from time to time that they have to do, namely, decide the case only on the evidence before the Court in the particular proceedings. 
     
      
    26 A sentencing judge is well able to distinguish the evidence, particularly in the form of an agreed statement of facts, in one sentencing proceeding, and put both those facts and his judgment contained in the remarks on sentence in the prior proceedings out of his or her mind, for the purpose of the subsequent proceedings. A reasonable, independent observer would understand that judicial training does enable that to occur and would not call in question in any manner the proposition that that sentencing judge would bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the second sentencing decision making process. 
     
      
    27 I make these observations in the light of the well-known principle that, by reason of issues of parity, it is highly desirable that co-offenders should be sentenced by the same sentencing judge. It often occurs, if there is a time gap between the two sentencing exercises, that it is necessary that the sentencing judge put out of his or her mind the findings of fact made in the first of those sentencing exercises. 
     
      
    28 It may be that this principle does not operate with quite as much force when the Court is dealing with accessories after the fact, particularly to a crime like murder, where the elements of criminality are so different. Nevertheless they still arise in such a case. Issues of parity may still arise and it remains desirable that the same judge sentence all offenders. Where there are findings of credibility based on a contested issue of credit in the first proceedings, it may be the situation is different, but there is nothing of that character in the present case. 
     
      
    29 By reason of the jurisdictional issue, the appropriate order of the Court in this case is that leave to appeal should be refused. 
     
      
    30 WOOD CJ at CL:  I agree. 
     
      
    31 HOWIE J: I agree. I wish only to make one observation. There is no material before this Court to indicate the basis upon which the Crown joined in the application that Hulme J should not sentence the applicant. It was unnecessary to call upon the Crown in determining this application, and therefore the reasons are still not apparent. 
     
      
    32 I, for my part, am considerably troubled that the Crown would ask a judge of this Court to disqualify himself from sentencing a co-offender, or joining in such an application. The principles of parity generally require that a co-offender is sentenced by the same judge wherever it is practically possible to do so. I find it difficult to understand in this case or generally, why the Crown should believe that a principle should be set aside, unless there were the clearest reasons in the interests of justice to warrant such a course. 
     
      
    33 If this application was supported merely by the fact that the Crown had joined in an agreement by which Justice Hulme should sentence the co-offender on a particular basis then on the material before this Court, I cannot see any foundation for the Crown to take what in my view was a very serious and significant step in the course of criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    34 Otherwise, I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    35 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that leave to appeal is refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 19 September 2001, Malcolm Huntley Potier was indicted before his Honour Judge Hosking SC at the Sydney District Court, on two counts, that between 2 May 2000 and 8 May 2000 he did solicit an undercover police operative, with the assumed name of “M”, to murder respectively, Myra Linda Oswald and Glenn Stuart Wakeham. The maximum available penalty, pursuant to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 in relation to each offence, was imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    2 Pleas of not guilty were entered, and after a trial lasting just over a month, verdicts of guilty were returned in respect of each count. On 10 May 2002, concurrent sentences were imposed each of imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, commencing on 8 May 2000, with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
    3 Mr Potier has filed an appeal against conviction, and an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences. The Crown has appealed against the inadequacy of the sentences. These respective appeals were first listed for hearing on 7 May 2003, but the listing was vacated on Mr Potier’s application. Further hearing dates were then set for 28 August 2003, and later for 2 December 2003, but each was again vacated on Mr Potier’s application.  
     
      
    4 The reason for these hearings being vacated related to applications which had been made but refused for legal aid, and to attempts by Mr Potier to have the various tapes which had resulted from the use of listening devices or telephone intercepts tested, and to investigate other aspects of the evidence, the precise detail of which is not known.  
     
      
    5 When the matter came on for hearing before us, Mr Potier was still not in a position to pursue the conviction appeal, in which he was unrepresented. He indicated that he intended to file a further appeal against the refusal of legal aid for that appeal. He was represented by counsel who had been briefed to appear on the Crown appeal against sentence, but not upon his application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    6 Having regard to the lengthy history of the matter, we reached the conclusion that Mr Potier has had more than sufficient time to bring the conviction appeal to a state where it was ready for hearing. We accordingly determined that it should be struck out of the list, subject to it being restored in the event of the Court being satisfied that it was ready to proceed. We made suitable directions to that effect.  
     
      
    7 We determined that the Crown appeal should be heard, as should the application for leave to appeal against severity. In that regard, no relevant prejudice was seen to be occasioned to Mr Potier, since if the conviction appeal succeeds, the sentences that have been imposed, and any variation of them by this Court, would be quashed.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    8 The relevant facts are somewhat complex, but were the subject of comprehensive findings by his Honour. In essence, his Honour found that Mr Potier (who we shall hereafter refer to as “the defendant”) had lived for most of his life in the United Kingdom where he had operated, with some considerable success, as a property developer until the crash of property prices in the late 1980’s or early 1990’s.  
     
      
    9 During 1989 he began a relationship with the first intended victim, Myra Oswald. They lived together thereafter for almost 10 years. In 1997, they had a daughter, Sarah. By the time of her birth, their relationship was deteriorating. 
     
      
    10 In early August 1999, Miss Oswald left the defendant and went to live with a sister in Scotland, taking Sarah with her. A little while later, she decided to fly out to Australia, where she had lived for some time before beginning her relationship with the defendant. Her purpose was to get out of the United Kingdom for a time, as she put it, to “let things calm down between me and Malcolm”.  
     
      
    11 She left by air on 13 August 1999, and flew to Townsville, where she met up with the second of the defendant’s intended victims, Glenn Wakeham. She had been involved in a relationship with him during her earlier visit to this country. He had been recently separated from his own wife. At the time of her departure, she was unaware of there being any proceedings on foot in relation to the custody of Sarah.  
     
      
    12 While in Townsville, Miss Oswald was informed by a relative that the defendant had commenced proceedings in the United Kingdom, seeking custody of Sarah and access. She retained lawyers to act for her in those proceedings. Soon afterwards she saw the defendant in Townsville. She became aware that he had made an application to a Magistrates Court in that city, exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. Miss Oswald flew back to the United Kingdom in October of that year in accordance with certain undertakings which she had given to the court in Townsville. Upon her return, she discovered that the defendant had obtained an ex parte order from the High Court, preventing her from taking Sarah back to Scotland. Orders had also been made for contact between Sarah and the defendant.  
     
      
    13 Following negotiations, Miss Oswald was permitted to return to Scotland to live with her parents, upon condition that the defendant be allowed to have access to Sarah, pending the final hearing in the High Court which was listed for 6 December 1999. 
     
      
    14 On 1 December 1999, she handed Sarah to the defendant for an extended contact period. Some days later she discovered that he had abducted Sarah and had taken her to Australia, having travelled on a false passport issued in the name of “Mills”. An order was made for Sarah’s return, but by then it was too late to be executed in the United Kingdom. 
     
      
    15 The defendant initially took up residence in Melbourne, where it became his habit to attend an internet café which was run by Debbie Conway. From that location, he sent various email messages to Miss Oswald, in an attempt to sort the matter out. Miss Oswald did not respond to those messages.  
     
      
    16 As time went by, the defendant struck up a friendship with Miss Conway. When she learned that he had taken Sarah from the United Kingdom, contrary to a Court Order, she became concerned as to the girl’s welfare and notified a friend, who had previously been a senior officer in the Australian Federal Police.  
     
      
    17 The Department of Immigration and the AFP were informed. As a consequence, the defendant was arrested on 16 February 2000 as an unlawful non citizen, and was placed in the Maribyrnong Detention Centre. Sarah was reunited with her mother.  
     
      
    18 While in detention at Maribyrnong and later at Villawood, the defendant maintained contact with Miss Conway, by telephone. During these conversations he spoke to her of his concerns that Sarah would come to physical and/or sexual harm at the hands of Mr Wakeham. These concerns appear to have been based upon certain information which he had acquired, earlier in the year, while in Townsville, from the solicitor who had previously acted for Mr Wakeham’s former wife in matrimonial proceedings between them.  
     
      
    19 It became apparent to Miss Conway that the defendant was considerably agitated. She feared that he was unbalanced and possibly suicidal. She made contact with the Victorian Police and later with the New South Wales Police and was advised to continue to speak as normally as possible with the defendant during any telephone calls which he made. She warned the Villawood staff to keep a close watch on him, because of her concerns, and because of her assessment that he was depressed.  
     
      
    20 On one occasion, he informed her that if the Court proceedings were to fail, and he was unsuccessful in obtaining custody of Sarah, then he had a “Plan B” which he had already arranged before leaving the United Kingdom, with a man “Dave”. On being pressed by her, he explained that the plan involved the killing of Mr Wakeham, if that became necessary. At this stage, he made it clear that his intentions did not extend to killing Miss Oswald.  
     
      
    21 Miss Conway informed him that the whole idea was stupid and immoral, and that he should grow up.  
     
      
    22 At some stage it seems that the defendant became aware of a decision in the Family Court of Australia in Townsville, which had gone against him. He conveyed his distress concerning this development to Miss Conway, observing “she’s gone up there, she is in his bed now, it is time to have the favour called upon”, and that “it is time to ring up Dave”. She said that he asked her to phone the man Dave. She pretended to do so, but in fact made no attempt to call him. 
     
      
    23 A few days later, in another call, the defendant said to her that he “wanted the favour doubled”, explaining that he now wanted Miss Oswald killed as well.  
     
      
    24 In early April 2000, the defendant spoke to Miss Conway using the telephone of an inmate, Alessandro Basso. He said that he had arranged for Basso to kill both Mr Wakeham and Miss Oswald. He also said that he had withdrawn four and a half thousand Pounds Sterling, which was to be paid into a bank account, by way of a bond with the Department of Immigration, so as to secure Mr Basso’s release from the Villawood Detention Centre, pending his deportation to Italy. He observed, in the course of this conversation “God has provided”.  
     
      
    25 By the time of this call, Miss Conway began to have genuine fears that the defendant might actually recruit someone to kill both persons. She went to the Victorian Police, and was referred to the Police in New South Wales.  
     
      
    26 The bond for Mr Basso was posted, but his only response was to fly out of Australia, to Italy, with his girlfriend.  
     
      
    27 A little while later, the defendant informed Miss Conway that he had been given the name of a man, Chris Condon, who supposedly was a hitman. He gave her two telephone numbers, and asked her to phone this man to say, “…that I am kosher.” She made contact with a man who acknowledged that he was called Chris. She terminated the call.  
     
      
    28 From that point onwards, a telephone intercept was placed on her phone service, pursuant to warrant, to monitor and record any further conversations with the defendant. Twenty-one recordings of such conversations were tendered in the trial.  
     
      
    29 After Basso’s departure, the defendant asked Miss Conway to attempt to find a hitman to kill Mr Wakeham and Miss Oswald. Acting on police instructions, she reported back to the defendant that she had found a man “Jacko”, who would come to speak to him about the proposal.  
     
      
    30 Between 2 and 8 May 2000, a police operative posing as a colleague of “Jacko”, spoke to the defendant at the Detention Centre, twice in person, and twice by telephone. A listening device and a telephone intercept were used to record these conversations.  
     
      
    31 His Honour found that these conversations bore no interpretation other than that “the [defendant] was seeking to recruit the undercover operative to have Miss Oswald and Mr Wakeham murdered by the fictitious man “Jacko”.  
     
      
    32 The defendant gave evidence in the trial, in the course of which he acknowledged having participated in the recorded conversations with Miss Conway, and with the undercover operative. However, it was his case that what he was really talking about was finding somebody who could obtain “legal evidence” that would discredit Mr Wakeham, for use in the Family Court proceedings.  
     
      
    33 His Honour noted that it was the fact that the defendant had used the expression “obtaining evidence legally”, in some of these conversations, but also noted that Miss Conway had explained that the defendant had indicated that this was to be a code to be used in any conversation with the man who was introduced to him, in case their conversation happened to be recorded.  
     
      
    34 The defendant also gave evidence to the effect that the words, which were attributed to him, only bore their incriminating appearance because some unidentified person had manipulated the recordings electronically to make it appear that he was seeking to recruit the undercover operative to have Miss Oswald and Mr Wakeham killed.  
     
      
    35 The jury by their verdict rejected this account, “not surprisingly” according to his Honour, who expressed the view that the Crown case was overwhelming.  
     
      
    36 His Honour did however accept that, at least in relation to Mr Wakeham, the defendant “may have been motivated by a genuine (but an… entirely misplaced) concern for his daughter Sarah”. That view, his Honour held to be erroneous because although there had been some evidence from Mr Wakeham’s former wife that he had physically disciplined his own children, “there was no real evidence whatsoever” that he had sexually molested them, or any other children.  
     
      
    37 The position in relation to Miss Oswald, his Honour found, was “completely different”. At no time, his Honour said, had she ever presented any physical threat to Sarah. The defendant’s intention to have her murdered, in addition to Mr Wakeham, his Honour found arose 
     
      
       
        
        “through feelings of either jealousness towards Miss Oswald and/or resentment and/or a desire to obtain for himself custody of Sarah, because (at least in [his] mind) that would leave nobody else to take custody of her.” 
        
       
       
       
      Subjective Circumstances  
       
      
    38 The defendant was 50 years of age at the time that he appeared for sentence and had no prior convictions. In sentencing him, his Honour made express reference to the reports which were tendered from two consultant psychiatrists, Dr Jonathan Carne and Dr Alnutt, concerning the defendant’s mental state, at the time of these offences.  
     
      
    39 Relevantly, Dr Carne said: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the examination and from the documents referred to above, in my opinion, Mr Potier was suffering a major depressive episode, with brief episodes of psychotic symptoms during periods that he was in custody at the Maribyrnong Detention Centre in Melbourne, the Villawood Detention Centre in Sydney, and in prison. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, the major triggering factor for his depressive episodes were fears for the welfare of his daughter, and that he would lose contact with her.  
        
       
       
        
        During the period when it is alleged that the offences were committed, it is my opinion that Mr Potier was suffering from a major depressive episode.  
        
       
       
        
        I draw the Court’s attention to the fact that Mr Potier has no criminal record, nor is there any evidence that he has ever been a person with a violent nature.” 
        
       
       
      
    40 His Honour made two pertinent observations in relation to this report: 
     
      
       
        
        “Firstly, while it is true that there does not seem to be any evidence that the prisoner was previously a person with a violent nature, I do note that the recorded conversations with the undercover operative show that in relation to Miss Oswald that the prisoner was quite willing for the fictitious man, Jacko, to have Sarah’s mother murdered in front of her very eyes. Secondly, in my view, Dr Carne’s diagnosis about the triggering factors for his depressive episodes, being the welfare of his daughter and the possible loss of contact with her, do not translate into this prisoner’s motivation to have Miss Oswald murdered as well as Mr Wakeham.” 
        
       
       
      
    41 Dr Allnut reported that he had accepted that the defendant had come to believe that his daughter was at significant risk from Mr Wakeham, and this led him to express the opinion that: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has made it his life’s goal to achieve custody of his daughter, to protect her from this man. In my view, it is this belief that has driven Mr Potier to a point where he is now incarcerated and found guilty of a serious crime.” 
        
       
      
    42 His Honour said, in relation to this expression of opinion, that it: 
     
      
       
        
        “too fails to factor in the fact that this prisoner wanted, at least latterly, Miss Oswald murdered”. 
        
       
      
    43 Additionally he noted that Dr Allnut had said, in relation to the defendant’s mental state, at the time of the offences, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Potier denies intention to solicit murder and his account is somewhat at odds with the facts. Given the fact that he has been found guilty at trial, I am forced to assume that the conviction is based on fact. In my view, he has filled his life by finding meaning in achieving goals. His quest for his daughter’s safety has become one such goal about which he remains obsessed. At the time of the offence, I believe he was experiencing a depressed mood, overvalued ideas about Glenn Wakeham, and a high degree of anxiety about his daughter’s welfare and his ability to achieve custody of her. He was desperate to gain custody of his daughter and was prepared to go to extreme lengths to achieve this.” 
        
       
      
    44 His Honour found these expressions of opinion concerning the defendant’s mental state, at about the time of his dealings with the undercover operative, to be at odds, at least to a degree, with the records from the Villawood Detention Centre which were also tendered in the trial. They had been compiled at a time when the defendant had been placed on a suicide watch, and included the following entries: 
     
      
       
        
        “27 April 2000 ‘should be removed from at risk watch’. 28 April 2000 ‘happy, communicating, positive’. 29 April 2000 ‘happy and communicating’. 30 April 2000 ‘alert, communicating’. 4 May 2000 ‘happy and communicating’. 8 May 200 ‘happy, alert, positive’.” 
        
       
      
    45 His Honour said, in relation to these observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the prisoner may have been depressed, to a degree, during the periods of the commission of these offences, but I agree with the Crown’s submission, that that degree of depression was at the lower end of the scale.” 
        
       
      
    46 His Honour gave consideration to a submission that, in accordance with authorities such as R v Taouk (1993) 65 A Crim R 387, there was a degree of entrapment in so far as the police had sent in an undercover operative to discuss with the defendant his expressed desire to have the two persons killed. While not completely rejecting this submission, his Honour found that if there was any entrapment, then it was only to “a most minimal degree”.  
     
      
    47 That was the most favourable light in which the submission could have been viewed. The defendant had enunciated a clear intention to have the murders committed, well before he spoke to the undercover operative. The case was not one where he was pushed or encouraged to do something that was not already set in his mind.  
     
      
    48 His Honour accepted the Crown submission that the defendant’s conduct involved an attempt at direct interference with the processes of the law in relation to the Family Court, although he did not consider the facts were as bad as those that were seen in R v Lewis (1998) 100 A Crim R 361, which he accepted as having represented “the high water mark” for sentences for this offence, and in which the Court of Criminal Appeal had dismissed an appeal against the severity of a sentence of 15 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 10 years. That was a case where the appellant had pleaded guilty to soliciting the murder of his sister, and her de facto husband, in order to prevent them giving evidence against him in forthcoming sexual assault proceedings, and where the offender’s conduct was found to have been particularly serious, in so far as it had constituted an attempted direct interference with the processes of the law, and had been committed while he was on bail. 
     
      
    49 In sentencing the defendant his Honour categorised the present offences as having been “very serious offences indeed”, adding: 
     
      
       
        
        “They were marked by an indifference to the lives of the proposed victims, and displayed an attitude, which was callous in the extreme. As the Crown submitted, if the prisoner could not obtain the result he wanted through the courts, he was prepared to have the proposed victims killed in order to achieve his ends.” 
        
       
      
    50 While his Honour described the offences in these terms and said that they were such as to call for sentences that would reflect the considerations of both general and specific deterrence, he also made it clear that he regarded the case as distinguishable from cases where there had been solicitations to murder persons for purely financial gain, for example, in order to secure the proceeds of insurance policies taken out on their lives.  
     
      
    51 He noted, additionally, that the defendant had “shown no remorse whatsoever”, and that he “could not say” what his prospects of rehabilitation were, no doubt by reason of that factor, and by reason of his continued claim to have been justified in what he had done.  
     
      
    52 His Honour declined to find special circumstances in relation to any of the matters that were relied upon, namely that he was continuing to suffer depression in custody, that he was a suicide risk, that he needed continuing psychiatric care, that this would be a first time in custody, that he had put everything at risk by doing what he did, and that he might suffer the loss of the trust of his daughter Sarah. Apart from the finding that these matters did not qualify as special circumstances, he added that, in any event, “the irreducible minimum” that the defendant should serve for offences of such objective severity, was imprisonment for 5 years.  
     
      
    53 The Crown submits that the sentences failed to reflect the serious criminality involved in the two offences and were, as a result, manifestly inadequate. Conversely the defendant contends that insufficient weight was given to the factors which lay behind their commission, and that as a result, they were manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    54 The offences were committed prior to the introduction of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and although it is accepted that the case was not one to which the standard non-parole period provisions apply, nevertheless it was argued that the period of 10 years now specified as the non-parole period applicable to a s 26 Crimes Act offence, provides an indication of the seriousness with which that offence is regarded. Certainly that is true of the legislative intention at the time of the enactment of the amendments to the principal Act, but we do not consider that it is a circumstance which should properly be taken into account in this case.  
     
      
    55 That is not to say that the legislative intention, which is to be ascertained from the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years is to be ignored. Clearly it is of importance and provides a clear indication that the offence is one of the most serious in the criminal calendar. On any view, the soliciting of a person to kill a third party is a fundamentally abhorrent and heinous crime. It is a crime for which the sentence must reflect a significant element of personal and general deterrence.  
     
      
    56 Deterrence has a particular relevance by reason of the cold blooded motivation that lies behind the act of an offender in engaging or attempting to engage a hit man to kill another for reward. It also has a particular relevance in that part of the motivation, in contracting the job out to a professional, is to reduce the chances of detection, not only because that person is assumed to have special skills, but also because the offender is able to place himself or herself one step removed from the killing. 
     
      
    57 It is evident that his Honour made appropriate reference to the matters which were of relevance, in relation to the commission of the present offences. They included the extent to which the defendant was suffering from depression although at the lower end of the scale; the fact that he had a genuine, although mistaken, belief that Mr Wakeham posed a potential threat to his daughter; and that the offences occurred against a background of a family dispute, which had spanned two continents and extended over several years. His Honour did not venture into the rights and wrongs of that dispute, and it would be similarly inappropriate for us to do so. However, it was unchallenged that the defendant abducted Sarah and brought her to Australia, without lawful excuse. To that extent, by his own acts, he escalated the dispute and harmed his chances of securing the custody of Sarah by lawful means.  
     
      
    58 While he is not to be additionally punished for this conduct, or for the illegality involved in his entry into Australia, these circumstances do say something about his willingness to abide by normal legal constraints, and about the extent of his determination to achieve his own desires by any means. In that regard it is not irrelevant that, at the time of the abduction of Sarah, there was no suggestion of her having been at any kind of risk from Mr Wakeham.  
     
      
    59 It does not appear to us that his Honour overlooked any material fact that was of relevance to the objective criminality of the defendant, or to his subjective circumstances. The facts that were relevant were specifically mentioned, and his Honour’s findings in relation to the defendant’s state of mind, his motivation, his absence of contrition, and the lack of entrapment, were properly open on the evidence. 
     
      
    60 The defendant was not to be punished additionally for electing to go to trial but, as a result, he was unable to call in aid the discount that would have been attracted by the utilitarian value of pleas. 
     
      
    61 There was no evidence led in the trial to show that his prospects of rehabilitation were favourable, and there could be no quarrel with his Honour’s conclusion that he was unable to come to any firm view in that regard. As we understand that observation, the question of rehabilitation remains neutral. It was not used as a factor either calling for leniency, on the one hand, or as a factor depriving the defendant of leniency, on the other hand. 
     
      
    62 The fact that the defendant would serve the sentences in a country other than his usual place of residence, and that by his behaviour he may have damaged the personal relationship which he craved with his daughter, and which had paradoxically driven his behaviour, were noted, as were the circumstances that this would be his first time in custody, and that he had been of a good prior character.  
     
      
    63 Ultimately, the question which arises upon the appeal, and upon the application for leave to appeal, turns upon whether the sentences appropriately reflected the inherent criminality involved. Depending upon the answer to that question, it becomes necessary to consider whether, either by reference to the principles of double jeopardy and the discretion which attaches to Crown appeal, and the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which apply to severity appeals, the intervention of this Court is required.  
     
      
    64 The submissions largely turned upon the pattern of sentencing for the offence, so far as that can be derived from the sentencing statistics, and from prior decisions, including the decision in R v Lewis. 
     
      
    65 His Honour noted that he had taken the sentencing statistics into account when endeavouring to identify a sentencing pattern. It is not known what the size of the statistical population was at that time, however the current statistics (for cases decided prior to the introduction of the standard non-parole legislation) are based upon a population of only sixteen cases, of which all but one resulted in a prison sentence. The terms of the sentences for all offenders ranged between 2 years and 6 months and 16 years, with the majority falling within the range of 4 years to 8 years, while the non-parole periods ranged between 18 months and 10 years, with a median of 4 years. For the four offenders sentenced after a plea of not guilty, the range is between 5 years and 8 years, with non-parole periods ranging between 4 years and 6 years. 
     
      
    66 These statistics are of limited value in providing any real guide to an appropriate sentencing pattern, having regard to the small population, and also having regard to the caution, which this Court has expressed in relation to their use. These concerns were noted in R v Hofer [2001] NSWCCA 544 where it was said, by the Presiding Judge in the present appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “23. Reference to the Judicial Commission statistics is of limited utility, having regard to the fact that the relevant population of cases involved, in this instance, is limited and also to the inevitable variations which arise in objective and subjective circumstances which can be glossed over in a bare statistical analysis (see  
        Regina v Tannous 
         NSWCCA 18 June 1997 and  
        Regina v Bloomfield  
        NSWCCA 15 July 1998).” 
        
       
      
    67 As was also noted, in that decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “there is the consideration noted by Grove J in  
        Regina v Hayes 
         (2001) NSWCCA 410 that: 
         
          
           
          ‘there is a misconception that the upper limit of the range of sentence is that of the statistical publications of sentence information by the Judicial Commission. The upper limit of sentence is in fact the maximum set by Parliament. If the upper limit of the statistical range is treated as reserved for the worst case or the worst offender, then persistent selection of sentences for others within that range will inevitably reduce the upper figure. This is not a matter of jurisprudence but a matter of arithmetic.’"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    68 Additionally, in R v Derbas [2003] NSWCCA 44, Hulme J said (at 34) of the relevance of statistics: 
     
      
       
        
        “the statistics but represent the application by other judges, rightly or wrongly, to particular offenders and fact situations which come before them. It seems to me far preferable in this Court to consider the proper sentence in a particular case in the light of the statutory provision and the established principles of sentencing. The statistics provide a check, but they should not be allowed to govern the process.” 
        
       
       
      
    69 It is clear that his Honour was influenced in the setting of an appropriate sentence by the conclusion which he drew, from a reference to the several cases which were cited, and to the statistics, that the range of sentences which had been passed for s 26 offences was broad, but that the “high water mark”, up to the time of sentencing, had been the overall term of 15 years which had been set in R v Lewis; and by his assessment that the facts in that case had been more serious than those that were present in this case.  
     
      
    70 Two observations need to be made in relation to that approach. First, Lewis was a case where there had been pleas of guilty, a factor that would normally attract a discount.  
     
      
    71 Secondly, the cases in which lesser sentences had been passed was distinguished in Lewis upon the basis that they had each involved only one victim, and that none had involved the aggravating circumstance of being conduct constituting a deliberate attempt to interfere with the processes of the law.  
     
      
    72 The present case, however, shares each of those features, and it is difficult to see why his Honour regarded the facts in Lewis as having been significantly more serious, even allowing for the fact that in Lewis the planning had progressed somewhat further, that the offender had been on bail, and that he was subject to an Apprehended Violence Order. Those were circumstances of significant aggravation, yet they would not seem to justify the difference in sentencing outcomes which his Honour regarded as appropriate. 
     
      
    73 What we have said so far does not challenge the need for courts to act consistently, so as to preserve relativity, in sentencing, in the way discussed in R v Oliver NSWCCA 20 March 1980 and R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 197, and so as to avoid disparity in sentencing standards (Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 326-327).  
     
      
    74 Clearly that is the case where there is a clearly established sentencing pattern. But at the same time, sight is not to be lost of the individualised nature of sentencing, or to the caution of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the  
        range 
         appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range. As Mason J said in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 612:  
         
          
          ‘The reference to an appropriate sentence is apt to be misunderstood. Generally speaking, a sentence within a limited range of years is appropriate to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and to the character, antecedents and conditions of the offender. As the ascertainment and imposition of an appropriate sentence involve the exercise of judicial discretion based on an assessment of various factors it is not possible to say that a sentence of a particular duration is the only correct or appropriate penalty to the exclusion of any other penalty.’” 
          
         
         
        
       
      
    75 In those circumstances reference to the decisions in Regina v Quatari [2001] NSWCCA 353, R v Bednarz [2000] NSWCCA 533, and R v Marat AY NSWCCA 30 October 1998, each of which involved a single intended victim, were of limited assistance, and for his Honour to have placed any particular reliance upon them risked error, since they did not, upon any view, form part of a relevant range.  
     
      
    76 For example, Quatami involved a partially successful Crown appeal in a case where there had been a plea of guilty, and where the sentencing judge had found that there were present significant subjective considerations of a cultural kind, associated with certain religious and moral beliefs.  
     
      
    77 In Murat AY there were a number of unusual and significant mitigating features relating to the offender’s unbalanced condition, the pressure placed upon him by the person solicited, and the fact that he had ended up being somewhat uncooperative in having the plan carried to fruition. Similarly in Bednarz there were significant subjective features associated with the offender’s psychiatric illness, her delusional state, and the impact of the sentence upon a third party, namely her son, for whom she had been the carer, due to the serious injuries which he had suffered in an earlier accident. Further, that was a case where there had been a plea of guilty.  
     
      
    78 We have some difficulty, additionally, with his Honour’s assessment that the present case should be regarded as less heinous than one where the offender was motivated purely by financial gain. In terms of moral culpability, each had precisely the same purpose in mind, namely the unlawful taking of a human life. In our view, the drawing of any such distinction involved little more than splitting straws.  
     
      
    79 What is, in our view, critical in this case, is that the defendant, in a very deliberate and cold blooded way, solicited the murder of Miss Oswald and Mr Wakeham, for the reason that he had been unable to secure his objective of securing the custody of Sarah, through the normal processes of the Family Court in Australia, and of the High Court in England. 
     
      
    80 In doing so, he resorted to extra curial measures that cannot be tolerated by any civilised community.  
     
      
    81 It is a notorious fact that emotions run high in Family Court proceedings, particularly where they involve issues of custody and access, and yet it is only by reference to the procedures which are available in those courts, that such disputes can be determined. To subvert those procedures is to threaten the rule of law, and on any view, as in the case of Lewis, the criminality here involved was in the upper level of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    82 The case was one that called for a very significant element of general deterrence, so as to send the clearest possible message to persons in the defendant's position, that condign sentences will be passed if they attempt to secure custody or access, by securing the murder of their former partner, or of any de facto who has come to stand in their place.  
     
      
    83 In our view his Honour failed to give this factor sufficient weight, and allowed himself to be swayed unduly by the defendant’s mistaken belief that Sarah faced a risk of harm at Mr Wakeham’s hands.  
     
      
    84 It is the case, as Brennan J observed in Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305 that “emotional stress which accounts for criminal conduct is always material to the consideration of an appropriate sentence”. Similarly to motive and any evidence of psychiatric illness it is a matter which goes to the offender’s moral culpability, yet it can be outweighed by countervailing factors. 
     
      
    85 In the present case there were in our view two countervailing considerations: first, the fact that there were two intended victims, and secondly that the defendant had made it clear that he was prepared to have his former partner murdered in the presence of his daughter. Moreover, as we have observed, his Honour’s assessment that any depressed state of which the defendant was suffering was at the very low level. It was not of the kind or degree as to attract any mitigation of the sentence in accordance with the well known principles noted in decisions such as R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, and R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. The present is a case where the defendant was acting with full knowledge of what he was doing and of the gravity of his actions and there was, as a result, no reason for any moderation of sentence.  
     
      
    86 In our view the defendant has not made good the submission that insufficient weight was given to his emotional state, or to any condition of depression from which he was suffering, or from his misguided motivation which could, in any event, have only related to his desire to have Mr Wakeham murdered. We would refuse to grant him leave to appeal against the sentence.  
     
      
    87 We consider, however, that the Crown appeal should be allowed. For the reasons already mentioned, we are of the view that, individually, the sentences were manifestly lenient. Additionally, we consider that the fact that the sentences were wholly concurrent meant that the total criminality was not sufficiently reflected in the sentencing order.  
     
      
    88 While the offences were associated, in so far as they arise out of the same general background, and in so far as their actus reus depended on the same dealings with the man “Jacko”, they were properly to be considered as two offences. In order to reflect the total criminality involved, in accordance with the decision in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and the more recent decision in Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15 there needed to be a degree of accumulation.  
     
      
    89 In our view, while longer sentences should have been passed at first instance, it is appropriate, in this case, by reference to the principle of double jeopardy, and to the discretion which is reserved for Crown appeals, to dispose of the matter by directing that there be an effective accumulation of 2 years in respect of the sentence for the offence concerning Miss Oswald to arrive at an overall term of 8 years and 8 months. A consequential adjustment of the non-parole period will be required in respect of that sentence so as to provide for a minimum period of imprisonment of 6 years and 3 months.  
     
      
    90 In coming to that conclusion we have taken into account the evidence which has recently been placed before us concerning the custodial status of the defendant, and which shows that he was placed in a special management area from November 2002 at Goulburn Correctional Centre. He has continued to serve his sentence at the MRRC Silverwater, with a similar status.  
     
      
    91 There is an issue between him and the DPP as to whether this occurred as a result of information which he provided to Corrective Services officials concerning the alleged misconduct of certain prison officers, or whether it resulted from concerns as to his safety, related to threats from inmates, arsing from their suspicion that he had stolen items of property while working in the receptions area. We do not consider it necessary to resolve that issue, as it does not have any relevance, of itself, as to whether he has been serving, or will continue to serve, his sentence under conditions which would occasion additional hardship.  
     
      
    92 Where the circumstances of imprisonment for a particular offender are shown to be more onerous than that of other mainstream prisoners, that is a circumstance which can have a potential relevance for the exercise of the Court’s discretion whether to allow the Crown appeal.  
     
      
    93 However, as this Court has pointed out in recent decisions, including Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 331, R v Ah-See [2004] NSWCCA 202, R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97, R v Kain [2004] NSWCCA 143, R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 28, R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 and Regina v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299, the bare fact that a person is held on protection may prove very little, since the conditions of such detention can vary significantly from centre to centre and from case to case. Accordingly it has been considered necessary for the Court to receive evidence as to the precise impact of any restrictions which do arise in the case of the individual offender.  
     
      
    94 In the present case we have a report from the Department of Corrective Services which shows that at Goulburn and at the MRRC, inmates who are housed in special management areas, are held in conditions which are no less favourable than those applicable to mainstream inmates. In some respects, it was reported, they are more favourable; additionally, it was reported, the usual counselling and welfare services are available, and progression through reclassification is not affected.  
     
      
    95 The defendant has submitted that his detention in circumstances where he is forced to associate with paedophiles and persons who have been convicted of offences involving the sexual assault of children, or the infliction of violence upon them, is particularly oppressive. That it has this feature he attributed to the circumstances of his conviction, and to his professed concerns for his own child. 
     
      
    96 He says that he has asked to be taken off protection or to be moved to another centre, in order to avoid this kind of contact, but those requests have been refused.  
     
      
    97 Ultimately it is a matter for a prisoner as to whether he will associate with another prisoner and communicate with him. It is also a matter for the Correctional authorities to determine the most appropriate centre for that prisoner’s detention.  
     
      
    98 We are not persuaded that the conditions of the defendant’s detention or the circumstance that fellow prisoners have been involved in crimes against children, and tend to speak of those crimes in his presence, render his imprisonment unduly onerous to the point where the discretion should be exercised in his favour.  
     
      
    99 For similar reasons to those mentioned by his Honour we do not see any occasion to vary the statutory ratio by reason of the presence of any of the circumstances to which his attention was drawn since they have already been taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence. The fact of accumulation would, however, justify a small adjustment, since we accept that it does constitute a special circumstance with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    100 Accordingly we make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Defendant’s application for leave to appeal against severity of the sentences refused; 
       
      2. Crown appeal against leniency allowed; 
       
      3. Quash the sentences below, and in lieu thereof: 
       
       
        
        (a) sentence the defendant, in relation to Count 2, to a term of imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, to commence from 8 May 2000, with a non-parole period of 5 years, similarly to commence from 8 May 2000 and to expire on 7 May 2005; 
         
        (b) sentence the defendant in relation to Count 1 to a term of imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, to commence from 8 May 2002, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, to commence from 8 May 2002 and to expire on 7 August 2006.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Glenn William Eaglesham, was convicted by a jury of the murder on 11 March 2002 at Taree of Petrina Joy Eaglesham. The offender and the deceased were married and lived in Taree with their two year old son. The deceased was employed in a bank in the town. Relations between them deteriorated during 2001. The deceased resented the disrespectful way in which the offender was treating her, swearing at her, belittling her and falsely accusing her of having affairs with other men. Just before Christmas she threatened to leave him, but he promised to mend his ways and persuaded her to stay. His attitude and his behaviour did not improve, however, and by Monday 4 March 2002 the deceased had had enough. She took the child with her and his and her belongings and moved into the premises of a work friend.  
     
      
    2 The offender was very fond of the child and by all accounts a good father. He pursued the deceased, partly to do what he could to save the marriage and partly because he wanted to continue to see and care for the child. Things reached the stage when the deceased told her colleagues at the bank not to put through to her calls that the offender was making. 3 On Tuesday 5 March the deceased was at the house of her mother, Mrs Fuller. The offender went there in the evening. After dinner the offender took the child’s bag and said that he was leaving with the child. The deceased blocked his way and he took hold of her wrist and twisted it and tried to hit her. He told her that he could have knocked her out cold. He calmed down and they talked about the desirability of the deceased moving her belongings to Mrs Fuller’s house. She did so on the following day. 
     
      
    4 On Friday 8 March a serious altercation took place at Mrs Fuller’s house. Mrs Fuller was not at home. The offender tried to wrest the child from the deceased’s arms and she resisted. She took the telephone and locked herself in the bathroom, intending to call for help, but the offender unplugged the phone. He forced his way into the bathroom and forced her out. He tried again to take the child, holding the deceased’s arms behind her back. He said that it would not be hard to kill her and the child. When he let her go she ran to the garage and locked herself and the child in her mother’s car. He called for her to come out of the car and tried to get in. He said that he wanted to scare her, to make her feel as he was feeling. He went into the house and emerged with a meat cleaver, though he did not try to attack the deceased with it and may have been threatening to injure himself. If he was, he did not carry out his threat. The deceased was terrified. She ran to a neighbour’s house and telephoned Mrs Fuller from there. The offender followed her but the kindly neighbour refused to let him in.5 When Mrs Fuller came home the offender became apologetic. She advised him to get medical help and he said that he would. He learned that the deceased was going to see about getting an apprehended violence order and begged her and Mrs Fuller not to do so. 
     
      
    6 These accounts are taken mainly from a record the deceased began to make when she realised that she was going to have to make a formal complaint about the offender’s activities. I accept the account as reliable. 
     
      
    7 On the following day the offender told Mrs Fuller that he had seen a doctor as promised. She told him that the apprehended violence order papers had been issued and were at the police station. 
     
      
    8 Monday 11 March was a work day and the deceased was using Mrs Fuller’s car. The bank where she worked was in the Taree City Centre and there was a car park there in which cars could be left all day. The deceased drove the car to work and left it in the car park.  
     
      
    9 During the day the offender rang the bank, pretending to be the deceased’s karate instructor, and spoke to the deceased. She was very upset to receive the call. She told the offender that the apprehended violence order was in force. She telephoned the police and told them what had happened. They went to the offender’s house at 4:05pm and tried to serve the order. The offender’s car was there but there was no answer when police knocked on the door. 
     
      
    10 During the afternoon the deceased withdrew from her account at the bank the sum of $290, comprising five $50 notes and two $20 notes. She left work at about 4:40pm.  
     
      
    11 The offender had left work earlier in the afternoon to go home. It is not possible to say whether he was home when the police called at 4:05pm. A man answering his general description was seen in the car park, not far from where Mrs Fuller’s car was, at about that time. A sporting colleague of the offender, Mr McIntosh, saw the offender walking towards the car park not long after 4:40pm. I accept the accuracy of his identification. The distances involved are not great. It was possible to walk from the offender’s house to the car park in under seven minutes, so the accused could, consistently with that identification, have been at home or at the car park at about 4pm.  
     
      
    12 The offender went to the car park and there encountered the deceased. In his evidence he gave an explanation why he went there and how he came by chance upon the car and the body of the deceased. The jury obviously rejected the latter part of his explanation. I reject it all. I do not regard him as a witness of truth.  
     
      
    13 When Mr McIntosh saw the offender he was wearing shorts but no shirt and had nothing on his feet. He could have been carrying a knife, but the evidence does not enable me to say that he was. He had laid hands on a knife or other sharp weapon by the time he encountered the deceased. The injuries and blood patterns on the car and the floor of the car park show that the offender attacked the deceased from behind at the open front passenger door of the car. He held her by the hair and drew the weapon savagely across her throat a number of times, inflicting two very deep wounds. So deep were the wounds and so forceful was the use of the weapon that the cervical vertebrae were marked. The deceased died from massive blood loss and from heart failure caused by the entry of air into the vascular system.  
     
      
    14 Having murdered the deceased, the offender bundled her body into the car and closed the door. It is not possible to say precisely where his car was at the time. It may have been at the car park, but it does not really matter for, as I have said, distances between significant places were not great. He took the deceased’s handbag and drove to a car park on the banks of the Manning River on the edge of town. He removed the cash and kept it. Police later found five $50 notes, one $20 note and one $5 note hidden in his shoe. I am satisfied that the money was what was left of the sum withdrawn by the deceased that afternoon.  
     
      
    15 The offender threw the deceased’s mobile phone into the river. He strewed the bag and its other contents, which included cards and other documents identifying the deceased, on the riverbank where passers-by would see them. His intention was to make it look as though a robber had done the murder. Later on he suggested to his former partner that the police should be investigating drug dealers, who might have killed the deceased. 
     
      
    16 Having planted the deceased’s bag and belongings, he drove home. There must have been a substantial amount of blood on his feet. Photographs of the scene of the murder show how he walked through the deceased’s blood. There was probably blood on his clothes as well. He showered and thoroughly cleaned the bathroom. He removed all traces of the deceased’s blood. He cleaned the car inside and out. He went out of his way to engage the attention of his next door neighbour and say to her things implying that he had been at home, working hard, for a substantial time. He was trying to establish an alibi. 
     
      
    17 At some time, it is not possible to say when, he carefully disposed of the murder weapon. 
     
      
    18 He sat down at home and wrote a letter to the deceased marked “Monday 6.30”. It is in these terms- 
     
      
       
        
        Well I feel better. Ive keep myself busy today washing clothes, cutting the grass. Kicked the top of my toe. & washed the car so since 4.00pm to 6.30pm I havn’t stop  
        (sic) 
        . I worked harder at home that  
        (sic) 
         work. I was hoping you would come and talk to me today but you havn’t. I won’t pressure you babe. I love you tho. I wish you could give me a chance. Even to talk or something. I’m thinking about moving in with dad so you &  
        (the child) 
         can have this place.  
        
       
      
    19 He left the letter at his house where he knew that any investigating police would find it. His intention was to establish an alibi. 
     
      
    20 The deceased was not found until about midnight. At 5 o’clock on the following morning police officers called at the offender’s house and told him that the deceased had been found dead. The offender went with them to the police station and made a statement. In it he said that he had left work at 3:30pm and had gone home and remained there washing, showering and cutting grass. He had left the house, he said, at about 5:30pm to buy a bottle of drink and had then walked the dogs. The account he gave was inconsistent with his having been at the car park at any relevant time.  
     
      
    21 He took the trouble in the statement to say that his former partner did not like the deceased but that of late they had had no arguments that he knew of. He mentioned that the deceased had told him that a member of her family (naming him) had touched her inappropriately and that a former male friend of the deceased had been unhappy when he and the deceased had begun their relationship. He made these hurtful statements in order to try to divert suspicion from himself. 
     
      
    22 Just after 1pm on the same day the police arrested the offender and searched his house. He was taken into custody. At the Local Court he heard the prosecutor tell the magistrate that his fingerprints had been found in blood on the car. He began to tell a different story. He wrote letters to his mother and to Mrs Fuller describing how he had been to the car park and had come accidentally across the deceased in the car. He had lifted her and realised that she was dead and then, panicking, had run home without telling anybody. I am satisfied that he wrote those letters and maintained that version because he realised that the police would probably be able to prove that he had been at the car park. 23 The offender continued to tell that false story. He gave evidence on oath to the jury to the same effect. More recently he has said the same thing to Dr Wilcox, a psychiatrist whose report has been tendered on his behalf on sentence. 
     
      
    24 The several measures taken by the offender to hide evidence and try to divert suspicion from himself and onto others resulted from careful planning. The submission that there was no premeditation must be rejected. It is not possible to say when the offender laid hands on the murder weapon, but obviously he had it when he went to the car. He was then intending to use it. I have dealt in some detail with the careful attempts he made to avoid detection and try to throw suspicion onto others in order to show, as I have concluded, that his individual acts were not spontaneous but parts of an integrated scheme which he devised before he sought out the deceased. 
     
      
    25 The offender was born on the 8th July 1971. He left school at the beginning of year 11 and began working as a labourer for his father, a plumber. He has generally been in work in labouring jobs. He was employed in a fish processing factory at the time of the events giving rise to the charge. He commenced a substantial relationship when he was quite young and he and his partner had two children. He remained on good terms with them after the relationship ended and was seeing them regularly up to the time of these events. He and the deceased lived together for a number of years before they married.26 In November 2001, when relations between him and the deceased were bad, the offender consulted Dr Keegan, his general practitioner. He was teary, angry and complained of loss of sleep and appetite. He was stressed by his work and by the presence of a new baby. He had lost motivation and had had some ideas of suicide. Dr Keegan prescribed an antidepressant.  
     
      
    27 By December his mood and sleep had improved, though he reported a troublesome side effect with the antidepressant which, I think, caused him to stop taking it.  
     
      
    28 He saw Dr Keegan again in February complaining about pain in one of his feet. According to Dr Keegan’s notes, the offender looked well and fit. His depression had lifted. 
     
      
    29 On the 28th March he was seeing Dr Keegan again, telling him about the break-up of the marriage and about a problem with anger. Dr Keegan recorded that there was no history of violence but that the offender had threatened to take the child. According to the note, the offender was contrite. Dr Keegan prescribed a different antidepressant and referred the offender to a counsellor. 
     
      
    30 There seems no doubt that the offender was depressed about the position he found himself in. There seems no doubt that, for a time at least, he wanted to win back the affections of the deceased. He obtained a book called “Absolute Happiness,” which advocated self-examination and prescribed written exercises in which things desired were repeated many times. He read the book and wrote out the exercises. 
     
      
    31 The offender spent a number of hours telling Dr Wilcox his story. He said that he found it hard to tell the deceased that he loved her and that after the separation he was telephoning her and speaking to her in order to apologise. It is difficult to accept at face value that that was his reason in view of the aggressive way he conducted himself, especially in the presence of the child. He told Dr Wilcox several lies, repeating to her the story about coming upon the deceased by accident and finding her dead.  
     
      
    32 During his time in custody the offender wrote a letter to his mother telling her, for the first time, that when he was young he had been raped by a friend of his sister. It is possible that he was sexually assaulted when young, but if he was I would not regard that as mitigating his criminality. The difficulty is that the offender is such a cunning planner and is so ready to tell a false story that he thinks will improve his position that I cannot accept the assertion unsupported by reliable evidence.  
     
      
    33 It was submitted that the murder was committed while the offender was depressed and that it was more than cold-blooded, it was an irrational and impulsive reaction to the offender’s intense sense of rejection and abandonment. I accept that the offender was depressed when the deceased left him and that he felt rejected and abandoned. But I do not think that he murdered the deceased because he was depressed. There are two reasons for this conclusion. First, Dr Keegan prescribed antidepressant medicine and the offender took it. It might have been expected to work, as the first drug had. It was likely to lift his depression. Secondly, and more importantly, the offender showed none of the signs of depression in the positive way he went about his task. Far from being teary and unmotivated, he carefully planned and executed the murder and the steps calculated to divert suspicion from himself. Those steps required him to think clearly and to present to others, particularly his neighbour, his family and the police, an appearance of normality. I do not think that he could have done these things if he had been significantly affected by his depression. 
     
      
    34 No doubt the offender felt rejected and abandoned, but there was nothing impulsive or irrational about the way he went about his work. The murder was born out of the offender’s anger about and resentment of the deceased’s leaving him and obtaining the apprehended violence order. This was not a spontaneous welling-up of anger.  
     
      
    35 Court orders have been made for the custody and welfare of the child. They prevent the offender from ever seeing or speaking to him. He will not see the child grow up and will play no part in teaching and guiding him. He will never know what the child knows or thinks about him, at least before the child becomes an adult. I accept that the offender will suffer because of this severance. I assume also that his relations with the children of his first relationship will be affected. However, these are the inevitable consequences of his offence. They do not mitigate his criminality.  
     
      
    36 The offender continues to deny his criminality. There is no contrition. He has denied to his parents that he murdered his wife. He cannot now turn round and admit his guilt because he thinks that if he did he would lose the support of his family. 37 The offender has made no attempt to harm himself since he has been in custody. He is no longer depressed.  
     
      
    38 His inability to take responsibility for his action will, Dr Wilcox thinks, hamper his rehabilitation. I am not prepared to conclude that there are no prospects of rehabilitation, however. As things stand they are poor, but things can happen in time and the offender may acknowledge his offence in due course.  
     
      
    39 Dr Wilcox observes that when his state of denial comes to an end he may become depressed and suicidal. She also believes that once the offender’s preoccupation with legal proceedings comes to an end his sense of loss will intensify, perhaps leading to further periods of depression. Undoubtedly the offender is going to need counselling, and perhaps psychiatric, services during his time in custody. 
     
      
    40 During 1993 the offender went to Coonabarabran to seek work and moved into the house of his partner’s parents in that town. Also living at the house was her sixteen-year-old brother. On an occasion in November the offender, his partner and members of her family went camping. The offender accused her brother of stealing money and began to attack him with his fists. Others intervened. The offender carried on the attack, punching his partner’s father, her brother and his male companion. He knocked her father unconscious and broke his cheek bone. He was convicted and fined. I do not regard his actions as aggravating the murder, but they disentitle him to the leniency that might otherwise have been extended to him. 41 It was submitted that there were special circumstances justifying the fixing of a parole period exceeding one quarter of the head sentence. They were said to be the offender’s probable need for counselling and professional assistance in view of the likely intensification of his sense of loss once these proceedings are over and, in view of the history of depression, and his need for counselling over the loss of contact with his children, maintaining and establishing relationships with others and containing his anger. The second reason was that this is the first time the offender has served a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    42 I accept that there are the risks pointed to by Dr Wilcox. I think that the offender’s sense of loss and rejection will probably intensify and that he will need professional services. However, the non-parole period which it is necessary to impose in order to reflect the great seriousness of the offence is a long one. It is not to be supposed that problems of the kind pointed to will not be broached until the commencement of the period of parole. The offender will have therapy, over years if necessary, during the non-parole period of his sentence. I find it impossible to estimate what professional services and counselling he may need at the commencement of his period of parole, but I have no reason to believe that all that must then be done will not be able to be done within the period I have allowed.  
     
      
    43 The offender intentionally killed the deceased in a particularly brutal way. This was a very serious offence of its kind.

      70090/02 REGINA v JOSEPH MELHEM AZAR 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Joseph Melhem Azar was charged with having murdered Sami Sarraf on 23 June 2001. He pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He acknowledged having shot Sami Sarraf. He claimed that at the time of the shooting he was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind. The jury, however, was not persuaded. They returned a verdict of guilty of murder. 
     
      
    2 It remains for me to pass the sentence. I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. They must be determined in a manner consistent with the jury verdict. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Azar, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    3 The fundamental issue in the trial concerned Mr Azar's state of mind at the time of the shooting. Why did he shoot Sami Sarraf? His criminality is to be judged by reference to that issue. Was it, as the Crown alleged, an act of revenge, premeditated and the more serious because he had used a firearm (s21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Was it, on the other hand, the action of someone suffering from a psychiatric condition, significantly impaired although not substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind? 
     
      
    4 The circumstances in which the incident occurred are capable of providing insight into that issue. 
     
      
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    5 Shortly after midnight on Saturday 23 June 2001, Mr Azar was driven to the home of Sami Sarraf at Guildford. He knocked at the door a number of times. Sami Sarraf was at home with his children and nephew, who was visiting from Lebanon. The children were young. The oldest, John, was 15 years old. 
     
      
    6 Mr Sarraf went to the door. He was confronted by Mr Azar. Mr Sarraf retreated. Mr Azar was carrying a pistol with seven bullets. He followed Mr Sarraf into the house, firing at him. Three bullets struck the victim. One penetrated the brain. All seven bullets were discharged. 
     
      
    7 Mr Azar then turned to leave. He was intercepted by Mr Sarraf's 15 year old son, John. There was a struggle. However, Mr Azar managed to escape. He fled through the front door.  
     
      
    8 John returned to the lounge room. He saw at once that his father had been shot through the forehead. He was still alive but grievously wounded. He assumed that he was dying. Careless for his own safety, and exhibiting extraordinary courage, John then left the house in pursuit of his father's assassin. He ran down the street, tackling Mr Azar and wrestling him to the ground. 
     
      
    9 Mr Azar was still holding the gun. John could not know whether any bullets remained in the chamber. He took hold of the gun and used it to subdue Mr Azar, striking him on the head a number of times. He acknowledged that he was angry. He kept striking Mr Azar until he was stopped by the deceased's nephew, who arrived somewhat later. 
     
      
    10 The incident woke the neighbourhood. A number of residents came out of their homes. Several rang the emergency number. Within minutes the police arrived, and minutes after that an ambulance. A number of witnesses noticed that Mr Azar was wearing gloves. They were latex surgical gloves. John made that observation, which he related to police that night, within hours of the incident. His brother, Adam, also saw Mr Azar's gloved hand as the pistol was discharged. The gloves were seen by the nephew from Lebanon. The police officer who attended to Mr Azar as he lay on the street noticed that he was wearing gloves. They were similar to the gloves she was wearing. Indeed she noticed him remove the gloves and place them in his pocket. A Police Inspector also noticed that Mr Azar was wearing gloves. A paramedic ambulance officer, who examined Mr Azar's hands for the purposes of inserting a cannula, noticed what he termed ""the pruning effect"" upon the skin which occurs immediately after latex gloves are removed. Mr Azar said he could not remember the events surrounding the shooting. He was not able to say whether he was wearing gloves or not. 
     
      
    11 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Azar was wearing gloves. Whilst the gloves were never found, it was a confused crime scene. There were opportunities to dispose of the gloves there or later at the hospital. 
     
      
       
      Mr Azar's state of mind. 
       
      
    12 Why, then, did Mr Azar shoot Mr Sarraf? Mr Azar said that when he was six or seven, and still living in Lebanon, he was sexually assaulted by the deceased, who was then aged about 14. He said that the assault had a profound effect upon him. It made him question his own sexuality. He felt deeply ashamed and believed that in some way he was at fault. 
     
      
    13 He came to Australia with his family when he was nine. Mr Sarraf also came to Australia. Indeed, there was a link between the two families through marriage. Mr Azar said that, because of the shame, he told no-one. Nonetheless, he believed that the episode caused him to behave in ways which he now recognised were immature. He drank too much. He flirted with women, as if to prove his sexuality. 
     
      
    14 Ultimately, on the account he gave to the jury, he was imprisoned for receiving in 1991 for a term of four years with a non parole period of three years. Whilst in prison, it came to his wife's notice that he had been having an affair with another woman. His wife resolved to seek a divorce. This caused him anguish, such that he saw a prison psychologist or counsellor. He questioned how he had arrived at this point in his life. For the first time he disclosed the incident during his childhood and the way in which it had haunted him throughout his life. According to his testimony, arrangements were made for him to make the same disclosure to his brother, whom he trusted. He also told his wife. 
     
      
    15 Ultimately, in the case presented to the jury, he reunited with his wife after his release from gaol. He resumed his business as a car mechanic. Unfortunately, he had, in the meantime, become addicted to heroin. He was able to conceal that addiction from his wife for a time. However, she eventually became aware of it. She helped him in his struggle with that drug. From time to time he relapsed. With his wife's help he began to address his drug problem. 
     
      
    16 Then, according to Mr Azar's account, corroborated by his wife, an episode occurred six or so months before the murder, which led to his decline. By chance, whilst visiting his sister, he again encountered Sami Sarraf. Their meeting was brief. They exchanged greetings. The effect upon Mr Azar was profound. He returned to heroin. He began using it intravenously. He plundered the cash reserves of the business. He became impossible to live with. Indeed, he moved out of the family home to accommodation above his workshop. From there he went to his sister's home. 
     
      
    17 Aspects of Mr Azar's account were strongly challenged by the Crown, including the ""incident"" in Lebanon. One, of course, does not have the victim's version of these events. Nonetheless, as a matter of probability, I am satisfied that Mr Azar's description is broadly accurate. Having said that, I do not accept that the episode as a child, whatever the detail, is a complete explanation for Mr Azar's aberrant behaviour thereafter. It is part of the explanation. It combined with other aspects of his character to produce that behaviour. 
     
      
    18 In the days before the murder, Mr Azar's sister endeavoured to care for him as he withdrew from heroin. She took him to a number of doctors and to RPA Hospital more than once. At 11.59 pm on Thursday 21 June 2001 (that is, 24 hours before the murder), Mr Azar was taken to the Emergency Department of the RPA Hospital. He was, according to the hospital records, treated for heroin withdrawal. He was discharged at 6.00 am the following morning into his sister's care. 
     
      
    19 Mr Azar said that he spent the rest of the day recovering. The person who supplied him with drugs came to his sister's home to see him. That person was accompanied by another male. Mr Azar had heroin during the course of the day. When he had that heroin and the size of the dose are uncertain. It is also uncertain whether, at the time of the shooting, he was suffering from withdrawal, although he may have been experiencing some symptoms. I believe, however, that is unlikely. 
     
      
    20 On the Friday evening, hours before the shooting, Mr Azar watched television with his companions. A film, ""Sleepers"", was screened. The film included graphic scenes of child sexual abuse. Mr Azar said that it had a profound emotional impact upon him. He had to avert his eyes. He was embarrassed to show his companions the emotions he was experiencing. He determined that he would go to Mr Sarraf's home at Guildford to confront him. He travelled with the other two males in their car. On his account, one of them handed him a gun ""for his own protection"" as he was getting out of the car. 
     
      
    21 There were difficulties in accepting Mr Azar's account. They may explain the jury's rejection of the partial defence which he raised. First, Mr Azar's sister lived at Marrickville. Mr Sarraf lived some distance from Marrickville at Guildford. The film finished some time before 11.36 pm. Mr Azar said that he left well before the end. The murder was at about 12.14 am. On any view, there was a significant lapse in time (which may have been as much as several hours) between the trigger which he identified, being the movie, and the shooting. Secondly, I believe it unlikely that Mr Azar was handed the gun moments before he left the car. The fact that he was wearing latex gloves suggested planning. The gun was probably a further aspect of that planning. However such a finding cannot be made beyond reasonable doubt. I cannot therefore make any finding in respect of the gun. Thirdly, but for the speed and extraordinary courage of the victim's son, Mr Azar may well have got away. It would then have been a puzzling and professional slaying for which there was no apparent motive. 
     
      
    22 The Crown urged that, even were I to accept the probability of an incident during Mr Azar's childhood, involving Mr Sarraf, the lapse in time as he journeyed from Marrickville to Guildford, and the premeditation shown by wearing gloves, demonstrated that his true motive was revenge.  
     
      
    23 I do not doubt that revenge played a part in his motivation. However, it was revenge seen through the distorted prism of Mr Azar's psychiatric state. Although he was not substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind, I believe that he was significantly impaired. Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt, who each gave evidence in the trial, accepted that Mr Azar was suffering from a depressive illness. They accepted that the graphic scenes in the film ""Sleepers"" would be likely to reawaken the childhood experience such that, when presented with Mr Sarraf, whatever his intentions before that moment, his ability to exercise restraint or self control would be significantly impaired. Although unquestionably, at the time of the shooting, he intended to kill Sami Sarraf, it is not possible to say beyond reasonable doubt when that intention was formed.  
     
      
    24 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including general deterrence. I have been furnished with a Victim's Impact Statement by John Sarraf. He describes with great poignancy his anguish and that of his family following the death of his father. He exhibits in his statement the same extraordinary courage that he showed on the night. He has since assumed many of his father's responsibilities towards his younger brothers. One can only sympathise with his anguish and that of the family at their loss (cf s21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). However, I must, of course, deal with such material in a manner consistent with the principles identified in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85.  
     
      
    25 Nonetheless, although Mr Azar committed a brutal and awful crime which has profoundly affected the young children of the deceased, his criminality is significantly reduced by reason of the circumstances which I have described. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case. 
       
      
    26 Mr Azar was born on 2 January 1960. He was 41 years old when these events occurred. He is now 44 years old. Although he and his wife divorced in 1992, they came back together after his release from prison. They regard each other as husband and wife. They have two grown children. 
     
      
    27 Mr Azar has a criminal record (s21A(2)(d)). He was convicted on a number of occasions for offences of dishonesty when he was a young man. On 5 July 1985 he received a two year suspended sentence for larceny and receiving. On 20 September 1991 he was, as mentioned, sentenced to four years imprisonment with a minimum term of three years for receiving. On 25 January 2002, he was convicted of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, the offence having been committed in March 1996. When sentenced for that offence, Mr Azar was already in custody, having been arrested after the murder of Mr Sarraf. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 14 months, commencing 25 June 2001 and concluding on 24 August 2002, at which time he would be eligible for parole (during a further period of ten and a half months). 
     
      
    28 Mr Azar qualified as a mechanic and at one time had a successful business. The circumstances giving rise to the present offence are unusual. They will obviously not recur. I regard Mr Azar, by reason of maturity, and his history, as having reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    29 He remains, nonetheless, vulnerable to drug abuse. He would benefit from supervision, such that a finding of special circumstances is warranted. However, the division of the sentence in accordance with the statutory ratio will already provide a significant period of supervision, such that the adjustment for special circumstances is small. 
     
      
       
      Contrition. 
       
      
    30 Mr Azar did not give evidence on sentence. There is no evidence of contrition, apart from apologies which he repeatedly offered to the victim's son on the roadway at Guildford, as he was being held, pending the arrival of the police. I do not really regard that as evidence of contrition. 
     
      
       
      Injuries to Mr Azar. 
       
      
    31 Counsel for Mr Azar drew attention to the injuries inflicted upon Mr Azar immediately after the shooting, when he was repeatedly struck with a pistol by John. He lost a good deal of blood. No criticism of John Sarraf is made. However, it was said that in sentencing Mr Azar he is entitled to have those injuries taken into account, as explained by Gleeson CJ in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561: (at 566/7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""We also take into account, as the Crown concedes we are entitled to do, the extra-curial punishment that has already been meted out to the respondent by others, both before and after the sentencing proceedings."" 
        
       
      
    32 In R v Daetz (2003) 139 A Crim R 398, James J (Tobias JA and Hulme J agreeing), having reviewed the authorities, said this: (at para 62) 
     
      
       
        
        ""62. I have concluded from this examination of the authorities cited to the Court and especially  
        Allpass, Clampitt-Wotten 
         and  
        Cooney 
         that, while it is the function of the courts to punish persons who have committed crimes, a sentencing court, in determining what sentence it should impose on an offender, can properly take into account that the offender has already suffered some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence. This is so, even where the detriment the offender has suffered has taken the form of extra-curial punishment by private persons exacting retribution or revenge for the commission of the offence. In sentencing the offender the court takes into account what extra-curial punishment the offender has suffered, because the court is required to take into account all material facts and is required to ensure that the punishment the offender receives is what in all the circumstances is an appropriate punishment and not an excessive punishment. How much weight a sentencing judge should give any extra-curial punishment will, of course, depend on all the circumstances of the case. Indeed, there may well be many cases where extra-judicial punishment attracts little or no significant weight."" 
        
       
      
    33 Here, it was not suggested that the actions of John Sarraf were unreasonable. Mr Azar had just shot his father. He still had a gun. The gun had to be taken from him and he had to be subdued until the arrival of the police. However, Mr Azar then received a number of blows to the head. Unlike Daetz the consequences were short lived. There was no fracture to his skull. There was no permanent injury. Whilst it is a matter that should perhaps be taken into account, it should be given little weight. 
     
      
       
      The commencing date. 
       
      
    34 Mr Azar was arrested on 23 June 2001 and taken into custody. Ordinarily his sentence would begin from that date. However, he had outstanding a drug matter from March 1996. The sentence in respect of that matter commenced on 25 June 2001. It is difficult to understand why it did not commence on 23 June 2001. Mr Azar was in custody, even though in hospital. However that may be, it seems to me inappropriate in the circumstances that the sentence for murder should be wholly concurrent with the sentence in respect of the drug matter. The sentence I am about to impose should be delayed three months, commencing on 22 August 2001. 
     
      
    35 Joseph Melhem Azar I sentence you to imprisonment for 17 years commencing on 22 August 2001 and expiring on 21 August 2018, with a non parole period of 12 years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 22 August 2013.

     REGINA v Michael Allan Matthew THOMPSON 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: These are appeals against sentence by the Crown. David John Walter and Michael Allan Matthew Thompson were both indicted for robbery in circumstances of aggravation (s95(1) Crimes Act 1900). The circumstance of aggravation was that they maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon a person, being the person whom they robbed (s95(2)(c)). They each pleaded guilty. On 4 March 2004, they were sentenced by Mahoney ADCJ as follows: 
     
      
    · David John Walter: Imprisonment for 5 years commencing on 4.3.04 with a non parole period of 6 months from 4.3.04 to 3.9.04. 
     
      
    · Michael Allan Matthew Thompson: Imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 13.3.04 to be served by way of periodic detention with a non parole period of 4 months from 13.3.04 to 12.7.04. 
     
      
    2 The Crown asserted that in each case the sentence was manifestly inadequate. On 27 August 2004, having heard argument, the Court allowed each appeal and resentenced the offenders. 
     
      
    3 We now provide reasons for making these orders. 
     
      
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    4 On Friday 8 November 2002 the victim, a man aged 41 years, determined that he would go to a nightclub in Cronulla. Shortly after midnight he was walking along a lane that led to the nightclub. A man (who from the description, was plainly Mr Walter) came up behind him. He then stood in front of him and said: 
     
     ""Give me your jeans."" 
    5 The victim was, indeed, wearing jeans. Unsurprisingly, he dismissed the request as a joke. He was a man about 5' 7"" tall. The person who made the demand (Mr Walter) was over 6' tall and considerably heavier. The victim endeavoured to proceed on his way. Mr Walter then followed, dancing around him like a boxer. As this was happening, the victim became aware of a second man, smaller than the first, but plainly associated with him (Mr Thompson). The larger man (Mr Walter) repeated his demand for the jeans. Having again been ignored, he then punched the victim in the eye and the face.  
     
      
    6 The victim attempted to defend himself. He covered his face. He tried to run. Both males stood in front of him. The victim grabbed the jumper of the larger man and pulled him to the ground. He tried to hold his assailant, who continued to strike him. The victim then lost consciousness. He had no recollection of the events thereafter until treated by ambulance officers, obviously some time later. 
     
      
    7 A number of passers-by witnessed the attack. One provided a description to the police which included these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I saw this guy holding the crouched guy from behind. I saw this guy kicking the crouched (man) in the back area and lower. I saw him kick him about six or seven times at least just then. The crouched guy was covering his face and head and basically just trying to block the blows."" 
        
       
      
    8 The larger of the two men, by inference Mr Walter, was then seen to step forward. The same witness continued his account with these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He was obviously out cold and was not moving. Whilst he was crouched over the guy on the ground the big guy I saw him go for the victim's back trouser pocket. This guy said a couple of times to the shorter guy, 'Keep kicking him Mickey'."" 
        
       
      
    9 The reference to ""Mickey"" was a reference to Michael Thompson. Mr Thompson, according to this witness, responded to this encouragement by kicking the victim a number of times. 
     
      
    10 The victim's jeans were then removed, as were his shoes. His mobile phone, his money (approximately $35), his house keys, his baseball cap and other incidentals were taken. He was left unconscious by the side of the road.  
     
      
    11 Messrs Walter and Thompson then walked towards Cronulla station, where they were seen by a security guard about ten minutes after the attack. The guard observed the larger man (inferentially Mr Walter) to be carrying jeans and the smaller man (Mr Thompson) a pair of shoes. The police were notified. 
     
      
    12 Within a matter of minutes the police were able to locate Messrs Walter and Thompson. As the police approached, one was seen to throw away the shoes. Mr Thompson was wearing the jeans. The police observed that the grey jumper worn by Mr Walter was torn. It also had blood stains on the front and back. Both were searched. The property of the victim was found in their possession. When asked about each item, they provided a false explanation. They were arrested and later charged. 
     
      
    13 The victim, meanwhile, was conveyed to the Sutherland Hospital. The report from the hospital described his injuries in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He sustained abrasions to the face and a large infra-orbital haematoma. CT head showed no intra-cerebral injury but a right .... maxillary fracture. They were not involving the orbit so he was discharged with head injury advice."" 
        
       
      
    14 Fortunately, the victim made a recovery from those injuries. There was no suggestion of permanent disability. 
     
      
    15 The police investigation provided insight into the bizarre demand by Mr Walter for the victim's jeans. Mr Thompson had recently separated from his wife. He was living with his sister and Mr Walter. According to an interview conducted by the police within hours of the offence, he and Mr Walter went to a hotel in Gymea on the Friday evening. Mr Thompson said he had ""a couple of schooners"" and three or four ""double bourbons"". When he left the hotel he rated the degree to which he was intoxicated to be eight or nine on a scale of ten. Mr Walter, on his reckoning, was perhaps ""seven or eight"" (on a scale of ten). 
     
      
    16 They then went by taxi to Cronulla and made their way to the same nightclub which had been the destination of the victim. However, they were refused entry. The ""bouncer"" said that Mr Thompson's tracksuit pants were unacceptable. Mr Thompson provided the police with the following account of what then occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q190. OK. Now, and after you left where did you go? 
         
        A. To ask this dude if he wanted to swap pants. He said, 'No'. And I left it at that."" 
        
       
      
    17 He was asked by the police about the clothing he was carrying at the time of his arrest. He gave a false explanation. He said that he obtained the clothing from a Salvation Army clothing bin near the railway station. He had thrown the shoes away because he had no need of them. 
     
      
    18 The police located the ""bouncer"" who had refused them entry to the club. He confirmed that he had indeed denied them entry because no tracksuit pants were allowed in the club. The witness added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""9. Both guys had been drinking but I wouldn't say they were legless. The guy with the track pants was more affected by alcohol than the dark guy. 
        
       
       
        
        10. When I saw them coming down the street, I decided that I was not going to let them in no matter what they were wearing. They didn't look like our normal clientele."" 
        
       
      
    19 The police attempted to interview Mr Walter. However, he declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
       
      Remarks of the sentencing Judge. 
       
      
    20 Having described the incident, his Honour said this: (ROS 4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""If the courts were not to deal with situations such as that in a stern fashion then the city would be just one whole lot of anarchy and law abiding citizens would not be able to go out of their homes after dark. 
        
       
       
        
        I don't propose to say any more about the facts of the incident. I have said enough to indicate that the crime that these two offenders committed was a very serious crime indeed, and looked at from a point of view of objective seriousness, it would rate very highly on the scale of seriousness."" 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour indicated that there was no ""parity"" between Mr Thompson and Mr Walter. The criminality exhibited by Mr Walter was worse in a number of respects. First, Mr Walter was the ""major aggressor"". Mr Walter had ""waylaid"" the victim (ROS 7) and, according to eye witnesses, had inflicted most of the blows. Secondly, Mr Walter had exhorted ""Mickey"" (Mr Thompson) to join in (""keep kicking him Mickey""). Thirdly, Mr Walter, again according to eye witnesses, had removed the property from the victim once he had been disabled. Fourthly, Mr Walter was significantly older than his companion. He was 32 years old whereas Mr Thompson was a little over 23 years. 
     
      
    22 Having described the incident, his Honour dealt with the subjective cases of Mr Thompson and Mr Walter. We will briefly describe the material placed before his Honour and then refer to the findings in respect of each offender. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case of Mr Thompson. 
       
      
    23 Mr Thompson was born on 28 April 1979. He was brought up in Newcastle. He is the third child in a family of four children. He told a psychologist, W John Taylor, that his parents got on well and ""there were no problems in the family during his formative years"". His father was employed. 
     
      
    24 However, Mr Thompson had difficulties at school. He was always in the slow learning classes. He left school at the age of 16, having completed Year 8. For a time he worked as a labourer, assisting in landscaping. He then formed a relationship with a woman. They left Newcastle to live with her parents. They remained together for six years and had two children. He obtained employment as a farm hand on a poultry farm nearby. However, in March 2002, he abandoned that employment once he broke up with his partner. 
     
      
    25 Mr Thompson told the Probation and Parole Service that, following the breakdown of his relationship, he became depressed. He missed his children. He began drinking heavily. He was drunk at the time of the offence. He recognised that that was no excuse and that what he did was wrong. 
     
      
    26 Mr Thompson had a criminal record, although not for crimes of violence. As a child, he had been placed on a good behaviour bond in 1995 for stealing and maliciously destroying property. A further bond was imposed as a result of a bag snatching incident in 1997. On both occasions he was apparently in company. 
     
      
    27 W John Taylor, psychologist, formed the view, having carried out extensive testing, that Mr Thompson had ""limited intellectual ability and a lack of introspection"". Indeed, Mr Taylor classified him as ""borderline intellectually handicapped"". He was not, however, suffering from any emotional disorders. 
     
      
    28 Nonetheless, Mr Thompson was highly regarded by those who knew him. A number of references were provided. His mother gave evidence. She described his emotional difficulties after the break up of his relationship, and the deprivation of contact with his children. Ordinarily he was not a person given to violence.  
     
      
    29 There were a number of developments after the offence which may be regarded as positive, in terms of Mr Thompson's rehabilitation. First, Mr Thompson was deeply remorseful when speaking to the Probation and Parole Service. Consistent with that remorse, he pleaded guilty in the Local Court at the first available opportunity. Secondly, he sought assistance with respect to alcohol and drugs from the Tharawall Aboriginal Corporation. He was counselled a number of times. Arrangements were made for further counselling in the future. Thirdly, Mr Thompson appeared before Mahoney ADCJ in June 2003, and again in December 2003. His Honour thought it was desirable that he should be sentenced at the same time as Mr Walter. The matter was adjourned. Mr Thompson was ultimately sentenced on 4 March 2004, as was Mr Walter. When standing the matter over in June 2003, Mahoney ADCJ encouraged Mr Thompson to find a job. Mr Thompson did so. He approached his former employer, who took him back. He thereafter worked five or six days a week, taking the train to Campbelltown at the weekend to see his children. At the same time he reduced his alcohol consumption. His employer provided the following character reference: 
     
      
       
        
        ""During this time I found him to be a considerate, honest and conscientious worker. Michael undertook any task asked of him with considerable enthusiasm. He exhibited diligence ad a self-motivated attitude towards his working environment, hence he was able to be left to work unsupervised on any given task. 
        
       
       
        
        I have no hesitation in recommending Michael Thompson to any potential employer."" 
        
       
       
      His Honour's findings on Mr Thompson. 
       
      
    30 His Honour made a number of observations which were common to both offenders. Both were Aboriginal. His Honour said this: (ROS 6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Both of them, in my view, are entitled to as much positive advantage as can be gleaned or extracted on their respective behalves from the well known decision of Wood CJ at CL in  
        Fernando's 
         case some years ago. The Crown has not conceded that Thompson is entitled to that concession but I take the view in the light of the evidence in the case that he is so entitled."" 
        
       
      
    31 Both offenders were genuinely remorseful. Both had obtained employment since the offence. His Honour said this: (ROS 10/11) 
     
      
       
        
        "".... this rehabilitation aspect is well in hand as far as Thompson is concerned, and I think also Walter is well along the way to being rehabilitated from the state of mind and behaviour in which he was on the night of this particular offence. 
        
       
       
        
        I have been most impressed by the fact that both Thompson and Walter, during the period of their respective remands, have grasped the opportunity that that remand, particularly the long period of remand, has given them to show that they have each gained employment and kept it."" 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour said that he was especially impressed by Mr Thompson, in respect of whom he said this: (ROS 11/12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I suppose there would be many young men in his situation who would have taken the dole and just stayed there until the Court case was finished. Following on an indication that I gave him some months ago that it would be well to his advantage if he were to get himself a job, he has left home, having contacted his former employer down at Bargo; he has left the comforts of his home and now living in a caravan park at Bargo so he can pursue employment at his old place of employment."" 
        
       
      
    33 This was, in his Honour's judgment, ""an excellent demonstration of the fact that he is well on the way to rehabilitation"" (ROS 12). 
     
      
    34 Neither offender had previously served a custodial sentence. Both plainly had a problem with alcohol. In each case, his Honour made a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    35 Mr Thompson, however, was at a disadvantage compared to Mr Walter. He was intellectually less able. He was also ""less sophisticated"" and susceptible to being led astray by Mr Walter, the older man. Unlike Mr Walter, he had no qualifications. 
     
      
    36 Reflecting these differences, and their different roles in the commission of the offence, his Honour imposed a significantly shorter term upon Mr Thompson (3 years cf 5 years), with a shorter non parole period (4 months cf 6 months). In the case of Mr Thompson, but not Mr Walter, he ordered that the sentence should be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case of Mr Walter. 
       
      
    37 Mr Walter was born on 27 March 1970. His mother was Aboriginal. He does not know the identity of his father. He was adopted into a caucasian family at the age of three months. There were three other children, including one other adopted child. He was brought up in Coffs Harbour. His step-mother abused him physically and emotionally as a child. He described the abuse in his evidence on sentence, as did his former defacto wife, Ms Sally Bird. Ms Bird's evidence was as follows: (T14) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What did he tell you about that? 
         
        A. That numerous times his step mother or adopted mother used to assault him physically. He had, she used to do things like tie him to the bed and beat him with a curtain rod and make him strip naked in front of his friends while beating him, belittle him, call him racist names, to the point he didn't want our children to ever have contact with her because he worried she may do the same thing to them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were referring to his aboriginality? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What kind? 
         
        A. Little black bastard."" 
        
       
      
    38 The abuse ceased by the time he was about twelve, when he was physically able to fight back. He got on well with the remaining members of his family. However, he now has nothing to do with them. 
     
      
    39 Mr Walter attempted to make contact with his natural mother. He communicated with her through an agency. She said, however, that she had no wish to see him. He refused to accept that response. He independently endeavoured to locate her through the electoral roll. However, she reaffirmed her previous attitude. 
     
      
    40 Mr Walter also gave the following evidence: (T20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. In terms of your contact with the aboriginal community growing up in Coffs Harbour, what was that like? 
         
        A. I didn't really have anything to do with the aboriginal community there. They didn't really accept me because I was pretty much brought up in a white family, so I wasn't really accepted."" 
        
       
      
    41 However, Mr Walter formed a relationship with a woman, Ms Sally Bird. They lived together for almost thirteen years, separating in about November 2002. They had two children. Ms Bird described Mr Walter as a good father. She still clearly held him in high regard. She gave evidence on his behalf on sentence. He is a qualified cabinet maker. He has held various jobs. He was a promising footballer who had been selected to tour New Zealand. However, he suffered a serious neck injury at the age of 24 and was forced to abandon his career. According to Ms Bird, he was devastated. He began to drink heavily and smoke cannabis. After the break up, he again resorted to alcohol. 
     
      
    42 Ms Bird saw Mr Walter after the offence. She said that he was disgusted with himself for having ""gone over the edge"". He suffered from depression. On 27 January 2003 (that is, a matter of months after the incident) he was admitted to the St George Hospital suffering from depression. He was thereafter transferred to the Manly Hospital where he remained for some time. The hospital notes include the following entry: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Walter is tearful, depressed, uncommunicative about suicidal plans and is preoccupied by feelings of self-blame, guilt and regret.""  
        
       
      
    43 The Probation and Parole Service, in a recent report (28 May 2004) included the following statement made by Ms Bird: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Walter's partner stated that the inmate's problems tend to have their origin in his abuse of alcohol, and also his apparent inability to cope with negative emotions and stressful situations. She appears to be hopeful that the inmate will address his difficulties and is able to become a constructive member of the community, as she believes that he is intelligent, good-natured and hard working."" 
        
       
      
    44 Mr Walter had a criminal record. It included offences of violence. He was convicted in December 1994 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was fined $170. In 1998 he was convicted of driving whilst under the influence (mid range PCA). Again he was fined. He was also disqualified from driving. The following year he was convicted of driving whilst disqualified. On appeal, a sentence of periodic detention was replaced by a two year bond. The same year (1999), Mr Walter was again convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was ordered to perform 75 hours of community service. 
     
      
       
      The findings in respect of Mr Walter. 
       
      
    45 His Honour, for the reasons stated, regarded Mr Walter as the more culpable offender. He had a much higher level of ""sophistication and social awareness"" (ROS 8). His Honour said this: (ROS 13/14) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Walter is also greatly assisted by the way in which his former defacto wife has been prepared to look out for him, her earlier ... having him hospitalised to deal with the question of his emotional disturbance and more recently to continue her concern for him and to come along to court and give evidence for him. She is to be complimented for being able to put whatever other feelings she might have towards him to one side and to come along and be of assistance to him in the way she has."" 
        
       
      
    46 His Honour determined that, special circumstances having been found, ""the non parole period in the case of Mr Walter should be significantly less than the statutory ratio"" (ROS 13). He recommended that, whilst supervised by the Parole Service, he should receive counselling in respect of anger management and alcohol. 
     
      
       
      Was the sentence inadequate? 
       
      
    47 The Crown pointed to a number of remarks by the sentencing Judge which, whilst not misstating any sentencing principle, suggested that he had given rather more weight to certain subjective features than was warranted. In the result his Honour had plainly overvalued such features, according to the Crown, and arrived at a sentence in respect of each offender which was inadequate. 
     
      
    48 First, both offenders were Aboriginal. His Honour therefore believed that he should approach each matter in a manner consistent with the principles stated by Wood J in Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. The circumstances of each offender, according to the Crown, made the application of those principles doubtful, especially in the case of Mr Thompson. Even assuming their application, the issue had been overvalued by the sentencing Judge, given the outcome. 
     
      
    49 Secondly, the ""psychological makeup of the offenders"", and the fact that they were at a disadvantage in the community, was a matter to be taken into account when judging their moral culpability. However, whatever weight was given to that aspect, it would appear from the outcome that it must have been given greater weight than was warranted. 
     
      
    50 Thirdly, whilst unquestionably both offenders were affected by alcohol, as the bizarre nature of their demand upon the victim makes clear, it is also clear that they knew what they were doing. Having done their work, they escaped. Having been apprehended, they were able to invent a story to explained matters which would otherwise associate them with the crime. Whilst his Honour acknowledged that intoxication may be an explanation for their crime, and was not an excuse, the sentence, by its moderation, effectively excused what was a very serious crime. 
     
      
    51 In the case of Mr Walter, the Crown said that, whilst the term of 5 years may not have been manifestly inadequate, the non parole period of 6 months plainly was. It did not reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, even giving full weight to the subjective circumstances of Mr Walter. 
     
      
    52 In respect of Mr Thompson, the Crown asserted that error had infected each aspect of the sentence. In terms of their criminality, there was no ""relevant distinction"" to be drawn between the two offenders. Accordingly, the 3 year term was manifestly inadequate, the order that it be served by way of periodic detention was unduly lenient, and the non parole period of 4 months was likewise inadequate. 
     
      
    53 Counsel for Mr Walter responded with a number of arguments. First, in the submissions to the sentencing Judge, the Crown conceded the application of the Fernando principles. Secondly, there were, in the case of Mr Walter, mental health issues which were causally related to the commission of the crime. They operated to reduce his moral culpability, such that it could not be said that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Thirdly, counsel joined with the Crown in submitting that no relevant distinction should be made between the criminality of Mr Walter and that of Mr Thompson. Finally, the Court was reminded of the important discretion on Crown appeals and the relevance of that discretion, given the significant delay in sentencing and prosecuting this appeal. 
     
      
    54 Counsel for Mr Thompson acknowledged that the sentence which had been imposed was lenient. He submitted, nonetheless, that it was not manifestly inadequate. Even were the Court to find error, it should not, as a matter of discretion, intervene. Counsel drew attention to certain developments since Mr Thompson had been sentenced. Mr Thompson was ordered to attend for periodic detention on 12 March 2004. Between March and the end of May 2004, however, he was absent without leave on three occasions, and absent with leave on one occasion. Mr Thompson gave as his reason for not attending that he was depressed. His counsel pointed to the coincidence in time between the service of the Notice of Appeal (26 April 2003) and three of the failures to attend. In June 2004 the Parole Board revoked the order for periodic detention. Mr Thompson would be obliged to serve thirteen weeks full time imprisonment. On 9 June 2004 a warrant was issued for his arrest. 
     
      
    55 The warrant, however, was not executed. Mr Thompson attended the hearing of the appeal and sat in the back of the court. 
     
      
       
      The inadequacy of each sentence. 
       
      
    56 It was open to his Honour, and for the reasons he gave, to regard the criminality of Mr Thompson as significantly less than that of Mr Walter (supra para 21). Although each offender was charged with Robbery in circumstances of aggravation (s95(1) Crimes Act), some guidance was to be found in the guideline judgement in respect of the kindred offence of Armed Robbery (s97(1) Crimes Act). Both offences, it will be noticed, carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The guideline in respect to s97(1) in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 was expressed in these terms by the Chief Justice: (at 388) 
     
      
       
        
        ""165 In my opinion sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. I have arrived at this figure after drawing on the collective knowledge of the other four members of the Court with respect to sentence ranges. I have also reviewed the sentences which this Court has imposed on occasions when it has intervened, including in Crown appeals where the principle of double jeopardy applies. The proposed range is broadly consistent with this body of prior decisions in this Court.""  
        
       
      
    57 Two matters suggested error. The first concerned the application of the principles in Fernando to the circumstances of each offender. Each offender was Aboriginal. Each was affected by alcohol at the time of the offence. The disinhibiting influence of alcohol was unquestionably important in the commission of the offence. However, these matters do not bring into operation the Fernando principles. Wood J, when stating those principles, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(A) The same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group but that does not mean that the sentencing court should ignore those facts which exist only by reason of the offenders' membership of such a group. 
        
       
       
        
        (B) The relevance of the Aboriginality of an offender is not necessarily to mitigate punishment but rather to explain or throw light on the particular offence and the circumstances of the offender.  
        
       
       
        
        (C) It is proper for the court to recognise that the problems of alcohol abuse and violence which to a very significant degree go hand in hand within Aboriginal communities are very real ones and their cure requires more subtle remedies than the criminal law can provide by way of imprisonment. ... 
        
       
       
        
        (E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence  
        reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor 
        . This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects. ... "" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    58 Mr Thompson did not come from a dysfunctional family. There was no history of deprived socio-economic circumstances or of alcohol abuse. He, unfortunately, in common with other members of the community, had resorted to alcohol as a comfort from his troubles. The Fernando principle (E) had no application to him (cf Howie J in R v Newman & Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102 at paras 57 to 65). 
     
      
    59 The circumstances of Mr Walter were less clear-cut. The Crown, both before the sentencing Judge and this Court, acknowledged that the principles had some relevance. 
     
      
    60 The second error concerned the duration of the non parole periods in respect of each offender, 6 months in the case of Mr Walter and 4 months in respect of Mr Thompson, Mr Thompson already having the benefit of an order of periodic detention (which itself involved leniency). Neither adequately reflected the criminality of each offender. In fixing a minimum term, the sentencing Judge was obliged to take account of the same considerations that ought to be in contemplation when setting the head sentence, including deterrence (Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525, per Mason CJ and McHugh J at 531). In Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623, Barwick CJ, Menzies, Stephen and Mason JJ made the following comment, concerning the components of a sentence: (at 629) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate,  
        once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve having regard to all the circumstances of his offence 
        ."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    61 Having found special circumstances, the task which his Honour was required to perform was to determine the minimum term which justice required each offender should serve, having regard to the circumstances of the offence. This Court (Carruthers, Finlay and Badgery-Parker JJ) described what was required in R v Morrissey (CCA, unreported, 15.7.94) in these terms: (p 7) 
     
      
       
        
        "" ... the decision to vary the statutory proportion requires consideration not only of the desirability of increasing the additional term but also the appropriateness of reducing the minimum term which must nevertheless remain such as appropriately reflects the criminality involved."" 
        
       
      
    62 This was a brutal crime. Whatever the personal circumstances of the offenders, and however encouraging their prospects of rehabilitation, justice required, in the case of Mr Walter, a minimum term greater than 6 months, and in the case of Mr Thompson, a minimum term (in the context of an order of periodic detention) exceeding 4 months. The statistics furnished by the Judicial Commission, in respect of an offence under s95(1) of the Crimes Act, suggested that a minimum term of 6 months was at the very bottom of the range, and represented only a small proportion of the cases. It was plain that the crime committed by these offenders could not be so regarded. 
     
      
    63 In each case, therefore, the Crown had demonstrated error. There was a need to resentence, subject to the Court's discretion to intervene. 
     
      
       
      Discretion. 
       
      
    64 Here, counsel for each offender pointed to the significant delay on the part of the Crown. The offences were committed on 8 November 2002. Mr Thompson pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 22 April 2003. Mr Walter entered his plea on 27 May 2003. Both were committed for sentence in the District Court. The Crown, however, as the sentencing Judge remarked, failed to bracket the matters so that they proceeded together. Mr Thompson (although not Mr Walter) was listed for sentence before Mahoney ADCJ on 13 June 2003. Evidence was taken. The proceedings were adjourned, part heard, so that they could link up with the proceedings against Mr Walter. Both matters were fixed for hearing on 8 August 2003. 
     
      
    65 However, on 8 August 2003 the matter was again adjourned. Counsel for Mr Thompson was present and ready to proceed. However, counsel for Mr Walter (who was then appearing pro bono) was not available. The matter was then fixed for 15 September 2003. On that day, however, it could not proceed. The sentencing Judge was part heard in Lismore. Both matters were then fixed for hearing on 11 December 2003. 
     
      
    66 On 10 December 2003, counsel for Mr Walter made an application to vacate the hearing scheduled for the next day. Mr Walter had been required to demonstrate his Aboriginality to qualify for legal assistance. That took time. Having been accepted as an Aboriginal, representation was provided by the Aboriginal Legal Service. That Service determined, in the short time available, that further evidence was required. Both matters were again adjourned. They were fixed for hearing on 4 March 2004. On that day, at last, they proceeded. Each offender was sentenced. 
     
      
    67 Having been sentenced, the Director of Public Prosecutions permitted seven weeks to elapse before signing the Notice of Appeal (21 April 2004). The Notice in each case was served on 24 April 2004. 
     
      
    68 The appeal having been lodged, the matter again did not proceed with despatch. Transcript of the sentencing proceedings and the remarks on sentence were not available. The appeal was listed on 8 July 2004. It was adjourned. It ultimately proceeded on 27 August 2004. 
     
      
    69 Mr Thompson did not cause that delay. Although the reasons for the adjournments between August and December 2003 do not reflect adversely upon the Director, the untidy and prolonged nature of the sentencing proceedings can be traced to the initial failure of the Director to ensure that both matters proceeded at the one time. In a matter in which the Director claimed, and the Court has found, that the sentences were manifestly inadequate, it was unsatisfactory to delay seven weeks before serving the Notice of Appeal. The Crown, although not the Director, was responsible for the delay on the appeal, in failing to prepare transcript in a timely way. 
     
      
    70 Delay is important in the context of the Court's discretion on a Crown appeal. Hayden JA said this in R v Hernando  (2002) 136 A Crim R 451: 
     
      
       
        
        ""18. Sentences which are so lenient that on their face they reveal appellable error are not only intrinsically undesirable, but carry the further disadvantage of having a cruel impact on the respondents who are beneficiaries of a legally flawed generosity. The Crown is in no way to be criticised for seeking to challenge totally unsatisfactory sentences, at least if this is done speedily. Even where particular appellate courts decide against a further term of imprisonment, the impact on the respondents of the uncertainty in the period between when the Crown gives notice of its desire to appeal and the time when the appeal is decided must be agonising. Those respondents may deserve greater punishment than they received at the sentencing stage, but not that type of punishment. In the context of civil cases Lord Griffith famously spoke of the 'strain' imposed on personal litigants, the 'anxieties' occasioned by facing new issues, and 'the raising of false hopes':  
        Ketteman v Hansel Properties Pty Ltd 
         [1987] 1 AC 189 at 220. These factors obviously press down even more heavily on accused persons facing Crown appeals occasioned by erroneous sentencing."" 
        
       
      
    71 Having taken these matters into account, the Court determined that it should intervene and resentence. The delay, nonetheless, remains relevant to the sentences to be imposed in substitution for those set aside. 
     
      
       
      The resentence of Mr Thompson. 
       
      
    72 It is recognised that, after a successful Crown appeal, there is an element of double jeopardy. The offender faces sentence for a second time on the same facts. The sentence which is substituted should therefore be towards the lower end of the range (Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 341). 
     
      
    73 In the case of Mr Thompson, taking account of his role in the offence and his subjective case, his sentence should reflect three additional matters. First, it should take account of the significant progress which he has continued to make in his rehabilitation. He has remained employed at the poultry farm and has moderated his intake of alcohol. Secondly, the sentence should reflect the time spent by him attending for periodic detention. Thirdly, it should take account of the delay in respect of which Mr Thompson is blameless. 
     
      
    74 It should be understood that the sentence substituted is emphatically not the sentence which the Court believes was appropriate in the first place. It is a sentence moderated in accordance with the principles applicable after a successful Crown appeal.  
     
      
    75 In the case of Mr Thompson, the orders of the Court made on 27 August 2004 were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years to date from 13 March 2004. The Court specified a non parole period of 9 months commencing on 13 March 2004 and expiring on 12 December 2004. 
       
       
      4. The respondent to be released to parole on that date. 
       
       
      5. The Court noted that in setting the non parole period, it was conscious that during the span of time specified the respondent, Mr Thompson, has served some periods of periodic detention and has been at liberty during other periods. 
       
       
      6. The respondent, Mr Thompson, should surrender to custody forthwith. 
       
       
      The resentence of Mr Walter. 
       
      
    76 Mr Walter has made good use of his time in prison to address the problems which led to his offending behaviour. He has worked as a carpenter. He has earned a position of trust. He has incurred no internal charges. He is described by Prison Officers as ""quiet, polite and compliant"". He has attended drug and alcohol counselling. A report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service included the following comments: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Walter indicated that prior to his incarceration he consumed very large quantities of alcohol on weekends and to a somewhat less, but still significant degree, during the week. He indicated that although he did not consider this to be a problem at the time, he has now had time to take a step back and consider his past behaviour and its consequences. The inmate suggested that the impact of being incarcerated helped to stimulate his desire for self-analysis. The subsequent period of time which he has been able to benefit from, without the negative consequences of alcohol has contributed significantly to his ability to be able to clearly evaluate his prior lifestyle and choices."" 
        
       
      
    77 The report continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Enquiries with the AOD Worker confirmed that Mr Walter has sought individual counselling to address his alcohol problem. The Worker indicated that the inmate has progressed well and complied with the homework assignments as required. He further stated that Mr Walter appears (to) be very motivated to address his alcohol problem. However, his current placement makes it difficult to offer him any significant long-term intervention. The AOD Worker agreed to speak to the inmate with regards to post release management and offer referrals to community based treatment."" 
        
       
      
    78 The Service in the same report (28 May 2004) commented upon Mr Walter's prospects of rehabilitation. It said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Walter appears to be regretful of the offence and indicated that the resulting incarceration has served as a 'wake up' call. He pointed to depression and alcohol as the two contributing factors and indicated that since entering custody, he has been attempting to understand his own behaviour. His ex partner confirmed that Mr Walter has had ongoing difficulty with managing his alcohol abuse and has never dealt satisfactorily with the events from his childhood."" 
        
       
      
    79 The report continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Although eager to be released, Mr Walter appears to have a rather positive attitude towards his incarceration. He considers this period of time as an opportunity to evaluate his past behaviour, develop, through rehabilitation, strategies that will allow for a behaviour change, and finally, the manner in which he will implement and ensure the behaviour change upon his release. It is encouraging that the inmate has largely focused on his rehabilitation and gaining insight into his own behaviour. He expressed commitment to continue rehabilitation and self-improvement following his release and he appears to be quite clear and realistic about the degree of effort necessary to successfully implement those behaviour changes."" 
        
       
      
    80 Mr Walter's former wife, Ms Sally Bird, was willing to assist after his release. 
     
      
    81 In determining an appropriate sentence, the principles identified in the case of Mr Thompson apply to Mr Walter. There is a need to moderate the sentence, recognising double jeopardy and the significant delay in sentencing and in prosecuting this appeal. 
     
      
    82 The orders in respect of Mr Walter made by the Court on 27 August 2004 were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 4 March 2004. The Court specified a non parole period of 12 months commencing on 4 March 2004 and expiring on 3 March 2005. 
       
       
      4. The first date of eligibility for parole was specified as 3 March 2005.

      FRIDAY 3 SEPTEMBER 2004 
       
       
       
      70044/2003 – REGINA v MICHAEL THOMAS O’LEARY 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 15 June 2004 Michael Thomas O’Leary (the offender) pleaded guilty to having murdered Maxwell Gordon Abbott at Windang on or about 15 December 2002. The offender is now aged 24. He was 22 at the time of the offence. He has been in custody since his arrest on 27 December 2002 and it is appropriate that the sentence to be imposed upon him should commence from that date. 
     
      
    2 A statement of facts was tendered on sentence. It is agreed that it constitutes the factual basis upon which I should proceed to sentence the offender. Subject to minor amendments, it is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The deceased, Maxwell Gordon Abbott, aged 60 years, was the occupier of site 812 at the South Pacific Village Caravan Park at 138 Windang Road, Windang. This site contained a two bedroom relocatable home. 
         
         
        The deceased was in the habit of attending at the Illawarra Yacht Club at Northcliffe Drive at Warrawong where he would meet friends including Pam Bryant. The offender was introduced to the deceased by Mrs. Bryant and they became further acquainted through the attendance by the offender at the Yacht Club from time to time. 
         
         
        Initially the offender was residing with his girlfriend Elizabeth Bogojevic at 170 Waples Road, Unanderra. However, around the beginning of December 2002 the offender and his girlfriend separated and she had requested that he move out of her home. The offender sought accommodation with his grandparents but they were unable to provide a place for him in their home. His father was overseas and the offender did not enjoy a good relationship with his father’s wife and so there was no prospect of accommodation with his father. 
         
         
        The offender then entered into an agreement with the deceased whereby the offender would live with the deceased at South Pacific Village Caravan Park. The offender was to pay $50-00 per week by way of rent and otherwise share in other living expenses. 
         
         
        The offender was unemployed at the time of the offence, he having been dismissed from his employment as an apprenticed plant mechanic with Gough and Gilmore in April, 2002. He had virtually absented himself from work in December, 2001 and had failed to adequately explain his absences. The offender was not in receipt of any social security benefits and had no income at all. He had been surviving by writing cheques without any funds in his bank account. He had also been borrowing money from friends and family. His behaviour was out of his previously known character and he had become depressed. He had also begun to tell many lies to everybody with whom he had contact, on all manner of topics. 
         
         
        On or about the 4th December, 2002 the offender moved in with the deceased. On that day he brought with him 4 cases of beer and four bottles of wine. These items were purchased from Theo’s liquor store at Warrawong by passing a valueless cheque drawn on the offender’s account with the ANZ Bank at Figtree. 
         
         
        On or about the 9th December, 2002 the offender purported to pay rent to Michael Gales, the manager of the South Pacific Caravan Park, on behalf of himself and the deceased by passing a valueless cheque in the sum of $348-00 drawn on the offender’s account with the ANZ Bank at Figtree. This was later returned to Mr. Gales who spoke to the offender about it. The offender made promises to Mr. Gales which were never honoured. Mr. Gales believed that there was no problem as the deceased had been meticulous in his dealings with Mr. Gales and always promptly paid his rent. 
         
         
        On 11th December, 2002 the offender had an argument with his girlfriend and punched the windscreen of her car causing damage. She apparently made application for an apprehended violence order restraining the offender as a result of this incident. 
         
         
        On 15th December, 2002 Carolyn Humphries, another resident at the South Pacific Caravan Park saw the deceased in his premises. She gave the deceased $20.00. The deceased complained to Ms. Humphries about the offender, saying that the offender had not paid any money towards rent and food and beer. The deceased told Ms. Humphries that the offender “would have to go soon”. This was the last known sighting of the deceased by anybody other than the offender. The deceased did not attend at Ms. Humphries’ van later that day as agreed. 
         
         
        Some time during the day of 15th December, 2002 the offender and the deceased argued. The deceased told the offender he was to leave. The offender has given a version of the argument stating that he was punched by the deceased and that he retaliated by punching the deceased, and that the deceased hit an object of furniture in the lounge room and fell to the floor. The offender has admitted striking the deceased whilst he was on the floor and that the deceased bled from a cut to his eye region. The offender attempted to clean up the blood that had fallen from the deceased and himself onto the carpet. 
         
         
        Later examination of clothing of the offender confirms the presence of blood on the t-shirt said to have been worn during this altercation. Further examination has revealed DNA profiles matching the profiles of the offender and the deceased. The Crown concedes that it is not in a position to disprove the version given by the offender, that is that he was struck by the deceased causing the offender’s nose to bleed. 
         
         
        The offender stated to police that he thought that the offender was merely unconscious and decided to put him into the wardrobe in the deceased’s bedroom. The offender left the caravan park shortly thereafter taking the deceased’s car. He visited various places before going to his girlfriend’s house at Waples Road, Unanderra late in the evening of 15th December, 2002. Police attended at those premises and informed him of the existence of the Apprehended Violence Order. The offender told them that he had been driven to the premises by his father. He did not tell the Police about the deceased’s car. The Police then took him to Port Kembla Police Station and then drove him back to the deceased’s van site. 
         
         
        The offender has maintained that the next morning he discovered the deceased still in the wardrobe and obviously dead. He believes that he attempted to obtain some money by using the deceased’s keycard at an Automatic Teller Machine at a nearby service station without success. He also attempted to obtain money being kept by Pam Bryant on behalf of the deceased, being the deceased’s share of the profits of a punters club in which both Mrs. Bryant and the deceased were participants. Mrs. Bryant refused to give the offender that money. The offender then maintains that on Monday 16th December, 2002 he attended at ACE CASH ADVANCE at Dapto with a video cassette recorder belonging to the deceased and obtained $30-00. This transaction was recorded on video. The offender maintains that he then left Dapto and travelled to Dunlop in the Australian Capital Territory where he stayed with the biological mother of the offender’s adopted sister. 
         
         
        However, the offender did not leave the premises of the deceased until Tuesday 17th December, 2002. This is established through the following evidence: 
         
        On searching the premises of the deceased a television programme guide was open at Monday 16 December, 2002. 
         
        The offender sought accommodation at the Oasis Caravan Park at Windang on 16 December, 2002. 
         
        Telephone records of the deceased’s service show telephone calls made on Monday 16 December to the premises at Dunlop in the ACT and on Tuesday 17 December 2002 to the Commonwealth Bank at Warrawong. 
         
        The transaction at Ace Cash Advance at Dapto took place on Tuesday 17 December, 2002. 
         
        The owner of the premises at Dunlop in the ACT recalls the offender arriving on Tuesday 17 December, 2002. 
         
         
        The two sons of the deceased had been trying to contact the deceased as Christmas approached obviously without success. Pam Bryant had also been trying to contact the deceased and eventually on Christmas Day 2002 Mr. Gales and others from the South Pacific Caravan Park gained entry to the deceased’s premises through a window and discovered the body of the deceased in the wardrobe in his bedroom. 
         
         
        On 26th December, a post mortem examination was conducted by Dr. Paul Botterill at Glebe. He concluded that: 
         
         
          
          “ 
          in plain terms, autopsy findings included many broken ribs, bruising over the front and the back of the muscle of the chest wall, bruising beneath the skin over the left side of the face and left forehead, bruises of the left arm and both legs. 
           
           
          As at the time of autopsy the cause of death was believed to be the combined effects of chest and head injury although the possibility of concurrent inebriation could not be completely excluded at that time. Testing for drugs and poisons showed a spleen fluid alcohol of 0.073 g/100 mL, consistent with decompositional effect. The chest and head injuries are consistent with multiple blunt force contacts and would be consistent with actions such as the use of knees or stomping”. 
           
          
         
        Dr. Botterill found fractures of the anterior aspects of the left 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th ribs, of the lateral aspects of the left 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ribs, and of the posterior aspects of the left 3rd, 4th and 5th ribs. Fractures were also seen of the lateral aspect of the right 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th and 9th ribs and of the anterior aspect of the right common rib. 
         
         
        The skin of the scalp was reflected and bruising over the left frontal scalp subcutis was found. There was also found extensive subcuticular haemorrhage beneath the area involving the left cheek, left temple and left angle of the mandible. 
         
         
        On Friday 27 December, 2002 Detectives Smith and Church of New South Wales Police attended at Dunlop with officers from the Australian Federal Police and arrested the offender. He was interviewed and gave the following version of events: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “The afternoon that it actually happened, I’d just got home, I’d been around to see my grandmother, and as soon as I walked in the door, he just started yellin’ at me, and he was, he was blind drunk himself, I come home and he was just sittin’ on his couch just watchin’ TV, just yellin’ at me, you know, like, to clean the room up and just everything, anything he could find something to whinge about, he did, and then I had a couple of beers, and I went and laid down for a while and then I woke up, and Max is just standin’ above me and just swore at me again, so I sat up and then he, he just thumped me right across the mouth,. I pushed him, and he went back, and then I ran up and I punched him once in the mouth and then once in the eye, we were in the lounge room at this stage, he went down on the floor, and I was just holdin’ his throat, just to try and scare him a little bit, and then I just thought he was unconscious, and I thought I’d scare him so I dragged him into, into his bedroom and put him , just put him in the closet, because I thought he’d wake up and huff and puff, and then I went back into the lounge room and tried to clean up the little bit of blood that was on the floor from me and him.” 
          
         
         
        The following day he was extradited to New South Wales where he was charged with the murder of the deceased. 
         
         
        The offender was subsequently interviewed at Burwood on 30 January, 2003. The offender admitted responsibility for the death of the deceased. The following exchanges took place: 
         
         
          
          Q.48 Could you tell us what dates you think you and Max had the argument on, the fight on? 
           
          A. It was Sunday morning, would have been the 15th of December. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q.49O.K. No, going back to that date, can you tell me what the argument was over? 
           
          A Well, like I told you before, I was, I was sound asleep, Max just came in and he was blind drunk, this is about 9.00, 9.30 in the morning and he just was standing over me, demanding money off me so he could go and buy some more beer, I said no, and a few other words, then he told me it’s probably best if I move out and I said I will and then, I don’t know, I just must have ticked something and he just started whaling (sic) into me, like while I was laying down in bed and then I got up and retaliated. 
          
         
         
        He said that he was hit in the nose by the deceased and there was some blood from his nose. He then went on to say at Q.65: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Yeah, I walked out and I pushed him, and that’s when he hit into his entertainment unit and then he fell to the ground and that’s when I, when he was on the ground, I punched him one in the face and that hit him just above the eye and then I put my hands around his throat for a second then after that, he just he wasn’t, wasn’t conscious. I just checked to make sure he was, like he was still breathing, things like that. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q.70 How did he come to be on the floor? 
           
          A. Because I pushed him and he bounced off, like he hit the TV cabinet pretty hard and then he fell to the ground straight after that. Plus, he was very, very drunk too at that stage. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. 71 Did you hit him at all when he was standing up? 
           
          A. No, not when he was standing up. No, when he went down to the ground, I did. I did pop him one when he was on the ground and that’s when I put my hand around his throat and then I realised that he was unconscious. 
           
           
          Q.72 Why did you hit him when he was on the ground? 
           
          A. It was just a rage going through me, that’s all I can say. I was just angry for him losing it at me.  
          
         
         
          
          Q.155 Do you think after you hit Max the first time, was he capable of hitting you back, I think after that? 
           
          A. I wouldn’t know, I just hit him once and then just hit him again and again. 
          
         
         
        By his plea the offender has abandoned defences of Provocation, Self Defence and Substantial Impairment. Nevertheless, it is common ground that the offender was to some extent impaired. 
         
         
        Dr. Stephen Allnutt interviewed the offender on 30 December, 2003 and concluded: 
         
         
          
          “In my opinion and with reasonable medical certainty your client (the offender) was suffering from a mental disorder; namely, a combination of Post Traumatic Stress and Depressive Disorder symptoms at the material time that the alleged offence occurred. Both of these conditions in my view would be regarded by psychiatrists as meeting the legal criteria for an “underlying condition” causing an “abnormality of mind”. 
          
         
         
          
          In my opinion at the material time of the alleged offence, your client would have been compromised in his capacity to interpret and judge events due to his symptoms. Individuals who suffer from moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression are more prone to misinterpretation and exaggerated interpretations of their environment in a negative way.” 
          
         
         
        Dr. Olav Nielssen interviewed the offender on 4 June, 2004 for the purposes of providing opinion to the Crown. His report included the following opinions: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Psychiatric Diagnoses 
           
          Adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety 
           
          Alcohol abuse disorder. 
           
          Summary and Opinion 
           
          Mr. O’Leary’s psychiatric disorder resulted in an abnormality of mind that was present in the period leading up to the offence and was not a transient condition. The combination of disorders resulted in subjective distress and also significant social disability. 
           
           
          The presence of depressed mood is unlikely to have significantly affected Mr. O’Leary’s capacity to understand and interpret the events leading to the offence. His depressed state may have affected his capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong to a minor degree, in that depressed mood often results in a reduction in concern about the possible consequences of one’s actions. The increased irritability and anger that is often associated with depression may also have resulted in a degree of impairment in Mr O’Leary’s capacity to control his aggression.” 
          
         
         
        
       
      
    3 I have received victim impact statements from the deceased’s sister and his sons respectively. Each of them detail the impact which his death has had upon them and the rest of the family. They each express their anguish and sense of despair at having lost someone whom they loved dearly. The feelings which they express are entirely understandable. I am aware of course that the effect of his death upon his relatives is not, for present purposes, a relevant consideration. See R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. Nevertheless the court expresses its profound sympathy to all those who have suffered, and who continue to suffer, by reason of his death. 
     
      
    4 Pursuant to s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900, the crime of murder attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. Section 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 nevertheless enables a court to impose a determinate sentence. It is common ground that this is not a matter which attracts the operation of s 61 of that Act. In sentencing the offender, it is necessary to proceed upon the basis that the offence to which he has pleaded guilty is the most serious in the criminal calendar. The starting point must be to recognise that a human life has been taken. The community expects that the sanctity of human life will be protected by the law and that those who take it will be appropriately punished. I am required to bear in mind the relevant statutory framework that pertains to the sentencing of offenders and to the principles which are enunciated in the authorities that bear upon the issue. That being so, it is common ground that I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing which are set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        3A 
        . The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
           
          (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
           
          (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
           
          (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
           
          (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
           
          (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
           
          (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    5 The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92 characterised s 3A as being a codification and elaboration of the purposes of criminal punishment which were described by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. A majority of the court, in a passage which is particularly apposite to the present case, said: 
     
      
       
        
        [s]entencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guide posts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. (At 476) 
        
       
      
    6 I must also, in determining the appropriate sentence, have regard to the various aggravating factors which are set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is apparent from the concluding words of s 21A(1) that the list is not exhaustive. As long as I take into account those factors that are relevant and known, it is not necessary as I understand the situation, to deal seriatim with each matter which is identified. Suffice it to say that I have had regard to the statutory requirements to which I have just referred, and given due weight to the matters which I consider as being of particular relevance. 
     
      
    7 It is not easy to determine precisely how the events unfolded which led to the death of Mr Abbott. Whilst the offender acknowledged his responsibility for causing the death, both to police in the interviews conducted with him and by his plea in this court, it is apparent that the very significant injuries occasioned to the deceased could only have resulted from a number of blows of considerable force having been struck by the offender. It is common ground that the blows which the offender inflicted upon the deceased were done with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Whatever may have precipitated the accused’s actions, nothing however justified the nature and extent of the violence which he visited upon a man who was not only considerably older than he was, but who was undoubtedly in an intoxicated state at the time. Likewise the accused’s conduct subsequent to Mr Abbott’s death in, for example, pawning his video recorder and taking his motor vehicle and his keycard do not reflect well upon him. However, it is common ground that it is not conduct of such a character as could be regarded as a matter of aggravation.  
     
      
    8 That said, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Abbott’s death was in any sense, planned by the offender. On the contrary, I accept the submission that it was not premeditated and that the relevant intention, to which I earlier referred, arose only during the course of the incident which culminated in Mr Abbott’s death. 
     
      
    9 The Crown concedes that it cannot exclude the reasonable possibility that the accused’s version of events, to the effect that the deceased verbally abused him and punched him before he retaliated, is true. Accordingly it also properly concedes that it is thus appropriate to take into account in the offender’s favour the fact that he was, to some degree, reacting to provocative conduct, albeit not of a kind that would entitle him to rely upon the provisions of s23 of the Crimes Act. Similar considerations apply to the question of excessive self-defence. 
     
      
    10 Of even greater significance is the possibility that the accused could, but for his plea of guilty, have brought himself within the scope of s 23A of the Crimes Act and thus relied upon the “defence” of “substantial impairment”. As has earlier been observed, the offender was examined by Dr Allnutt who provided a report in which he set out the circumstances which were said to be capable of supporting such a “defence”. Extracted below are relevant parts of that report: 
     
      
       
        
        [The offender’s] difficulties began in approximately January 2002 when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. While he was not himself a victim of the accident he was a witness to a significant accident in which he watched a police car going out of control and people flying out of the car. He was the first witness on the scene and found a trainee police officer hanging out of the car. He checked the police officer’s pulse, checked he was breathing and he tried to assist at the scene. He found out later that the policeman was brain dead. 
        
       
       
        
        The experience distressed him. He was distressed by the limited assistance that he was able to provide the struggling trainee police officer and the lack of involvement of other witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        Your client told me that since the accident “I just wasn’t sane anymore”. At the time of the accident he was involved in a stable relationship with his girlfriend of one year and was working as an apprentice mechanic performing adequately in his work. 
        
       
       
        
        Following the accident he recalled a change in his demeanour at work, in his relationship and socially. He made more mistakes at work because he was not paying attention. He was preoccupied about the possibility that his girlfriend may be involved in a car accident. These ruminations intruded on his capacity to focus on his work. He began attending work less and less because of loss of motivation or interest in work. As a consequence his performance deteriorated to the extent that he was finally fired from his job. 
        
       
       
        
        He became overly protective of his girlfriend. He said, “I stopped allowing her to have a life. I would need to be with her all the time”. His predominant concern was that, if he was not with his girlfriend something untoward would happen to her and he would lose her. He lost weight and his motivation and energy diminished. He said “I didn’t want to do anything”. He lost interest in his usual activities such as bike riding and walking. He argued with his girlfriend frequently due to increased irritability and short temper. He said that this was something that was not present in their relationship prior to the accident. His sleep deteriorated and on some nights he was unable to sleep. He later noticed that his sex drive diminished. 
        
       
       
        
        In an effort to cope he increased his alcohol consumption. Prior to the accident he drank approximately once a week, following the accident he found himself drinking on a daily basis approximately six beers a day and this further contributed to increasing tension in his relationship. 
        
       
       
        
        He said, “The image of seeing the car fly like that was like an explosion. It never left my head.” He thought continually about how bad things happened so easily. The image of the accident kept recurring in his mind. He denied that he began to experience any nightmares. He avoided socialising and spent his time with his girlfriend. He became more “jumpy” when he was driving and tended to be over cautious. He said “I paid double attention to everything after that”. I was always watching out. He said when he thought about the accident he felt “horrified”. He felt this way when he had “mental images in my head”. He became emotionally more distant from his girlfriend after the accident. 
        
       
       
        
        “I then started to lie about everything and anything”. After he was fired he continued to tell his girlfriend that he had a job. “I didn’t want to seem to be a failure” (although he felt himself to be a failure). He engaged in a number of deceptive behaviours, which he then said was uncharacteristic. He recalled going to car dealers and writing up cheques for cars, driving the car away and then having the car removed from him when the cheque bounced. He said he incurred approximately $80,000 worth of forged cheques. “At the time I began to believe my own lies, I was trying to please virtually everyone”. He told people that he was a mechanic. He believed that he was able to buy a house with his girlfriend. He said he was motivated by a desire to make his girlfriend happy and to get her what she wanted. At the time he thought he “had no problems about getting a house”. He recalled that he became impulsive “I did spur of the moment things, I would have no concern for the consequences. At the time I didn’t think there was anything wrong with me”, “It was like I had to please people, like my girlfriend and my parents”. I attempted to explore his motivation for this in greater depth; but found it difficult as he found his behaviour himself to be inexplicable.  
        
       
      
    11 The circumstances of the accident which the offender observed are set out in greater detail in the statement which he provided to police at the time, a copy of which was tendered in evidence before me. 
     
      
    12 Dr Allnutt also interviewed the offender’s father and his girlfriend. His report includes the results of those interviews: 
     
      
       
        
        Both his father and his girlfriend knew him as a reliable and honest individual. His girlfriend told me she had been going out with him for three years. His girlfriend made note that in the three years that she had been in a relationship with him he had never lost his temper with her and she had never had any cause for concern for intimidating behaviour on his part. 
        
       
       
        
        His father clarified that your client had never been under police arrest prior and had not manifested symptoms of conduct disorder or juvenile delinquency in childhood. 
        
       
       
        
        Both agreed that after being witness to the accident in 2002 there was a substantial change in his behaviour. He became more emotional. He began breaking down and crying more easily. His girlfriend said, “It was like there was a wall around him”. He began accidentally hurting himself at work, noting that he worked as a heavy machine mechanic. He was not sleeping well. She would wake up and find him sitting up at night. He would complain to her that he was too afraid to close his eyes because he would see the eyes of the dead police officer if he did this. His father informed me that he became withdrawn from the family and when approached he would be reluctant to talk about his feelings. Both agreed that he seemed emotionally “detached”. Both agreed that he appeared to be suffering emotionally but was not open to communicating this with them. 
        
       
       
        
        His girlfriend informed me that overall the relationship had been good. They had similar interests, they spent their time together bush walking and camping. After the accident he appeared detached and “emotionally very upset all the time, he cried a lot, he seemed to be unable to communicate his feelings”. On other occasions he told his father that he was going “nuts”. He told his father at times that he didn’t know why he was doing things; but he seemed to be doing things without considering the consequences. His father, becoming concerned, arranged counselling, which he attended in approximately June 2003 on one or two occasions in Wollongong. 
        
       
       
        
        His girlfriend told me that he seemed to be “worried all the time”. She specifically noted that he was afraid for her to get in the car and drive alone. He would want to accompany her every time she drove the car. He wanted to make sure that he was there with her at all times to protect her. His father confirmed that his son appeared to have a fixation on his girlfriend’s safety. His father made note that when he visited his son in gaol he continued to be concerned about people’s driving and advised both his father and girlfriend about driving carefully….. 
        
       
       
        
        Prior to losing his job, he started taking time off work, which again was uncharacteristic. They made note that he “never missed a day at work, he used to go to bed early, he even worked on weekends”. His girlfriend told me that she first became aware that he was writing illegal cheques in about August 2002. Both father and girlfriend agreed that this was something that was out of character. This caused conflict in his relationship with his girlfriend. 
        
       
       
        
        They noted that his alcohol consumption increased in October 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        His girlfriend was of the view that it was possible that his cheque writing had to do with a desire on his part to be in control and protective of her.  
        
       
      
    13 Dr Allnutt arrived at the following conclusions: 
     
      
       
        
        Following the motor vehicle accident your client describes a notable decline in his mental state. His mental state was likely further aggravated by the assault that he suffered in August 2002. Based on the information provided, there appears to have been a significant deviation from what would usually be regarded as normal behaviour for him. He became emotionally volatile; he manifested difficulties in concentration and attention; he became over-anxious; hyper-vigilant; he describes becoming more impulsive in that he began behaving in a manner without concern for consequences. He became more irritable and angry, manifesting lowered frustration tolerance. These are the kinds of symptoms that can compromise an individual’s ability to exert behavioural control and can increase the risk for impulsive aggression. 
        
       
       
        
        I am of the view that his capacity for volitional control would have been significantly compromised. He was predisposed, due to symptoms of PTSD and Depression and underlying conditions. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view I believe there are grounds to pursue the partial defence of substantial impairment. 
        
       
      
    14 Mr Smith, a clinical psychologist, also prepared a report. In it he refers to two incidents which occurred in 2001 which preceded the tragedy which the offender witnessed in early 2002. The following extract is taken from the report: 
     
      
       
        
        In January 2001 and at the beginning of the third year of Mr O’Leary’s apprenticeship, two incidents adversely compounded his poor coping. The first involved him happening to be on his way home behind an offender when the police arrested this person at gun point. Witnessing this caused him caused him (sic) emotional adjustment issues. He said his coping then slowly deteriorated. The second incident was that his girlfriend’s home was burgled in the May. Her father asked him to spend more time with her to increase her protection. He became very concerned for her safety and took many precautions to protect her. 
        
       
      
    15 Those incidents, whilst clearly not causing an impact of the magnitude of the one which the offender experienced the following year, do provide some context for an understanding of the reaction which he experienced to that latter incident. 
     
      
    16 As I have already indicated, it is common ground that this material should be taken into account in the offender’s favour either on the basis that it reduces the overall objective gravity of his conduct or as a mitigating factor in that it shows that the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his mental condition at the time. In the circumstances it is appropriate to give less weight to general deterrence than would otherwise be the case. See generally R v Merritt (2004) NSWCCA 19 at para 55. 
     
      
    17 I must also weigh in the balance those other matters upon which the offender is entitled to rely in order to mitigate the otherwise appropriate penalty. See s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Of particular relevance are (b) (c) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) and (k). 
     
      
    18 I have been provided with information concerning the offender’s background by way of the reports of Dr Nielssen, Dr Allnutt and Mr Smith. I have also had the benefit of sworn evidence from his father, Barry O’Leary and his girlfriend. 
     
      
    19 The offender was adopted shortly after birth. His two sisters were also adopted. His adoptive mother died from pancreatic cancer after a long illness, when he was about ten years old. Although this was a devastating experience for the offender and indeed for the entire family, the offender seems to have otherwise had a comfortable upbringing in a close knit family. His father eventually remarried, although that relationship has now broken down. 
     
      
    20 The offender struggled academically and was something of a “loner” at school. Nevertheless he appears to have excelled at various sports, including rugby league and ten-pin bowling. He was employed in a number of part-time jobs whilst completing school, including at a bowling alley. Whilst he was there he did volunteer work organising bowling days for disabled people. He also assisted disabled children to learn to sail. He obtained an apprenticeship after leaving school as a mechanic. He was initially enthusiastic about that position, which he had won over 200 other applicants, but eventually lost interest in the work and became disillusioned with the job. As was observed earlier, he was eventually dismissed from that position in April 2002 and was unemployed at the time of the offence. At some stage in 2002 the offender applied to join the Australian Army. In August 2002 he was accepted into the Army but at the last moment he turned down the offer.  
     
      
    21 The offender is entitled to an appropriate measure of leniency on account of his plea of guilty. That is a matter that I expressly take into account in his favour. See s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Whilst the plea of guilty was not entered at the first available opportunity, it was entered before the jury was empanelled. It is, of course, a significant step for an offender to take to plead guilty to murder. It is apparent from the admissions which he made that the offender accepted responsibility from the outset for having caused the death of Mr Abbott. He thereafter explored, as was his entitlement, the issue of substantial impairment before determining what plea he should enter. I was informed that had the matter proceeded to trial then it would have occupied at least three weeks of hearing time. That time has of course been saved. It may also be observed that his plea has obviated the necessity for a number of witnesses, who were close friends of the deceased, having to undergo the ordeal of giving evidence. As I have said, the offender did not plead at the first available opportunity, but I am of the view that a discount at about the mid-point of the range identified in R v Thomson v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 is called for in the circumstances of the present case. 
     
      
    22 The offender is also entitled to have weighed in his favour the fact that he has expressed contrition for his actions. First and foremost the offender made admissions concerning his involvement in this offence when questioned by police. True it is that the finger of suspicion had by then descended upon him as the likely perpetrator. True it is also that the offender was probably not entirely candid in revealing the full extent of the injuries which he inflicted upon his hapless victim. Nevertheless, he did make sufficient admissions to render his conviction all but inevitable. He has now clearly accepted full responsibility for the legal consequences of his actions and has thus demonstrated a “willingness to facilitate the course of justice”. See Cameron v The Queen (2002) 187 ALR 65. That is particularly so because of his decision not to seek to rely upon any “defence” or other material which may have had the consequence of reducing his culpability for this crime from murder to manslaughter. I accept that the opinion of Dr Allnutt, in particular, may have given him some cause for optimism in that respect.  
     
      
    23 Furthermore, the offender went into the witness box and expressed remorse for his conduct. He also apologised to the friends and relatives of the victim. Accordingly, he is in those circumstances, entitled to some credit over and above the discount which I have identified for the utilitarian value which his plea of guilty entails.  
     
      
    24 The offender is of course still a young man. It is to his credit that he has no prior convictions. There is also evidence before me as to his prior good character. I take those matters into account in his favour. It is also common ground that in light of those considerations, and because of the opinion of Dr Nielssen that the offender has “largely recovered from depression during the eighteen months he has spent in custody without treatment”, that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I am fortified in coming to that view by the evidence which shows that he has spent his time productively whilst he has been in custody. He has already completed two courses and plans to undertake further studies with a view to improving his employment prospects when he is eventually released.  
     
      
    25 Dr Nielssen also expressed optimism about the likelihood that the offender would not reoffend. In this context it is to be noted that the offender enjoys the ongoing support of his father and girlfriend. She remains committed to the relationship notwithstanding the prospect that the offender will be in custody for many years into the future. 
     
      
    26 It is again common ground that it is appropriate that I should find “special circumstances” within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In making such a finding, I have, in particular, had regard to the fact that this is the offender’s first time in gaol and that upon his eventual release from custody, he will require considerable supervision and assistance to facilitate his re-integration into the community. In reaching that conclusion, I have not overlooked the need, in setting the non-parole period, to fix the minimum period which the offender must spend in custody. See R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; R v MA (supra). 
     
      
    27 I have been provided with statistical information from the Judicial Commission which provides some indication as to the appropriate range of sentence for this kind of offence. I have also had regard to sentences imposed in other cases which may be said to bear some comparability to the present case. As has been well recognised that material has only limited value in assisting me in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. I have nonetheless derived some guidance from the decisions in R v de Souza 70105/94, NSWSC unreported, 10 November 1995 per Dunford J; R v Eberlin 70054/99 NSWSC unreported 2 September 1999 per James J and R v Chan [2002] NSWSC 544 per Ireland AJ. 
     
      
    28 Notwithstanding the offender’s favourable subjective matters and the other features of the case to which I have referred, it is necessary to impose a sentence which properly reflects the objective gravity of the offence and which gives effect to the various matters referred to in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This case involves the senseless and tragic loss of human life and accordingly nothing less than a substantial custodial sentence can be countenanced. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    29 For the crime of murder, I sentence the offender to 16 years imprisonment, to commence on 27 December 2002 and to expire on 26 December 2018, with a non-parole period of 11 years, also to commence on 27 December 2002 and to expire on 26 December 2013, which is the first date upon which the offender is eligible for release to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: Gerardo Villar (Villar), Kristijan Zugecic (Zugecic) and Tome Hadzi-Mitrov (Mitrov) were presented for trial on indictment before Coleman DCJ and a jury at Campbelltown District Court. The indictment was lengthy but all alleged offences by all then accused were alleged to have occurred at the same premises over the night of 24-25 May 2001. Count 1 was charged under the now replaced s 90A of the Crimes Act 1900 (kidnap) and all other offences were of the nature of sexual crimes. A general description of the counts and outcomes follows. 
     
      
    2 Count 1 of the indictment charged the three accused that: 
     
      
       
        
        “On or about 24 May 2001 at Canley Vale in the State of New South Wales, did detain RB with intent to hold her for advantage to themselves”. 
        
       
      
    3 On deliberation, the jury sent a note stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “The directions given on count 1 caused the jury to believe all three had to be found guilty or not guilty, however if the charges are specific to each accused, we have a unanimous verdict for two accused” (T5 15 October 2002). 
        
       
      
    4 His Honour stated that he proposed to take those verdicts in relation to that count and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the heads that have been nodded at the bar table, I take it there is no opposition to that course”. 
        
       
      
    5 An oral response is recorded by counsel for Villar “No, your Honour”. 
     
      
    6 Thereafter the jury returned verdicts of guilty against Villar and Zugecic on that count. They were discharged as unable to agree in respect of finding a verdict on that count in respect of Mitrov. 
     
      
    7 Counts 2 and 3 in the indictment charged Villar with having sexual intercourse with RB without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on these counts. 
     
      
    8 Count 4 charged Zugecic with having sexual intercourse with RB without consent in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s 61J, that circumstance being that the accused was in company at the time of the offence. A verdict of guilty was returned. 
     
      
    9 All counts in respect of which circumstances of aggravation were pleaded involved Crown allegation that, at the relevant time, the offender was in company. 
     
      
    10 Counts 5 and 6 charged Villar with similar offences contrary to s 61J. On each of those counts verdicts of not guilty were found by direction of the presiding judge. 
     
      
    11 Counts 7, 8, 10, 18, 21 and 24 charged Zugecic with further offences of sexual intercourse with RB without consent in circumstances of aggravation. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on counts 7, 8, 10 and 18. The jury were unable to agree and discharged from bringing in a verdict on count 21. They returned a verdict of not guilty on count 24 by direction of the judge. 
     
      
    12 Counts 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 22 and 25 charged Villar with further offences of sexual intercourse with RB without consent in circumstances of aggravation. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on counts 9, 11, 17 and 22. The jury found a verdict of not guilty on count 16. On counts 15 and 25 the jury returned verdicts of not guilty by direction of the judge. 
     
      
    13 Counts 12, 14, 19 and 20 charged Mitrov with sexual intercourse with RB without consent in circumstances of aggravation. The jury found a verdict of not guilty on count 12. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on count 14 by direction of the judge. On counts 19 and 20 the jury were unable to agree and they were discharged without verdict. 
     
      
    14 Count 13 charged Mitrov with indecent assault upon RB and count 13(a) charged Villar with inciting that offence. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on count 13 and consequently no verdict was taken on count 13(a). 
     
      
    15 Count 23 charged Zugecic with sexual intercourse with RB without consent contrary to s 61I. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on this count.  
     
      
    16 In overview then, Villar and Zugecic were convicted of offences, Mitrov of none. 
     
      
    17 The victim nominated in all counts was the same woman. She had been acquainted with Villar for many years. There was contradiction between them about whether they had engaged in sexual intercourse during a relationship which had existed between them at a previous time. RB had met Zugecic on a few occasions and had spoken to Mitrov on the telephone but had not met him. As a result of some telephone conversation, RB met Villar at a shopping centre and together they proceeded to Zugecic’s house at Warwick Farm. At the house were Zugecic and two other men. Mitrov arrived later. It was suggested that some of them go to Mitrov’s unit which was in Canley Vale. RB and the three men subsequently charged were driven there by a fourth man who stayed there for a time and then left. As is disclosed by the specification of the charges, all the alleged criminal conduct occurred overnight in these premises at Canley Vale.  
     
      
    18 The conduct constituting the counts upon which convictions were entered included penile/vaginal intercourse, fellatio and digital anal penetration.  
     
      
    19 Before turning to the grounds of appeal, some general observations can be made. The counts upon which verdicts of not guilty were directed by the learned presiding judge were not supported by necessary evidence and I have mentioned the reason for no verdict being taken on count 13(a). A pattern of sorts can be discerned in relation to the outcome of the other counts.  
     
      
    20 The jury were not satisfied of the proof of certain offences charged against Mitrov and brought in verdicts of not guilty for some and were unable to agree about others, but no finding of guilt on any count was made against Mitrov. 
     
      
    21 The jury acquitted Villar of offences alleged to have occurred in the main bedroom when only he and RB were present. They found both Villar and Zugecic guilty of offences once the latter had entered the main bedroom and they were in company of each other. The jury found proved offences by Zugecic and Villar after Mitrov entered that room but they were not satisfied of offence by Mitrov.  
     
      
    22 Subsequent to the alleged events giving rise to those charges, RB went to a bathroom where her pubic hair was shaved. Thereafter on return to the main bedroom the jury was satisfied of the proof of offences charged against Villar and Zugecic, but again, not against Mitrov.  
     
      
    23 Later, RB was downstairs (the main bedroom was in an upper level of the unit) and the jury were satisfied of the proof of an offence by Villar in that location but were unable to agree upon an offence charged against Zugecic. In relation to the latter it was alleged that Villar had on this occasion instructed RB to fellate Zugecic. 
     
      
    24 Thereafter, Zugecic was alleged to have taken RB to a second bedroom (also upstairs) where a further offence was committed by him. They were alone at the time of this charged offence although Villar entered the room afterwards. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on this charge. 
     
      
    25 Finally RB was in the main bedroom alone with Mitrov. The jury found Mitrov not guilty of an offence alleged to have occurred there. The evidence demonstrated that they fell asleep on the bed. RB awoke at about 8.30 am. She dressed and left after an affirmative response from Mitrov when she asked him whether she could leave.  
     
      
    26 Thus, findings of guilt against the appellants were significantly made when there was sexual activity in company and I have referred to this as a pattern of sorts, that is to say, convictions followed offences committed in company but acquittals or disagreement when RB and an alleged offender were alone. Count 16 is an exception in that the jury found Villar not guilty of an offence alleged to have been committed in company. 
     
      
    27 This pattern of findings can be discerned to have some correlation with what undoubtedly was a significant evidential resource. On departure from the scene RB went in succession to, and complained to, an ex boyfriend and her ex husband. The latter took her to police and it is obvious that she informed them that a video camera had been used during her ordeal.  
     
      
    28 On 28 May Villar told investigating police that videotaping had been done on a camera owned by Zugecic. Zugecic, when questioned, told police that the relevant tape had been disposed of in a garbage bin. He took police to the bin. The tape was recovered in an unravelled condition. By rewinding into a suitable cassette it was able to be played. The tape not only provides a pictorial record but it is accompanied by an audible sound track.  
     
      
    29 At the hearing of the appeal counsel for each of the appellants expressly submitted that the Bench should view and listen to the video recording (Exhibit A at trial). We have done so. Sexual activity is portrayed in detail. RB is both seen and heard to cry on occasions. Her utterances are poignant. Among other things she can be heard to say: “Gerry (Villar) don’t hit me”; “I’m scared, I don’t want to”; “Sorry, it just hurts, sorry”; and “No, I don’t want to”. At one point she is seen to be struck and to have her hair pulled. The voices of the accused are audible including at one stage Villar saying: “Yeah, you better not stop or I’ll fuckin deck ya”.  
     
      
    30 A powerful demonstration of the criminal conduct of the appellants is available by viewing the video. This appreciation derives from viewing the exhibit and hearing the sound track in its context. 
     
      
    31 A submission by the appellants’ counsel was that viewing the video would undermine the evidence of RB. It was not suggested that the video was an uninterrupted depiction of everything that happened on that night. Attention was directed to discrepancies between the complainant’s oral testimony and events and words recorded by the video. That there is a discrepancy between memory and record is hardly surprising. The posited inconsistencies, even if they be large in number, offer a metaphoric view of trees rather than of a forest. RB’s credibility was a matter for assessment by the jury. It was their function to weigh all the circumstances including matters asserted to be exaggeration, embellishment or invention. A particular example alleged of the lastmentioned was a dispute about threat of a gun. The transcript shows that this matter was appropriately canvassed before the tribunal of fact. Having acceded to counsels’ request to view the exhibit I comment that for my part that viewing did nothing to strengthen the submissions on behalf of the appellants, quite the contrary. 
     
      
    32 The appellants (and Mitrov) were separately represented at trial. Neither counsel who appeared on the appeal had appeared at trial. Whilst there is some coincidence in the grounds of appeal relied upon by each appellant, it will be convenient to deal with them successively. I turn first to those argued on behalf of the appellant Villar. 
     
      
       
      VILLAR 
       
      
    33 Grounds 1 and 2 are in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in law in respect of count 1: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in accepting the jury’s verdict of guilty and entering and recording a conviction. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in directing and/or failing to direct adequately or properly in respect of the elements of the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) in directing and/or failing to direct as to the Crown case. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2 (a) His Honour erred in law in directing and/or failing to direct adequately or properly as to joint enterprise and the elements and evidence in respect thereof. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) His Honour failed to determine whether there was a prima facie case to allow the acts of others to prove the crime.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 The submissions on these grounds were presented in combination by counsel for Villar. 
     
      
    35 As above noted, three accused were charged in count 1 of the indictment. It was the Crown case that those three accused detained RB for their advantage, namely to enable them to perform sexual acts upon her. The jury did not agree upon a verdict concerning Mitrov. 
     
      
    36 The appellant’s first submission was that, as the indictment was “solely joint, the verdict had to be the same for all three accused, i.e. all guilty or all not guilty.” The argument was focussed upon the specification of advantage “to themselves” in distinction from advantage to each of them. The contention that the indictment was solely joint appeared to be based upon this. 
     
      
    37 The indictment is not to be so restrictively construed.  
     
      
    38 In Hale’s Pleas of the Crown (1778) Vol 1 p 46 it is stated “every indictment is as well several and joint.” 
     
      
    39 In Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown 8th Edn (1824) Vol 2 p 331 s 89 it is stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems certain, at this day, that notwithstanding the offence of several persons cannot but in all cases be several, because the offence of one man cannot be the offence of another but every one must answer severally for his own crime, yet if it wholly arise from any such joint act which in itself is criminal … the indictment … may either charge the defendants jointly and severally … or may charge them jointly only, without charging them severally, because it sufficiently appears, from the construction of law, that if they joined in such act, they could but be each of them guilty; and from hence it follows, that on such indictment … some of the defendants may be acquitted, and others convicted;  
        for the law looks on the charge as several against each, though the words of it purport only a joint charge against all. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    40 These statements were cited with approval in DPP v Merriman 1973 AC 584. In that case the House of Lords also noted the correctness of a decision of this Court in R v Fenwick 1953 54 SR (NSW) 147. In Fenwick two persons were charged in one count with rape, it being alleged that they had each raped the same girl when driving her home from a dance. The trial judge told the jury that they might convict the accused for acting in concert or alternatively, individually, whether or not they were acting with a common purpose. A ground of appeal was that it was not open to the jury, if they found an absence of common design, to consider the individual cases of the accused, as separate charges had not been preferred against each of them. Street CJ, noting that the point was technical said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ I think it can be dealt with by an equally technical answer. Indictments are to be read jointly and severally.” 
        
       
      
    41 When the jury question abovementioned was received, Coleman DCJ included in his response a direction (of which he supplied to them a written copy) which concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “You cannot convict any one of the accused unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he participated in one of these ways with one or more of the other accused.” 
        
       
      
    42 These “ways” refer to earlier directions as to how an individual might participate in an offence. No complaint is made about those parts of the direction. 
     
      
    43 His Honour’s direction, by its mention of convicting “any one” of the accused, recognized the possibility that the jury may find differently in respect of individuals. Such a direction was permitted by the indictment and the findings of guilt of two of the three accused was open to the jury. The stance taken by counsel at trial not to object to taking the verdicts on counts against two accused in respect of whom the jury had agreed was correct. 
     
      
    44 The second submission made reference to R v DMC [2002] NSWCCA 513. In that case an issue had arisen as to whether a person went with an accused as a result of instruction (there was a parental relationship) or as a result of fear. It was held that it needed to be proved that the accused’s intention was to hold the other person irrespective of whether she was willing or not and that the jury had to be instructed accordingly. 
     
      
    45 In the present case, in giving the direction discussed in relation to the previous submission, his Honour referred to the requirement of proof that the accused would detain RB “for their advantage, that is, keep her against her will to enable them to perform sexual acts upon her.” In his summing up he had earlier referred to the Crown case that the accused agreed to have RB remain at Mitrov’s unit “for the purpose of sexual gratification of those men, whether or not she consented to that activity.” 
     
      
    46 No application was made to supplement his Honour’s directions in these regards and, in the context of this case and the issues for determination, they were appropriate and adequate. Ground 2 is sufficiently answered by reference to the written supplementary direction to the jury abovementioned. At the hearing of the appeal, it was necessary for the Court to request provision of copies which were supplied by the Crown. It was apparent that counsel for the appellants (as distinct from trial counsel) were not in possession of copies of the document. After production, no criticism of its content was advanced beyond the argument asserting that the indictment was “solely joint.” 
     
      
    47 The content of the document (MFI 43) was: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are 2 elements or ingredients each of which the Crown must prove to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        1. The first is that there was an understanding or agreement in existence between the accused that they would commit a crime: 
         
        a. The agreement or understanding the crown alleges that the accused made was that they would detain RB for their advantage that is keep her against her will to enable them to perform sexual acts upon her. If the accused were to reach such an agreement or understanding it would be an agreement or understanding to commit a crime. 
         
        b. The understanding or agreement need not be express – that is it need not be spoken – and its existence may be inferred from the all the circumstances in the way I have already outlined in paragraph 2 of the earlier written directions on Count 1. 
         
        c. You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was such an agreement or understanding. If you are not so satisfied you must find the accused not guilty. 
         
        d. You only go on to consider the next element or ingredient if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crown has proved this first element or ingredient. 
         
        2. The second is that each of the accused participated in that understanding or agreement by either 
         
        a. Committing the agreed crime or 
         
        b. Being present when the crime is committed knowing that it is being committed or 
         
        c. By intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the agreement or understanding to commit that crime. 
         
        d. You cannot convict any one of the accused unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he participated in one of these ways with one or more of the other accused.” 
        
       
      
    48 It is true that the papers do not appear to show a formal ruling of the type mentioned in Ground 2(b). I express it this way as some parts of the proceedings seem to have been transcribed at different times and are titled “extracts” most of which recommence pagination and interlocutory rulings are indexed accordingly and sequence is not always obvious. The Court was not referred to any formal ruling but it is abundantly clear that there was appropriate evidence of joint enterprise. One need look no further than the evidence of RB and Exhibit A (the video). 
     
      
    49 Grounds 1 and 2 should be rejected. 
     
      
    50 Ground 3 asserts:  
     
      
       
        
        “3. His Honour erred in law in rejecting the admissibility of part of the applicant’s ERISP and the video; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in rejecting cross examination of the complainant as to  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) parts of the ERISP of Zugecic 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) parts of the video 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) parts of the applicant’s ERISP”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    51 This somewhat cryptic and unparticularized expression of the grounds of appeal requires reference to submissions in order to detect what appear to be the appellant’s complaints. 
     
      
    52 On 28 May 2001 Zugecic was interviewed at length by police. At various points of it he claimed that he had seen RB at a brothel some months previously, that when he first met her two years previously he did not think she was in a relationship with Villar because she was a “worker” (prostitute) in a relationship “with everybody”, that until the night of the offences he had not had sex with her and that he had been told by one, Italo Arche, that RB had had sex with more than one partner at the same time. 
     
      
    53 His Honour ruled that those parts of the interview in which Zugecic made those assertions be rejected. This ruling was accepted by Zugecic. He further ruled that parts of an interview by police with Villar in which Villar claimed that RB may have complained of his conduct because he had rejected her overtures towards a relationship on account of his knowledge of her past as a prostitute and other reasons, also be rejected. 
     
      
    54 The submission was that the rejection of both parts of Zugecic’s interview was erroneous and thereby prevented cross examination on behalf of Villar about those matters. 
     
      
    55 What Zugecic said was not an admission by him and it was accepted by him that the statements were inadmissible. They could not change their character as to admissibility at the behest of a co-accused. 
     
      
    56 The gravamen of Villar’s complaint relates to a ruling inhibiting cross examination about four allied propositions. Following the procedure suggested in R v McGarvey 1987 10 NSWLR 632, a written description of the ingredients of proposed cross examination was produced and the subject matter included (the paragraph numbers in the document are adopted): 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Complainant previously told Villar that she previously worked as a prostitute. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The complainant has worked as a prostitute. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Location of the brothel and time frames at which the complainant worked. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) Words by the complainant after the events in Mitrov’s flat “Am I going to be paid for this?” 
        
       
      
    57 It might be mentioned that Villar gave evidence of sexual practices in which he claimed to have engaged with RB in the past, including the use of insulting words by him such as “slut” and “bitch” and “come on you whore”. He had had “group sex” with her and a friend, Italo Arche. Arche was called and gave corroborating evidence of the lastmentioned. He testified that the activity occurred at RB’s suggestion and that she told him that she “loves it rough” and that during the encounter Villar slapped her on the “backside”. 
     
      
    58 Thus, the ultimate effect of the restrictions imposed by his Honour’s rulings were limited to RB’s having allegedly worked in a brothel and an associated remark. His reason was expressed in terms that s 105(2) (now s 293) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was a blanket prohibition against admissibility of evidence of sexual reputation and not subject to exception. He referred to McGarvey (which dealt with the predecessor of s 105(2) namely s 409B of the Crimes Act) as relevant authority. The distinction was sought to be drawn in the case of Villar that the evidence did not relate to sexual reputation but was relevant to Villar’s alleged belief that the complainant was consenting to sexual activity with him. By way of comparison, it was noted that in McGarvey reference was made to the fact that the complainant there may have asked for money but the argument of relevance to honest belief was apparently not advanced. 
     
      
    59 The context of mention of possible payment in McGarvey was as part of a series of consensual sexual encounters conceded by that particular complainant which preceded the occasion accompanied by assault which had become the subject of charge. The case offers no authority for the proposition that a request for money by a complainant is admissible.  
     
      
    60 That the material now canvassed was inadmissible and accordingly not appropriate for cross examination on the basis now contended for is made plain in McGarvey where Hunt J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “……. the argument was ……… the complainant had been prepared to consent to intercourse with twenty men …….. led him to believe that she was consenting to intercourse with him …….”. 
        
       
      
    61 Consensual intercourse with twenty men and prostitution convey comparable matters of repute. Hunt J went on to observe: 
     
      
       
        
        “That, however, is the very sort of evidence that s 409B was designed to exclude ……. the evidence …….. would appear to have been inadmissible on an issue of belief in consent even prior to the introduction of s 409B …….  
        Gregory v The Queen 
         1983 151 CLR 566”. 
        
       
      
    62 Any former admissibility on the issue of credit is plainly the subject now of statutory bar.  
     
      
    63 Ground 3 should be rejected. 
     
      
    64 Ground 4 asserts that: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. His Honour erred in law in directing and failing to direct adequately or properly: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (a) in respect of ‘in company’ 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) the evidence in respect of the elements of ‘in company’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    65 Again, the statement of the ground is bereft of particulars. 
     
      
    66 In support it was put that “no direction was given in respect of counts 11, 17 and 22 as to whether the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Villar was in company of both (Zugecic and Mitrov)”. 
     
      
    67 The learned trial judge expressly directed the jury in respect of thirteen nominated counts (including those mentioned in this submission) that the Crown had to prove the additional element of circumstances of aggravation. He made it abundantly clear what the standard of proof required of the Crown was. He identified the circumstance of aggravation as being in the company of another person and directed that what was required was demonstration that “there is another person who is physically present and who participates in the offence by encouraging or assisting the accused.” 
     
      
    68 Any reference to others being present would be understood in the context of that direction. It was, first, simply incorrect to assert that no direction had been given. Second, the direction may have been unduly favourable to the appellant. In R v Leoni [1999] NSWCCA 14 Kirby J observed that where a victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons, that will be sufficient (to fulfil a circumstance of aggravation) “even if the offender did not, as it happens, intend to physically participate if required.” 
     
      
    69 It was submitted that the failure of the jury to agree upon verdict in respect of Mitrov negatived any proposition that Mitrov acted in concert with Villar and that he was not “in company”. That submission confuses the issue. That a jury may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of an offence by Mitrov does not extinguish his capacity to be relevantly in company at the time when Villar committed an offence.  
     
      
    70 Attention was drawn to the specification in particular counts that Villar was in company of Zugecic and Mitrov in distinction from alleging that he was in company with one or the other. No complaint was made at trial and it could not reasonably be said that the appellant might have misunderstood the case he was being required to meet. It was sufficient to elevate the appellant Villar’s offence to the aggravated form if one other person was present in the relevant sense.  
     
      
    71 Ground 4 should also be rejected.  
     
      
    72 Ground 5 asserts: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. His Honour erred in law in failing to direct adequately and properly in respect of the tendency evidence of the group sexual activity with Arche and the applicant’s previous sexual relationship with the complainant including any consensual sexual activity during the night of the charges.” 
        
       
      
    73 It seems that what is meant by the expression “tendency evidence of the group sexual activity” is the single occasion in which RB was alleged to have been engaged in sexual activity with Villar and Arche about two and half years before 24 May 2001. His Honour permitted that matter to be canvassed before the jury and allowed Mr Arche to give evidence to that effect. It might be mentioned in passing that written submissions on behalf of Villar referred to the tendency rule in s 97 of the Evidence Act. It can be observed that the requirements of that provision, in the context of a criminal trial, do not only apply to notice given by the Crown but whenever evidence of tendency of a person to act in a particular way is desired to be adduced. There was no suggestion that a tendency notice in respect of the evidence of RB had been given. His Honour repeatedly directed the jury that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Villar knew that RB was not consenting and, inter alia, explicitly told them that “the way in which they previously engaged in sexual activities was relevant to the issue of consent so far as Villar was concerned.” It would have been obvious to the jury that his Honour was referring both to the sexual relationship which Villar testified had existed and “the ways” in which it had been consummated including the occasion that an additional partner Mr Arche was engaged.  
     
      
    74 A matter of particular complaint was part of a direction by his Honour in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “…… on the issue of consent ladies and gentlemen, you cannot reason on previous occasions there is evidence that RB consented to sexual intercourse with (Villar), therefore she must have consented on this occasion. That reasoning is not permissible.” 
        
       
      
    75 This followed other directions including mention of “the way in which they (Villar and RB) engaged in sexual activity”. It might be noted that his Honour’s expression there did not refer to the dispute between Villar and RB as to whether any such previous activity had taken place. The jury would have understood the context and realized that his Honour was not directing them to reject RB’s evidence on that matter. 
     
      
    76 By the same token, they would not have understood his Honour to be determining that Villar did not have a belief of consent. After the passage to which attention was directed, further directions canvassed issues including Villar’s evidence that RB had previously come to him, undressed and engaged in sexual activity without speaking and that, given that experience, it was Villar’s contention that it should not be found that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that on the occasions charged he knew that RB was not consenting.  
     
      
    77 The passage complained of says no more than that simply because sexual intercourse may have occurred by consent on other occasions it does not necessarily prove that on the occasions charged there was also consent. There was no unfairness to the appellant Villar in stating what was obviously correct.  
     
      
    78 Another aspect raised under this ground was a contention that the jury should have been directed that, if they found in respect of some counts charged that there had been consensual sexual activity, then such findings should be taken into account both when considering whether there was consent on the other occasions and in relation to Villar’s belief regarding consent on those occasions.  
     
      
    79 The jury received conventional direction about the need to consider each count separately. In addition, they were instructed that the credibility of RB was essential to the proof of any count, although they were also told, correctly, that they could accept parts of what a witness (including the complainant) said and reject other parts. 
     
      
    80 In regard to the lastmentioned it has been declared desirable that some reference ought be made to the effect upon the assessment of credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept her evidence in respect of any count. The form and terminology of any such direction is a matter for a trial judge in the particular circumstances of a specific case: R v Markuleski 2001 52 NSWLR 82. 
     
      
    81 No direction was sought. The failure to give unrequested directions did not cause the trial to miscarry.  
     
      
    82 Ground 6 asserts that: 
     
      
       
        
        “6. His Honour erred in law in directing that consciousness of guilt applied in respect of the (attempted) destruction of parts of the video.” 
        
       
      
    83 I have already made some comment about the potential for incrimination derivable from viewing the video.  
     
      
    84 Again there are no particulars identifying the precise complaints this ground is intended to express but argument seemed to reveal these assertions: 
     
      
      (a) at one point in the summing up, his Honour erroneously referred to the evidence of Zugecic when he was recapitulating evidence given by Villar, 
       
      (b) his Honour did not expressly refer to denials of intention to conceal guilt which had been made by Villar, 
       
      (c) there was reference to reasons for “a lie”, and 
       
       
      (d) the video might have been taken for sexual gratification by the appellant and destroyed by Zugecic without Villar’s agreement. 
       
      
    85 His Honour separately dealt with the Crown’s arguments in support of assertion that action concerning the video exhibited a consciousness of guilt on the parts of Villar and Zugecic respectively. Referring to Villar he read to the jury part of the text of transcript of his evidence, only some of which I need for present purposes to reproduce: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Yes what did you do? 
         
        A. We watched the movie. It (sic) think we watched it and then we threw it away. 
         
        Q. So you watched this movie that had been made of what happened that night? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. And then you threw it away? 
         
        A. Yes we disposed of it.” 
        
       
      
    86 His Honour’s directions continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen the Crown Prosecutor put to you that the disposal of the tape or the attempted disposal of the tape showed a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused Mr Villar and the accused Mr Zugecic in that they realised that if the video tape was found the truth would come out about what they did. That is about the lack of consent on the part of Ms (RB). Ladies and gentlemen I should give you a direction concerning that. 
        
       
       
        
        First of all ladies and gentlemen you must be clear on precisely what it is that the Crown says illustrates the consciousness of guilt and the Crown says that the act which illustrates the consciousness of guilt is the destruction or attempted destruction of the video tape and it must be shown ladies and gentlemen that that relates to a material issue in the case. It is not enough the tape was destroyed or there was an attempt made to destroy the tape. It must be shown that that related to a material issue in the case. The Crown says that the material issue to which it relates is the issue of consent. That the images shown on the tape would indicate that (RB) was not consenting and that the acts that took place on that night were not consensual. 
        
       
       
        
        Before you can take that material into account you must first be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an attempt to destroy the tape. Secondly that it related to a material issue in the case and reveal a knowledge of the offence charged and that the accused did it because he knew that the truth about the images which were shown on the tape would implicate him in the offence charged. Or to put it another way because of a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. 
        
       
       
        
        I emphasize to you that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what was in his mind was guilt of the offence charged and not some other crime. You must remember however ladies and gentlemen that people don’t always act rationally and that conduct of this sort may sometimes be explained in other ways. There may be reasons for disposing of the tape quite apart from a realisation of guilt. It may have been done ladies and gentlemen as has been suggested to you for example by (counsel) because after viewing the tape the persons who had participated in the acts on the tape realised there was something they didn’t want to keep. That there was something they didn’t want to have left lying around in the future. It might be something the children might come across. It was something that they were perhaps not willing to keep once they had looked at it and realised precisely what it was that the tape showed. 
        
       
       
        
        If you think that there is a reasonable possibility that it was thrown away or attempted to be disposed of and thrown away for that purpose then you cannot use the circumstances in which the tape was disposed of for the purpose of establishing a consciousness of guilt. 
        
       
       
        
        I remind you ladies and gentlemen that there may be matters quite unrelated to a consciousness of guilt as has been put to you by (counsel) which do not relate to consciousness of guilt but relate to a realisation that what is contained on the tape is perhaps not very savoury and not worth keeping and not something which one would like to have about and be discovered by people who might come across it and be related to or connected to the accused in some way.” 
        
       
      
    87 These directions were not erroneous and posed the issues for the jury fairly to both the prosecution and the then accused. The complaints which I have summarized in (b) and (d) above are answered by the text of this extract from his Honour’s directions. It is true that there was no specific reference to Villar’s denial. None was sought and it can be inferred that those who could gauge the atmosphere of the trial were content with this balanced posing of the issue.  
     
      
    88 The summing up extended over more than one day and on the following day after giving these directions, his Honour turned specifically to the case concerning Zugecic and the Crown contention of his consciousness of guilt in attempting to dispose of the video tape. His Honour said that he would take the jury to the evidence relied upon and he introduced this by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Zugecic was asked this question”. 
        
       
       
      He then read the whole of the extract of evidence of Villar which he had read the previous day, from which I have extracted several questions and answers. The reference to Mr Zugecic’s evidence was plainly a slip of the tongue. The jury were well aware that Villar was the only one of the three accused who elected to give evidence and they would also have recognized the extract of transcript which had been read to them the previous day. Neither counsel for Villar nor counsel for Zugecic asked for correction. This slip does not attract intervention by this Court. 
       
      
    89 Different considerations may give rise to a prosecution allegation that a consciousness of guilt has been manifested. The commonest instance is probably the telling of lies but other examples are attempted bribery of witnesses, flight or, as in this case, attempted destruction of evidence. 
     
      
    90 The directions to be given in all of such cases are similar and, of greatest importance, similar cautions must be given specifying restraints which the jury must apply in deliberating upon such a Crown submission. In this case these cautions were appropriately and amply given, however, in giving them on the second occasion, mainly in relation to Zugecic, his Honour mentioned “a lie” possibly being told for reasons apart from a realisation of guilt. He gave examples of such explanations being out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence related to the offence. As the substance of the direction had made clear, the Crown was relying upon an attempted destruction of the video evidence and not upon the telling of any lie. The jury would have understood from express statements that what was being dealt with was that alleged attempt at destruction and not some unspecified lie. Again, this apparent slip was not the subject of any request for correction. What was said, although referring to a mistaken example of a possible foundation for consciousness of guilt, was not an expression directed towards inculpation of Villar or Zugecic.  
     
      
    91 I would reject ground 6. 
     
      
    92 Ground 7 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “7. The verdicts of the jury were inconsistent and/or unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence being also unsafe and unsatisfactory giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    93 The submissions in support of this ground commence by reciting findings by the trial judge which he made for the purpose of sentence. Some of these findings were contrary to RB’s testimony. It is submitted that “these findings meant that the complainant deliberately lied” about various matters.  
     
      
    94 The ground attacks the integrity of the jury verdicts and his Honour’s findings on sentence are not germane to them. This can be demonstrated by selecting one example. His Honour was satisfied that consensual intercourse took place on an occasion when Villar and RB were alone. Reference was made in written submissions to the acquittals by the jury on counts 2, 3 and 11 (the last is probably intended to be reference to count 16) and it was put that there was “no doubt that she was not believed on her oath on those counts.” This does not follow. It may very well have been doubt about proof of the knowledge of Villar that she was not at the time consenting which gave rise to the acquittals.  
     
      
    95 As I have indicated, his Honour’s finding for the purposes of sentence is irrelevant to examination of the verdicts. As was remarked in Cheung v The Queen 2001 209 CLR 1 (per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ @ 10): 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury’s verdict decided the issues joined by the plea to the indictment. It did not decide, either expressly or by implication, all facts of possible relevance to sentencing.” 
        
       
      
    96 The issue raised by this ground is whether the jury verdicts should be sustained. It was expressly submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be essential to view the video and transcript of the video (without deletions) in order to assist in assessing the evidence of the complainant.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    97 It was conceded at the hearing of the appeal that there had been no “deletions” by the Crown. The exhibit consisted of the entirety of what was salvaged from the attempted disposal of it. 
     
      
    98 I have already noted that the Court accepted this invitation to view (and hear the sound track) of the video. That exercise was more convincing of the soundness of the verdicts of guilty than provoking doubt about them. The implication that consensual sexual activity was portrayed is somewhat negatived by the description given by RB on the evening of 25 May 2001 to Dr Cooper at Liverpool Hospital. She described fellating Villar and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was telling me to enjoy it. He said he was going to kill me and beat the shit out of me if I didn’t act like I enjoyed it.” 
        
       
      
    99 This statement to Dr Cooper bears comparison with excerpts from the sound track of the video, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “Villar: Get into it, don’t be shy fuckin enjoy it. 
         
         RB: But I am not enjoying it. 
         
        Villar: That’s right. 
         
         RB: Just be gentle, that’s all. Is that alright. 
         
        (inaudible) 
         
         RB: Gerry (Villar), please don’t hit me.” 
        
       
      
    100 It is a reasonable inference that the last utterance was a response to something which was not audibly reproduced from the sound track. The exchange has a telling consistency with the history given to Dr Cooper. The verdicts of the jury were neither unreasonable nor unsupported by the evidence and this ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
       ZUGECIC 
       
      
    101 Grounds 1 to 4 on behalf of Zugecic were argued together. They were expressed: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned trial judge erred in admitted (sic) evidence of ‘relationship’ or ‘context’ evidence without requiring the Crown to specifically distinguish such evidence from evidence of charged acts of sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The learned trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it could not use evidence of uncharged acts as tendency or propensity. 
        
       
       
        
        3. (i) The learned trial judge erred in failing to specifically identify to the jury which acts were charged and which were not charged; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Alternatively, the learned trial judge erred in allowing the jury to determine which acts were charged and which acts were not charged. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. The trial miscarried as a result of the Crown: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) failing to lead sufficient or any evidence to distinguish between charged and uncharged acts of sexual intercourse; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) failing to lead any evidence from the complainant in relation to the specific sexual acts depicted in the video.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    102 The submissions referred to the content of the video. It was tendered after RB was asked to confirm that she had viewed it (when asked to do so by police) and that she identified herself and the three accused as portrayed in it. The video was received into evidence and played to the jury without objection by defence counsel. She was not led in chief through the various depictions of sexual activity but she was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you want any of that activity that you saw on the video, did you want it to take place, want it to happen? 
        
       
       
        
         A. No I did not, no I didn’t.” 
        
       
      
    103 It is common ground that the video includes filming of sexual activity between RB and the appellants (and Mitrov) which was not the subject of any charge in the indictment. His Honour drew this to the attention of the jury and cautioned them that the use that could be made of such was to place the offences which were charged into “their true context and to provide continuity and a chronology of events, in the sequence in which the Crown alleges they took place.” 
     
      
    104 In this instance it is significant to note that all these events, whether relating to charged or uncharged conduct, occurred on a single night within the same premises. The contentions specified in these grounds seek to dissect the activities in a way which was not sought to be done at trial. It is submitted that a direction should have been given that the evidence of uncharged acts could not be used as elements in a chain of proof of the offences charged: BRS v The Queen 1997 191 CLR 275. 
     
      
    105 The cases being presented by the accused were in each case that although sexual activity occurred, RB was a consenting party or, at least, each of them believed that she was consenting. There is a different contention about one occasion testified to by Villar but that dispute does not affect the argument concerning the ground. The existence of onus of proof is not to the point when perceiving that it would be a curious tactic for the defence in such circumstances to seek a direction of the type now canvassed which would highlight the uncharged activity. As stated, no direction was sought and the consequence of highlighting was thus avoided. 
     
      
    106 That the jury did not approach its task by considering the evidence in some global fashion is confirmed by the discrimination manifest between charges which they found proved and those which they did not.  
     
      
    107 The directions given by the trial judge were appropriate to the circumstances. 
     
      
    108 Ground 5 contended that: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. Verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 18 are unreasonable and cannot be supported on the whole of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    109 Zugecic did not give evidence and the argument in support of this ground is necessarily based upon criticism of the Crown evidence. It is submitted that although RB’s evidence “could not be said to lack credibility by reason of the manner in which it was given” it contained discrepancies, inadequacies and a lack of probative force sufficient to lead to a conclusion that there was a significant possibility that Zugecic was not guilty. 
     
      
    110 In support of this, attention was directed to several matters which were capable of being relevant to assessment of RB’s credit. She had a backpack containing, inter alia, clothing, because she said she had arranged to stay at the house of a former boyfriend Mr Lipman, overnight. Mr Lipman denied this arrangement. This was a peripheral matter and weight, if any, was peculiarly a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    111 The acquittals of Villar on counts 2 and 3 were claimed thereby to have damaged the complainant’s credibility on all counts. I have mentioned elsewhere that the reasons for the jury’s finding may well have been based upon doubt about proof of the state of mind of individual accused concerning consent at particular times. The acquittals do not convey inherent rejection of RB’s testimony. 
     
      
    112 The next topic addressed was the circumstances in which RB’s clothes came to be removed. She testified at different times that Villar took them off or that she took them off because he told her (forcefully) so to do. Reference was then made to her testimony that threats were accompanied by the mention of a gun. The submission continued by pointing out inconsistencies between RB’s oral evidence and what were said to be “obvious” depictions on the video. Other testimony which was said to be inconsistent or embellishment was also identified. 
     
      
    113 The ultimate submission was that it should be concluded that RB was being deliberately untruthful in denying activities which were inconsistent with “her general version of violence, threats and being pinned down”, that matters such as the mention of the gun were likely fabrications and that “on all of the evidence, the complainant’s version does not ring true.”  
     
      
    114 Such a conclusion is not conveyed. It is not known, for example, for what reason the jury found verdicts of not guilty on counts 2 and 3 but let it be assumed that they were satisfied that consensual sexual activity was involved (ignoring the issue of onus). The jury may nevertheless have been otherwise satisfied that many of the multiple subsequent sexual assaults by the appellants were undertaken by them with an attitude that they could do as they pleased towards her after initial consensual activity. It was well open to them to find that in such a circumstance the appellants well knew that she was no longer consenting to these multiple acts. It can be reiterated that the ultimate findings (including occasions when agreement could not be reached) offer a significant demonstration that the jury conscientiously adhered to his Honour’s instruction to consider each count separately. 
     
      
    115 There was abundant evidence of the occurrence of sexual activity and the verdicts of guilty in respect of some of them were not in the overall context of the evidence unreasonable. The jury had the advantage of seeing and assessing the complainant and judging her responses to the matters of criticism then, and now again, advanced. His Honour had emphasized the necessity for this jury to accept her testimony on the appropriate essential ingredients of charges. These grounds are not sustained. 
     
      
    116 Ground 6 asserts: 
     
      
       
        
        “6. (i) The trial miscarried by reason of the Crown Prosecutor’s comments on the failure of the appellant to give evidence. 
         
         (ii) The learned trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury after the Crown Prosecutor made such comments.” 
         
        
       
      
    117 The ground in substance contends that the Crown Prosecutor contravened s 20(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 in his closing address. The relevant part of that provision reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on the failure of the defendant to give evidence.” 
        
       
      
    118 The terms of prohibition applicable to the prosecutor are unqualified. The matter complained of is contained within this extract from the transcript of the address: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen, I now move to the defence case and the evidence of Mr Villar, and his record of interview. The first thing that I must tell you, and it’s most important, Mr Villar did not have to give evidence in this trial. Mr Villar does not have to prove his innocence. He and each of the other accused are presumed innocent, unless and until  
        they 
         are proven to be guilty.  
        They 
         don’t have to prove anything in this trial, and  
        they 
         don’t have to give evidence and Mr Villar didn’t have to give evidence. Indeed, his Honour will tell you that you cannot draw any adverse inference about an accused person if they don’t give evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        But once an accused person steps into the witness box and gives evidence, you are entitled to assess that person, as you would any other witness. That is, to assess whether they’re telling you the truth, whether they’re reliable, in precisely the same way you treat any other witness.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    119 Application was made to discharge the jury on the basis of this comment. His Honour held that the remarks, considered in their context, did amount to a comment of the failure of Zugecic and Mitrov to give evidence. His Honour’s conclusion was correct and I reject the submission by the Crown that the references to “they” were to “theoretical others.” The situation is comparable to the prohibition against comment that a person has refrained from giving evidence which was provided by the Accused Persons Evidence Act 1898 about which Isaacs J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, however, reference, direct or indirect, and either by express words or the most subtle allusion, and however much wrapped up is made to the fact that the prisoner had the power or the right to give evidence on oath, and yet failed to give ……. evidence …. there would be a contravention……” (of the provision):  
        Bataillard v The King 
         1907 4 CLR 1282. 
        
       
      
    120 Nonetheless, his Honour refused the application to discharge the jury. It should be noted that on the day previous to that upon which the Crown Prosecutor made the impugned remark the jury had submitted questions which included that they would “like to know why the other two accused did not testify.” His Honour responded that it was not appropriate at that point to answer the question but that he would deal with the matter in the summing up. He did so and it is apt to recapitulate the terms in which he did: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is one other important direction I should give you at this point ladies and gentlemen and that relates to the way in which you deal with the election by the accused, Mr Kristijan Zugecic and Mr Tome Hadzi-Mitrov, to rely upon their ERISP’s and not to give evidence. You must only take into account the directions that I am now giving you in relation to those matters. In particular, you should ignore any comments made in the course of this trial and in particular in his address by the Crown Prosecutor in relation to Mr Villar giving evidence on oath. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused Kristijan Zugecic and Tome Hadzi-Mitrov did not give any explanation of themselves in evidence in respect of the Crown case. Instead, they chose to rely upon the material that was contained in the ERISP. The accused was not bound to give evidence and there may have been many reasons why he did so and you must not speculate about those reasons. It is for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and you must not draw any inference from the accused not having given evidence. There may be reasons unknown to you why an accused person if otherwise in a position to contradict or explain evidence remains silent. 
        
       
       
        
        There are a number of important directions of law which I must give you in relation to that. An accused person may always by himself or by calling evidence make a response to the case presented by the Crown in the way of an explanation for the whole or parts of the Crown’s case. But there is no obligation to do so. As I have already pointed out, the Crown bears the obligation and onus of satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence charged. The accused bears no onus. He is presumed to be innocent until you have been satisfied by the Crown that he is guilty. Although the accused may give evidence in relation to the whole or any part of the Crown’s case by way of explanation for it, or by way of additional matters which he may raise, as Mr Gerardo Villar did, he may equally elect to give no explanation or call any evidence in that regard. He is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove his guilt. I repeat. There may have been many reasons why the accused did not give evidence and you must not speculate about those reasons and must not drawn (sic) any adverse inference from the accused not having given evidence or in fact any inference at all. 
        
       
       
        
        I direct you as a matter of law that the accused’s silence in court is not evidence against the accused and you must not draw any inference adverse to the accused because he has not given evidence in Court. His election not to give evidence must not be used by you to fill up gaps in the Crown case or to make up what you regard as deficiencies or defects in the Crown case. The election of an accused not to give evidence must not be regarded by you as any indication that he is guilty or that he believes himself to be guilty of the offence. As I remind you again ladies and gentlemen that you must not draw any inference adverse to the accused because he has exercised that right.” 
        
       
      
    121 There had been no suggestion that the Crown Prosecutor deliberately infringed the statutory bar, indeed he argued unsuccessfully that he had not done so. The issue to be dealt with by his Honour was whether the jury should be discharged. He concluded that he should not so order and that the matter could be redressed by giving the direction which I have recited. 
     
      
    122 The situation is within the category of inadvertent events which occur during a trial. The joint judgment (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) in Crofts v The Queen 1996 186 CLR 427 @ 440-441 articulates the approach that should be taken: 
     
      
       
        
        “No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable?” 
        
       
      
    123 The present matter turns upon the capacity of the appellant Zugecic to have given evidence. As Villar had done so it was obvious to the jury that he could. The comment by the Crown Prosecutor added nothing to the jury’s store of knowledge which was potentially prejudicial to Zugecic. The emphatic direction by the trial judge removed any prospect of practical prejudice to Zugecic even if this were to be hypothesized. The comment by the Crown Prosecutor did not contribute to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    124 Although, as his Honour found, the point might be decided in favour of the appellant in the sense that there was a “breach of s 20”, the appeal founded on this ground should be rejected by this Court in accordance with the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    125 An additional ground of appeal was advanced at the hearing on behalf of Zugecic complaining of the rejection by his Honour of cross examination of RB and a statement asserted to have been made by her to the effect, “Am I going to get paid for this?” The issue was raised by Villar in his appeal (Ground 3). I will refer to some further detail. 
     
      
    126 For the purpose of ruling his Honour had a statement by RB made about three months prior to trial (supplementary to an earlier statement) in which she revealed that on two occasions about five years prior to the night during which the offences were alleged to have been committed she worked in a brothel. She stated that she came forward with this information because she had recalled telling Villar this. The other material was that in his police interview on 28 May 2001 Zugecic said that he had on one occasion some two to four months beforehand seen RB in a brothel at Liverpool. He described her at one point as working there. His contact was limited to observation of her presence and he did not have sexual relations with her. He said that he had made other visits to that brothel but had not seen RB there on those occasions. 
     
      
    127 The argument involves consideration of the application of provisions of s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (at the time of trial s 105 and formerly s 409B of the Crimes Act 1900).  
     
      
    128 The legislation, I have already noted, expressly makes evidence of sexual reputation inadmissible. In McGarvey (supra) Hunt J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crimes Act 1900, s 409B (2), makes inadmissible any evidence relating to the complainant’s sexual reputation. It is a blanket prohibition, and it is not subject to any exceptions. Before the section was introduced in 1981, evidence was usually permitted that the complainant had a reputation for promiscuity as the basis for an assertion by the accused that, because he knew of that reputation, he honestly believed that she was consenting to intercourse with him.” 
        
       
      
    129 The first proposition argued on behalf of Zugecic is that the remark “Am I going to get paid for this?” is not evidence of sexual reputation but evidence upon the issue of whether RB did in fact consent to the sexual acts which took place. 
     
      
    130 The remark, if made, suggests that RB was a person who would provide sexual services for payment. Such a person is a reputed prostitute. The remark relates to sexual reputation and is therefore inadmissible. 
     
      
    131 The alternative argument is that the remark is comprehended with an exclusion specified in s 293(4)(a). The evidence of what RB told Villar (and the facts) about two events five years previously and the observation by Zugecic claimed in his interview do not assist. These matters are far less significant than, for example, convictions for prostitution but such have been held to be inadmissible where they occurred months before alleged offences: R v Berrigan, unreported NSWCCA 7 October 1994.  
     
      
    132 The Crown has pointed out that there is no material suggesting that the remark was made and it remains an allegation, and one which does not appear in the lengthy interviews by police with any of the then accused. However, the question raised is whether, if made, it is “of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances” in which the offences were committed.  
     
      
    133 As the remark was said to have been made after the events it could not have operated on the minds of the appellants to induce a belief in them that RB was at the time consenting to activity. Thus, the assertion must be that it is relevant to actual consent. 
     
      
    134 The document (MFI 2) submitted on behalf of the then accused to the trial judge under the title “Detailed Written Statement of the Nature and Scope of the Evidence Sought to be Adduced” revealed no more than: 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainant said the words to the effect ‘am I going to get paid for this?’ after the alleged incident.” 
        
       
      
    135 To whom it was alleged to have been said and in what circumstances was not detailed. It would appear that the matter was argued at trial “on principle”. It was not suggested that Zugecic wished to advance a case that he believed that RB came to Mitrov’s unit for prostitution. The scant information available fails to demonstrate tangible probative value in support of contention that RB consented to what was happening and the ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    136 The appeals against conviction should be dismissed. Each appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. As with the conviction appeals, it will be convenient to deal with the arguments separately advanced, but there are a number of common features which will not require repetition. It will be necessary to examine the structure of sentences but the ultimate result was in the case of Villar, imprisonment for seventeen years with a non parole period of ten years and, in the case of Zugecic, imprisonment for sixteen years with a non parole period of ten years.  
     
      
       
      VILLAR 
       
      
    137 Villar had a minor antecedent record for taking and driving a conveyance (in 1987) in respect of which he kept a recognizance to be of good behaviour and in 2002 (subsequent to the current offences) a fine for being in possession of a prohibited drug. His Honour found that this record did not disentitle the appellant to leniency and that finding should be endorsed.  
     
      
    138 The five counts upon which Villar was convicted charged detaining for advantage (count 1) and four counts of aggravated sexual assault (counts 9, 11, 17 and 22).  
     
      
    139 The first acts of intercourse between Villar and RB on the night in question occurred when they were alone in an upstairs bedroom. Verdicts of not guilty were found by the jury in respect of these occurrences (counts 2 and 3). The finding of the judge for the purpose of sentence was expressly that these acts were consensual and this is distinguishable from acquittals which may be based upon failure to prove knowledge that the victim was not in fact consenting. 
     
      
    140 His Honour also found, contrary to the evidence of RB, that the previous relationship between Villar and RB did include participation in sexual activity. This included as well the one occasion of “group sex” involving the witness Arche. He concluded that the latter offered some explanation for RB going upstairs to the bedroom with Villar whilst other men were in the unit. 
     
      
    141 In relation to count 1 his Honour found that Villar and Zugecic agreed upon the detention of RB after the consensual sexual intercourse between Villar and RB in the bedroom, and, it necessarily finished some time before RB awoke from sleep in the company of Mitrov. So far as it may be relevant, she received assent from Mitrov to her enquiry as to whether she could leave and she in fact left the premises. 
     
      
    142 The facts giving rise to count 9 were that, after an occasion when RB had fellated Zugecic, Villar inserted his finger in her anus. Count 11 was a similar act after Mitrov had entered the room and was fellated by RB. His Honour found that the acquittal of Mitrov on a charge relating to that event was based upon absence of knowledge on the part of Mitrov that RB was not consenting. 
     
      
    143 Later, after the shaving of RB’s pubic hair (by Mitrov) Villar had penile/vaginal intercourse with RB positioning her differently on two occasions, hurting her, causing her to cry and striking her face and pulling her hair when she asked to get off the bed (count 17). 
     
      
    144 Count 22 involved another act of penile/vaginal intercourse still later but downstairs on a two seater lounge. 
     
      
    145 The appellants were taken into custody when the jury verdicts were returned on 15 October 2002. On counts 9 and 11 (the digital penetrations) Villar was sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment of three years to be served concurrently commencing on 15 October 2002; on count 22 (the second act of penile/vaginal intercourse) to a fixed term of seven years commencing on 15 October 2003; on count 1 (the detention) to a fixed term of five years commencing on 15 October 2003, and on count 17 (the first act of penile/vaginal intercourse which was accompanied by violence and marked distress of RB) to fifteen years imprisonment with a non parole period of eight years commencing on 15 October 2004.  
     
      
    146 The maximum prescribed penalty for the offences of aggravated sexual assault was twenty years imprisonment. The prescribed maximum for the offence charged as count 1 was also twenty years imprisonment unless it be proved to the satisfaction of the judge that the victim was liberated without sustaining any substantial injury, in which case the prescribed maximum reduces to fourteen years imprisonment. It is argued on behalf of both appellants that the latter maximum was applicable in this case. 
     
      
    147 In the context of the section (then s 90A of the Crimes Act), “substantial injury” means more than minor or slight injury but it need not be of a serious kind which would constitute it as grievous bodily harm: R v Rowe 1996 89 A Crim R 467.  
     
      
    148 The learned sentencing judge turned his attention to this issue and expressed himself satisfied that RB suffered substantial injury with particular reference to medical evidence of bruising to the thigh and small anal tears, to which were added indications of residual psychiatric condition. As the terms of s 90A make clear, it is for the offender to demonstrate that the victim was liberated without substantial injury in order to make the reduced maximum penalty applicable. It is perceptible that his Honour approached the matter unduly favourably towards the appellant. In any event, there is no demonstrated error in his Honour’s conclusion. 
     
      
    149 It was submitted that the sentence on count 17 in particular was manifestly excessive and that the overall criminality of the offences was sufficiently reflected in the sentence on that count. The latter submission involved no concession that the assessment of fifteen years head sentence was appropriate. 
     
      
    150 The reason given by his Honour for the partial cumulative sentences was a need to reflect the total criminality involved. This is, of course, a principled objective. However, I have some difficulty in concluding that as having been appropriately achieved in this case. 
     
      
    151 It is true, as his Honour observed, that the offences were in a sense episodic but it was a single outbreak of criminality over one night and at one location. It is an extremely unusual feature that the forced acts of sexual aggression followed almost immediately upon what his Honour had found to be consensual intercourse. That circumstance did not expose RB to being used by the appellants for sexual gratification in whatever way they chose.  
     
      
    152 There was a considerable subjective case available to Villar. Mention should be made that he was himself a victim of a previous serious assault and his Honour expressly accepted evidence in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “He appears to have no history of violent offending but has been a victim of violence himself. He has serious mental health problems that need further assessment and ongoing treatment, including PTSD, depression and possibly a low average intelligence complicated by head injuries.” 
        
       
      
    153 His Honour adverted to this evidence in the context of difficulties that Villar had in adjusting to custody and in rejecting his condition as a mitigating factor or providing any justification or excuse for his actions on this night. In the remarks on sentence he observed general deterrence and public denunciation were of “primary importance” in sentencing for offences such as these. He did not advert to whether Villar was a suitable vehicle for manifesting general deterrence in the light of the “serious mental health problems” which he found were relevantly present: R v Scognamiglio 1991 56 A Crim R 81. 
     
      
    154 As earlier noted, the appellant’s record did not disentitle him to leniency but his Honour was entitled to find that the grave objective circumstances were not significantly diminished by subjective considerations. 
     
      
    155 I would affirm the principle that the past history of the victim, particularly reference to her having engaged in prostitution (which in this case was minor in the extreme) was irrelevant and that all citizens are entitled to equal protection under the law: R v Leary, unreported NSWCCA 8 October 1993. I also affirm his Honour’s view that these offences were extremely serious (although not in worst case category) but it should also be added that the appellant was not himself in the worst category of offender.  
     
      
    156 Taking all matters into account and giving due respect to his Honour’s experience as a sentencing judge, I have concluded that the effective sentence of seventeen years imprisonment with a non parole period of ten years is excessive and resentence should be undertaken. In coming to this conclusion I have regard to the statistical pattern available from the published collections of the Judicial Commission.  
     
      
    157 It is difficult to conceive an appropriate basis for the structure of sentence which results in a potential for an appellant to be on parole for seven years of a seventeen year sentence. That is particularly so in the circumstances of this offender. 
     
      
    158 As observed at the beginning of this judgment, the whole of the criminal activity of the appellants took place as a sequence of events in the one place on the one night against one victim. Whilst the seriousness of individual offences varied and was escalated by repetition of criminal conduct, these matters will be adequately reflected in the sentences now proposed. 
     
      
    159 I am unpersuaded that, by reason of special circumstances there should be alteration of the setting of a non parole period in accordance with the proportion mentioned in the applicable statute. 
     
      
      ZUGECIC 
       
      
    160 Zugecic had a minor antecedent record of being fined in 1996 and 2000 for possession of prohibited drugs. His Honour found that this record did not disentitle him to leniency and I would endorse that finding.  
     
      
    161 The six counts upon which Zugecic was convicted charged detaining for advantage (count 1) and aggravated sexual assault (counts 4, 7, 8, 10 and 18). 
     
      
    162 After Villar and RB engaged in consensual intercourse in the bedroom (as found by his Honour) Zugecic entered and forced RB to fellate him (count 4) and later placed his finger in her anus (count 7). Villar had done likewise and then Zugecic engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse with her (count 8). By this time Mitrov had come into the room and whilst he and RB were engaged in sexual activity, Zugecic again digitally penetrated RB’s anus (count 10). Villar was also present at this time. After RB returned from the bathroom where the shaving had taken place, Zugecic again had penile/vaginal intercourse with her (in succession to Villar) and in the presence of both Mitrov and Villar (count 18). 
     
      
    163 The maximum prescribed sentences were the same as I have recited in relation to Villar’s offences. For the reasons that I have given, I reject the submission also made on behalf of Zugecic that the applicable prescribed maximum for the offence in count 1 was fourteen years imprisonment. I need not repeat my references to a number of circumstances which I made when dealing with Villar. Zugecic’s first offence did not have the unusual aspect of following immediately upon acts of consensual intercourse as was the case with Villar. As the agreement to detain was found by his Honour to have followed these consensual acts (a finding which was not challenged) it is a consequence that Zugecic’s first crime must have come close to coinciding with the making of that agreement. It is also observed that Zugecic was convicted of five counts of aggravated sexual assault in distinction from four counts of such offence in the case of Villar. However, Zugecic was about six years younger than Villar and it is fairly plain that RB’s long term acquaintance and history of relationship with Villar must have been a significant factor in RB’s decision to accompany these men to Mitrov’s flat. His Honour had found that it was an adverse matter affecting Villar that he was, in a sense, breaching the trust that she had in him. 
     
      
    164 Zugecic was also taken into custody on 15 October 2002. He was sentenced to fixed terms of three years imprisonment commencing on 15 October 2002 to be served concurrently for the acts of digital penetration (counts 7 and 10). On counts 4 and 8 (fellatio penile/vaginal intercourse in the bedroom before the shaving incident) he was sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment for seven years to commence on 15 October 2003. On count 1 (detention) he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for five years to commence on 15 October 2003 and on count 18 (the final act of sexual intercourse by Zugecic which took place in the bedroom) to imprisonment for fourteen years to commence on 15 October 2004 with a non parole period of eight years commencing on that date and expiring on 14 October 2012. 
     
      
    165 The longest sentence was for the act which followed the offence by Villar which was accompanied by Villar striking RB, but the evidence did not reveal similar behaviour by Zugecic. It can also be observed that Zugecic’s offences of aggravated sexual assault, although greater in number, were all committed in the bedroom and within a more compacted span of time than in the case of Villar, whose final assault occurred downstairs later. The basis for concurrency of sentence for a unified outbreak of criminal conduct is stronger in Zugecic’s case in my opinion than in the case of Villar. 
     
      
    166 While Zugecic’s relatively insignificant record does not disentitle him to leniency he does not suffer from the handicaps of the latter particularly “serious mental health problems.” 
     
      
    167 For coordinate reasons with that which I have expressed in relation to Villar, I consider that a case has been made out for intervention by this Court in respect of sentence. Although there are differences, I am of opinion that the criminality of each offender is such that it would be appropriate that they receive terms which will, as a matter of practicality, be effectively equivalent. 
     
      
    168 As is the case with Villar, I am unpersuaded to find that special circumstances lead to alteration of the proportion mentioned in the statute when setting a non parole period. 
     
      
      ORDERS 
      
    169 In each appeal, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.  
     
      
    170 I would grant Villar leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal, quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and in lieu thereof sentence him as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Counts 9 and 11. To terms of three years imprisonment to commence on 15 October 2002 and to expire on 14 October 2005, to be served concurrently. 
       
       
      (b) Count 22. To a term of seven years imprisonment to commence on 15 October 2002 and to expire on 14 October 2009. 
       
       
      (c) Count 1. To a term of five years imprisonment to commence on 15 October 2002 and to expire on 14 October 2007. 
       
       
      (d) Count 17. To imprisonment for twelve years to commence on 15 October 2002 with a non parole period of nine years commencing on 15 October 2002 and expiring on 14 October 2011. 
       
      
    171 I would not set non parole periods in respect of the sentences imposed on counts 9, 11, 22 and 1 for the reason that the terms are wholly encompassed by the non parole period specified in connection with the sentence on count 17. 
     
      
    172 I would grant Zugecic leave to appeal against sentence, allow the appeal, quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and in lieu therefore sentence him as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Counts 7 and 10. To terms of three years imprisonment to commence on 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2005. Those terms to be served concurrently. 
       
       
      (b) Counts 4 and 8. To terms of seven years imprisonment to commence on 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2009. Those terms to be served concurrently. 
       
       
      (c) Count 1. To a term of imprisonment of five years to commence on 15 October 2002 and to expire on 14 October 2007. 
       
       
      (d) Count 18. To imprisonment for twelve years to commence on 15 October 2002 with a non parole period of nine years commencing on 15 October 2002 and expiring on 14 October 2011. 
       
      
    173 I would not set non parole periods in respect of the sentences imposed on counts 7, 10, 4, 8 and 1 for the reason that the terms are wholly encompassed by the non parole period specified in connection with count 18.174 The overarching effective sentence which I propose results in each case in imprisonment for twelve years with a non parole period of nine years.  
     
      
    175 For each appellant, 14 October 2011 is specified as the earliest date of eligibility for consideration of release to parole. 
     
      
    176 SIMPSON J:  I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    177 HOWIE J: I agree with Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Knight DCJ on 16 October 2003.  
     
      
    2 The applicant and two co-offenders adhered to pleas of guilty earlier made in the Local Court to a charge of taking and detaining a woman in company with intent to obtain advantage and occasioning her actual bodily harm. Such an offence has a prescribed maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment. The facts of this offence are, however, unusual and far distant from the serious conduct which can be comprehended in a charge under s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    3 The applicant is a young woman aged twenty four years. She is the de facto partner of Mike Rynn Toa (whom I will refer to as Toa). They are the parents of a small child. Toa is a cousin of Ngatokotoru Roi who is the mother of a three year old son named Jake. They are members of what was described as close knit community, the members of which had come from the Cook Islands. They were located in Armidale. Ms Roi commenced a relationship with one Jason Rummery and left Armidale to go and live with him in Inverell. She left the child Jake behind in Armidale with another cousin. 
     
      
    4 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. She testified that she became concerned about Ms Roi who had changed from being a very lovely mother to one she described as very horrible. She had had previously a close relationship with Ms Roi, describing themselves as like sisters. She had a poor opinion of Mr Rummery whom she thought was an unemployed drug user. Her concern was heightened by a perception that the child Jake was ill which she attributed to fretting for his absent mother.  
     
      
    5 On 8 May 2003 four people left Armidale by motor car driven by one James Wilson. The learned sentencing judge observed that Mr Wilson appeared to play no part in the events other than providing transport. The other occupants of the car were the applicant, Toa and a friend of theirs Andrew Wallace. Those three were the co-offenders charged as I have mentioned.  
     
      
    6 Upon arrival in Inverell the applicant (not revealing that she was in that town) telephoned Ms Roi and by use of a deception obtained her current address. The party then proceeded to it. 
     
      
    7 Thereafter the three offenders forcibly took Ms Roi to the motor car, obtained her belongings from the house, and returned with her to Armidale. In the course of detaining her there were struggles during which on one occasion Toa punched Ms Roi to the side of the face and the applicant “kneed” her in the stomach in order to force her into the vehicle. 
     
      
    8 On return to Armidale Mr Wilson left the group. Inside premises which were the home of the applicant and Toa, Ms Roi was permitted, and even encouraged, to make telephone calls. She called a family member and also the police. Ms Roi spoke to Senior Constable Burton who asked her what number she was calling from, Ms Roi made an enquiry and a female voice (fairly obviously the applicant) gave the correct number which was relayed to the constable. A short time later police came to the address and took Ms Roi away. They returned about an hour later and arrested the three offenders.  
     
      
    9 The applicant did not deny what had happened and offered the explanation that she was acting out of a desire to have Ms Roi return home and behave as expected by her family, which would include looking after her son.  
     
      
    10 However, his Honour found “they conceded that they knew, each of them in effect, that what they were doing was illegal and they have adhered to those statements ever since.” 
     
      
    11 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for four years dating from 16 October 2003 with a non parole period of nine months dating from that date and expiring on 15 July 2004. The Court has been advised that she has in fact been released on parole. The co-offenders received identical sentences.  
     
      
    12 The applicant had no prior conviction of any kind. In addition to fulfilling domestic duties it appears that she had employment from time to time as a rouseabout on various properties when that work was available.  
     
      
    13 Two grounds of appeal are relied upon: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The learned sentencing judge erred by taking into account as aggravating features two matters which were elements of the offence itself. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    14 Ground 1 has its origin in a statement by his Honour in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am required by s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to have regard to certain aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in subsection (2) and (3) of s 21A and I propose to do so by going through them seriatim in relation to each of the offenders.” 
        
       
      
    15 He then proceeded to observe: 
     
      
       
        
        “First of all, in relation to aggravating factors, s 21A(2)(b) is relevant. The offence did involve the actual use of violence. There can be no doubt that Ms Roi did sustain actual bodily harm and I am satisfied that that was caused by the way that she was handled on this day and, in particular, the punch that Mr Toa threw at her.” 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “The offence was committed in company and therefore subsection (e) is relevant.” 
        
       
      
    16 The commission of the offence in company and the sustaining by Ms Roi of actual bodily harm were elements of the offence charged under s 86(3) of the Crimes Act. Whilst aggravating factors to be taken into account are listed in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999 there is express provision at the conclusion of the scheduled items: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    17 It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour’s remarks show that he treated the elements of the offence above described as aggravating features.  
     
      
    18 In a written submission counsel for the Crown made a tentative concession: 
     
      
       
        
        “The respondent (Crown) submits that it would appear that the learned sentencing judge may have regarded these two features as aggravating the circumstances of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    19 It is plain from his Honour’s explicit remarks that he did in fact do so and ground 1 must be sustained. 
     
      
    20 The Crown submits, however, that even if such error has occurred this Court would not conclude that some lesser sentence was warranted in law. It is convenient to deal with this submission in the context of ground 2. 
     
      
    21 His Honour recognized that he had to balance the genuine, although misguided, motive of the applicant (and the co-offenders) against the objective seriousness of the offence and in particular the need for general deterrence. By reason of the plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity he indicated that he would apply a discount to sentence otherwise assessed and further enhance this discount by reason of a finding of remorse resulting in reduction in sentence by one third. It follows that the “starting point” of his assessment must have been six years imprisonment. 
     
      
    22 I have already observed that the applicant had no prior convictions. Toa and Wallace did have previous records which his Honour assessed as being comparatively minor. Nevertheless he rejected a submission that the applicant be dealt with in a more lenient fashion than either of them because “each of those gentlemen would have a legitimate sense of grievance”. It would be contrary to principle to deprive an offender of an entitlement to reflection of leniency in a sentence for that reason as it would logically follow that that offender was receiving an imposition which was larger than ought to have been assessed. However, parity is not a matter that is expressly advanced as a ground in this appeal.  
     
      
    23 Having regard to the demonstration of error encompassed by ground 1, the question of resentence by this Court arises. 
     
      
    24 I agree with his Honour’s observation that general deterrence was of importance and that the enforcement of cultural mores must occur within the confines of the law. 
     
      
    25 However, the victim knew at all times who the applicant was. After arrival in Armidale there was no real attempt to continue the detention as evidenced by the assistance in enabling police to be contacted and ascertain where she was. It does not undermine the seriousness of the breach of the law to observe that there were elements of farce to this offence. 
     
      
    26 In my view all the objectives of sentencing would have been attained by the imposition of a term of imprisonment suspended pursuant to s 12 of the applicable statute. 
     
      
    27 As matters presently stand, the applicant has been kept in custody for nine months - and is subject to parole for a little over three years hence. Taking into account the time already served I am of opinion that the appropriate resentence is to direct the applicant to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of twelve months from today pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    28 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    29 SHAW J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    30 GROVE J: The order of the Court therefore will be as I have proposed. 
     
      
    31 The application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted. The appeal is allowed. The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed. In lieu thereof the applicant is ordered to enter a good behaviour bond for twelve months from today pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    32 We direct that the applicant attend and enter that recognizance at the Armidale Court within seven days of today.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Simpson J and Howie J. Subject to what follows I agree with their Honours. 
     
      
    2 In my view in respect of the first count the Respondent should be sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months, including a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months, both such terms to commence on 27 November 2003 and in respect of the second count the Respondent should be sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months, including a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months, both such terms to commence on 27 February 2005. The total effective sentence would thus be one of 4 years imprisonment, including a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The non-parole period of the second sentence has been reduced in order to provide a parole period which gives reasonable effect to the finding of special circumstances and not because of any view that the Respondent’s criminality the subject of that charge is less than that the subject of the first charge. 
     
      
    3 Both the objective circumstances of the Respondent’s offences and his subjective circumstances have been detailed by their Honours and I need not repeat them. Otherwise the principal factors leading me to the conclusion that the sentences should be as I have described are the following. One is the guideline judgement of this Court in R v Whyte [2002] 55 NSWLR 252 where it was said, at [229], that for a typical case, there identified, of an offence such as the Respondent’s, “Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.” 
     
      
    4 The second is my view that the Respondent’s moral culpability was high. In that regard there is his blood-alcohol level. At 0.1 or thereabouts, it was about twice the legal limit of 0.05 even if it was, as the trial judge said, “markedly below that which is commonly encountered in this particular form of dangerous driving”. However, more important to my mind was the nature of the Respondent’s driving at a time when he knew he had had a substantial amount to drink. As Simpson J and Howie J have pointed out, the Respondent succeeded in failing to negotiate a relatively gentle curve of a road despite adequate lighting and good road surface after travelling for but 5 minutes, and skidded, to some extent sideways, for some 38 metres before hitting a tree. Photographs of the car after the impact demonstrate that the impact must have been of some substantial force. Those facts indicate that there was grave inadequacy in his driving, whether this be in the form of speeding, inattention or otherwise. 
     
      
    5 A third lies in the fact that there is nothing otherwise in the circumstances of the case as it was presented to Acting Judge Ducker which argues for the view that the Respondent’s criminality was of a lesser order than the typical case referred to in R v Whyte. Nor is there anything in the Respondent’s subjective circumstances which argues for any significant reduction in the sentence otherwise indicated as appropriate.  
     
      
    6 I make it clear that, in my reliance on the decision in R v Whyte, I do not treat that case as doing any more than providing the guideline it purports to give. However it, and R v Jurisic [1998] 45 NSWLR 209 which preceded it, were considered judgments of this Court and in my respectful view represented a weighing of the competing considerations to be taken into account in the typical cases to which they referred in a way which was certainly not unfair to offenders. The result is undoubtedly hard on someone such as the Respondent – a person who, but for the particular transgressions the subject of present consideration, would seem to be a worthwhile member of the community. But his actions resulted in far worse for his victims and the tenor of the statutory provisions and the need to deter others from acting as he did means that a substantial punishment must be imposed.  
     
      
    7 To these considerations must be added reference to 3 further matters. One is that the Respondent did not plead guilty. He is not, of course, to be punished for that but he is not entitled to the discount which flows from a plea of guilty. The sentence of (not less than) 3 years envisaged in R v Whyte was for an offender who was entitled to a discount for a “plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value”. The sentence thus reflected a discount of the order of 10%. See R v Whyte at [204]; R v Sullivan [2004] NSWCCA 99 at [10-11] and [54]. 
     
      
    8 The guideline also contemplated the commission of but one offence. As was said in the case itself, some increment in such a sentence could be expected in the event of there being more than one victim. I have difficulty in seeing how that increment could reasonably be less than an increase of 12 months in the non-parole period. 
     
      
    9 Thirdly, the Respondent is of course entitled to such benefits as flow from this being a Crown Appeal and the considerations which the double jeopardy consequent thereon necessarily involves. Nevertheless there must remain some balance between the allowance on that account and the punishment his conduct requires. The sentence I favour is what I regard as the lowest that could reasonably have been imposed at first instance and, although it does involve a large increase on that originally imposed, the principal cause lies in the grossly inadequate sentence imposed by Acting Judge Ducker.  
     
      
    10 SIMPSON J and HOWIE J: The respondent to this Crown appeal was convicted after trial by jury of two counts of dangerous driving causing death. Each offence was contrary to s 52A of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Acting Judge Ducker sentenced the respondent on each matter to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months. The sentences commenced on 27 November 2003, the date of sentence, and were to be served concurrently. The respondent is to be released to parole on 27 November 2004. The Crown asserts that the sentences are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    11 The jury found that the respondent was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the accident that resulted in the death of the two passengers in his vehicle. The Crown case was that the respondent was driving at an excessive speed and that he was under the influence of alcohol. The death of the two victims was occasioned by the vehicle leaving the road and coming into impact with a tree. 
     
      
    12 The respondent asserted before the jury, as he had done shortly after the collision, that the accident was a result of his having been forced to leave the road surface to avoid a vehicle being driven on the respondent’s side of the road. The jury were clearly not satisfied that the deaths occasioned by the impact were not in any way attributable to the fact that the respondent was under the influence of alcohol or driving at an excessive speed; s 52A(8). The sentencing judge found beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other vehicle. 
     
      
    13 It, therefore, follows that the respondent had lost control of the vehicle when negotiating a bend in the road because of his intoxicated state. Yet it was a paved road in relatively good condition, dry and reasonably well lit. There was no evidence to suggest that the conditions of the road or the lighting were responsible for the loss of control of the vehicle. The vehicle had slid 38 metres into the tree, almost sideways, causing extensive damage to the whole of the passenger side of the vehicle and resulting in the death of his two passengers. 
     
      
    14 The facts need a little further amplification. The respondent had on the evening of the accident attended a 21st birthday party at a football club. He had consumed alcohol there and at about 1.30am decided to adjourn to a nearby hotel. He asked a friend to move his car from the club to the hotel because he felt intoxicated. He left from the Ballina Hotel at about 3.30am and had been driving for about five minutes before the accident occurred. He said that he had been driving at 50kph before losing control of the vehicle after he swerved onto the grass. The persons who were killed in the accident were a long-standing friend of the respondent aged 23 and the deceased’s friend, a female aged 25, whom the respondent did not know well. They had asked him for a lift and he complied. The respondent was intending to drive them home, but, for some unexplained reason, the accident occurred after the respondent’s vehicle had passed the residence of the passengers. 
     
      
    15 It was clear that the respondent lost control of the vehicle when negotiating a sweeping right hand bend. The Crown asserted that this was as a result of the speed at which the vehicle was travelling combined with the respondent’s impaired ability to drive the vehicle because of his intoxication. According to the respondent he was awake, alert and in conversation with the male passenger at the time of the accident. The road was 8.3m wide with no centre line. It was described as being in good condition and free from loose material. It was governed by a 50kph speed limit. The marks on the road surface and the grass area before the crash site indicated that the vehicle was going into yaw on the road surface; that is traction was lost because of excessive speed or over-steering and causing the vehicle to rotate on its axis. There were photographs in evidence showing the positioning of a jig to represent the movement of the vehicle’s wheels at the time of loss of control and as it left the road surface. 
     
      
    16 The respondent told police, who spoke to him shortly after the accident, that he had consumed three or four middies of full-strength beer. He said that he commenced drinking at 8 pm and had a sip of a drink about an hour and half before the accident. Later in a recorded interview the respondent gave a different account of his consumption of alcohol. He said that he had commenced drinking at 7 pm and concluded at 12 pm. He had consumed six VB stubbies at the party and then a rum and coke at the hotel. The police officers, who spoke to him, both could smell alcohol on his breath. 
     
      
    17 In relation to the effect of the alcohol on him, the respondent told police: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I was, I was fine, cause I, when I go out I normally don’t drink alcohol, cause I can’t afford to, I just go out just to socialise and, and when I do drink I stop drinking well before I’ve got to drive home and I count drinks. So, I know when I’m right to drive. 
        
       
       
      He also said that he did not believe that he was over the “legal limit” when he entered his car to drive home. He felt fine before the accident, was alert and talking with the male friend who was sitting beside him. 
       
      
    18 A sample of blood was taken from the respondent when he attended the Ballina Hospital shortly after the accident. It returned a reading of 0.084 grams of alcohol per 1000 millilitres of blood. Evidence by Dr Pearl at the trial was to the effect that the likely concentration of alcohol at the time of the accident was 0.1 and not less than 0.095, a reading that his Honour described as being “towards the bottom of the scale of medium range offences”. The doctor’s evidence was that the respondent would have been significantly impaired in his capacity to drive a motor vehicle at the time of the impact. The less experienced the driver the greater the impairment. A police officer attending the scene of the accident thought that the respondent was slightly to moderately affected by intoxicating liquor. 
     
      
    19 The respondent gave evidence at his trial. He said that he felt he was “over the limit” at the time he asked a friend to move his motor vehicle to the hotel. He maintained that he had only one drink at the hotel, a rum and coke as he arrived. He had nothing to drink for the three hours thereafter. He was unfamiliar with the road where the accident occurred and was being directed by the male accused. He said that he had five years driving experience and believed that had it not been for the other motor vehicle he would have been able to safely negotiate the corner at the speed he was travelling. He was not feeling the effects of alcohol at all. 
     
      
    20 His Honour found that the respondent’s assertion that he lost control because of the lights of an on-coming vehicle was untrue. The respondent had steadfastly maintained this version from when police spoke to him at the scene, during the course of his evidence to the jury and when interviewed by an officer preparing a pre-sentence report. He had rejected any suggestion that his driving was affected by the alcohol he had consumed. In reference to the respondent’s assertion about the on-coming vehicle and his refusal to accept responsibility for the accident, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender has, at all times, claimed that [ ] a motor vehicle caused him to swerve to avoid a head-on collision with such a vehicle. I believe that the reason for the vehicle leaving the road was that the driving capacity of the offender was impaired and clearly the jury’s verdict confirmed that. It is very easy to be critical of the young offender - he was 23 at the time or less than that – in that he did give a version which was meant to be exculpatory of himself. I believe that he did that because he was so shocked and horrified by what had occurred – what must have been increasingly clear over those terrible moments after he made an inspection of the vehicle and saw the state of the two passengers – that they were either not alive or not going to survive. Once having made that claim he was in a sense stuck with it……….. 
        
       
      
    21 With respect we do not understand the import of the last sentence in that passage. Whatever might have been his immediate reaction, he had ample opportunity to confess the truth. The simple fact is that the respondent has never accepted his criminal responsibility for the accident and the death of the two passengers. He may be remorseful for the consequences of the accident, and he may genuinely feel sorrow for the loss suffered by the families. We have little doubt that he would wish to turn back the clock. But true contrition does not arise without an acceptance of guilt. This lack of contrition affects both the measure of denunciation required in response to his conduct resulting in the death of two young persons and the prospects of his rehabilitation. Without the respondent accepting criminal responsibility, we do not share his Honour’s confidence that the respondent is unlikely to offend in the future. 
     
      
    22 Be that as it may, the real question raised in this appeal is whether the sentence is manifestly inadequate or whether his Honour’s sentence was so infected by error that it cannot be allowed to stand. The objective facts are clearly serious and to these we will shortly return after referring to the subjective circumstances of the respondent. 
     
      
    23 The respondent was aged 23 years at the time of sentence. The offences had occurred about 18 months earlier. He has no criminal record or traffic history. He had the benefit of a supportive upbringing with his parents in Ballina. At the time of sentencing he was unemployed but receiving Newstart Benefits. He had been discharged from the army, in which he had served for three years, after sustaining a back injury in a motor vehicle accident. He had undertaken casual work as a spray painter before the fatal accident but had not worked since. He was living with friends in Ballina. 
     
      
    24 A psychological report emphasised the effect of the accident upon the emotional stability of the respondent, who was described as being “profoundly disturbed and distressed”. He had sought to attend the funeral of both deceased, but the parents of his male friend did not want him present in the congregation. There is nothing, in my view, in the psychological report of relevance to an assessment of the respondent’s culpability. The report does, however, reveal the magnitude of the effect of the accident upon him. The psychologist concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He is deeply traumatised despite his outwardly “stable” look. He is living with the distressing symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, reactive depression and high anxiety. At present he has no notions of recovery from his current condition and no future perspective. 
        
       
      
    25 The respondent’s mother gave evidence as to matters of general background and the effects of the accident upon her son. She stated that he had been receiving counselling from a psychologist to help him cope. There were also two testimonials tendered on his behalf. 
     
      
    26 This is yet another tragic case of an otherwise fine young man failing to act responsibly in relation to the consumption of alcohol and driving, with the result that he took the lives of two other young citizens. A full-time gaol sentence was inevitable but the question arises as to whether the sentence imposed was adequate to reflect denunciation and general deterrence, the important goals of punishment when sentencing for this type of offence that is unfortunately so often committed by young persons of otherwise impeccable character. 
     
      
    27 The Crown raises three complaints that are said to have vitiated the sentencing discretion exercised by Judge Ducker. They are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. failure to give any weight at all or adequate weight to the principle of general deterrence; 
         
         
        2. excessive weight to the subjective features of the respondent; 
         
         
        3. misapplication of the principle in  
        Pearce 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610 
         
         
        
       
      
    28 As is so often the case, the first two grounds can only be answered by a determination of whether the sentence is manifestly inadequate and, therefore, whether some unidentified error must have occurred in the proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences in light of the subjective circumstances of the offender and the purposes of punishment in the particular case. 
     
      
    29 Insofar as general deterrence is concerned, the sentencing judge did not mention this consideration. This is notwithstanding the importance that has been attributed to that factor when sentencing for offences such as those of which the respondent was convicted. But the failure of an experienced sentencing judge to mention a matter is not conclusive of a failure to have regard to it: see R v Carr (2002) 135 A Crim R 171 at [34]. Yet it is disturbing that, general deterrence being such a significant matter in sentencing for this type of offence, no reference appears to have been made to it by his Honour either in exchanges with counsel or in the sentencing remarks. However, we would not be prepared to find that the sentence imposed upon the respondent would not act as a deterrent or sufficient deterrent to other young persons in the community. If there is error in the sentence imposed, we do not believe it lies in this complaint. 
     
      
    30 The second ground is again one that, generally speaking, can only be made good by a consideration of the sentence imposed as against the objective seriousness of the offence. If the sentence fails to reflect the criminality inherent in the offence committed, then it might be assumed that the sentencing judge either failed to properly assess the criminality, or having done so, paid it insufficient regard as against the subjective case presented on behalf of the offender. 
     
      
    31 It must be said that this was not an exceptional subjective case having regard to the nature of the offence and the persons who are likely to commit it. In Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at [204] the Chief Justice set out the factors that frequently recur in offences of this kind. So far as matters subjective to the respondent are concerned, they are: young offender; of good character with no or limited prior convictions; no or limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates; and genuine remorse. There is nothing in the material that was before his Honour to indicate that the subjective case presented on the respondent’s behalf was other than typical and there was, therefore, nothing that warranted or justified the sentencing judge taking a course that was unusually lenient. 
     
      
    32 There were, however, at least three matters that took the present out of the ordinary case, and these were highly significant: there was more than one death; there was a plea of not guilty; and there was no contrition as distinct from remorse. True it was that, with possibly one exception, there were not aggravating features, the presence of which might indicate that the moral culpability of the respondent was high. See Whyte at [228]. But it does not follow that the offence was not a serious one that warranted condign punishment. The matter of possible aggravation was the degree of speed at which the respondent was driving at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    33 Judge Ducker after referring to the matters in Whyte which were held to be indicative of the ‘typical case” stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Overall I think that it could be regarded as a typical case in the sense that it was serious, but no more serious certainly in terms of moral culpability than the typical case referred to in Whyte. 
         
        
       
      
    34 With respect, that assessment is erroneous because of the presence of the three matters to which we have made reference: in particular, the fact that there was more than one death. It was an atypical case despite the fact that it may not have fallen within the category where an offender’s moral culpability was high because of the aggravating factors set out in items (iii) to (xi) at [216] – [217] of Whyte. 
     
      
    35 In that list of aggravating factors (ii) is “Number of people put at risk”. This particular factor is not identified as one of the “frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence” so that it is not one of the matters which may indicate that the offender’s culpability is high or “that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct”. We accept, with respect, that to be the case where one is considering only the fact that persons generally, such as other users of the roadway, are put at risk by the driving of the accused. It is in such a case, like (i), “Extent and nature of the injuries”, a consequence of the driving and says nothing about the moral culpability of the driver. 
     
      
    36 But it is a different situation where the offender knows the extent of the risk that was being created because he or she was aware of persons actually being placed in danger at the time of the driving. For example, it must be the case that the moral culpability of a driver of a bus full of passengers who is driving dangerously is worse than the moral culpability of the lone person driving the family vehicle in the same manner. So in the present case the fact that the respondent was driving two passengers in his vehicle at the time of the accident increased his moral culpability for driving in a manner dangerous or under the influence of alcohol. See R v Skrill [2002] NSWCCA 484 at [75] per Carruthers AJ with whom Hulme J generally agreed. 
     
      
    37 It is clear that the Chief Justice in both Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and Whyte was not attempting to identify all the matters that might impact upon the assessment of the moral culpability of an offender in any particular case. For example, the type of vehicle being driven might be an aggravating factor that goes to the moral culpability or the abandonment of responsibility of the driver in a particular case. The Chief Justice should not be taken in Whyte to be suggesting that the number of persons put at risk cannot be a matter that can affect an offender’s moral culpability, but only that in the normal case it would not. 
     
      
    38 It is trite that an offence under s 52A is a crime that has two distinct elements: a culpable act of driving and the consequence of that act. It is the consequence of the act of driving that gives rise to the particular offence committed and that makes the offender liable to a maximum penalty far in excess of that prescribed for the corresponding traffic offence. The fact that more than one person was killed as a result of the driving is such a significant attribute of the criminality arising from the offences charged against the respondent, that it had to result in a significant increase in the sentence that would have been appropriate in the typical case where only one person had been killed. 
     
      
    39 The significant matter of criminality arising from the respondent’s act of driving, without regard to the consequence of the driving, was the level of his intoxication and his loss of control of the vehicle. Judge Ducker held that “the degree of intoxication was markedly below that which is commonly encountered in this particular form of dangerous driving”. That assessment might be accurate but that does not necessarily resolve the issue of the respondent’s culpability for the loss of two lives, and certainly does not mean that the culpability was at the lower end of the scale. This was a case where the respondent maintained that he was alert at the time of the accident, observant of the roadway and conditions, and was travelling at a speed of between 50-60kms. Yet the motor vehicle left the road apparently because the respondent simply failed to negotiate a relatively gentle curve in the road despite adequate lighting and good road surface. He had only travelled for 5 minutes and was in a well-lit area of what appears to be an unremarkable location in the suburbs of a large country town. 
     
      
    40 If the version of the respondent as to the approaching vehicle is discounted, then he must have been incapable of the proper control of the motor vehicle to a very significant degree, regardless of what might be otherwise inferred from the blood-alcohol reading. Although his Honour found that the respondent was not driving in a manner dangerous because of excessive speed, the impact between the vehicle and the tree, some six metres off the edge of the road, was horrific. The respondent’s failure to control the motor vehicle was gross. 
     
      
    41 In any event, we cannot accept his Honour’s finding that the respondent was not travelling at an excessive speed for the circumstances in which he found himself. This is not to say that he was necessarily exceeding the speed limit to any substantial degree and certainly not to the speed calculated by Senior Constable Mills, being 83-93kph based upon the critical speed of the bend in the road. But it is obvious from the objective evidence that the respondent was travelling at a speed in excess of what was appropriate to negotiate the bend safely. The yaw marks were consistent with the vehicle either attempting to take the curve at excessive speed or with a sudden steering movement. The police officer gave evidence that there was no indication of the latter having occurred. 
     
      
    42 If one discounts the fact that there was another vehicle or some other incident to cause the loss of control, such as the respondent falling asleep at the wheel, there seems to be no other reason but excessive speed for the loss of control to such a marked degree that the vehicle acted as it did in travelling from the road surface to the accident site. Of course the respondent’s inability to assess the appropriate speed to take a bend is consistent with the significant impairment of his driving skills as a result of intoxication. However, even putting to one side the fact that the respondent was under the influence of alcohol, the loss of control when negotiating that particular stretch of roadway was, in my view, so gross that he was obviously driving in a manner dangerous to the public. The effect of intoxicating liquor may explain why he was driving in that manner. 
     
      
    43 We are, with respect, unable to understand how his Honour could come to a finding that the vehicle was not travelling at an excessive speed to safely take the curve in the road yet accept, as he was obliged to do, that the respondent’s driving ability was significantly impaired. The impairment had to have some impact on his driving in a practical and not simply theoretical basis for him to have lost control of the vehicle as he did. The respondent’s evidence that he was travelling at 50-60kph was given on the basis that he glanced at his speedometer shortly before the accident. But his whole account of the circumstances leading up to accident was untrue and there was no reason why he should be accepted on this particular fact when it was inconsistent with the objective evidence. Although his Honour was entitled to find facts for the purpose of sentencing, he could only do so on a rational basis in accordance with the evidence. There can be no doubt that the respondent was driving too fast to safely take the curve in the road and for that reason lost control of the vehicle. We are also in no doubt that he was travelling in excess of the speed limit of 50kph to a significant degree. 
     
      
    44 We are also of the view, with respect, that his Honour also gave insufficient regard to the seriousness of the blood-alcohol reading. The respondent had a blood-alcohol level of not less than 0.095. This is almost twice the legal limit. Had the level been at 0.15, he would have been guilty of an aggravated offence in respect of each death and the applicable maximum penalty would have been imprisonment for 14 years rather than 10 years. In that context we do not understand the significance of his Honour’s remark: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The degree of intoxication was markedly below that which is commonly encountered in this particular form of dangerous driving. 
        
       
       
      This seems to suggest that it was a matter of mitigation that the offence was not more serious. The degree of intoxication both by reference to the objective blood-alcohol level and the respondent’s inability to control the vehicle indicates a serious offence of its type. 
       
      
    45 His Honour’s finding that it was an important mitigating factor that the respondent did not have any criminal record was, with respect, erroneous. As has already been noted, it is a typical characteristic for offences under s 52A that the offender has little or no criminal record, as is the fact that the respondent had good character. Even before the guideline judgments of Jurisic and Whyte, it was accepted that general deterrence was so important when sentencing for this kind of offence that youth, good character and clear record could not be accorded the same weight they might have been given in sentencing for other offences where such subjective features were atypical. 
     
      
    46 The third ground of appeal asserting that his Honour erred in making the sentences wholly concurrent is clearly made out in my opinion. His Honour appears to have misunderstood the significance of the fact that two persons had died. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The sentences arising, as they do, out of exactly the same circumstances should be concurrent. An identical sentence for each of the offences is appropriate in the circumstance. 
        
       
       
      But it is simply not the law, and never has been, that, because two offences arise out of exactly the same circumstances, they should be dealt with by concurrent sentences. 
       
      
    47 Before Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, what his Honour said might have been correct as a rule of thumb, because sentencing practice in this State allowed for the totality of criminality to be reflected in a single sentence where there were two or more offences arising from the same circumstances. But if the total criminality could not be reflected in a single sentence, the sentencer was required to cumulate the sentences, notwithstanding that the offences arose from a single criminal episode. Wilkins (1988) 38 A Crim R 445 is an example of a case where two offences of culpable driving occasioning death arising from a single accident resulted in cumulative sentences because the maximum penalty for one offence was insufficient to reflect the criminality involved. 
     
      
    48 Since Pearce it has been accepted that, generally speaking, the criminality arising from a particular offence is to be reflected in the sentence for that offence, and the issue of totality addressed by a consideration of whether the sentences are to be served concurrently or cumulatively. In Skrill, above, it was held by a majority of this Court that sentences for aggravated dangerous driving causing death and aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm arising from the one incident of driving should have been imposed partly cumulatively to reach an appropriate overall sentence. See also Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516 in respect of sexual assault offences arising from the same incident. 
     
      
    49 It will rarely be the case that sentences for multiple offences of dangerous driving causing death could be made wholly concurrent. Because, as was noted earlier, the criminality in the offence is not simply derived from the culpable act of driving without having regard to the consequences, the fact that more than one person is killed means that the criminality will not usually be sufficiently comprehended by a sentence that is appropriate for a single offence. In the present case, even assuming that a sentence of two years was appropriate for one offence, it could not, in my opinion, be an adequate reflection of the fact that the consequences of the respondent’s driving was the death of two persons. This is notwithstanding the statements in R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 to the effect that a judge has a discretion as to whether to make sentences cumulative or concurrent and legal minds might differ as to what order was appropriate in a particular case. 
     
      
    50 It is clear that there have been a number of decisions of this Court that have either approved of, or imposed, concurrent sentences for multiple offences under s 52A even where more than one death has occurred. Some examples are set out in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Plumb [2003] NSWCCA 359 at [19]. That was an offender’s appeal against a sentence in which partly cumulative sentences were imposed for two offences arising from the one act of driving. As the Chief Judge notes, in none of the cases cited was any reference made to Pearce or its impact upon cases of multiple victims in dangerous driving cases. After referring to Skrill and Wilkins the Chief Judge, with whom Smart AJ agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I am not persuaded in the present case, having regard to the very serious injuries inflicted on the two victims, that some degree of accumulation was not called for. Otherwise it is difficult to see how the overall objective criminality could be accommodated within the confines of  
        Pearce 
        . 
        
       
      
    51 The reason given by the sentencing judge in the present case for imposing concurrent sentences does not appear to take into account whether such an order could, within the proper application of the principle in Pearce, reflect the totality of the criminality resulting from a single act of driving which was aggravated by the fact that the respondent had two passengers in his vehicle and which resulted in the death of both. His Honour went no further than concluding that the sentences should be concurrent because the offences arose “out of exactly the same circumstances”. In this regard his discretion miscarried. 
     
      
    52 In any event the overall sentence imposed did not reflect the objective circumstances of both the manner of driving and its consequences. Subject to any discretionary matters, the Crown appeal should be allowed notwithstanding the restraints and limitations placed upon this Court in allowing a Crown appeal. The sentencing discretion was infected with error and the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate to a very marked degree. 
     
      
    53 The Court has received an affidavit by the respondent concerning his conduct while in custody. He has been doing what he can by way of work, courses and programmes to serve his period in gaol in a worthwhile manner. He has been involved in a Kickstart Camp for young offenders at Oberon in an attempt to instil in him an understanding of the need to take responsibility for other persons who rely upon him. He is hoping to attend two more such camps. 
     
      
    54 Mr Cook, on behalf of the respondent, has urged the Court not to intervene and disturb the sentence were the Court to find that there was error or that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. He relies upon the fact that the respondent is due for release to parole on 26 November next and is working toward that date. He also asked the Court to take into account the delay in lodging the appeal: a period of two months expired between the date of sentence and the filing of the appeal. A delay of that order is generally unacceptable, particularly where an offender has a period of 12 months or less to serve before release at the expiration of the sentence or on parole, and especially where he or she is serving a first gaol sentence. No good reason was given for the delay and it is a weighty matter in deciding whether to intervene. 
     
      
    55 The respondent also relies upon the conduct of the Crown at the sentencing hearing. During the course of the Crown’s submissions and after the prosecutor had submitted that the offences fell within the guideline and a fulltime custodial sentence was appropriate, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ..It seems to me that it should be less than that indicated in Whyte’s Case. Do you wish to say anything about that? The moral culpability is less than in most cases. He showed considerable good sense earlier in the evening, a period elapsed where the suggestion is that he only had one drink, one further drink, and he believed himself capable of driving. And there is some suggestion that he still thinks that which is a little bit of a worry. 
         
        
       
       
      The Crown Prosecutor then went on to comment upon the evidence of Doctor Perl and her findings as to the respondent’s level of impairment. 
       
      
    56 We do not believe that the Crown Prosecutor should be taken as having accepted the proposition put by the sentencing judge in the first line of that quote or in some other way having led his Honour into error by accepting, even tacitly, that a sentence “less than that indicated in Whyte’s case” was appropriate.  
     
      
    57 Judge Ducker found that were special circumstances for a reduction in the non-parole period for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This will be the first sentence of imprisonment imposed upon a young man of good character, with a flawless prior record and who believed he was fit to drive and who earlier in the night – quite a lot earlier-and at that time thought he was not fit to drive and did not drive. He was mistaken but the moral culpability in my view is much less than usual. 
         
         
        However, it seems clear that he will need some careful counselling when he is released.  
        
       
       
      The Crown has not sought to argue that it was not open to his Honour to find special circumstances. However, apart from the fact that the respondent was a young man of good character being sentenced to full-time custody, there was nothing else in the material that could justify such a finding. There was no suggestion in the psychological report that the respondent needed counselling or would do so when released from custody. The probation officer thought he needed “medium level of intervention because of the serious nature of the offence and his attitude to his alcohol use”. But the fact that he continues to deny that alcohol was a cause of the accident and eschews responsibility for his loss of control of the motor vehicle leads me to have little confidence that any form of counselling would be met with an appropriate response. 
       
      
    58 A significant matter in determining the outcome of this appeal is the frustration and disappointment caused to the respondent by a variation in his anticipated release date, especially where it may result in a change of classification with more onerous conditions than he currently experiences, For that reason we would have found special circumstances and departed from the statutory ratio between the term and the non-parole period in order not to crush his endeavours at reform. 
     
      
    59 The sentence was manifestly inadequate and this Court must intervene and resentence the respondent. We agree with respect that the sentence proposed by Hulme J is within the range of sentences that ought to have been imposed by Judge Ducker, although opinions might differ as to where in the range of available sentences that proposed by His Honour would fall. However, we do not believe that it is now appropriate to impose such a sentence in light of the delay that has occurred since sentencing in the District Court. 
     
      
    60 The delay in the ultimate determination of the sentence to be served by the respondent has been occasioned by three stages in the judicial process: firstly, the delay in the lodging of the Crown appeal; secondly, in the time taken for the matter to be listed for a hearing in this Court; thirdly, the time take to resolve the appeal. Of course during the period of over 9 months since the respondent was sentenced by Judge Ducker, he has been continuing to serve his sentence. He has no doubt been in a state of uncertainty as to the outcome of the appeal and presumably continuing with the courses and programmes in which he was engaged at the time of the hearing of the appeal. In light of the fact that the respondent is a young man of generally good character serving his first period in custody, the delay between the sentencing in the District Court and the resolution of the appeal is a very significant matter in the exercise of this Court’s discretion to intervene at the behest of the Crown. 
     
      
    61 Had the matter been capable of being determined closer to the date when the sentence was imposed, we would have taken the course of allowing the appeal and increasing both the total term to be served by the respondent and the overall non-parole period, but not to the extent proposed by Hulme J. We would have imposed a total sentence of not less than 3 years and a total non-parole period of not less than 21 months. However, in light of the fact that the respondent is currently entitled to be released to parole on 27 November next and taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the offence and the subjective considerations touching upon the respondent and his rehabilitation, we are of the opinion that it would now be unduly harsh to extend his non-parole period at such a late stage in the course of the sentence imposed upon him. The justice of the matter, so far as both the respondent and the community are concerned, can best now be attained by allowing the respondent to be released to parole on 27 November, having served what was a not insignificant period in custody, but to extend the period during which he can serve the balance of the sentence in the community. 
     
      
    62 We come to this view having regard to the material before the Court both as to the impact upon the respondent of the deaths of his passengers and the manner in which he had approached his period in custody up to the date of the hearing. We accept, so far as can be reliably assessed, that at least one of the traditional sentencing objectives, the rehabilitation of an otherwise law-abiding young man, has been accomplished. We also consider that the sentence now imposed is not without a significant component of both general, and, to the extent to which it is necessary, specific deterrence. 
     
      
    63 In order to achieve that which we consider now to be the appropriate response to the Crown appeal we must depart from the general principle of sentencing stated in Pearce, and cannot do other than impose totally concurrent sentences. We are mindful of the fact that one of our reasons for finding error in the sentence imposed by Judge Ducker was his Honour’s failure to have sufficient regard to the fact that there were two deaths and the need for the sentences to reflect the increased criminality arising from that fact alone. However, his Honour’s error was that he determined to impose concurrent sentences for the wrong reason and the resulting overall sentence was inadequate. 
     
      
    64 We would allow the appeal and quash the sentences imposed by Acting Judge Ducker. In respect of each count the respondent should be sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 27 November 2003. The non-parole period is to expire on 26 November 2004 the date upon which the respondent is to be released to parole. It is to be a condition of his parole that he places himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    65 That is not to be regarded as the sentence that should have been imposed upon the respondent or which we believe is an appropriate one to punish the offences committed by him.

     BATHURST CITY COUNCIL v NOELENE JANICE CHEESMAN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 IPP JA: The respondent was injured on 6 February 2000 when she fell while visiting the Bathurst swimming pool. She claimed that the injuries she had suffered were caused by the negligence of the appellant, the appellant being the owner and operator of the pool and its surrounds. Goldring DCJ upheld her claim and awarded her damages. The appellant appeals contending that his Honour erred in so doing. 
     
      
    2 The fall occurred at about 10.30am. It was a bright, sunny day. The respondent, then aged sixty one, was taking her grandchildren, aged about five and eight at the time, to the pool. 
     
      
    3 The appellant charged members of the public for admission to the pool. The respondent paid the entry fee for herself and her two grandchildren. Having passed through the entrance, she walked quickly with her grandchildren along a footpath towards a pool used by smaller children. While so walking she tripped, fell and hurt herself. 
     
      
    4 The footpath was constructed of concrete pavers. One of the pavers had an edge that was slightly raised by about 20 millimetres, described by one of the respondent’s witnesses as “somewhere less than a 20 cent piece”. The respondent tripped over this raised edge. 
     
      
    5 The respondent testified that as she was walking, she did not look down and she was not looking particularly at the footpath. 
     
      
    6 Mr Kelly SC who, together with Mr McKenzie, appeared for the respondent submitted that the difference in height between the pavers was not obvious. 
     
      
    7 It is plain that the differential was not regarded by those who used the footpath as being particularly remarkable. It was the type of everyday minor hazard that visitors to the pool area could be expected to avoid. 
     
      
    8 The respondent’s expert witness observed that the concrete path had been laid for a considerable period of time and was constantly used. 
     
      
    9 The manager of the pool, Mr Riley, who had been manager for four years before the incident, had no knowledge of anyone else having fallen over the displaced paver. 
     
      
    10 Miss Fisher, who worked as an attendant and swimming instructor at the pool and had done so for two swimming seasons prior to the respondent’s fall, said that she walked across the path many times a day. By the time of the accident, she had been at the pool on more than 100 occasions. Neither she nor anyone else she observed or heard about had been impeded in any way by the displaced paver when walking along the path. 
     
      
    11 The trial judge considered that in these circumstances the appellant breached the duty of care it owed the respondent. He accepted that the respondent was guilty of contributory negligence which he assessed at 15 per cent. His Honour’s reasoning as to the liability of the appellant is reflected in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the Council - the Council as occupier, not as Council, and I emphasise that - had a duty of care to make the premises as safe as was reasonably possible in the circumstances, and that [included] the duty to eliminate unevenness in footpaths, which might not be eliminated if they were in a public street, but in commercial premises, constitute a potential hazard. 
        
       
       
        
        The Council did not fulfil that duty and I therefore find it liable to the plaintiff.” 
        
       
      
    12 The finding of 15 per cent contributory negligence was based on his Honour’s conclusion that the respondent was not looking precisely where she was going and in the conditions she could perhaps have done more. 
     
      
    13 The legal principles applicable to the present circumstances are well settled. The trial judge cited the remarks of Samuels J in Phillis v Daley (1988) 15 NSWLR 65 (at 67) which remain an apt statement of the duty upon occupiers, namely “the current law requires an occupier of premises to take reasonable care for the safety of persons entering upon them, bearing in mind what is reasonable”. 
     
      
    14 The trial judge correctly observed that irrespective of whether the duty of care upon an occupier arises by way of contract or under the common law, it is no more than a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill. The duty is no higher under contract than it is under the common law of negligence. The standard of care may be higher but this must depend on the relevant circumstances. 
     
      
    15 Here we are concerned with the care owed to a person who enters the grounds of the public bath along a footpath that in virtually every respect is akin to a footpath along a public road. 
     
      
    16 In David Jones Limited v Bates [2001] NSWCA 233 Davies AJA (with whom Heydon JA agreed on the issue) said (at [17]): 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of commercial premises, such as retail stores, and in the case of residential premises, the duty is more onerous than that which applies to a highway authority. Nevertheless, it remains a duty to take that care which a reasonable person would take having regard to foreseeable dangers. As Fitzgerald JA said in  
        Rasic v Cruz  
        [2000] NSWCA 66 at [42]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          `A shopkeeper owes a duty of care even to careless customers. However, a duty of care is not a general duty to protect careless people from the consequences of their own carelessness. The test of reasonable care is not whether the safety of the shop could be improved.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 In Francis v Lewis [2003] NSWCA 152 Mason P (with whom Hodgson JA and Tobias JA agreed) said (at [40]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Foreseeability of risk of injury is not determinative of breach of duty of care … The duty is one of reasonable care, not whether safety could have been improved by some modification. The duty is not confined to one owed to those who are careful for their own safety, but it is relevant to take into account that plaintiffs are themselves expected to act reasonably and take care for their own safety when determining what is reasonable”. 
        
       
      
    18 In Campbelltown City Council v Frew [2003] NSWCA 154 Mason P (with whom Santow JA and Tobias JA agreed) stated (at [33]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The ultimate question remains whether the respondent established that the Council was unreasonable in not doing more than it did, assuming that more could have been done"". 
        
       
      
    19 In Burwood Council v Byrnes [2002] NSWCA 343 Handley JA (with whom Beazley JA and Hodgson JA agreed) said (at [28]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Pedestrians … are in a position of relative advantage because they can generally protect themselves from uneven surfaces on footpaths and other public areas by keeping a lookout and taking care for their own safety. The position will be otherwise if the surface contains something unusual or unexpected which creates a real danger for ordinary pedestrians.” 
        
       
      
    20 In Brodie v Singleton Shire Council (2001) 206 CLR 512, where there was a differential in height of about 50 millimetres between a concreted footpath and the earth on the side of it, Gleeson CJ observed that the fact that there was an unevenness in a road or footpath which could result in a person stumbling or falling would not suffice to establish negligence. His Honour remarked (at 526, [6]-[7]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Not all footpaths are perfectly level. Many footpaths are unpaved. People are regularly required to walk on uneven surfaces on both public and private land. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Littler v Liverpool Corporation 
         [1968] 2 ALL ER 343 at 345 Cumming-Bruce J said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          `Uneven surfaces and differences in level between flagstones of about an inch may cause a pedestrian temporarily off balance to trip and stumble, but such characteristics have to be accepted.’” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ observed (at 581, [163]): 
       
       
        
        “It is in the nature of walking in the outdoors that the ground may not be as even, flat or smooth as other surfaces. As Callinan J points out in his reasons in  
        Ghantous 
        , persons ordinarily will be expected to exercise sufficient care by looking where they are going and perceiving and avoiding obvious hazards, such as uneven paving stones, tree roots or holes.” 
        
       
       
      Callinan J emphasised (at 639, [355]) that: 
       
       
        
        “It is not unreasonable to expect that people will see in broad daylight what lies ahead of them in the ordinary course as they walk along. No special vigilance is required for this.” 
        
       
      
    21 In Lombardi v Holroyd City Council [2002] NSWCA 252 the plaintiff tripped over a concrete slab in the footpath which was twenty five millimetres higher than the adjoining slab on one corner. Hodgson JA observed (at [32]): 
     
      
       
        
        “A plainly visible step of 25 millimetres in a footpath is [not] correctly regarded as high risk or unacceptable risk.” 
        
       
      
    22 In Burwood Council v Byrnes [2002] NSWCA 343 there was again a fall where one concrete paver had sunk to a lower level than others. The plaintiff tripped on the exposed side of the higher paver. The difference in levels was approximately 20 millimetres, the same as in this case. On appeal, the judgment of the trial judge who had found for the plaintiff was set aside. 
     
      
    23 Ryde City Council v Saleh [2004] NSWCA 219 followed Burwood Council v Byrnes. Sheller JA (with whom Mason P and Tobias JA agreed) remarked (at [18]) that it was curious that the trial judge had referred neither to Lombardi v Holroyd City Council nor Burwood Council v Byrnes. I would make the same comment in this case. 
     
      
    24 I do not think the fact that the respondent fell on a footpath that was not alongside a public highway affects the standard of care required of the appellant in this particular case. The remarks of Gleeson CJ in Brodie to which I have already referred emphasise that it is reasonable to expect uneven surfaces on private land as well as public land. This is not a case where a person has fallen inside a shop or indoor commercial premises where the surface of the floor might be expected to be even. Here, the respondent was walking in the open air, on a path traversed by many members of the public over many years. In essence, it was little different from a public footpath. There was no reason for the respondent to pay less attention to the level of the surface of the footpath on which she fell than on any public footpath. 
     
      
    25 Mr Riley, the manager, was aware of the higher differential but decided that it was not necessary to do anything about it. After the respondent fell, it took some three hours of work to grind down the difference. In my view, however, this does not establish that it was unreasonable for the appellant to have omitted to take these steps at an earlier time. 
     
      
    26 Following the reasoning of the authorities to which I have referred, I do not think that it was unreasonable of the appellant to have left the footpath in the way it was at the time that the accident took place. In my opinion, the trial judge erred in finding that the council failed to take reasonable steps for the safety of users of the footpath. 
     
      
    27 Accordingly, I would uphold the appeal with costs, set aside the orders made by the trial judge, order judgment for the appellant and order that the respondent pay the costs of the trial. The respondent to have a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 (NSW) if otherwise entitled. 
     
      
    28 McCOLL JA: I agree. 
     
      
    29 SPERLING J: I also agree. 
     
      
    30 IPP JA: The orders of the Court will be those I proposed.

      The principal issue on appeal 
       
      
    3 This appeal turns on whether the respondent, as the authority in charge of the Silverwater Prison, breached the duty of care it owed to the appellant while he was a prisoner there. 
     
      
    4 On 16 February 1990 the appellant was convicted in the District Court, on his own plea of guilty, of three counts involving sexual assaults on male persons under the age of 18 years. He was sentenced to a minimum term of two years and six months imprisonment and an additional term of ten months imprisonment. The minimum term was due to expire on 15 August 1992. 
     
      
    5 By September 1991 the appellant had been admitted to the prison work release programme. Under that programme the appellant left the gaol each working day to undertake paid employment. He returned to the gaol each evening. He had a room to himself in a group of buildings known as “the Units” which were located within a fenced off area in the Silverwater complex. 
     
      
    6 On the night of 21 September 1991 two or more assailants wearing balaclavas forced the lock of the appellant’s room, entered, and assaulted him with iron bars. He suffered serious injuries. 
     
      
    7 The appellant sued the respondent for damages for negligence. It was not in dispute that the respondent owed the appellant the duty of care described in the following terms by Mason P in State of New South Wales v Napier [2002] NSWCA 402 (at [75]) namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “The control vested in a prison authority is the basis of a special relationship which extends to a duty to take reasonable care to prevent harm stemming from the unlawful activities of third parties”. 
        
       
       
      The main question before the trial judge, Cooper DCJ, was whether the respondent had breached that duty of care. The appellant’s arguments did not find favour with his Honour and his claim was dismissed. 
       
      
    8 The critical passage in his Honour’s judgment that was subject to challenge on appeal was the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The defendant concedes that the supervision was minimal but says that it was appropriate in the light of the fact that the inmates in the units and Silverwater House had all passed through various tests and observations to the extent that they were trusted to go out into the community on works release and/or day leave. Accordingly they could be trusted not to inflict an assault upon a fellow inmate. In my view this is a reasonable conclusion for the authorities in charge of that prison to have reached.” 
        
       
      
    9 The appellant argues that his Honour should have held that, by providing only minimal supervision of the inmates in the Units, the respondent breached the duty of care it owed the appellant and, thereby, caused the appellant to suffer the injuries that were inflicted upon him. 
     
      
       
      A brief history of the appellant’s imprisonment 
       
      
    10 Prisoners convicted of sexual assaults on minors are known in prison as “rock spiders”. They are regarded with contempt by other prisoners and are often subjected to verbal and physical abuse by them. For this reason sexual offenders are sometimes placed in protective custody. The appellant did not wish to be placed under protection and attempted, while in gaol, to stay away from other paedophiles. He also attempted to keep secret the offences of which he had been convicted. He was, however, unsuccessful. 
     
      
    11 In 1991 there were three main categories of prisoner classification, A, B and C. Category C was the “lowest” category. There were sub-categories within Category C. Prisoners classified as C1 were kept behind a secured fence with minimal supervision. Prisoners with a C2 classification were kept in an open institutional environment with minimum security. Prisoners with a C3 classification could be permitted to leave the prison on work release and to obtain weekend leave, day leave and education leave. 
     
      
    12 After being sentenced, the appellant sought, from the start, to obtain a C3 classification and to be admitted to a work release programme.  
     
      
    13 He was first incarcerated at Parramatta Gaol. In July 1990 he was moved to Bathurst Gaol. By 26 July 1990 he had been classified as Level B. He was soon granted a C1 classification. In November 1990 he was given a C2 classification and was transferred to the Oberon Prison Farm. There he was taunted by other prisoners and called a rock spider. 
     
      
    14 In January 1991 the appellant was transferred from Oberon to the Kirkconnell Afforestation Camp. On 12 January 1991 the deputy superintendent of Oberon wrote to the superintendent of Kirkconnell in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The above inmate has been transferred to your institution for his own safety. This matter was discussed between yourself and me approximately two weeks ago. 
        
       
       
        
        Since that time pressure has been put on Bujdoso to prove to the inmates at Oberon as to what he is in gaol for. He has been able to withstand their demands until now and he was given deadline until tonight. 
        
       
       
        
        Bujdoso has never been on protection and does not wish to go on protection.  
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    15 The appellant experienced problems at Kirkconnell about three months after he had been taken there. He explained: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]here wasn’t much mingling between Oberon camp and Kirkconnell camp so it took a fair while before the word came through.” 
        
       
      
    16 In March 1991, at Kirkconnell, a prisoner entered the appellant’s room and assaulted him. The appellant told a prison officer about the assault but said that he did not want the matter taken any further. He did not report the incident formally because he thought that he would thereby break the code of gaol ethics and would be branded as a “dog”. Also, he did not want to jeopardise his movements through the prison system to his hoped for C3 category at Silverwater Prison.  
     
      
    17 In May 1991 the appellant was transferred to Silverwater. About three or four weeks after his arrival the other prisoners began to comment that he was a rock spider. 
     
      
    18 The appellant began to fear for his safety and spoke to Mr Edwards, the prison psychologist, about this. He also spoke to the officer in charge of the gardens, who gave him work near the main central administration building. This was a safer position than the more remote gardens. 
     
      
    19 In late July 1991 the appellant received an anonymous letter dated 26 July that concluded “What’s a rock spider like you doing at Silverwater? You asshole! Love from ‘the boys’ at Oberon”. The letter was implicitly threatening. The appellant showed it to the prison psychologist, Mr Edwards, and discussed it with him.  
     
      
    20 On 9 August 1991 the acting superintendent at Silverwater sent a memorandum to the superintendent in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Today 9/8/91, I was approached by the Welfare Officer Mrs Torda, in relation to prisoner Peter Andrew Bujdoso. I then spoke to Bujdoso in company with Mrs Torda. 
        
       
       
        
        Bujdoso told me that prisoner Craig Young was moved into [his] cell last night, and since that time was causing trouble by turning other prisoners against him. He requested that I move him to another section of the gaol.  
        
       
       
        
        The SAU being fully occupied, I arranged for him to be accommodated in Unicom House.  
        
       
       
        
        S P O R Brown at 2.15 pm informed me that he has been told by a prisoner that Bujdoso would not be safe in Unicom House.  
        
       
       
        
        I have instructed Mr Brown to immediately submit a report on this matter.” 
        
       
      
    21 Unicom House was an area within the Silverwater complex where drug and alcohol rehabilitation treatment was provided. It was known as the “D & A” Unit. On 9 August 1991 Mr Brown reported to the superintendent as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On commencing duties as SPO in the D & A unit I was informed by Mr Lehn that inmate Bujdoso 186369 was moved into the unit on Mr Lewis’ instructions. I have also been informed that the inmate was moved into the D & A because his cell mate had threatened him. I was also told that Bujdoso was a rock spider and that some of the inmates were going to flog him if he is not moved out of the D & A Unit. I have conveyed this message to Mr Lewis who has stated that Bujdoso is ‘there and is stopping there’. I wish it known that the onus is now on Mr Lewis should anything happen to this inmate. Furthermore Bujdoso is here even though he has not got a drug or alcohol problem so he will not be attending the classes which is part of the criteria to be moved into the D & A unit.” 
        
       
      
    22 Shortly after the appellant arrived at Unicom House he met with the deputy superintendent, Mr Rochford, and Mr Lewis. They asked him if he wanted to go back to Kirkconnell or stay at Silverwater. He replied that he felt that he would be safer on work release at Silverwater. He reasoned that if he obtained work he would be out of the gaol at about 5.30 am and would not return until 6.30 to 7.00 pm. He told the prison authorities that Mr Edwards, the prison psychologist, had informed him that at Silverwater he would be in much less danger in the work release section because the inmates there had all worked so hard to reach the work release stage and would not wish to jeopardise their position.  
     
      
    23 Mr Rochford and Mr Lewis asked the appellant to write out a statement recording what he had informed them, whereupon he wrote the following words: 
     
      
       
        
        “I Peter Bujdoso, feel that I am in no danger. I feel that other inmates will throw verbal abuse at me but I am firmly convinced that it is as far as it will go, I wish to remain at Silverwater.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant testified that these words reflected his own wishes. He wished to stay at Silverwater on work release and did not want to go into protective custody. 
       
      
    24 Eventually, in early September 1991, the appellant was transferred to the work release unit. Work was found for him outside the prison and he commenced that job on 12 September 1991. 
     
      
       
      Prisoner accommodation at Silverwater House and the Units 
       
      
    25 In 1991 the Silverwater prison complex housed only C category inmates, that is, categories C1, C2 and C3. When prisoners first came into Silverwater they were put in a dormitory area. When a vacancy occurred they were moved into another building known as Irwin House. Once prisoners were classified as C3 they were moved to another building, Silverwater House. When they obtained work release they moved to the Units.  
     
      
    26 The Units comprised four demountable units with two on one side of a walkway and two on the other side. Adjacent to one set of two was the administration block that accommodated the prison officer on duty. Each of the four accommodation units had a corridor down its centre with approximately nine rooms for the prisoners on each side. At each end of the corridor was a door that was kept open.  
     
      
    27 The Units involved single accommodation whereas the inmates at Silverwater House largely had to share rooms. The appellant was allocated a room at the end of a unit furthest from the walkway. That unit was the furthest unit from the administration block where the prison officer was stationed when he was on duty. The shower and toilet rooms were adjacent to his room. 
     
      
    28 Each of the rooms allocated to prisoners within the Units had a door in which was a small window and which was fitted with a night latch type lock. The lock could be opened from the inside by turning a knob. From the outside, it was designed to be opened only with a key. Each inmate was given a key that would open only his room. The prison officer on duty had a master key that could open all of the rooms. A curfew from 9.30 pm was imposed on prisoners and after this time they were only allowed to leave their rooms to go to the toilet or the bathroom. 
     
      
    29 There were about 50 inmates in Silverwater House. About 72 people lived in the Units. There was free access between Silverwater House and the Units. The Units and Silverwater House were, however, fenced off from the remainder of the Silverwater complex by means of a chain wire fence. The gate to that fence was locked at night. 
     
      
    30 Over a period of some months there was fairly regular movement of prisoners into Silverwater and out of it as prisoners were released. The population in Silverwater House and the Units changed from time to time. Prisoners from Unicom House were possibly accommodated in Silverwater House or the Units. This was likely to have been the cause of the appellant being recognised as a sex offender. 
     
      
      The system of supervision and security in the Units 
       
      
    31 Until towards the latter part of 1990, two officers worked on what was referred to as the “B watch” at Silverwater House and the Units. The B watch commenced at 10.30 pm and ended at 6.00 am the next morning. The watch involved a system of what was described as random checks undertaken “every couple of hours” at the Units.  
     
      
    32 One officer was stationed at Silverwater House and one at the Units. The officer on the B watch stationed at the Units would, when he first commenced duty, check the fence line separating the Units and Silverwater House from the rest of the complex. This involved walking around the inside of the perimeter of the fence for some 10 to 15 minutes. Thereafter, the officer stationed at Silverwater House would join the officer at the Units and together they would do a head count of prisoners. They would shine a torch through the window in the door of each room and satisfy themselves that each room was occupied and that the number of persons they counted coincided with the number that should have been present. Having completed this head count at one unit, the two officers would walk to the next unit and undertake a head count there. When all head counts had been completed at the Units the two officers would walk to Silverwater House where they would conduct a similar head count. 
     
      
    33 In late 1990, the system was changed by reducing the number of officers in Silverwater House and the Units to one. The second officer was moved to a different section of the Silverwater complex. Mr Mercer, who at the relevant time was an assistant superintendent at Silverwater, testified that the officers were reduced from two to one “because of the lack of custodial issues and the administrative and accountability role that they played”. It is apparent from other evidence given by Mr Mercer that, by “custodial issues” he meant issues involving the potential escape of the prisoners. “Accountability” involved head counting. It does not seem from Mr Mercer’s testimony that any thought was given to the personal safety of the prisoners residing in the Units.  
     
      
    34 The effect of the reduction in officers meant that for substantial periods within every two hours there was no officer at the Units and the prisoners were left entirely alone there. 
     
      
    35 The lock on the appellant’s room door was flimsy and out of date. It could be forced open fairly easily. Its purpose was merely to give privacy to the inmates. As the trial judge found, “it was never intended to keep out a person or persons who might be striving to enter the room with felonious intent”. 
     
      
       
      The assault and its aftermath 
       
      
    36 On the night of 21 September 1991, the appellant came home from work and locked the door to his room. At about 11.00 pm he saw a face looking through the window in the door. He got out of bed, saw the door being pushed, and put his shoulder against it. The door was forced open, however, and three or four men burst into the room. They were wearing balaclavas. They severely assaulted him with iron bars. He suffered a fractured skull, broken left thumb, his left arm was put in a cast and his back, arm and leg were painful. 
     
      
    37 When the assault was investigated, those prepared to make a statement testified that they heard scuffles, noises and screaming.  
     
      
    38 At the time of the assault, an officer named Mr Lehn was the person undertaking the B watch. While he checked the perimeter of the fence, there was no one in the guard station in the Units. When he went to Silverwater House to do the head count there, there was again no officer present at the Units.  
     
      
    39 After the assault the appellant was moved from the Units. Mr Lehn thought that the appellant would not be safe in the Units. The appellant was returned, against his wishes, to Kirkconnell where he spent the remainder of his sentence. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s reasons for providing minimal supervision at the Units 
       
      
    40 Before an inmate achieved a C3 classification he had to meet specified criteria and complete a trial period. The C3 candidate would then go to Silverwater House where he would be given pre-work release weekend leaves. If he completed two or three separate day leaves successfully, he would be allowed to go on work release. He would then progress from Silverwater House to the Units. Overall, the assessment process took 12 weeks.  
     
      
    41 The respondent contended that the prisoners who had reached the Units with a C3 classification and were on work release had established that they were persons who could be trusted. The appellant agreed with this. 
     
      
    42 Because of the trust that the prison authorities placed in the work release inmates, they considered that no special steps were considered necessary to ensure the inmates’ safety from each other.  
     
      
    43 The evidence was that the incidence of assaults in the Units prior to September 1991 was very low. According to the respondent, this was because the inmates had too much to lose if found to be involved in that kind of conduct. They would lose their work release and weekend leave entitlements and could be sent back to another prison.  
     
      
    44 For these reasons the respondent took the view that, once prisoners had moved into the works release units, it was in order for supervision and surveillance by prison staff to be minimal. As Cooper DCJ put it: 
     
      
       
        
        “This was because the inmates had passed through every possible check that the classification officers could come up with to determine that they were about as low a risk of committing further offences in or out of gaol as could be estimated.” 
        
       
       
      Did the respondent take reasonable steps for the safety of the appellant?  
       
      
    45 Prison authorities owe a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of prisoners during their detention in custody: Howard v Jarvis (1958) 98 CLR 177. This duty includes taking reasonable care to prevent harm stemming from the unlawful activities of other prisoners: State of New South Wales v Napier (see cases cited by Mason P at [75]), Ashrafi Persian Trading Co Pty Ltd v Ashrafinia [2002] Aust Torts Reports 81-636 (see cases cited by Heydon JA at 68,335). 
     
      
    46 This duty arises from the control exercised by the prison authorities over prisoners and the vulnerability of the prisoners over whom they have control: State of New South Wales v Godfrey & Godfrey [2004] NSWCA 113. 
     
      
    47 Lack of proper supervision of prisoners can readily constitute a breach of the duty of care. In Ellis v Home Office [1953] 2 All ER 149, Singleton LJ said (at 154): 
     
      
       
        
        “The duty on those responsible for one of Her Majesty’s prisons is to take reasonable care for the safety of those who are within, and that includes those who are within against their wish or will, of whom the plaintiff was one. If it is proved that supervision is lacking, and that accused persons have access to instruments, and that an incident occurs of a kind such as might be anticipated, I think it might well be said that those who are responsible for the good government of the prison have failed to take reasonable care for the safety of those under their care.” 
        
       
      
    48 In considering whether a prison authority has complied with the duty of care imposed upon it, it is self-evidently relevant to determine whether it knew or should have known of the risk that a prisoner might be assaulted by other prisoners, and the extent of that risk: see Ellis v Home Office (at 161), Ralph v Strutton (1969) 62 Qd R 348 (at 356-358) and L v Commonwealth of Australia (1976) 10 ALR 269 (at 273-274). 
     
      
    49 In the present case the trial judge held that the approach of the respondent was reasonable; he found that it was reasonable for the prison authorities to rely on the trust they placed in the C3 prisoners and the incentive for good behaviour established by the work release system. As I have mentioned, this is the principal finding that is challenged in the appeal. 
     
      
    50 The first point to take into account is that, despite the trust placed by the respondent in C3 prisoners in the Units, that trust had not always been honoured.  
     
      
    51 There was one known incident where that trust was seriously abused. An inmate of the Units, while at Long Bay, had given information to the authorities regarding the location of a handgun in the Central Industrial Prison. As a result, he was moved to Silverwater and placed in the Units. A $20,000 contract was placed on his life. Two other inmates in the Units took up that contract. The informer was fire bombed while in the Units. This occurred prior to the assault on the appellant. 
     
      
    52 Although Mr Mercer described the general incidence of assaults at Silverwater as “very low”, other minor incidents of breach of trust appear to have been well-known. Mr Mercer described these as “indiscretions”. These involved prisoners in the Units returning drunk and “trying to smuggle drugs or booze”. A problem that, by the time of the assault, had not been resolved was that at times, at night, certain unknown inmates would go over the perimeter fence and walk to the Silverwater Speedboat Club. There they consumed alcohol and indulged in other activities. The authorities were trying to stop this practice. By the time of the assault they had been unsuccessful. 
     
      
    53 In addition, from time to time objects were found in the Units that, by their nature, suggested that they had been acquired and retained by inmates for some unlawful purpose. These included, for example, knuckledusters, balaclavas made out of beanies and metal bars, such as those with which the appellant was struck. 
     
      
    54 In order to prevent the importation of potentially dangerous metal objects into the Units, the respondent had implemented a system of searching inmates when they returned from work. According to Mr Mercer, “we had metal detectors at the time, hand-held wands, and inmates that came back from work were all searched, mainly body searched, if we believed that there was an issue they were stripped searched, but, as I said, we didn’t perceive at the time a risk …”.  
     
      
    55 Nevertheless, there were other means by which prisoners could, undetected, bring pieces of metal such as metal bars into the Units. Nearby the Units (and part of the Silverwater prison complex) was a factory known as the Silverwater Light Engineering Factory (SLEF). Mr Mercer said that it was relatively easy to get pieces of metal out of the SLEF. When asked whether prisoners could get metal bars into the Units, Mr Mercer replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “That area was open during the day and I believe that’s, yes, a fair response. If an inmate actually wanted to walk up there with a piece of metal and an officer wasn’t in the area at the time, sure”. 
        
       
      
    56 Mr Lehn confirmed that, from time to time, metal objects, coming from SLEF, had been found in the Units. These were confiscated and reports on them were submitted to the Governor. He presumed that bars, such as those used in the assault on the appellant had been found in the past in the Units. 
     
      
    57 Thus, the persuasive force of inmates having a lot to lose if they were involved in unlawful conduct was by no means foolproof. 
     
      
    58 I now turn to the knowledge that the respondent had that the appellant was at risk of being assaulted while in the Units. 
     
      
    59 The starting point is that the appellant had been convicted of sexual assaults on minors and for that reason alone was, to the respondent’s knowledge, potentially at risk of being attacked by other prisoners. 
     
      
    60 To the knowledge of the respondent, the appellant had been threatened at Oberon and threatened and in fact assaulted at Kirkconnell. He had to leave these places for his own safety. 
     
      
    61 At Silverwater he had received the anonymous threatening letter and had been called a rock spider. In a report dated 26 September 1991, Mr Edwards stated that the appellant had “often reported incidents in which he had been threatened, vilified or humiliated”. Mr Edwards testified: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those issues came up in ongoing discussions about whether or not [the appellant] could be maintained safely at Silverwater”. 
        
       
       
      He said that that information “was related to other staff in case discussions, direct discussions of how well he could be managed”. 
       
      
    62 The fact that the appellant signed a document stating that he did not fear for his safety does not detract from the actual knowledge of those in control of the Units that his safety was at risk. Indeed, the fact that Mr Rochford and Mr Lewis asked him to make a statement to that effect indicates that they appreciated that he was at risk and did not want to be blamed should the risk materialise.  
     
      
    63 The trial judge rightly found that the history of the appellant, as known to the prison authorities, “was one where there was a potential that the [appellant] could be subjected to physical violence”.  
     
      
    64 In these circumstances, I consider that the respondent did breach the duty of care it owed the appellant and the judge erred in finding to the contrary. The system of trusting the C3 prisoners had not always worked, there had been a serious assault in the past and virtually continuous minor infractions. The respondent had reduced to one the number of guards on duty at the Units for reasons unrelated to prisoner safety. Importantly, the respondent had actual knowledge that the appellant was at risk. Nevertheless, it took no additional steps to protect him. Those in control and who knew that the appellant had been threatened did not even inform the guard at the Units (Mr Lehn) of this fact, and did not even provide the appellant with a more secure lock on his door. Nothing was done. In my view that was negligent. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    65 I would uphold the appeal with costs, set aside the orders made by the trial judge, declare that the respondent breached the duty of care that it owed the appellant and remit the matter to the District Court for a trial as to damages.

     Regina v Ian Craig Styman 
      
     Regina v Peter David Taber 
     
     
      
    On 19 January 2001, Mrs Joy Golbie Alchin was found dead in her house at 23 Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point. Mrs Alchin was lying face down on a mattress on her bedroom floor. Her wrists and ankles were tied together with grey duct tape and cable ties. There was a pair of underpants folded to form a wad against Mrs Alchin’s mouth and a pillowcase had been placed over her head. There was duct tape wound tightly around her mouth, lower jaw and neck. According to an autopsy report tendered by the Crown, Mrs Alchin had died between 1pm on 5 January 2001 and 12pm on 19 January 2001, but more likely some time between 16 and 18 January 2001. The immediate cause of death was smothering and dehydration associated with restraint. 
     
      
    It was the Crown case that the appellants, Ian Styman and Peter Taber, together with Shannon Styman, broke into Mrs Alchin’s house in the early hours of 7 January 2001, bound and gagged her, robbed her of over $23,000 and then abandoned her. The appellants, in their evidence at trial, contended that Shannon Styman, without their participation, attacked Mrs Alchin and tied her up before arriving at Taber’s house at 3am on 7 January 2001. The appellants, on this basis, denied playing any part in the attack. Shannon Styman, however, asserted that he was part of a joint attack and pleaded guilty before the trial began to the charge of robbery in company of the other two offenders and gave evidence accordingly. 
     
      
    For the charge of murder the Crown relied upon that part of s18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 which provides that murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act or omission of the accused, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life. The Crown case against each accused in relation to murder was therefore based on an omission to rescue Mrs Alchin when at the time of the omission the accused fully realised that the omission would probably cause her death.  
     
      
    The trial involved an extensive examination of evidence from the appellants, Shannon Styman, experts and other lay witnesses. Significant, for the purposes of this appeal is the undisputed fact that on 7 January 2001, Ian Styman made a 000 telephone call from a pay phone on Greenwell Point Road, Nowra East reporting a break and enter in Spies Avenue. This call was not acted upon. 
     
      
    On 11 December 2002, the jury returned verdicts against Taber and Ian Styman of guilty of murder and of aggravated robbery but not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and against Shannon Styman of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and not guilty of aggravated sexual assault.  
     
      
    The trial Judge sentenced Taber for the offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing therein a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation to imprisonment for twenty years and for the murder of Mrs Alchin to imprisonment for life. The same sentences were imposed on Ian Styman. Shannon Styman was sentenced for the offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing therein a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation to imprisonment for eight years and for the unlawful killing of Mrs Alchin to imprisonment for fourteen years with a non-parole period of nine years expiring on 25 March 2011. 
     
      
    On appeal, the appellants submitted that the trial Judge erred in law in not directing verdicts of acquittal on all counts at the close of the Crown case on the basis that there was no evidence that the conduct of the appellants caused the death of Mrs Alchin. It was also contended that his Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly in respect of murder, manslaughter, the legal duty to rescue, causation and joint enterprise. Other grounds of appeal relied on by the appellants included that the verdicts of the jury on all counts were unreasonable and that the sentences imposed were excessive. 
     
      
    Held: 
     
      
    Causation – the attribution of casual responsibility 
     
      
    1. The basic proposition relating to causation in homicide is that an accused’s conduct, whether by act or omission, must contribute significantly to the death of the victim. It need not be the sole, direct or immediate cause of the death. 
     
      
       
      Royall v The Queen  
      1990 172 CLR 378 
       
      
    2. It was clear enough that Mrs Alchin’s death would not have occurred but for the omission on the part of the appellants to remove her from danger after the 000 call. It was also clear that, had the operator passed on the call as she should have, Mrs Alchin would have been rescued and would not have died. It was a matter for the jury whether, in these circumstances, inaction by the appellants should be seen as having significantly contributed to Mrs Alchin’s death. It was an error by the trial Judge not to leave that question to the jury. 
     
      
    3. However, on the facts of this case, there was no reasonable prospect that the jury would fail to find that the appellants’ omission caused Mrs Alchin’s death. It follows that the error did not lead to a miscarriage of justice and no appeal lies on this account. 
     
      
    Refusal to direct verdicts of acquittal 
     
      
    4. The applications made for directed verdicts of acquittal at the conclusion of the Crown case were made on the narrow basis that there was no evidence that the conduct of the appellants caused Mrs Alchin’s death. However, there was evidence of that element in the Crown case and indeed, there was no reasonable prospect that the jury, properly directed, might have found otherwise. The trial Judge’s decision to refuse the applications was correct. 
     
      
    Directions on murder and manslaughter  
     
      
    5. There can be no doubt that in the summing up, both orally and in the written directions and in the written questions the trial Judge adequately distinguished between the forms of homicide which were relevant, namely, manslaughter by criminal negligence and murder. 
     
      
    6. It was made clear to the jury that the omission to act was not by itself sufficient to constitute murder. There had to be an accompanying relevant mental state, that is, that the accused fully realised at the time of the omission that the probable consequence would be Mrs Alchin’s death. The relevant distinctions between murder and manslaughter were clearly stated by the trial Judge.  
     
      
    Directions on joint enterprise 
     
      
    7. No coherent argument was put by counsel for the appellants which suggested any error in the trial Judge’s summing up in relation to joint enterprise. 
     
      
    Whether verdicts unreasonable 
     
      
    8. Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that the verdict of a jury may be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. Accordingly, this Court was required to undertake an independent examination of the evidence in order to determine whether the jury, acting reasonably, should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 
     
      
    9. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict against each appellant that on or about 6 January 2001, in circumstances of aggravation, they broke and entered Mrs Alchin’s dwelling and there committed a serious indictable offence, namely, whilst in company with each other robbing her of her money and, at the time of committing such offence, depriving her of her liberty. 
     
      
    10. However, there was one crucial matter which gave rise to a doubt about whether the appellants were guilty of murder for reason that they caused Mrs Alchin’s death by an act or omission done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life. In order to convict the appellants for murder, the jury had at least to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, in the time that passed after the 000 call was made and before Mrs Alchin died, they became aware that she had not been, and would not be, rescued and thereby fully realised that she would probably die. 
     
      
    11. The possibility that Mrs Alchin had not been rescued had to be weighed against the high probability, amounting to virtual certainty, that the 000 call would be acted upon. The likelihood that the operator would forget or otherwise fail to communicate such a call to the police was extremely remote. 
     
      
    12. The possibilities concerning the belief of the appellants as to what had happened to Mrs Alchin, which might flow from lack of publicity in the media or information from other members of the family, were highly speculative and amounted to little more than suspicion. There was no direct evidence to support a finding that the appellants were aware that Mrs Alchin had not been rescued. Even if it could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants realised by 15 or 16 January that Mrs Alchin had not been rescued, it could not be concluded that she was then alive. 
     
      
    13. It follows that it was not open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that, at any time before she died, the appellants fully realised that Mrs Alchin would die unless they rescued her. Accordingly, the conviction of each appellant of murder should be quashed. 
     
      
    14. The convictions for aggravated robbery stand. 
     
      
    The sentences  
     
      
    15. The trial Judge’s finding on sentencing that the appellants realised after twenty-four hours that the 000 call was ineffective and yet still left Mrs Alchin bound and disabled, knowing she would probably not be rescued in time, was regarded by his Honour as a serious aggravating feature of the offence of aggravated breaking entering and stealing. Given the findings of this Court, that the jury was not entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants realised before Mrs Alchin died that she had not been rescued and would probably die, this finding on sentencing could not stand; s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    16. It will be necessary to hear submissions on re-sentencing the appellants for the offence of aggravated breaking and entering. 
     
      
    Whether there should be a new trial on the alternative count of manslaughter 
     
      
    17. Section 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that where an appellant has been convicted of an offence, and the jury could on the indictment have found the appellant guilty of some other offence, the Court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of the other offence. 
     
      
    18. The Court sought written submissions from the parties as to whether it would be appropriate to exercise the power under s7(2). The appellants submitted that there should be a new trial; the Crown did not ask the Court to substitute a verdict of manslaughter. The parties did not, of course, have the benefit of this judgment when making these submissions. 
     
      
    19. In the circumstances, the Court has formed the view that it should order that the verdicts of murder be quashed and that there should be new trials on the charge of manslaughter but that the Crown will have liberty to apply for an order substituting a verdict of manslaughter in relation to either or both appellants in lieu of the order for a new trial, provided such leave is exercised within 28 days from the date of this judgment.

      The Court 
      : 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 On Friday, 19 January 2001, Mrs Joy Golbie Alchin was found dead in her house at 23 Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point by Phillip George Reeves, who with his wife, Sheila MacGillivray Reeves, was the proprietor of a service station in the Greenwell Point area. Mrs Alchin was lying face down on a mattress on her bedroom floor. Her ankles were tied together with grey duct tape and four black cable ties, two around each ankle, with one from each pair tied through the other to secure the ankles together. The wrists were tied in a similar way, though more tightly than the ankles. There were two cable ties around the left wrist, one looped through the other. There was a pair of underpants folded to form a wad across Mrs Alchin’s mouth, which had been covered by a pillowcase over her head. There was duct tape wound tightly around her mouth, lower jaw and neck. It was the Crown case that the appellant, Peter David Taber, the appellant, Ian Craig Styman and Shannon Styman broke into Mrs Alchin’s house in the early hours of 7 January 2001, bound and gagged her, robbed her of over $23,000 in cash and then abandoned her.

    2 On 9 September 2002, Taber, Ian Styman and Shannon Styman were jointly indicted on charges: firstly, that between 5 and 19 January 2001 they murdered Joy Golbie Alchin; secondly, that on or about 6 January 2001 in circumstances of aggravation they broke and entered the dwelling of Joy Golbie Alchin situated at Spies Road and there committed a serious indictable offence, namely, whilst in company with each other did rob her of her money and at the time of committing such offence did deprive her of her liberty; and, thirdly, in the alternative to count 2, that on or about 6 January 2001 they entered the dwelling house of Joy Golbie Alchin with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely, to steal her property and at the time of committing such offence knew that there was a person in the dwelling house.  
     
      
    3 For the charge of murder the Crown relied upon that part of s18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 which provides that murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, “was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life”.  
     
      
    4 In R v Crabbe (1985) 156 CLR 464 the High Court in a joint judgment of five members, after referring to some differences of opinion in the Court as to whether the knowledge which an accused person must possess in order to render him or her guilty of murder when an actual intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm is lacking, must be a knowledge of the probability that the act will cause death or grievous bodily harm or whether knowledge of a possibility is enough, said at 469: 
     
      
       
        
        “The conclusion that a person is guilty of murder if he commits a fatal act knowing that it will probably cause death or grievous bodily harm but (absent an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm) is not guilty of murder if he knew only that his act might possibly cause death or grievous bodily harm is not only supported by a preponderance of authority but is sound in principle. The conduct of a person who does an act, knowing that death or grievous bodily harm is a probable consequence, can naturally be regarded for the purposes of the criminal law as just as blameworthy as the conduct of one who does an act intended to kill or to do grievous bodily harm. Indeed, on one view, a person who does an act knowing its probable consequences may be regarded as having intended those consequences to occur.” 
        
       
       
      Ultimately, the Crown case against each accused was based on an omission which caused Mrs Alchin’s death when at the time of the omission the accused fully realised that the omission would probably cause her death. 
      
    5 The trial began on 2 September 2002 before Barr J and a jury. The appellants pleaded not guilty to all charges. On 3 September 2002, Shannon Styman pleaded guilty to the second count on the indictment but maintained his plea of not guilty to the other counts. The Crown case was that each accused committed the offences charged jointly, with the others, in a criminal enterprise. Shannon Styman’s plea of guilty on the second count subsumed the third alternative count so that he went to trial on the first and fourth counts alone. Taber and Ian Styman were convicted on the first and second counts. In respect of the first count, Shannon Styman was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. All three were acquitted on the fourth charge of aggravated sexual intercourse. 
     
      
       
      Summary of the Crown case 
       
      
    6 The Crown tendered an autopsy report prepared by a pathologist, Dr Peter Graham Bradhurst. According to that report, Mrs Alchin had died between 1 pm on 5 January 2001 and 12 pm on 19 January 2001, “but more likely some time between the 16th and 18th January 2001”. (The uncertainty about the date of death has some significance and is further discussed below.) Because the pillowcase was fairly loose over Mrs Alchin’s head and because she had not sustained any immediately life-threatening injury, it was possible that she had survived for a reasonable period of time even though she had been bound and gagged. The immediate cause of death was smothering and dehydration associated with restraint. The smothering was described as an obstruction to the airway from the underwear placed over Mrs Alchin’s mouth and held firmly with the duct tape. The fabric of the pillowcase would have interfered with the airflow through the pillowcase and into her lungs. Her nasal passage was not blocked. In the position she was in, any gaps for airway would have been blocked, though she may not have been in that position continuously. The dominant cause of death was dehydration though the smothering would have come at the end of her life when she was comatose and not able to remove the pillowcase from the front of her face. In her weakened state, she would have had a reduced ability to breathe and the pillowcase would have caused a lack of airflow when contaminated by the fluids of her nose and mouth.  
     
      
    7 Mrs Alchin had received a blow to the left side of her mouth causing two lacerations. These lacerations on Mrs Alchin’s mouth were consistent with her having fallen off the bed and hitting her face. Abrasions to her buttocks were consistent with her having wriggled herself across the floor by moving her feet and back and shoulders. 
     
      
    8 A fingerprint expert found no identifiable prints on the surrounding doorframes of Mrs Alchin’s house nor on selected items in the house nor on the duct tape wrapped around her ankles, wrists and mouth.  
     
      
    9 At 4.54 am on 7 January 2001, Ian Styman made a 000 telephone call from a pay phone on Greenwell Point Road, Nowra East. In this call the following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “No one there” 
         
        “Hello” 
         
        “Oh, hello” 
         
        “Could you send a car out please?” 
         
        “Where to?” 
         
        “Spies” 
         
        “Where?” 
         
        “Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point” 
         
        “What’s happening there?” 
         
        “There was a couple of blokes that went in with guns, second house from the corner” 
         
        “What do you mean … a couple of blokes went in?” 
         
        “That went in the house, there’s a little old lady there…” 
         
        “Break and enter?” 
         
        “I can’t talk but they’re, they’re here ..” 
         
        “What…what number?…” 
        
       
       
      Ian Styman then terminated the call. 
       
      
    10 The call was taken by Anne Maher, a communications operator at the Police Communications Centre (VKG Warilla) and should have been entered on to a Computerised Incidence Dispatch System (CIDS). This would have caused the message to be electronically forwarded to a radio operator who would then broadcast the job. In this case, no CIDS message was entered. Accordingly, the message went no further than Ms Maher and was not acted upon. 
     
      
    11 We now return to the evidence concerning the date of Mrs Alchin’s death. It is clear that she died between 7 and 19 January 2001 and there can be little doubt that she lived for some days after 7 January. The question is, of course, how long. The Opinion of Dr Bradhurst as stated in his autopsy report was that Mrs Alchin “died some time between…5 January 2001 and…19 January 2001 but more likely some time between 16 and 18 January 2001” (emphasis added). That this is expressed in less than certain terms is unremarkable, but it certainly could not justify a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that death occurred no earlier than 16 January. We mention the standard of proof because it was crucial to the Crown’s case on murder that the evidence established both that the appellants realized that it was probable that Mrs Alchin would die and that that realization preceded her death, for the obvious reason that the criminal conduct was the omission to rescue her. Each of these facts had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. This did not mean that the actual date of death had to be proved to this standard but it did mean, in our view, that it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove that the realization of the probability of death (if established) must have occurred prior to that date, whenever it was. In other words, on the assumption that the appellants indeed realized that Mrs Alchin had not been rescued, if it was reasonably possible that they did not come to this realization until after she had died, they must be acquitted of her murder. It is also obvious that the date of death (after the first few days) was not a matter of common sense: the jury could go no further than the expert opinion, in the absence of any other relevant evidence on the point. The cause of death did not indicate its date. Dr Bradhurst, the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy stated in his tendered report, under the heading Estimation of time of death: 
     
      
       
        
        “In view of the post-mortem appearances, the relational temperatures for the period and the absence of attack by flies and maggot infestation until after the body was found and taking into account Dr Ryan’s assessment (with which I agree), in my opinion death  
        most likely 
         occurred two to four days prior to the autopsy, that is any time between 16 and 18 January 2001, but death occurring even before 16 January cannot be entirely excluded. [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
       
        
        Because the pillow slip was fairly loosely over her head and because she had not sustained any immediately life-threatening injury, it is quite possible she survived for a reasonable period of time even though she had been bound and gagged.” 
        
       
      
    12 Dr Bradhurst was not cross-examined about the difference, if any, he sought to convey by the phrases “more likely” in the Opinion and “most likely” in the Estimation. It was probably a distinction without a difference. In cross-examination, Dr Bradhurst agreed that, in his opinion the deceased died “very close to the time she was discovered”, based on the degree of decomposition. He agreed that the fact that a blanket wet with urine was found adjacent to her body confirmed the conclusion that the deceased “passed away close, very close” to the time of discovery. He was not asked to interpret this time frame in terms of days. However, in speaking of bruises, he said that he used the word “recent” in a very liberal sense. During further cross-examination Dr Bradhurst said that 16 January was probably but “definitely not necessarily” the earliest date of death (emphasis added). In re-examination, Dr Bradhurst confirmed that his opinion remained as he had stated it in the autopsy report, namely, “that it is more likely [that death occurred] sometime between 16 and 18 January 2001” than earlier. For completeness, we should mention that Dr Ryan (the Government Medical Officer) who was present when Mrs Alchin’s body was found, estimated that she had been dead for some 72 hours. That Mrs Alchin died no earlier than 16 January was, on the expert evidence, no more than a mere probability. The evidence (set out below) of Mrs Alchin’s neighbour Mrs Batchelor as to an offensive smell apparently coming from Mrs Alchin’s house being evident four or five days before discovery of her body was unknown to Dr Bradhurst and was unfortunately not brought to his attention during his evidence. Mrs Batchelor’s evidence raises the reasonable possibility that Mrs Alchin died at least six or seven days before discovery, namely 12 or 13 January, allowing not only for a substantial degree of putrefaction but also time for the smell to reach Mrs Batchelor’s house, bearing in mind that the external windows and doors of Mrs Alchin’s house were closed.13 Thus, the direction to the jury that Mrs Alchin “continued to live for a further nine to eleven days” as a given and established fact, with respect, significantly overstated the actual effect of the expert evidence which was all one way. The jury were, indeed, reminded of the evidence that “16th to the 18th January is the time at which Dr Bradhurst thinks that the deceased most probably died” but this was immediately followed by the direction “you would have to regard the 16th January…as the date of death, because you have to treat the matter conservatively”. No point was taken as to this question either at the trial or in this appeal. We mention it merely as showing that, in dealing with the element of the appellants’ realization of the probability of death, the jury very likely considered the issue upon a mistaken view of the evidence. It is also material to the ground of appeal requiring this Court to consider whether the verdict of the jury was unreasonable. 
     
      
    14 In the result, no conclusion was capable of being drawn beyond probability, though perhaps high probability, that Mrs Alchin had died by 16 January. How long before that date she may have died must be speculative, increasing in certainty no doubt as the period extended backward.  
     
      
    15 Mrs Alchin regularly placed grocery orders by telephone with Mr and Mrs Reeves each Wednesday. The orders were delivered to Mrs Alchin’s home on Friday afternoons by one or other of the Reeves. Their last contact with Mrs Alchin occurred on 24 December 2000, when she called to say that there had been an attempted break-in the night before and she wanted some padlocks. They were delivered on 5 January, which was the last occasion that Mrs Reeves saw Mrs Alchin. No order was placed after 5 January 2001. Eventually this caused Mr and Mrs Reeves concern. On 19 January 2001, Mr Reeves went to Mrs Alchin’s house. He climbed over the front gate and knocked repeatedly on the front door. He then went around the side and climbed over the side gate. Both gates were padlocked. When he went around to the back of the house he noticed that the outside back light was on and the back door was half open. There was also a locked security door, on which was a note written by David Geoffrey Bennett.  
     
      
    16 In early January 2001, Mr Bennett had met Mrs Alchin at her home and at her request measured the back door for the installation of a new security door, which he installed on Monday, 8 January 2001. Before going to the premises on that day he had rung and received no answer. When he attended he found the back door open and ajar. He called out but got no response and proceeded to fit the security door. He then locked it and left a note attached to the bars of the back door stating that he had left the key with a neighbour. Mr Reeves retrieved that key from that neighbour and used it to unlock the security door and enter Mrs Alchin’s house. After finding her body, he called the police. 
     
      
    17 On about 19 December 2000, Mrs Alchin had told an acquaintance, Graeme Saville Cox, that someone had tried to break into her house. She mentioned that things had been moved around in her shed. In late December or early January, Mrs Alchin rang Mr Cox and said that someone had tried to get in her front door with a piece of plastic. He advised her to install a security door for her back door and organised this. Around Christmas 2000, Mrs Alchin told another acquaintance that someone had tried to break into her house and that she was going to install the security door. On Christmas Eve 2000, Mrs Alchin told Mr and Mrs Reeves that her house had been the subject of an attempted burglary. She had been asleep when she heard a noise. She turned on her light and scared off the intruder. She said she was worried about security and placed an order for padlocks. Mrs Reeves delivered the padlocks to Mrs Alchin and was told that a piece of plastic had been used to get in her front door. Mrs Reeves saw it in Mrs Alchin’s hands. It was the size of a credit card. 
     
      
    18 On 24 December 2000, Constable Olivia Shephard attended Mrs Alchin’s house. Mrs Alchin said that her back shed had been broken into and something was wedged in her front door. Constable Shephard saw a white plastic card jammed in the door. Mrs Alchin opened the front door. Constable Shephard removed the card. There were no jemmy marks on the door. Mrs Alchin was advised to keep her front security door locked. Mrs Alchin told Constable Shephard that the key was broken off inside it. On 28 December 2000, Murray Aston, a locksmith, came to Mrs Alchin’s house and changed the lock on her front security door. Mrs Alchin believed that someone had a key. At the same time, she told Mr Aston that she wanted a new rear door. She paid Mr Aston in cash with pre- polymer banknotes.  
     
      
    19 Several people visited Mrs Alchin’s house in January 2001. On 5 January, Barry Milsim Irving, an electrician, went there and saw that her front mailbox had been broken off. On 8 January, Kevin Stuart Garrett went to read Mrs Alchin’s meter. He usually entered through the front gate but on this occasion he found the gate had a padlock. On 12 January, George Francis Cross from the Greenwell Point Post Office delivered mail to the house. He saw Mrs Alchin from time to time on his run and had got to know her. On occasions, she would give him a cheque and a bill for payment, which he would do for her and return the next day with a receipt. He noticed a padlock on Mrs Alchin’s front gate for the first time. Her mailbox was not outside as it usually was. Her practice was to take it in at night and bring it back outside in the mornings.  
     
      
    20 Mr and Mrs Batchelor, who had lived in Greenwell Point for well over thirty years, had been Mrs Alchin’s neighbour for about three years before her death. She said that she never saw Mrs Alchin except for glimpses through the palings of the back fence when she was hanging out her washing. She only spoke to her once, a telephone conversation, when Mrs Alchin offered her some grapefruit. About four or five days before Mrs Alchin’s body was found Mrs Batchelor noticed a very bad smell – she described as like a dead rat – that she thought at first came from her own laundry or toilet, but which obviously came from Mrs Alchin’s house. For obvious reasons, this evidence strongly suggested that Mrs Alchin had died some days before 14 or 15 January.  
     
      
    21 Mrs Rutter, who was born in 1959, gave evidence that her mother moved to her house in Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point in about 1977 or 1978 and that she went to live there with her in 1982, having previously lived with her father for some years. Mrs Alchin had three sisters, Cheryl Ravell, Margaret Jones and Marie Gale and three brothers, Gordon (who was deceased), Allan and Kevin Ravell. Mrs Alchin enjoyed good health. She would go out from time to time to visit friends and go shopping. However, Mrs Alchin did not drive and did not like to go out on her own. She was security conscious and would not open the door to strangers. Mrs Rutter did not suggest that, aside from the fact that her mother liked to have company when she went out, she was a recluse. In 1989 a dispute arose between them and Mrs Rutter did not see her mother again from that time. However, it appears that she kept in contact by telephone. Sometime in the late 1990’s they fell out again. The two last spoke in October 2000 but the evidence does not otherwise disclose the frequency of their contact. Mrs Rutter was not asked and did not give evidence about any communications, direct or indirect, with the appellants.  
     
      
    22 Another sister, Margaret Jones, said that she had had contact with Mrs Alchin until 1997, when they fell out. Mrs Jones would visit Mrs Alchin and take her shopping once or twice a fortnight. Mrs Alchin always had money in cash. Several years earlier, Mrs Jones was with Mrs Alchin when Mrs Alchin withdrew $7,000 cash in old $100 notes from a bank. Mr and Mrs Reeves gave evidence that when Mrs Alchin paid for groceries she would usually pay in cash with $50 notes. In the past, she had also paid with old (pre-polymer) $100 notes. She would go to her bedroom to get the money. Alan Walter Ball, the owner of the Greenwell Point Newsagency and General Store, gave evidence that he delivered newspapers to Mrs Alchin’s house. Once a month she would pay him in cash at her front door. The last delivery was on 17 January 2001. 
     
      
    23 Mr Cox was a friend of Mrs Alchin, having met her through a pastor of the Seventh Day Adventist Church (of which she was an adherent) who got to know Mrs Alchin well through his work with Meals on Wheels. Mr Cox had agreed to her request to drive her around when she bought a car, which he also used. Amongst other things, he would speak with Mrs Alchin on the telephone, visit for a cup of tea and take her shopping, though this ceased when one of her widowed neighbours, a Mr Knowles, took this on. Mr Cox understood that Mrs Alchin and Mr Knowles became good friends and commenced to see each other regularly. Mr Cox and Mrs Alchin continued to speak together by telephone, one occasion being on 19 December when Mrs Alchin called to complain that she thought someone had attempted to break into her house through the back door; they also spoke in early January 2001, when she told him that someone had been trying to get through the front door with a piece of plastic and that she had called the police. The last time they spoke was sometime later when Mrs Alchin asked Mr Cox to go over and do some work for her in her yard but some personal matters intervened and he did not go. In the week before 20 January 2001, however, Mr Cox called her from time to time, but without success and, thinking that she may have hurt herself, had decided to investigate on 20 January but was then told by a police constable he knew that Mrs Alchin’s body had just been found. Mr Cox had seen Mrs Alchin carrying a lot of money when he took her shopping. Once she bought a motor vehicle in a private sale for $2,000. She went to her bedroom and returned with the money in $100 notes. Rodney James Knowles gave evidence that he drove Mrs Alchin to various places on several occasions and saw her make purchases with old $50 notes. He stated that there was no physical relationship between them.  
     
      
    24 Mrs Gale, who was living in Queensland, had last seen her sister, Mrs Alchin at the end of November 1998 and last spoke to her towards the end of 2000. She was called principally to give evidence about a conversation after Mrs Alchin’s death with members of the family, including Mr Taber, about old banknotes and did not give any more specific evidence about her contact with her sister. 
     
      
    25 Cheryle Ravell, Mrs Alchin’s youngest sister, was living in Greenwell Point at the time of Mrs Alchin’s death. She confirmed the other evidence about her sister’s habits. She said that they were not close because they did not see each other “very often”. At about Christmas 1999, they fell out over some shopping done by Mrs Ravell for Mrs Alchin and she stopped seeing and talking to her in about April the following year. One of Mrs Ravell’s daughters, Melinda took over doing the grocery shopping for her. Another of Mrs Ravell’s daughters, Leonie, had been living with the appellant Taber for four or five months. She was called by the Crown to give evidence, inter alia, about Taber’s whereabouts on the night of 6 January 2001. She was not asked and gave no evidence about her relationship with Mrs Alchin, or Mrs Alchin’s habits of life or relations with the rest of the family or, for that matter, any other persons, nor whether she had said anything to Taber about these matters. 
     
      
    26 Melinda Ravell said that she would visit Mrs Alchin perhaps once or twice a week and did her shopping for her from time to time. Mrs Alchin had lent money to Cheryle and to Melinda Ravell. These were in cash amounts of $22,000, $3,000 and $22,000 on separate occasions in late 1999. Mrs Alchin handed the money over in her house on each occasion in a paper bag. Most of the money comprised old $100 notes. Mrs Alchin wanted to be repaid in cash. A dispute arose in relation to the repayment of these loans. This caused Mrs Alchin to contact a solicitor in the latter half of 2000. Eventually she was repaid. The evidence did not suggest, however, that Melinda’s contact with Mrs Alchin ceased, although she had not attempted to contact her during the relevant time. 
     
      
    27 A Mr Garrett attended Mrs Alchin’s premises on 11 January 2001 to take a meter reading. Mr Ball owned the Greenwell Point Newsagency and General Store, where Mrs Alchin had a standing order for a newspaper to be delivered on Wednesdays and Sundays and a magazine monthly. Mr Ball made these deliveries by throwing them over the fence early in the morning. Once a month he went to the door to be paid, the last of these occasions being 17 January 2001.  
     
      
    28 After Mrs Alchin’s funeral, Mrs Rutter went to her house for a clean up. While there Mrs Alchin’s brother-in-law, Richard Stanley Jones, found a key within the cushions of a chair situated near the back door. The key fitted the lock on the back door.  
     
      
    29 Detective Senior Constable Paul Andrew Johnstone received a telephone call from Mr Reeves at 12.20 pm on 19 January 2001. Mr Reeves said he had found Mrs Alchin dead in her house. At 12.55 pm, Johnstone went to Mrs Alchin’s house with Senior Constable Olana Lillian Jeffery, who maintained a crime scene log, and Sergeant Wesley John Hanrahan, who kept the premises secure. Having entered the premises over the padlocked front gate where they saw several wrapped newspapers on the front lawn, they climbed over another padlocked gate at the side of the house and walked to the back door. Johnstone unlocked the security door with a key he received from Mr Reeves and opened the back door, which was closed but not locked. He saw wrapped newspaper on the floor near the back door. There were rotting tomatoes in the kitchen sink. The front door was shut. Mrs Alchin’s bedroom was in a state of disarray with clothing and bed linen scattered over the floor. Wardrobe doors were opened and their contents scattered. A later inspection by Detective Sergeant Wayne Benney showed no sign of any ransacking in any of the rooms except the bedroom. Benney gave evidence that the cable ties were tied to Mrs Alchin in such a way that they would not break when pulled and would have to be cut. On the mattress there were two bed sheets knotted together. 
     
      
    30 On 21 January 2001, Johnstone took part in a search with Benney at Mrs Alchin’s house. In her bedroom wardrobe, Johnstone located a brown leather handbag containing two small purses, one with $156.45 in notes and coins and the other with $250, which included two pre-polymer $100 notes. A broken black cable tie was found on the bedroom floor. A later external search revealed no apparent signs of forced entry.  
     
      
    31 On 24 January 2001 at 4.50 pm, police went to the appellant Taber’s house at 211 Old Southern Road, Worrigee and executed a search warrant. Amongst those present in the house were, Taber, and his de facto wife, Leonie Kaye Ravell. Also present were Sharon Rose Herne and her daughters, Kylie Rose Herne and Meegan Elizabeth Herne. They were required to go outside and were searched by Detective Jeffrey, who said the search took less than ten minutes. Their car was also searched and following this search they left. Mrs Herne gave evidence that the elapsed time between the police arriving and her and her daughters leaving the house was about an hour. Constable Stephen Gregory Hegarty said in evidence that he saw Mrs Herne and her two children leave the house and go out to the front. They left about five minutes after the search of the house began. 
     
      
    32 The search of Taber’s house began at about 5.15 pm. The police found in the main bedroom two new rolls of grey duct tape, several shopping receipts, including one from K-Mart dated 8 January 2001 in the amount of $1,737.80; in the lounge room a small clear plastic bag containing a quantity of black cable ties; in the rear yard a piece of grey duct tape on the lawn and in the garage a backpack containing gloves and masks. Taber said that the gloves were his mother’s as she was a nurses’ aid. The Crown placed no reliance on the finding of the masks. 
     
      
    33 When the search moved to the front of the house, Taber handed a pre-polymer $100 note to one of the detectives. 
     
      
    34 The police searched a panel van at the front of the house and a white Ford Ute. Detective Senior Constable Jeffrey Allan Bennett gave evidence that he assisted in searching the utility and found two lengths of scrunched up used grey duct tape in the rear tray. Benney saw these two items in the rear of the utility and took photographs. The search was videotaped by Senior Constable Adam James Asplin. Bennett was shown the videoed footage during cross-examination. He agreed that it showed Detective Senior Constable Ivor Davies, Senior Constable James Gordon Littler and Constable Ray Thomas near the white ute. Littler pointed twice to the inside of the utility before Bennett approached it. Bennett said, after viewing this portion of the taped footage, that he made a mistake when he said that he had been the one who had found the scrunched up duct tape in the rear of the utility. 
     
      
    35 Hegarty’s evidence was that after he arrived at the house he secured the front yard and driveway. His evidence, which was corroborated by all other police officers present, was that the search was completed at 7.35 pm. He saw Bennett locate two scrunched up rolls of duct tape in the rear of the ute. He did not see anyone approach the utility prior to this. Hegarty was not visible on the videoed footage showing the search of the utility because he was behind the camera at this time and when cross-examined about whom he first saw find the scrunched up tape in the utility, he was adamant that it had been Bennett.  
     
      
    36 Davies gave evidence that he recalled seeing the duct tape in the back of the utility. He had made no earlier approach or search of the vehicle. He said that the duct tape was pointed out to him by other police. He did not see any officer pick it up. At first, Thomas said in evidence that he did not search the ute. In cross-examination he remembered that he did search it. He did not recall finding any duct tape in the utility. He agreed that the videotaped footage of the search showed him searching a panel van and then moving over to the utility where he stood near Littler and motioned Davies to the back of the utility before Littler pointed twice towards the back of the vehicle. He could not recall if he had been pointing out the two rolls of scrunched up duct tape. 
     
      
    37 Littler gave evidence, that in the company of Thomas, he saw duct tape in the back of the utility after he had walked to the side of it. He could not recall pointing it out but agreed that he was shown to do so on the videoed tape. He agreed in cross-examination that he made no mention about seeing duct tape in the utility when he made his statement. This was because he forgot. 
     
      
    38 The evidence of Bennett, Hegarty and Littler was that after the scrunched up rolls of duct tape were found in the back of the utility, they were recorded on video tape and Detective Constable Jason Charles Stevenson, the allocated exhibit officer, took possession of them, recorded what had been found, and placed them in a brown paper bag which he then sealed. Stevenson confirmed in evidence that he did this and that the scrunched up rolls of duct tape were logged at 7.09 pm. 
     
      
    39 The videotaped footage of the search showed Stevenson placing the duct tape found in the rear yard into a brown paper bag. There was no videotaped footage of the two scrunched rolls of used duct tape found in the rear of the utility. Stevenson agreed in cross-examination that there was no video taped footage of him picking up these two rolls of duct tape. Asplin, in cross-examination, acknowledged that after Littler had pointed to the utility the camera then focused on the two scrunched up rolls of duct tape. He did not recall seeing any officer place these two rolls of duct tape into a paper bag and he agreed there was no videotaped footage of this happening. Benney’s evidence was that Stevenson sealed the two pieces of duct tape in a brown paper bag. In cross-examination he said that when he had earlier given evidence he had made a mistake in saying that the two pieces of duct tape went into separate bags. 
     
      
    40 Stevenson’s evidence was that the rolls of duct tape were not located in his presence as he was placing exhibits in the back of a police vehicle at the time. He was able to see the search of the utility taking place. In his statement he said that Bennett had located these items. On the property exhibit form he had written that Bennett found the two rolls of scrunched up tape. He explained that this was because Bennett had identified them to him. 
     
      
    41 Detective Senior Constable Kevin Alan Cody gave evidence that he was present while the utility was searched. Bennett found two pieces of scrunched up pieces of duct tape in the rear of the utility. In cross-examination, after watching the video footage of Littler pointing to the utility he said he had not actually seen Bennett locate the tape. He had relied on the log of Stevenson to prepare his statement when he had said that Bennett had located the tape. In cross-examination, he said that the duct tape was obvious once one looked into the vehicle.  
     
      
    42 In cross-examination, Stevenson agreed that he had verified the property exhibit without first having Taber check and sign it. Davies also gave evidence that he had questioned Taber at the scene about the $100 note handed to him, the backpack containing the gloves and masks and the receipts found by the police but had no recollection of asking Taber about the scrunched up rolls of duct tape found in the utility. 
     
      
    43 The cross-examination of the police officers who undertook the search was to the effect that the two scrunched up rolls of duct tape found in the back of the white utility were planted by police and were expected to be found. This was denied. 
     
      
    44 The police officers present during the search of Taber’s house were cross-examined about an occasion during the search when the police were in the bedroom and Cody said: “Jason, those girls right to go? We’ve searched the car. They have a backpack in the lounge.” After this Davies and Stevenson were seen on the videotaped footage of the search to leave the room. Asplin, Littler and Thomas could not recall the two officers leaving the room. They acknowledged the videotaped footage showed them doing so but they could not assist as to where they went. Hegarty, who was securing the front yard, gave evidence that he did not recall seeing Davies or Stevenson come out to the utility before the utility was searched. Bennett’s evidence was that as far as he was aware there was no other time the utility was searched other than the time about which he gave evidence. Cody gave evidence that he did not see any other officer approach that utility before it was searched and the scrunched up rolls of duct tape were found. For most of the time he was in the front yard. His role was to assist Davies with interviewing Taber. 
     
      
    45 Stevenson said in cross-examination that he had left the bedroom and gone into the lounge room or hallway to write up the exhibits and secure them. That was where they were stored. In re-examination he said that he believed that he gave the backpack in the lounge room to a police officer to return to Mrs Herne and her daughters who then left. He did not recall leaving with another police officer nor anyone saying anything to him about searching a car. He did not take part in the search of any car. His evidence was that what Cody was referring to was the search of Mrs Herne’s car which was parked at the front.  
     
      
    46 Cody gave evidence that he and another officer searched Mrs Herne’s car at the front before they were allowed to leave. The question asked by him in the bedroom was made after his search of that car and after Meegan Herne’s backpack was searched. He did not know where Stevenson and Davies went when they left the room.  
     
      
    47 Mrs Herne’s evidence was that while she was at the front of the house she did not see any police officer search the utility. She was pre-occupied with the police who were searching her car. At that time, there were several police outside the house.  
     
      
    48 Meegan Herne gave evidence that up to half an hour after the police arrived, when she was at the front of the house being searched, she turned and saw a man with a grey ball of tape in his left hand. She described him as being in his early to mid thirties, six feet tall, with short dark hair, not fat or skinny, with trousers and a long sleeved shirt. She saw him standing next to Taber in the middle of the front yard close to the utility. She was about ten feet away from him at the time. After seeing this she and her sister and mother left.  
     
      
    49 The police who attended at Taber’s house for the search were all questioned about the description given by Meegan Herne of the man she had seen holding a grey ball of tape. Their evidence was generally either that they could not recall seeing such an officer there as described by her or they recalled there were officers who matched the physical descriptions but not the clothing. 
     
      
    50 Cody gave evidence that he was not holding the ball of tape. He could only recall that he and Davies were wearing trousers and long sleeved shirts. Hogan gave evidence that after escorting Leonie Ravell out of the house he did not search any vehicle and was not holding a ball of tape. His evidence was that the description given by Meegan Herne matched him and Littler. Hegarty said that he had not seen any duct tape before the utility was searched nor any officer searching it. While the Hernes were present he did not see any police officer in the vicinity of the utility. He did not see any officer holding a ball of duct tape. Johnstone gave evidence that he did not go near the white utility and did not place any duct tape in the back of that vehicle. He did not see any officer holding duct tape and standing near it. Senior Constable Anthony Peter Hyndes recalled seeing a utility at the front when he took part in the search of Mrs Herne’s car. He did not approach the utility and did not see any other officer approach it. He did not see any officer holding duct tape. 
     
      
    51 Constable Paul Edward McCann gave evidence that he remained in the front yard while the house was being searched to secure the premises. After the search was completed he went into the house to help seize the exhibits. He did not look inside the utility but he saw the video camera around while it was being searched. At no stage did he see an officer holding a piece of duct tape.  
     
      
    52 Detective Inspector Wayne George Hayes took photos of all police who attended the search and subsequently showed the photos to Meegan Herne. She was unable to say whether any of them were handling the duct tape. Hayes did not show the photos of Bennett because he was on leave and in any case had been wearing jeans and a T-shirt on the day of the search and was specifically excluded by Meegan Herne in her evidence. Inspector William Peter Carter, another officer present during the search, was bald and no photo of him was taken. He gave evidence that he was present at the search to ensure its integrity and fairness. He had seen Stevenson’s property exhibit form on the day of the search but he had not handled it nor read it in its entirety. Stevenson agreed he had not given this form to Carter for him to attest to the integrity of the search as an independent observer.  
     
      
    53 Carter completed a search warrant independent observer form and the search warrant procedures scene plan. The last item shown in these documents was a search of the carport at 6.51 pm. He said in cross-examination that he was still present when the panel van and utility were searched but agreed that he had made no reference to these searches in his statement. He did not recall if anything was found in the utility. He agreed that he was not visible on the videotaped footage when the utility was being searched. He was last seen on the videotaped footage when the carport was being searched. He denied he was not outside when the ute was searched and said he must have been with the cameraman. Stevenson in evidence said he believed Carter came out when the ute was searched and that Carter was present for the entire search. He could not explain why Carter was not visible on the videotaped footage. Davies gave evidence that he could not recall if Carter was around when the search was wrapped up. 
     
      
    54 Benney gave evidence that he took photographs of a broken black cable tie found by police on the carport floor in front of the boat and another black cable tie on the carport floor alongside the boat. He examined the packed cable ties found in the lounge room. The cable ties taken from Mrs Alchin and the broken cable tie found on the floor in Mrs Alchin’s bedroom were all examined and found to be 202mm in length. On 31 January Benney made a visual comparison of packaged cable ties from various outlets in the Nowra area and found there were matches with the cable ties found at Taber’s house in the carport and cable ties from K-Mart and Ison & Co in Nowra. 
     
      
    55 Benney also examined duct tapes found by police during the search of Taber’s house. He concluded that the duct tape found in the rear yard was not of the same type as the duct tape used on Mrs Alchin. The two new rolls of duct tape found in the bedroom were different to the two scrunched up rolls of tape found in the utility. Benney concluded that these two rolls of scrunched up tape had characteristics in common with the duct tape found on Mrs Alchin. The width was the same (48mm), the colour was the same and the tapes had no pattern on them.  
     
      
    56 Suzanne Maria Briese from Forensic Services, Australian Federal Police, prepared a report dated 8 May 2001. On 22 January 2001 she received several items for DNA testing including blood from Mrs Alchin, Taber, Ian Styman, Shannon Styman and Leonie Ravell. She also received the duct tapes found during the search of Taber’s house in the bedroom, utility and rear yard. These included item 30 described as two rolls of duct tape, item 29 described as pieces of duct tape marked item 1, which I take to be exhibit M, the two scrunched up rolls of duct tape found in the utility, and item 36, which was exhibit J, described as the duct tape found in the rear yard. Ms Briese’s report of 8 May 2001 suggested that DNA testing on item 29 produced no reported result.  
     
      
    57 David John Royds from Forensic Services, Australian Federal Police, conducted an examination of the duct tape removed from Mrs Alchin’s mouth, ankles, wrists and pillowcase as well as the duct tapes found during the search of Taber’s house in the bedroom, rear yard and ute, which became respectively items 5, 6 and 7 in the report. In his report dated 22 March 2001, item 7 was described as a brown paper bag, sealed and signed by Benney, and labelled in part “three pieces of duct tape located in the rear of M/V AAE-98R at premises, 211 Old Southern Road, South Nowra”. The number was the registered number of the ute. Mr Royd’s evidence was that when he received them the duct tapes were split into three pieces and were scrunched up. In his report Mr Royds stated the following conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        “The physical and chemical properties of the tapes from the two loci (being from the body of Joy Alchin, and from the motor vehicle AAE-98R at 211 Old Southern Road, South Nowra) were similar. This means the two tapes could have a common source. 
        
       
       
        
        A mechanical fit was not established between tapes from these two loci. 
        
       
       
        
        In the absence of a data base that reflects the range of variation and physical and chemical properties in the overall population of ‘duct’ tapes, the evidential value of this observation is undetermined. 
        
       
       
        
        A small clump of coarse wool fibres impregnated with red brown granular material was observed on a section of tape, purportedly from M/V AAE-98R at 211 Old Southern Road, South Nowra. A sample of this stain and a sample of the stain from the pillow case, purportedly from the deceased, were handed to Dr Sutton for DNA testing. The findings of her work are the subject of another report.” 
        
       
      
    58 In his evidence, Mr Royds said that the wool was coarse and of a type that would be seen in carpets. A presumptive test for blood was undertaken, which came back positive, though this was not conclusive. The blood was microscopically examined and Mr Royds concluded that because the blood and fibres had mixed together, the blood was wet at the time it had come into contact with the fibres. 
     
      
    59 On 7 March 2001, Dr Julie-Anne Sutton received two samples. “One of these purportedly contained a sample from a pillow case associated with Mrs Alchin and the other contained a sample associated with tape from a vehicle. The proposition to be tested was: that the sample from the pillow case had the same DNA type as the sample from the tape from the vehicle.” In her report of 30 March 2001 Dr Sutton identified the first as item A and the second as item B. Her report was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “2.0  
        EXAMINATION 
        
       
       
        
        2.1 The examination of each item was conducted at separate times, in separate batches and analysed on different genetic analysers.  
        
       
       
        
        2.2 Human blood was detected on items A and B. 
        
       
       
        
        2.3 Items A and B were examined using the polymerse chain reaction (PCR) method for the analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The DNA profiles obtained on items A and B were indistinguishable from each other at ten regions (loci) of the DNA. The results of DNA analysis from the items submitted are shown in Table 1 on page 3 of this report. 
        
       
       
        
        2.4 The point estimates for these profiles is one in 23.1 Billion 
          
        in the general ACT population. 
        
       
       
        
        2.5 It can be stated with 95% confidence that the true frequency of the DNA profile as identified from both items A and B is between 1 in 13.6 Billion and 1 in 39.1 Billion 
          
        in the general ACT population.

        3.00  
        CONCLUSION 
        
       
       
        
         The human blood detected on “FC010573 complainant pillow case” (Item A) and “FCO10573 from tape FSO/168 29ii Vehicle” (Item B) could have come from the same individual. The evidential value of the observation is exceedingly high given the rarity of the profile obtained.” 
        
       
      
    60 The DNA profile of the two samples examined by Dr Sutton was identical to the DNA profile obtained by Ms Briese of Mrs Alchin’s blood as typed in her report using the profiler plus system. Ms Briese said in her evidence that when she examined the duct tape she had not seen any fibrous material. 
     
      
    61 Benney gave evidence that on 27 February 2001 after the scrunched up duct tape from the utility was first returned to Nowra police from Ms Briese, before they were sent for further analysis to Royds and Sutton, he undertook a visual examination of all the duct tapes removed from Mrs Alchin and from the search at 211 Old Southern Road, South Nowra. Some of the duct tape removed from Mrs Alchin had blood. Although he was examining all of the pieces of duct tape in proximity to each other they were on separate sheets and laid under one another. He conceded that despite his care to avoid contamination there was a possibility that there may have been a touching of the two pieces of tape. The items were put on a fresh piece of manila paper and he overlaid the paper to get them as close as he could without directly touching them. Although there was a possibility of this happening to his knowledge they had not touched at the ends. There was no possibility that they could have touched on top of each other. The examination took a couple of days and the room he conducted it in was kept secure. On 1 March 2001 he repackaged the duct tape from the utility into three separate bags. 
     
      
    62 Robert John Goetz, from the Department of Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe, was called by the Crown by leave after all the accused had given evidence. He had examined the ends of the pieces of duct tape removed from Mrs Alchin and from the duct tape found by police in the utility. He examined ten areas on the duct tape found by police in the utility and DNA was recovered in five areas. Four were consistent with Mrs Alchin and an unknown individual. The appellants and Shannon Styman were all excluded. 
     
      
    63 Through the installation of lawfully obtained listening devices, police monitored conversations at Taber’s house and on Ian Styman’s mobile phone. The Crown relied on these audio tapes which were transcribed as showing a consciousness of guilt through various conversations suggesting a concern about the police investigation, lies about the money Taber and Ian Styman had in their possession and an apparent consciousness that the phones were tapped which caused a cautiousness in the conversations, some of which were preceded with “14” being said, which on the Crown case was a code to note that the conversation was being tapped. In one of these conversations, Taber was speaking to Leonie Ravell about police having taken two rolls of duct tape, but Taber made no reference to that duct tape not being his. 
     
      
    64 The Crown called Andrew Peake, who was a friend of Ian Styman, and through him Peake had met the appellant Taber. In early December 2000 he had been at the KFC in Nowra having lunch with Ian Styman between 12 noon and 2 pm. This was either on a Monday or Tuesday. Half an hour later, he followed Ian Styman as he drove on his motor bike to Taber’s house at 211 Old Southern Road. They stayed there for five or ten minutes. He then drove to Ian Styman’s house at Sanctuary Point where they stayed until about 5 or 5.30 pm. Peake was going to go out and get milk for Ian Styman’s wife, which he later did. Later, Peake and Ian Styman went to Taber’s house in Peake’s car. They were both wearing shorts and T-shirts. They stayed at Taber’s house for no more than half an hour. Ian Styman and Taber then got into Taber’s mother’s car (a white four door car) and Peake followed them to Taber’s mother’s house in Nowra. Peake was driving a red Ford Laser.  
     
      
    65 Ian Styman and Taber parked in the driveway and went into the house via the front. Peake waited outside and had a cigarette before walking into the house through the front door. He called out to the appellants, heard a voice from the back of the house and went there. He saw the appellants in a room, standing face to face, and one of them had his wrists tied up in black cable ties with his fists clenched and his hands in front of him. Peake’s evidence was that they were making sure that the person who was tied up could not get out of the cable ties. They then cut the ties off. Peake did not actually see the cable ties being removed. 
     
      
    66 Peake described the appellants as standing face to face and about a metre apart; “They were tied up at one time and when I turned around they were free. I don’t know who cut who free.” Their faces suggested that they were “a bit shocked” when Peake came into the room. After this incident, the appellants changed into black pants and blue business shirts. The appellant, Ian Styman, had told Peake that the appellants were doing a security job that night in Wollongong. After the appellants had changed Peake told them he was going out to get milk. Taber said: “No you’re coming with us.” Peake said he was not. One of the appellants said: “You are.”  
     
      
    67 Subsequently, Peake changed into a blue business shirt with a tie. Peake and the appellants got into Taber’s mother’s car with Ian Styman driving. This was about 6 or 7 pm. They drove to Greenwell Point and stopped at a service station where Peake was told to buy a can of WD40 or similar and was given $10. He was told to remove the blue shirt before going into the service station, which he did. On returning to the car Peake asked the appellants where they were going and was told he would find out when they got there. Fifteen minutes later they arrived in Greenwell Point and Peake was told to wear the blue shirt again. The car was driven past a bowling club. Peake marked the route taken on a map during his evidence. The car was then driven to the end of Greenwell Point near the pools and was parked there. Peake removed his blue shirt and went into a pub with the appellants where they remained for about half an hour. 
     
      
    68 They returned to the car. This time Peake was driving. The appellants directed him. He was told to stop the car and the appellants got out and told Peake to drive back towards the pools and wait there for them to ring him. He parked the car and waited for the call on his mobile. Fifteen or twenty minutes later, Ian Styman rang and told Peake to “come and get us”. He picked the appellants up in front of the bowling club. Peake’s evidence was that at some stage, either at the house or in the car, he noticed three or four cable ties, each about a metre in length, in Ian Styman’s top pocket or pants. The car was driven back to Taber’s mother’s house. Peake was told to forget what he saw. 
     
      
    69 In mid-January 2001, Peake saw Ian Styman in Nowra with a 4WD. Peake asked him where he got it from and Ian Styman said he had sold his motorbike.  
     
      
    70 Taber’s father gave evidence that in December 2000 his hours of work were 2 am to 8.30 am and 11 am to 5.30 pm at a dairy. He had come home every night until it was time to work again the next morning. He had met Peake once in 1999 and had never seen him at his house between 1 December and 23 December 2000 nor ever witnessed an incident where his son used cable ties to tie up someone. There was evidence that Taber was working in Canberra in late November/early December 2000.  
     
      
    71 Sharyn Styman (Ian Styman’s wife) said that in December 2000 she and Ian Styman were in receipt of social security benefits and rented their house in Sanctuary Point. Around Christmas 2000, she saw Ian Styman with a surplus of money. She was aware he had bought a motorbike in early December for a few thousand dollars. He said the money came from selling his previous bike and also a computer. This evidence was corroborated by the purchaser of the computer and the bike. She gave evidence that he did security work. The last she recalled was a few years before 2000. Ian Styman would wear a blue shirt and blue pants.  
     
      
    72 In January 2001, Sharyn Styman saw the appellants both wearing blue business shirts. Ian Styman told her he had a security job in Wollongong. It was daytime, after lunch, when they left the house in Peake’s red Ford Laser. A few hours later, Peake returned to her house. She could not recall if she had seen Ian Styman again that day. She had not seen Taber. She could not recall seeing Ian Styman again until the next morning. A few weeks later she saw the blue shirts in her wardrobe and took them to the police. She agreed that Peake had told her about a “tying up episode” in her garage, with Taber also present. 
     
      
    73 Peake had mentioned this when they were in Sharyn’s house and again when they were travelling by car to Nowra to look for a car for Sharyn. Peake was driving and at one point became upset and pulled over. He said he was upset because of this “tying up business”. Sharyn had to drive the car home. Peake had talked for a couple of hours. He had also told her that the shirts were used as a uniform while they were checking someone’s house in Greenwell Point and that they were also used on the night when Ian told her he had the security job in Wollongong.  
     
      
    74 In evidence, Sharyn said that in early January 2001 Ian brought home a Suzuki Soft Top 4WD which Crown evidence later established was purchased on 7 January 2001. Taber was with Ian when he drove it up the driveway. She asked him where he got the money from. He said it was from work he had done in Canberra. On the same day, Ian also brought home a pine TV cabinet which he said had been on lay-by. Later, after Ian had been charged, Sharyn found the receipt for it in her bedroom. There was no reference to its having been on lay-by. Ian sold the Suzuki a few weeks later. 
     
      
    75 The day before Sharyn saw the Suzuki at her house, Ian and she had a discussion about her going with him to Sydney to look for a car. It had been a last minute arrangement. It was 6 January 2001 and they were both at home. That afternoon he changed his mind and told Sharyn that he was going to Sydney with Taber. This happened after Ian had received a telephone call from Taber.  
     
      
    76 Sharyn did not see Ian again that night. She had no recollection of him coming to bed. She said in cross-examination that after Ian had told her that he was going to Sydney with Taber she went about her own business and did not recall whether Ian was home or not. Later she agreed that her recollection was that Ian had left the house after they had had an argument. She did not see him again until the next afternoon when he returned home with the Suzuki. She did not know where he was between 11 pm and 5 am.  
     
      
    77 Usually Sharyn went to bed by 11 pm. She had not woken at all during that night. She agreed that Ian was often in the garage or on the internet until early in the morning and could have been in the garage that night working on computers and playstations. In cross-examination, she agreed that she had told police when she was interviewed that Ian had been on the internet that night and also had been working on Playstations. In evidence she said that she thought Ian had been at home though this was based on what she used to observe of Ian around that time, not that night in particular. She agreed that she had told police that she thought Ian might have been at Taber’s house, though this had only been an assumption. 
     
      
    78 In cross-examination, Sharyn agreed that Ian was always talking about buying cars and motorbikes. She did not know that he was actually going to buy a car. A week before he brought home the Suzuki there had been talk about trading in her car for a newer model. As far as she knew he was not saving to buy a car.  
     
      
    79 Sharyn and Ian did not share bank accounts and she had no knowledge of his having enough money to afford the car he bought. She agreed in cross-examination that Ian received extra money from the work he did with playstations and computers, as well as, security work. Ian and she did not discuss money but she did not expect him to have that much.  
     
      
    80 Peake gave further evidence in which he said that the blue shirts identified by Sharyn were similar to those worn by Ian and Taber. In cross-examination, he agreed he may have told Sharyn that he had seen Taber tying up Ian with cable ties. He did not recall this and denied ever telling her that he had seen this happen in the garage. He confirmed that what he saw happened in Taber’s mother’s home.  
     
      
    81 Ms Briese gave evidence that she conducted DNA tests on the two blue shirts. She concluded that Ian Styman could not be excluded as a contributor to DNA on one of the shirts which was a mixture of DNA types. The deceased, Taber and Shannon Styman were all excluded as contributors. For the other shirt, Ian Styman, Shannon Styman, Taber and the deceased were all excluded as contributors. 
     
      
    82 On 5 November 2002 during the trial, Leonie Ravell, Taber’s de facto, entered a plea of guilty to hindering the investigation in relation to Taber between 19 and 24 January 2001. She gave evidence (by leave) that on 6 January 2001, around 5 pm, she was at home with Taber. Around 7 or 8 pm she went to bed and Taber left the house. She did not see if he left in a particular vehicle. Around that time, Taber was driving his mother’s white Hyundai. When she went to bed there was no one else in the house. When Taber left the house, Leonie was in her bedroom and heard voices from the driveway. She was pretty sure they were the voices of Ian and Shannon Styman. There came a time when she no longer heard the voices but she did not see anyone leave. She heard a car starting but did not see who was in that car. The car drove away and she heard no more voices after that. She then went to sleep.  
     
      
    83 It was suggested to her that Taber went out briefly to get some take away food. She could not recall that. At around 6 am the next morning Leonie recalled being woken up by Taber. There was nothing to suggest that he came to bed the night before. She may have asked him where he had been but could not recall what he said. It may have been that he had simply been out. She agreed she did not know if he had meant he had been out all night or only on the morning of 7 January 2001. They went to Sydney in the white Hyundai with Ian and Shannon Styman to look for a car. That morning was the first she knew about a proposal to go to Sydney. On the way she slept in the back seat. At no stage was the car stopped on a bridge and a bag thrown out. 
     
      
    84 Leonie had no memory of getting up during the night. At no time during the night did she hear a car leave her house or any conversation outside between Taber, Ian or Shannon Styman. Her bedroom was near the carport. She expected she would have woken if a car was driven in her driveway. She agreed that Ian Styman might have visited the house on 6 January 2001. It was suggested that Taber and Ian Styman had spent the afternoon setting up a playstation to the TV with a car racing game. She did not recall a Playstation in the house. She denied arguing with Taber about his staying up and playing the game all night. She agreed she had been outside sunbaking for most of that day. She agreed in cross-examination that she had told police that earlier on that day Ian came to the house on his motor bike and had left it there and borrowed the white Hyundai. Shannon Styman had also been there. He came on his motorbike. She told police that she recalled being woken up the next morning around 6 am by the sound of the car. She said in evidence that at that time she had heard voices outside, one of which was Ian Styman’s. She had also heard Shannon and seen the white Hyundai.  
     
      
    85 John Styman was the brother of Ian and the father of Shannon. He worked as a volunteer at Nowra Police Station. On a Sunday night in March 2001, Ian came to his house and asked to see him outside. Shannon was also present. Ian told John that he had been “DNA’d” from the Nowra Police and asked John what would happen if the DNA came back positive and “if there was any way that the DNA could be changed before it came back”. John Styman told him there was not. At that time Ian was very shaky, he looked upset and was in tears. Ian told John that the police were trying to charge him, Shannon and Taber with the murder of Mrs Alchin. John Styman reported this conversation to the police. This evidence was not led against Taber. 
     
      
    86 John Styman was cross-examined along the lines that at about the time of this conversation he had been taking medications to assist him with pain from damaged muscles and nerves. He agreed that the medication made him drowsy. He said that Ian had asked him if there was any way that the DNA could be tampered with. He was not sure if Ian had asked him if the DNA could be planted. He did not recall Ian saying anything about the police in that conversation. He agreed that after he had made his statement to police he said he “truly misunderstood whether I was asked by Ian to tamper with any evidence”.  
     
      
    87 Cheryle Ravell, who was Mrs Alchin’s sister and Leonie’s mother, gave evidence that a week after 24 January 2001 she visited 211 Old Southern Road and fed the dogs. She found an exercise book which had quotes for buildings and drawings of buildings. In the middle was a drawing of a house which looked like her sister’s house. She tore the page out of the book and kept it in the console of her car. She showed it to her daughter, Melinda, and also mentioned it to Leonie. No one else had access to her car. Subsequently, she discovered that the sketch went missing from her car. This evidence was corroborated by Melinda, who drew a similar sketch. In an interview by Detective Senior Constable Paul Johnstone, she was asked why she had taken so long to tell the police officer about it. She did not know. She agreed that she had said that the map she had found was damning evidence and that it was a “golden opportunity to get rid of Peter” someone she did not like. 
     
      
    88 Paul Styman was a brother of Ian Styman. He gave evidence that Ian, Shannon and Taber came up to Queensland in the latter part of February 2001 for the purpose of work. He overheard a conversation between Taber and Leonie Ravell. Taber said: “If it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t be in this shit”. Paul Styman took this to mean that Leonie had wanted to drive back to New South Wales. 
     
      
    89 Terry Daniel Wilke did building work for Taber. He gave evidence that in February 2001 Taber was going to Queensland. He told Wilke that the police were accusing him of Mrs Alchin’s murder. Wilke asked him if he had done it. Taber said he had not.  
     
      
    90 The Crown called several witnesses to give evidence that Taber was not very financially secure before January 2001. He was often short of cash and borrowed money from people including his father, David George Taber. David Taber gave evidence that Taber would at times be short of cash and would ask for money in exchange for cheques. He had lent Taber a few hundred dollars before 23 December 2000. Taber also sought advances from employers who contracted him for building work and sought advance payments for building work being undertaken. He did this because he was short of money for himself and for the payment by him of wages to his workers. He also pawned electrical items, including a mobile phone, during 1999 and 2000 for loans ranging from $50 to $170. He would repay the loans in accordance with his agreement with the pawnbroker. On 8 January 2001 he repaid his most recent loan and interest in the amount of $360. Evidence of the finances of Taber and Ian Styman, before January 2001, was supported by various banking records tendered. 
     
      
    91 Meegan Herne, who had met Leonie Ravell at the end of 2000, gave evidence that Taber was like everyone else, tight with money until pay day. Taber and Leonie had plans to go to Queensland after Christmas but as far as she knew they had a quiet New Year and did not go. Melinda Ravell gave evidence that, a few weeks before Christmas 2000, Taber asked to borrow a couple of thousand dollars to go to Queensland but Melinda did not have the money. On Christmas Day, Melinda and Leonie came to their mother, Cheryle’s, house. Taber said he had “hocked” his tools so as to have money to spend. He had about $200 in his wallet. 
     
      
    92 Meegan Herne said she had had conversations with Leonie about Mrs Alchin lending money to her mother and sister and that legal action was begun when the money was not repaid fast enough. Herne could not recall if Taber was present during these conversations. 
     
      
    93 Donyelle Louise Turner gave evidence that she moved into the premises at 211 Old Southern Road just before Christmas 2000 where she was present during a conversation with Taber and Leonie in the lounge room. She was renting a room from Taber and Leonie from Christmas 2000. Taber and Leonie were discussing the need for a few thousand dollars for a holiday. Taber suggested to Leonie that they ask Melinda for a loan. Taber rang Melinda on his mobile and went outside. When he returned he said that Melinda could not lend them the money. Taber then suggested that they visit Mrs Alchin to see if she could lend them money but Leonie did not want to go because she knew that others had borrowed money from Mrs Alchin before. Turner, Leonie and Taber were all together in the lounge room. Leonie expressed her disappointment about Mrs Alchin’s refusal to lend them money and said “we can always kill her … not that anybody would notice… because no one ever saw her”. Taber responded that somebody would notice that she was gone. Turner said that Leonie then said that “nobody would notice because nobody saw her anyway and her Mum hadn’t seen her for a while” and that she and Melinda had planned it a while ago. Turner thought they were joking around. She conceded in cross-examination that there was a possibility that she was mistaken about Taber being actually present at the conversation. In cross-examination, Turner agreed that she had often smoked cannabis while living in the house, but she denied that she was ever in a “stoned” state. 
     
      
    94 The Crown led evidence that from January 2001, both Taber and Leonie had bought items of value. Leonie also appeared to have been carrying a lot of money when she went shopping. Cheryle gave evidence that in January 2001 she went shopping with Leonie who had money on her, in particular a couple of grey $100 notes. Cheryle asked Leonie about the money and was told that Taber had paid her back for rent money. Leonie bought a 68 inch TV, a PlayStation and a second hand fridge and washing machine. This was probably a week before Cheryle found out that Mrs Alchin had died on 19 January. 
     
      
    95 Melinda gave evidence that on 8 January 2001, she went to Taber’s house and saw Taber installing a fridge in the kitchen. Taber said he had bought it from the hock shop. A week or so later Melinda saw a new TV and other appliances. She recalled they had conversations suggesting that the items had been purchased that week.  
     
      
    96 On 7 January 2001, Meegan Herne went to Melbourne. She returned on 14 January 2001. When she went to 211 Old Southern Road she noticed that it was newly furnished with a stereo, a TV, a PlayStation, new fishing gear and new decorations, as well as new shoes and clothes. She stayed there for a week and went shopping with Leonie in Nowra. Meegan Herne noticed that Leonie had “quite a bit” of money on her and was buying things she would probably never use; that Leonie could not fold her wallet because there was so much money in it; and that Leonie had about half a centimetre of old $100 notes and not many new ones. She and Leonie bumped into Ian Styman. Meegan Herne noticed that he had a new Suzuki Soft Top.  
     
      
    97 On 3 January 2001, Donyelle Turner went to Sydney. She stayed until 16 January 2001. While she was away she received a call from Taber asking her how she was going to pay the rent. She told him that she had organised it with Leonie who was to cover her while she was away. Taber was not happy with this arrangement, so she offered to deposit the money in his bank account which she did in an amount of $45. When she arrived back at 211 Old Southern Road she noticed similar items as those noticed by Meegan Herne, and Cheryle and Melinda. During the week, Taber bought a new fishing rod and Leonie bought clothes. On 17 January 2001, Turner went shopping with Leonie and noticed Leonie buying items which made Turner suspicious. That night when Taber and Leonie went out, Turner went into their bedroom and looked through Leonie’s wallet. She saw three or four old $100 notes and a few newer notes, totalling $900. She also noticed a paid mobile phone bill for around $500. 
     
      
    98 Sarah Burgess worked at Nowra K-Mart as a check-out operator. She met Leonie. One day Leonie and her boyfriend came through the check-out with two trolleys filled with household items totalling about $1,500. Taber handed Leonie the money which she then handed to Burgess in old $100 notes. Burgess identified the receipt she issued which had been found by police during a search of 211 Old Southern Road. Ian Styman and Taber also made purchases in cash using old $100 notes during January 2001. 
     
      
    99 On 7 January 2001, Ian Styman bought a Suzuki Sierra from Alan Stoker. Stoker placed the ad in the Trading Post and met three males and a female for the car to be inspected. It was taken for a test drive. One of the males agreed to buy it for $4,300. This male went to a Hyundai and returned with the cash in old $100 notes. A receipt was made out to Ian Styman though wrongly dated 8 January 2001. A certificate of registration for this vehicle noted the transfer of the registration to Ian Styman. 
     
      
    100 On 7 January 2001, Taber bought a white Ford Utility from a car dealership in Villawood. Mustafa Batak was the salesman. He recalled two males and a female were present during the sale. One of the males had a beer gut. He said they needed a cheap utility. The price agreed on was $1,400. The white utility was bought on condition that the exhaust was repaired that day. The other male told Batak that they had the cash and showed Batak a bum bag containing a roll of money, about 2 inches thick. A contract was drawn up in Taber’s name, though the sale price on that contract was $100. The paper work was completed in the office where the other male handed over the money to Taber. The money was counted and Batak noted that it was in old $100 notes, which he identified as similar to one which had been handed by Taber to Detective Senior Constable Davies during the search of Taber’s house. Batak commented about these old notes and Taber said they were still in use in Nowra. The owner of the car dealership also counted the money and saw that it was comprised of old $100 notes. He asked Taber where he got the money from because he had not seen that money around. Taber said that it was still around. 
     
      
    101 On 8 January 2001, a male with a young woman and two children looked at a Honda motor bike which had been advertised for sale by Martin and Patricia Carter. It sold for $900, which was paid in cash. Mrs Carter was unable to recall what type of notes were used though she believed they were $50 notes. Mr Cater believed that the notes were “more like paper currency rather than plastic notes” but could not be sure. A receipt was issued in the name of Shannon Styman.  
     
      
    102 Evidence from banking institutions and the Reserve Bank was that new $100 notes came into circulation on 15 May 1996. No $100 notes were issued from ATM machines in Nowra. Cheryle had worked as a bar attendant at the Greenwell Point Bowling Club. She had once seen an old $100 note pass through the club. She recalled it because she did not see those notes “that often”. Evidence from Australia Post was that no “cash” mail had been sent to Ian Styman from November 2000 to January 2001. 
     
      
    103 On 24 January 2001, after Taber returned to 211 Old Southern Road from Nowra Police (following the search of his house), there were several people still at the house. Taber was asked by Cheryle about the money she had seen with Leonie and if he had any old notes. Meegan Herne told Taber she had also seen old notes. Taber said he may have had one or two. Cheryle told him she had seen more of these notes. Taber said he had sold a shed and was paid in old notes and that his employer had paid him in old notes. Cheryl and Melinda expressed scepticism. Taber said his father had lent money to him.  
     
      
    104 In cross-examination, Marie Rose Gale, a sister of Mrs Alchin, who was also present at the house, said that Taber also said he had $8,000 in old notes and was owed another $5,000. 
     
      
    105 A discussion took place about what had happened at the Police Station. Taber made a call on his mobile phone. Ian Styman came by and picked up Taber in his Suzuki 4WD. Someone else was in the back seat. Taber left the house and returned later. Later Meegan Herne saw Taber, Ian and Shannon Styman in the 4WD at a service station. Taber arrived home around half an hour afterwards. He was upset because the police had taken all the new things he had worked very hard for. 
     
      
    106 Taber said that if he had parked his ute on the other side of the road the police could not have touched it. Meegan Herne said in cross-examination that in this conversation he had been referring to a $100 note the police had taken off him. Evidence was led from other persons who had paid Taber for building work he had undertaken. This was to the effect that he had been paid by cheque or in cash in new notes. 
     
      
    107 The Crown tendered mobile phone records. On 7 January 2001, at 3.25 am, a 9 second call was registered on the Nowra tower from Taber’s mobile phone to Ian Styman’s mobile phone. At 5. 25 am, there was a call to Vodafone, which registered on the Mount Cambewarra tower which was further north. On 7 January 2001, at 4.31 am, there was a call from Ian Styman’s mobile phone to Taber’s mobile phone which was listed as a diverted call and lasted for 2 seconds. A call made at 5.09 am to Vodafone registered on the Nowra tower and at 6.07 am registered on the Saddleback Mountain tower. From 9.42 am there were a series of calls registered on the Merrylands tower. 
     
      
    108 Gareth Arthur Simmons, from Vodafone, gave evidence that the strongest cell that picks up a mobile call is generally the closest one. If a phone call was made from the Greenwell Point area, in which Mrs Alchin’s house was located, the most likely receiving site would be the Nowra site. Simmons and Detective Sergeant Angelo Memmolo conducted an experiment using Ian Styman’s mobile number by making calls from 1/16 Frederick Street, Sanctuary Point, Ian Styman’s house, and then from the corner of Sanctuary Point Road and Paradise Road. The Nowra site did not register on any of these calls. 
     
      
    109 The Crown relied on this evidence to show that Ian Styman and Taber were not at their respective houses when the calls were made.  
     
      
    110 Ian Styman was interviewed by police on three occasions, once on 3 March 2001 and twice on 26 March 2001.  
     
      
    111 Ian Styman was questioned about money he had earned and spent. He had paid for his Suzuki in new notes with money accumulated from work. He denied having paid with old notes. He had not been near Taber when Taber purchased the white ute on 7 January 2001. At that time, Ian was across the road in Taber’s mother’s white Hyundai. He did not know how Taber paid for the ute. 
     
      
    112 Ian Styman did not recall what he was doing on 5, 6 and 7 January 2001 though he would have had no reason to be out in the early morning. He denied having been out on the night of 6 January 2001, though he may have gone to Taber’s house and then to another person’s house in relation to a boat. He had returned home before midnight. He denied having ever been to Mrs Alchin’s house and said he did not know her. He was questioned about the call made from his mobile at 3.25 am on 7 January 2001. He could not explain what the call was about nor why it had registered from the Nowra tower.  
     
      
    113 Ian Styman was also asked about calls tapped by police in which he spoke of his concern in relation to DNA evidence. He said he had become concerned about DNA being planted after a detective had told him he would be going down, no matter what. He denied ever speaking to John Styman about interfering with DNA results. 
     
      
    114 Ian Styman told police he had gone to Taber’s house, on 24 January 2001 after Taber returned from the police station, because he wanted to know why Taber had told police he had money in his bum bag. Ian denied having a bum bag when he went to Sydney to buy a car. Sergeant Angelo Memmolo denied in cross-examination that following the interview of 3 March 2001, he told Ian, “You’re going down for this no matter what”. 
     
      
    115 Taber was interviewed by police on 24 January 2001. During this interview he was questioned about the money he used to make the purchases he made (such as his car and the purchases from Nowra K-Mart) and in particular how he managed to be in possession of old notes. He said he had accumulated money from jobs he had done and that he was sometimes paid with old notes. He kept the money he was accumulating hidden from Leonie and usually at his parents’ house. He denied there had ever been an attempt to borrow money from Mrs Alchin or that there had been a conversation about killing her. He said he did not know of Mrs Alchin having a substantial amount of cash; he did not know her. 
     
      
    116 During the interview with Taber this interchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … we had two rolls of grey duct tape. A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did they come from? A. Um, South Nowra servo. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The purpose of having those rolls of tape is for what, can you tell me that please? A. Um, well you also found some in the back of me ute wrapped up. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Two rolls of it, yes. A. Yeah, What we do is because the steel we use is so light um, we wrap the tape around it to hold it all together then you can sit it all on your ute in one bundle, tie it down, just basically to, and the same with um, … from … and stuff like that. Yeah, ‘cause, ‘cause you can’t tie them down, like you’ve, you’ve got a, a ridge on an angle, the steel angle like that. If you go to tie that down with a rope … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Mr Taber, do you, do you have cause to use those ties, … A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. … plastic ties? A. Yeah.” 
        
       
       
      No case to answer submission  
       
      
    117 After the Crown closed its case on the thirty-sixth day of the hearing, 31 October 2002, counsel for each of the accused submitted that his client had no case to answer on the count of murder and applied for a verdict by direction. Barr J refused these applications for reasons given in a judgment on 1 November 2002.  
     
      
    118 At this stage critical to Barr J’s reasoning that the charge of murder should be left to the jury, was his view that, despite the 000 call, it was open to the jury to find, that the binding, gagging and abandonment of Mrs Alchin caused her death and that the evidence against each accused was capable of establishing that at the time of the act causing death the accused realised that death would probably occur but continued with his course of conduct regardless.  
     
      
    119 On 6 November 2002, Barr J made some further remarks to be incorporated into his earlier judgment. In particular he referred to Lawford & Anor v R (1993) 61 SASR 542, a decision of the Full Court of South Australia. The failure of the accused to rescue Mrs Alchin from the danger into which she had been deliberately put could be treated as an omission by the accused causing death. For reasons which Barr J gave, he said he did not think it appropriate to leave the case to the jury as one in which the accused were said to have caused the death of Mrs Alchin by omitting to perform any duty. The events were better seen by being categorised in the usual way as acts causing death. As will appear, his Honour did not adhere to that view. 
     
      
       
      Further judgment on no case submissions 
       
      
    120 On 11 December 2002 (the day when the jury returned its verdicts), Barr J delivered further reasons for judgment “On the basis on which murder should be left to the jury” (reported in 56 NSWLR 443). He observed that his added remarks on 6 November 2002 indicated he was unsure whether the events occurring between the time of the attack on Mrs Alchin and the time of her death were properly to be regarded as a single continuous act or as an act followed by an omission. His Honour went on to say that, following his remarks of 6 November and before counsels’ closing addresses began, he made it clear that he proposed to leave to the jury the availability of a verdict of guilty of murder in any accused’s case constituted by an omission to fulfil a legal duty to remove Mrs Alchin from the danger in which she had been put combined with a realisation, at any time during the period of omission and ending with her death, that she would probably die. The judgment of 11 December 2002 recorded his Honour’s revised reasons for leaving the counts of murder to the jury and his Honour’s reasons for the way those counts were left to the jury in the summing up. 
     
      
    121 By the time Barr J came to sum up to the jury, he accepted that if any accused had abandoned Mrs Alchin intending to alert the authorities with the intention or expectation that Mrs Alchin should be rescued by the police, the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at that time that accused fully realised that the deceased would probably die. Inevitably, the Crown case then depended upon establishing beyond reasonable doubt that after the 000 call was made each of the accused omitted to perform a duty owed by that accused to Mrs Alchin accompanied by the full realisation that that omission would probably result in her death. The duty which followed from the accuseds’ abandonment of Mrs Alchin, tied and gagged as they had left her, was to take all reasonable and practicable steps to release her after the making of the telephone call. The jury’s consideration of whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused fully realised that his omission would probably result in Mrs Alchin’s death had to take account of the making of the 000 call and whether thereafter the accused fully realised that Mrs Alchin would probably die, assuming her still to be alive. Moreover, the necessary causal relationship, which had to be established, was not between Mrs Alchin’s death and the act of binding, gagging and abandonment but between her death and the failure, after the 000 call, to take all reasonable and practicable steps to perform the duty. Barr J accepted that this was the Crown’s case but both in his reasons for judgment of 11 December 2002 and from time to time in his summing up his Honour referred to the act of binding, gagging and abandonment as the cause of death and stated the resultant duty not in terms of reasonableness and practicability but in absolute terms.  
     
      
    122 It is clear that causation is a question of fact and, hence, the question whether the Crown had proved the appellants’ acts or omissions caused Mrs Alchin’s death was not for the judge but the jury to determine. It was clear enough that, as it happened, her death would not have occurred but for the appellants’ omission to remove her from danger subsequent to the 000 call. It was also the case that her death would not have occurred but for an instance of serious negligence on the part of the telephone operator in failing to communicate the call to the police. The question was whether, in these circumstances, the death of Mrs Alchin should be regarded as caused by the appellants’ omission or, more precisely, that their omission should be regarded as having substantially contributed to her death, was a matter of factual evaluation that should have been left to the jury. We are inclined to the view that the jury would have determined this question adversely to the appellants but, in light of the conclusion that we have reached as to the reasonableness of the murder verdicts, we do not have to decide this point or whether, if the adverse decision were inevitable, there would nevertheless have been a substantial miscarriage of justice in the sense articulated in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 371-372 (see also Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593). 
     
      
    123 Barr J referred to several cases in which were listed what his Honour described as well recognised categories of circumstances which gave rise to a legal duty in one person to act in a particular way towards another, a failure to perform which would render the obligated person liable to be dealt with criminally. Amongst these were R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226 at 236-245. His Honour quoted from the judgment of McAlvay CJ in People v Beardsley (1907) 113 NW 1128 at 1129-1130. There the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law recognizes that under some circumstances the omission of a duty owed by one individual to another, where such omission results in the death of the one to whom the duty is owing, will make the other chargeable with manslaughter ... This rule of law is always based upon the proposition that the duty neglected must be a legal duty, and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty imposed by law or by contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the immediate and direct cause of death.” 
        
       
      
    124 So stated, the principle has ready application to relationships giving rise to such a duty. Reference was made to the legal relation of protector, as husband to wife, parent to child, master to seaman, knowing such person to be in peril and to proper efforts to rescue without jeopardising the life of the person owing the duty or the lives of others. Failure to make such reasonable and proper efforts could result in the person being guilty of manslaughter “at least” if by reason of the omission of duty the person to whom it was owed died. Barr J referred to four situations, identified by Yeldham J in Taktak where failure to act might constitute a breach of legal duty. These were the statutory duty to care for another, a certain status relationship to another, assumption of a contractual duty of care to another and a voluntary assumption of care to another. 
     
      
    125 With more particular relevance to the present case, in Lawford at 547-8, the South Australian Full Court said that a duty not to leave a person in danger might arise where the defendant had put that person in danger by a wrongful act. 126 Barr J referred to R v Miller [1980] 2 QB 532 (Court of Appeal) [1983] 2 AC 176 (House of Lords). In that case the appellant, a house squatter, fell asleep on a mattress with a lighted cigarette and the mattress caught fire. The appellant awoke and realised that the mattress was smouldering. He did nothing about it but moved to another room in the premises. The house caught fire. The appellant was charged with arson. He was convicted and appealed. The question of law involved ([1983] 2 AC at 174) was whether the actus reus of the offence of arson was present when a defendant accidentally started a fire and thereafter, intending to destroy or damage property belonging to another or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged, failed to take any steps to extinguish the fire or to prevent damage to such property by that fire. Lord Diplock at 174 preferred to speak in terms of the conduct of the accused and his state of mind at the time of that conduct instead of speaking of actus reus and mens rea. He also preferred to speak in terms of “responsibility” rather than “duty”. 
     
      
    127 Like arson in the classification referred to by Lord Diplock, murder is a “result crime” not complete unless, and until, the conduct of the accused has caused death. So the period from that immediately before the act and the death may be considerable and the conduct of the accused causative of the result may consist not only of the physical acts but also of the failure to take measures that lie within the accused’s power to counteract the danger the accused has created. As the accused’s conduct, active or passive, varies during this period so too may the accused’s state of mind at the time of each piece of conduct (175). 
     
      
    128 At 175-6 Lord Diplock said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If at the time of any particular piece of conduct by the accused that is causative of the result, the state of mind that actuates his conduct falls within the description of one or other of the states of mind that are made a necessary ingredient of the offence…I know of no principle of English criminal law that would prevent his being guilty of the offence.…Likewise I see no rational ground for excluding from conduct capable of giving rise to criminal liability, conduct which consists of failing to take measures that lie within one’s power to counteract a danger that one has oneself created, if at the time of such conduct one’s state of mind is such as constitutes a necessary ingredient of the offence.…I cannot see any good reason why, so far as liability under criminal law is concerned, it should matter at what point of time before the resultant damage is complete a person becomes aware that he has done a physical act which, whether or not he appreciated that it would at the time when he did it, does in fact create a risk that property of another will be damaged, provided that, at the moment of awareness, it lies within his power to take steps, either himself or by calling for the assistance of the fire brigade if this be necessary, to prevent or minimise the damage to the property at risk.” 
        
       
      
    129 In Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378 at 390-391, Mason CJ referred to the necessity for coincidence between act and intent and the way in which the deceased met her death. At 458 McHugh J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is trite law that the relevant state of mind and the harm-causing act ‘must both concur to constitute the crime’ … [but] the state of mind of an accused does not have to coincide with the time of the deceased’s death.” 
        
       
      
    130 These statements apply, of course, as much to omissions as to acts. 
     
      
    131  Thus the case against each accused was necessarily one where the Crown had to prove acts by the accused imposing upon him a duty or responsibility to take all reasonable and practicable steps to release Mrs Alchin and his omission after the 000 call to perform that duty accompanied by a realisation that as a result Mrs Alchin would probably die. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
      Summary of the case for the appellant Taber 
       
      
    132 On 5 November 2002 the Crown by leave re-opened its case and called Leonie Ravell. After her evidence was complete, the Crown again closed its case and the cases of each of the accused were opened and evidence given. The appellants each gave evidence, as did Shannon Styman.  
     
      
    133 Taber gave evidence and was cross-examined. He was a friend of the appellant Ian Styman. He moved into 211 Old Southern Road about two or three months before Christmas 2000 because he had formed a relationship with Leonie. He worked as a builder and also did security work, twice with Ian Styman at a caravan park. His uniform was dark pants and bright yellow shirt but on one job at a hotel in Wollongong he wore a blue shirt with a tie. This was on New Year’s Eve in 1998/1999. He had never seen the shirts that Sharyn Styman identified. In cross-examination, he said that his uniform was returned to his company employer. 
     
      
    134 Taber knew Peake but did not see much of him. He could not recall ever going to Greenwell Point with Peake, though he said there might have been a time between January and March 2000. Although his counsel cross-examined Peake on the basis that Peake was confused about when he had gone with Taber and Ian Styman to Greenwell Point pub, this had not been on Taber’s instructions. 
     
      
    135 Taber said that over December 2000 he did building work at a location past Canberra and remained there between Monday and Thursday travelling back to Nowra on Fridays for the weekend. This job was completed on 20 December 2000. He said he would have been in Nowra on 2 and 3 December. He denied the events described by Peake ever occurred.  
     
      
    136 Taber said he had completed an apprenticeship as a plant mechanic and used cable ties which were found by police in his house and which he said he had bought from K-Mart. He also used duct tape in his building work and for transporting material. He did not have a practice of keeping used duct tape. It would be thrown away. He gave evidence about the duct tape police found in his back yard. He said he had used duct tape on the pool to stop leaking which had been caused by a cat.  
     
      
    137 Taber said that on the night of 5 January he was at home. On 6 January he was home during the morning. At about 4 pm or 4.30 pm, Ian Styman came over on his motor bike with a PlayStation and a racing game. They set it up on the TV. Leonie was out the back in the pool and sunbaking at the time. At about 5.30 pm Shannon arrived at the house. Taber went to McDonalds and when he returned Shannon wanted to know if he could borrow Taber’s mother’s car to go home. He had asked Ian Styman to give him a lift home but Ian Styman did not have a spare helmet with him so Taber let Shannon take the car. Taber did not drive Shannon home because he had been drinking beer that day and would have been close to the limit. Shannon left at about 6.15 pm.  
     
      
    138 Taber and Ian Styman continued with the PlayStation game as they needed first to qualify for licences. Leonie came in but she did not take much notice of them. Taber argued with her about something and she said she was going to bed. Ian Styman left at about 8.30 or 8.45 pm on his motor bike. He pushed it out of the driveway on to the road and started it there. This was what he usually did at night. Leonie had been in bed for fifteen or twenty minutes. Taber went back inside and stayed on the PlayStation game until about 3 am.  
     
      
    139 At about that time, Shannon showed up at Taber’s front door which was open. Taber saw a silhouette and initially thought it was a friend of his. Taber asked him what he was doing there and asked about his mother’s car. Shannon said he had left it up the road. He reassured Taber that he had not smashed it but said he had left it up there but he did not want to bring it to Taber’s house. Taber wanted to know what was going on because he had originally told Shannon to return the car at 10 am the next day. Shannon told Taber that he thought that he would drop in on Taber before going home. Taber told him that he was meant to go home at 6 pm when he first borrowed the car. Taber became frustrated with Shannon who said: “I did over a drug dealer” or “I robbed a drug dealer”. Taber was astonished and said “What the fuck are you doing? Why did you do it in mum’s car?” They argued on Taber’s front porch, though Taber tried keeping his voice low because Leonie was in bed. In cross-examination, Taber said that from his bedroom he would not necessarily hear an argument on the porch.  
     
      
    140 Taber and Shannon went up the road so that Taber could check on the car. They argued more and Taber rang Ian Styman at around 3.30 am, which explained the 9 second call at 3.25 am as shown in the mobile phone records. Taber told Ian to “Get your arse into town now. Shannon has done something stupid.” They arranged to meet across from the Honda shop in South Nowra. He did not want Shannon at his house because he was furious with him and he did not want Leonie to wake up.  
     
      
    141 Taber drove the car to the arranged meeting point. Ian Styman showed up at around 4 am on his motor bike. Taber told Ian Styman “Shannon’s just done a drug dealer over in my mother’s car.” Ian Styman said “So?”, Taber said “It’s me fucking mother’s car.” Ian Styman walked up to Shannon and said “What do you think you are doing?” and they argued. Ian Styman then said he wanted to get something to eat, so Taber told him to leave his motor bike at his (Taber’s) house and they would go in the car.  
     
      
    142 Ian Styman drove the motor bike to Taber’s house and left it there. He was then picked up by Taber in Taber’s mother’s car with Taber driving and Shannon in the front seat. Ian Styman turned on the light and looked in the back of the car and told Taber to pull the car over. Taber did and Ian Styman got out and asked Shannon what he had done. Ian Styman said “This isn’t stuff from a drug dealer’s house”. Shannon said it was but Ian Styman said, “There’s old purses, there’s pennies, old jewellery. What have you done?” Shannon then said, “I did an old bag over at Greenwell Point”. They argued and Ian Styman asked Shannon where she was now. Shannon said she was “Out there tied up because he had to tie her up to look for the money, but he had found none”. Ian Styman told Shannon that he had to go out and untie her, but Shannon said “No she can get free”. Ian Styman told him that he had better make sure and told Shannon to ring someone. Shannon refused and Ian Styman said, “You’re ringing someone, I’m taking you to the phone box and you’re fucking going to ring someone”. 
     
      
    143 Ian Styman went into the driver’s seat and drove the car to a phone box on Greenwell Point Road. Ian Styman said they would ring the police. Shannon refused so Ian Styman said he would ring. He asked Shannon where the lady was and Shannon said she was in Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point, the second house from the end. Ian Styman walked to the phone box with Taber and he rang 000.  
     
      
    144 After the call they re-entered the car with Ian Styman driving. Taber told Shannon “I want all the shit out of my car”, and the car was driven back to Taber’s house where it was cleaned out. By now it was around 5 am and Shannon put everything into a bag, including surgical gloves, pennies and jewellery, as well as half a brick, taken from Taber’s house and Shannon tied the bag with cable ties. Taber said in cross-examination that he had also seen Shannon put a key into the bag. He had earlier said that he had not seen a key, but his evidence was that he had meant to say that he had not seen the key from close up. 
     
      
    145 Ian Styman then drove the car from Taber’s house to Nowra Bridge. Shannon opened the window and threw the bag into the river. I interpolate that Detective Sergeant Memmolo gave evidence that divers were unable to recover any bag from the river. 
     
      
    146 Taber arrived home at about 5.30 am on 7 January and woke up Leonie. The day before he and Ian Styman had organised to go to Sydney to look for cars and he thought that Leonie might want to come along. They had originally planned to go later that day but because of everything that had happened they decided to leave earlier. Leonie came into the car, Taber’s mother’s white Hyundai, and went to sleep. Taber first drove to his parents’ house to collect some of his money ($1,500). The money had accumulated because he had not been up to date with his GST payments. 
     
      
    147 They looked through various car yards. At one point Shannon handed Ian Styman “a wad of cash first and then he passed me a wad of cash”. He did not really say anything and the money was in old notes. Taber received $3,000. Ian Styman asked Shannon what that was for and Shannon said “Its for helping me out”. Ian Styman asked where it came from and Shannon told him from the robbery. He said he had gotten about twenty-three grand. The $100 note Taber gave to Constable Davies during the search of his house was not part of the money given to him by Shannon. He kept that note in his wallet as a lucky note. 
     
      
    148 Taber took the money because he needed it. He had not paid his tax and he needed a new car and was pretty broke. He bought a ute that day (the white ute in which the police subsequently found the two rolls of scrunched duct tape). At this time Leonie was across the road. They also bought a PlayStation from K-Mart. He used the $1,500 he had brought with him to buy a new TV, a stereo and kitchen items. He recognised the receipt for these. Ian Styman also bought a Suzuki Sierra. They also bought some furniture and Ian Styman bought an entertainment cabinet. After driving back home, Taber parked the ute in his carport and Shannon left with Ian Styman in his Suzuki. Ian Styman’s motor bike was left at Taber’s house. 
     
      
    149 Taber used the money given to him by Shannon to buy other electrical items and kitchen appliances and to pay other bills. He had lied to Leonie and said he had sold a shed because he knew the money “had been basically obtained illegally by Shannon” and he did not want anyone to know. He agreed that he had lied to Leonie and Melinda Ravell after coming back to his house from the police station on 24 January 2001 by telling them that he had received money from a job in Canberra. He had lied because he did not want them to know what had happened. During an intercepted conversation, he also said that he had been stripped searched by the police.  
     
      
    150 The next day, Taber brought Ian Styman’s new entertainment cabinet to Ian Styman’s house. He believed his evidence at trial was to the same effect, even though Sharyn Styman gave evidence that Ian Styman brought home the entertainment cabinet on the same day as the new Suzuki and was not cross-examined about that. Taber and Ian Styman spoke about the amount of money they were given. Ian Styman said he did not think that Shannon robbed an old lady. They spoke about the possibility that Shannon had in fact robbed a drug dealer like he had first said. Taber did not see Shannon again between that time and 19 January. 
     
      
    151 Between 7 and 19 January, Taber did not have any idea about the identity of the old lady. Leonie never mentioned Mrs Alchin’s name during that time. He had known Leonie for three to four months. He had not considered following up on the 000 call “because I took it that they had gone out” and because of his discussion with Ian Styman that Shannon must have robbed a drug dealer. He had not heard anything on the news about a lady being found tied up and robbed so he assumed that the 000 call had gone through and was checked and found to be bogus. In cross-examination his evidence was that his intention and belief was that the lady would be rescued once the 000 call was made.  
     
      
    152 Leonie eventually told Taber that her aunt was found dead at Greenwell Point. The next day, Ian Styman came to Taber’s house and said he had a conversation with Shannon who had told Ian Styman that the house he robbed was covered with police tape. They then realised that the victim had been Leonie’s aunt. They were shocked and did not discuss it. Taber had never met Mrs Alchin and had never discussed borrowing money from her. He had never been to her house and was not aware that she kept large quantities of cash. He denied the evidence of Donyelle Turner and denied ever being privy to conversations where Leonie was disappointed about her aunt refusing to lend them money and saying that they could always kill her.  
     
      
    153 Taber kept a book with sketched plans of buildings because he worked in the building industry but he had never sketched a plan of Mrs Alchin’s house. Taber’s evidence in cross-examination was that before the 000 call when Shannon mentioned the lady lived in Spies Avenue, nothing clicked with him to identify her with Leonie’s aunt. Taber’s evidence was that the mask found by police during the search of his house on 24 January belonged to his younger brother who had bought it at the Easter Show. The gloves were his mother’s, as she was a community nurse. This evidence was corroborated by William Taber. 
     
      
    154 Taber gave evidence that when his panel van and ute were searched at his house he did not recall seeing Inspector Carter around. He could not recall seeing the two scrunched up rolls of duct tape in his ute before police found them and he did not recall putting them there himself. Taber agreed in his evidence that when he was interviewed by police about the use to which he put the duct tape in his building work he had also said, “Well, you also found some in the back of me ute wrapped”. This was because he had not taken much notice of it at first, but he later thought about it and realised that he had never kept used duct tape. Taber also gave evidence about a tapped conversation with Leonie in which he told her that police had found two rolls of screwed up duct tape in the back of his utility, but at that time Taber had not really thought about the police finding it. 
     
      
    155 Taber gave evidence that when he was at Nowra Police Station and went into the charge room he was told by Detective Davies that he would be stripped searched, which he then was. Davies, in cross-examination, denied that this happened. Senior Constable Kevin Hugh Pattison (the Custody Officer at the time) gave evidence that Taber was not stripped searched while in his custody. After getting dressed, Taber was told, “Listen mate you tell us everything you know and we’ll go easy on you”. In cross-examination, Davies agreed that he might have said this to Taber because it was a fact that assistance could be given to people who told the truth. 
     
      
    156 Taber agreed he had told numerous lies to police when he was interviewed, particularly in relation to where he obtained the money to make his purchases. He had lied because he was scared. Taber did not tell the police anything he knew about Shannon because at the time the police were trying to blame him and he thought they would take anything he said the wrong way.  
     
      
    157 Subsequent to his interview, Taber went home and later Ian Styman and Shannon came by in Ian Styman’s Suzuki. They all left and drove down the street where Ian Styman asked Taber why he had told police that he had his bum bag when they were in the car yard. Taber denied ever saying that to police and Ian Styman told Shannon that it was his fault and that he had better fix it.  
     
      
    158 Taber was cross-examined about the implausibility of Shannon walking to his house on the afternoon of 6 January on the off-chance that he would get a lift home from Ian Styman and about Shannon showing up at Taber’s house at 3 am in the morning when they had arranged for Shannon to return Taber’s mother’s car the next morning at 10 am, particularly as, on Taber’s case, Shannon left the car up the road with jewellery and other items of value.  
     
      
    159 Taber was also cross-examined about why he had telephoned Ian Styman after Shannon showed up at 3 am at his house. Taber explained that he had not known what to do. His call to Ian Styman at 3.35 am lasted 9 seconds. Taber was cross-examined about how Taber managed to arrange a meeting with Ian Styman in that short space of time.  
     
      
    160 Taber was cross-examined about the implausibility of his having chosen to confront Shannon with Ian Styman near the Honda shop. Taber said it was off the highway. Taber was questioned about when he had seen the various items in the back seat of his mother’s car. He said it was when they were waiting for Ian Styman at the Honda shop. He did not know why he had told Shannon to get rid of them from his car there and then. He could not explain why Shannon had tipped everything into his back seat in the first place.  
     
      
    161 Taber was concerned about getting rid of the items in the back seat and he could not explain why they drove back to his house after the Honda shop. It was Taber’s evidence, that Ian Styman drove his motor bike to Taber’s house and parked it in the driveway. He acknowledged Leonie’s evidence that she had not heard the sound of a bike around 4.30 am. In cross-examination, Taber said that it took time to wake up Leonie and that she was a heavy sleeper. His evidence was that when he was playing the PlayStation the sound was turned down and the doors were kept closed. 
     
      
    162 Taber was cross-examined about the 2 second diverted call from Ian Styman’s mobile phone to Taber’s mobile phone at 4.31 am on 7 January. This was at a time when, on Taber’s evidence, he was driving back to his house after the Honda shop. Taber could not remember this call. 
     
      
    163 In cross-examination, Taber said that when Shannon threw the bag over the Nowra Bridge he had also thrown a roll of duct tape. His evidence was that it had always been his instructions that it was Shannon Styman who threw the bag and he had never said it was Ian Styman. Taber was cross-examined about why Shannon tied the bag with a cable tie if it was to be thrown out anyway.  
     
      
    164 In cross-examination Taber said that he had been worried about his mother’s car being identified in the robbery but he could not explain why he nevertheless agreed to travel to Sydney with Shannon in that car.  
     
      
    165 Taber was also cross-examined about the implausibility of his evidence that Shannon gave money to Ian Styman and Taber as a thank you, when Ian Styman had not helped Shannon but had been angry with him and had insisted they call the police. Taber could not explain why Ian Styman told the 000 operator that more than one person had broken into the house of the lady. Taber said in cross-examination, that his mistake was taking the money from Shannon. 
     
      
    166 Taber called Helmet Glanzer, a communications and software engineer, to give evidence. He had conducted an experiment by taking a mobile phone to Greenwell Point and noting the base stations showing up on the mobile phone. At 23 Spies Avenue, Mrs Alchin’s home, two base stations service the area, Princess and Shoalhaven. The Princess base station was most likely serviced by Saddleback Mountain and not Nowra. Half way between Nowra and Greenwell Point the mobile stopped showing the Nowra base station. Mr Glanzer was taken to the call made at 3.25 am on 7 January 2001 from Taber’s mobile phone which registered on the Nowra base station. In his opinion the call could not have been made from Spies Avenue. In relation to the second diverted call at 4.31 am from Ian Styman’s mobile phone, Glanzer said that it was most likely not picked up and hence was a message bank from Vodafone.  
     
      
    167 Taber also called Gareth Arthur John Simmons, a senior engineer for Vodafone Australia. He gave evidence about the phone records for Shannon’s mobile phone. On 6 January 2001, there was a call at 10.29 pm to Vodafone from Saddleback Mountain. Simmons said that this site was on a very high point and the call could have been made at Greenwell Point or anywhere on the low lying area. There were also calls at 4.29 am and 4.32 am on 7 January 2001 made to Vodafone. The Mount Cambewarra site picked up the first call and the second was picked up by Nowra. The fact that these two calls were picked up from both of these different sites meant that the caller was either in the Nowra area or in the borderline of those areas because of the lack of dominance between the two cells. The Mount Cambewarra site was very high and was directed down over the low lying area across the Greenwell Point and Black Forest. When asked if the caller could have been in Greenwell Point, Simmons said, “Given that they picked up the Mount Cambewarra site, that they were probably – the Greenwell Point area is a little bit too far east. They would have most likely picked up the Nowra site first. The fact that they are picking up the Mount Cambewarra site would put them north of Greenwell Point site … or further west.” 
     
      
    168 In relation to the second diverted call from Ian Styman’s mobile phone to Taber’s mobile phone at 4.31 am on 7 January 2001, Simmons said that the diversion could have been caused by the phone losing coverage and a call of two second duration would mean that the caller possibly caught the beginning of a message service and decided not to leave a reply. 
     
      
       
      Summary of the case for the appellant Ian Styman 
       
      
    169 Ian Styman gave evidence and was cross-examined. He said that he first discovered that an elderly lady had been robbed and tied up at Greenwell Point about ten minutes before he made the 000 call, once Shannon had told him what he had done. He admitted lying to the police when he was interviewed because he was afraid of being dragged into something that he did not do. Ian Styman denied the evidence of Peake and said that Sharyn Styman was mixed up when she gave evidence that she had seen him leave the house wearing a blue shirt. In cross-examination, he said that in January 2001 he owned a Kawasaki motor bike and described its noise as being medium. 
     
      
    170 In cross-examination, Ian Styman adopted the evidence he had heard Taber give in respect of the events of the early hours of 7 January 2001. He said he was at home when he received a call from Taber saying that Shannon had done something stupid in his mother’s car. Taber wanted to meet across from a Honda shop. Ian Styman had not asked any questions because it involved Shannon and he agreed that Taber’s meeting point was a lot closer to Taber’s house. He did not ask Taber what Shannon had done because Taber hung up after telling Ian Styman to meet him. This was the nine second call made at 3.25 am. Ian Styman agreed that he had lied when he told the police in his interview that he did not recall that call. 
     
      
    171 Ian Styman was in the kitchen making toast at the time of Taber’s call. He had been out in the garage fixing a computer and had the kitchen door closed so that the smell of the toast would not go through the house. He was cross-examined to the effect that he was making up this evidence, which he denied. He said that Sharyn Styman was mistaken in her evidence about him having left the house earlier that night. He had never spoken to her to correct her, after he received a copy of her statement, because she had been told not to speak to him. 
     
      
    172 Ian Styman drove his motor bike to meet Taber and Shannon. They were both sitting in Taber’s mother’s car. Taber told Ian Styman that Shannon had done over a drug dealer and was concerned about Shannon having used his mother’s car. Ian Styman had not asked Shannon any questions about what he had taken from the drug dealer. Taber then opened the back door and said “look at all this shit”. The light came on in the car and Ian Styman glanced at the back and basically saw gloves. At that stage he did not see any purses or jewellery or bags. Ian Styman gave Shannon “an earful” and said “its no use staying around here, lets go back to Peter’s place”.  
     
      
    173 Ian Styman drove to Taber’s house on his motor bike. He was cross-examined about the implausibility of this given that Taber had wanted to get away from his house. Ian Styman also said in cross-examination that he drove to Taber’s house because of his concern that police may be looking for the car and he wanted to get the car off the side of the road. However, he could not explain why they then travelled in that car to get something to eat.  
     
      
    174 Ian Styman arrived at Taber’s house before Taber and Shannon. He said he turned off his motor bike at the roadway because he had consideration for the neighbours and for Sharyn Styman and the kids. Ian Styman explained the two second diverted call, shown at 4.31 am in the mobile phone records from his mobile by saying that he had rung Taber to find out where he was and had hung up when the voicemail came on. Taber’s evidence had been that he was putting petrol in the car during this time.  
     
      
    175 Ian Styman was cross-examined about the mobile phone records of Shannon showing a call by Shannon to his house at 4.29 am. Ian Styman was not aware of such a call because at that time Shannon was with Taber on the way to Taber’s house. 
     
      
    176 Ian Styman was on the street when Taber arrived, and he told Taber he wanted to get a drink and a hot dog. Ian Styman entered the back seat and pulled the gloves from the floor and the seat and he saw a purse, a string bag, two rings and pennies. Ian Styman told Shannon, “You haven’t done a drug dealer over, what have you done?” He told Taber to pull over. Ian Styman got out of the car fuming. Shannon also got out. He was cross-examined about why he had not remained in the car to have this argument, but he said that the houses in the area were a distance away from where the car stopped. 
     
      
    177 Shannon told Ian Styman, “I’ve done an old bag’s place over … tied her up and stole some things”. Ian Styman told him that he had to get someone to go out there and untie her. In cross-examination, he was asked why he told Shannon to get someone else involved instead of telling Shannon to go and untie her himself. Ian Styman said he had been confused and had not thought about that. Ian Styman told Shannon to ring the police and Shannon said that the lady could untie herself. Ian Styman said he did not believe him and he denied in cross-examination that he was making this up.  
     
      
    178 Shannon refused to call the police, so Ian Styman made the 000 call while Shannon sat in the back of the car. Ian Styman was cross-examined about what he told the 000 operator, in particular that “a couple of blokes went in with guns”. He had said that to make it more realistic, and he had said “a couple” because it sounded better. He could give no other explanation.  
     
      
    179 Ian Styman had not asked Shannon how the lady was tied up, and he was cross-examined about the fact that he had also not asked any questions about the lady’s age, or whether she had a husband or children. He agreed that as far as he knew there could have been others who may have seen her to free her, but he never asked. Ian Styman had also seen duct tape in the back of the car. He was cross-examined about his reaction in seeing duct tape and cable ties in the car. He said that at first they were not noticeable and he never wondered if they were used on the lady. Ian Styman was cross-examined to the effect that his evidence was a lie and that it was implausible for him to suggest that he gave no significance to seeing these items when he had been so concerned, on his evidence, to make the 000 call.  
     
      
    180 After the call, they planned to get rid of everything from the car and they drove back to Taber’s house. Ian Styman was cross-examined about why they bothered returning there. He said he was driving and “we were just driving in that direction” and he had no explanation for why they did not just go to the Nowra Bridge and get rid of everything first. He was cross-examined to the effect that he was tailoring his evidence to suit the fact that the 000 call was made from a traced phone booth and thus he was giving a false explanation for where they were and where they were headed. 
     
      
    181 When they reached Taber’s house, Taber said. “The shit’s got to be cleaned out”. Everything was put into a string bag, which Ian Styman had also seen in the car. The bag was tied and they drove to the bridge. Ian Styman was cross-examined about the differing descriptions of the bag between Ian Styman and Taber and about the oddity of Shannon placing all these items in the back of the car in the first place. Shannon threw the bag over the bridge.  
     
      
    182 Ian Styman said that earlier that day he had made arrangements with Taber to go to Sydney and he asked Taber if they were still going. He said that Sharyn Styman was mixed up when she gave evidence that they had planned to trade in her car. Shannon asked to come along and Ian Styman had no objections. He was cross-examined about this, because on his version, the police may have been looking for Shannon. 
     
      
    183 Ian Styman was cross-examined about his purchase of the Suzuki on 7 January 2001. He paid in cash, with money given to him by Shannon, which was $4,000 in new notes and $1,000 in old $100 notes. At the time, Ian Styman was in a car yard and Shannon gave him the money and said he should buy something more decent. Ian Styman was cross-examined about what he had been planning to spend that day, before Shannon gave him the money. Ian Styman said he had $1,000. He was cross-examined about whether Sharyn Styman knew he had any money and he said she knew he had money but that she did not know the amount. He could not explain how Shannon knew that he did not have more money on him. In cross-examination, Ian Styman said that at the time when Shannon admitted to having robbed an old lady he had said that he had stolen money. Ian Styman nonetheless took the money from Shannon, though he disagreed with the evidence given by Taber, that Ian Styman had put the money in the back of his phone. Ian Styman’s evidence was that he had put it in his pocket. He did not have his bum bag that day and had kept $1,000 he had brought with him in the back of his phone case. 
     
      
    184 Ian Styman also bought a TV unit. He drove the Suzuki back home and left his motor bike at Taber’s house. Later that day, Taber drove to his house with the TV unit in his new ute. In cross-examination, he said that he had seen Shannon after 8 January 2001 and Shannon was worried that Ian Styman would dob him in. Ian Styman was scared to tell the police what he knew. He was cross-examined about his movements on 6 January 2001. He went to Taber’s house in the afternoon with a PlayStation, something they had organised the day before. They set it up in the lounge room. Ian Styman could not recall if he had seen Leonie because he was focused on the game. Shannon arrived about 6 pm. He had been dropped off at the top of the street by a friend and walked to Taber’s house which Ian Styman said was a couple of kilometres down the street. Ian Styman asked him what he was doing there and Shannon said that he had spotted his bike. Shannon borrowed Taber’s mother’s car. Ian Styman understood he was going home. Ian Styman’s evidence was that he was expected home for dinner at that time too. He was cross-examined about why he had not left with Shannon. He said it was because he had his motor bike at Taber’s house. He was cross-examined about why it was not easier for him to leave his motor bike there, drive Shannon home in the car and drive it to Taber’s the next day, since they had arranged to drive that car to Sydney.  
     
      
    185 In the previous week, Ian Styman and his wife Sharyn had plans to go to Sydney. On 5 or 6 January, Ian Styman and Taber organised to go together. Ian Styman agreed that he had not told his wife about this until the evening of 6 January when he got home from Taber’s house at around 9 pm. He denied that he then left with Shannon after telling her of the new arrangements. He said that she and the kids could not go to Sydney as well, because of the lack of room. He agreed that she had her own car and had wanted to trade it in. When asked why he excluded her from going to Sydney he said, “Because I changed my mind”. 
     
      
    186 Ian Styman’s evidence was that he had not left the house after arguing with Sharyn. He had headed into the garage with a computer. He remained at home until he received the phone call from Taber after 3 am. He agreed in cross-examination that he had asked his brother if it were possible for police to tamper with DNA, but he had not asked for any results to be altered. His evidence was that he had not been in tears. He had been concerned about the police planting DNA. He also gave evidence that he had worked in the key cutting and shoe repair business seven years earlier.  
     
      
    187 Ian Styman was cross-examined about security work he had done with Taber. He said that, between 1998 and 2000, he had worked with him twice, the second time at a caravan park in the new year of 1998/1999. He wore a uniform which included a short sleeved blue shirt. He could not be sure if he had ever seen the shirts produced by Sharyn Styman. He had no explanation for them being in his wardrobe. He said that Sharyn Styman was mixed up when she said he had left the house with Peake and some blue shirts. He said that Peake may have been lying because he was interested in Sharyn. 
     
      
    188 Ian Styman’s evidence was that although he was concerned about the old lady, he had made no further enquiries to see if she had been found. He had not listened to the news between 7 and 19 January. He did not make any enquiries of Shannon or Taber in this regard.  
     
      
    189 In cross-examination, he said that on 19 January Shannon had rung him between 4 and 6 pm to ask where he was because he wanted to talk to him. He was questioned about the phone records in respect of Shannon’s home phone. There were three calls from that phone to Ian Styman’s mobile phone on 19 January but none between 4 and 6 pm. In re-examination, he said that Shannon had access to two telephones. 
     
      
    190 Shannon met up with Ian Styman and told him that police had blocked off the house that he had broken into at Spies Avenue. He said that he did not free the lady because there were police everywhere. Ian Styman could not recall what he told Shannon who left after twenty minutes. Ian Styman tried to ring Taber but could not contact him. He had no explanation for why he had not rung Taber while Shannon was there. He was cross-examined about why he had not gone to Spies Avenue or to Taber’s house then, particularly as he had been so concerned to make the 000 call in the first place. He denied that what he was told by Shannon had not concerned him. Ian Styman went to see Taber the next day and Taber had told him that Leonie’s aunt was found murdered. They realised that Shannon was responsible. Ian Styman denied visiting Taber as a result of what Shannon had told him. His evidence was that it had just been a visit.  
     
      
    191 Ian Styman’s evidence was that he did not tell Shannon what Taber told him about the deceased being Leonie’s aunt until 24 January 2001. He said that, although his role had been minimal and that he had phoned 000, he did not go to the police because he did not think the police would believe him.  
     
      
    192 Ian Styman was questioned in relation to his use of the term “14” when speaking to Taber in some tapped conversations. He denied that he wanted to alert Taber to the fact that the phones might be tapped.  
     
      
    193 Ian Styman was also cross-examined about a tapped conversation between Taber and himself where they spoke about the night of 6 January 2001. Ian Styman told Taber that his problem was that he had no alibi because he was not sure where he was. Taber agreed and said “I mean for all I know we were out that night”. At the time of this conversation Ian Styman was not sure of where he had been although he was sure at the time that he gave his evidence. 
     
      
    194 Ian Styman called as a witness Brian Leslie McDonald, a fellow of the Australian College of Biomedical Sciences/Legal Medicine. McDonald said he had reviewed the evidence of Suzanne Briese in relation to the two blue shirts. He found himself at odds with her conclusion. The evidence indicated that one of the particular alleles corresponding to Ian Styman was not detectable in the DNA mixture. Therefore, his DNA could not be a component in the mixture and thus he was not a contributor to the shirt and would be excluded. He also disagreed with Ms Briese’s assumption that there were only two contributors. 
     
      
       
      Evidence of Shannon Styman 
       
      
    195 Shannon Styman gave evidence and was cross-examined. He lived at Erowel Bay with his de facto wife, Nadia Donn. Ian Styman was his uncle. Until 4 January 2001, he had not met Taber. On that date Shannon telephoned Ian and asked what he was doing. This was a call made at 11.30 am as shown in the phone records tendered. Ian Styman said he was going into town to drop off some PlayStations and Shannon asked if he could go with him. Ian Styman picked him up on his motor bike. Ian Styman asked Shannon if he was interested in making some money and Shannon said he was and asked Ian Styman what was involved. Ian Styman said “You’ll find out soon enough” and they left and eventually drove to Taber’s house.  
     
      
    196 Taber asked Shannon if he had a job and if he needed money. Shannon said he did not have a job and he did not have any money. Taber asked Shannon if he was interested in making any money and Shannon asked him what he had to do. Taber said his girlfriend’s aunt lived in Greenwell Point and had enough money to buy a house. Taber said that he and Ian Styman had gone to the house one night to try to break into the house and were unsuccessful because the lady had woken up and that on another occasion, the two of them went there with Peake dressed as security guards. Taber said they would use a key to get in via the back door which was a skeleton key. Taber told Shannon that all he had to do was make sure that the lady stayed where she was and did not get hurt. They discussed going to the house that weekend. Ian Styman dropped Shannon home. 
     
      
    197 On 5 January 2001, Shannon rang Ian Styman twice and asked what he was doing. These calls appeared on the phone records at 11.55 am and 12.47 pm. Ian Styman said he had to go to Nowra for PlayStations and he picked Shannon up and they went to Neil Simmons’ house. They then went to Taber’s house. Taber said he was going to Greenwell Point the next day. There was discussion about cable ties and duct tape being used to tie up the lady. Shannon also saw a key which had been modified by Ian Styman. Ian Styman dropped Shannon home. 
     
      
    198 On 6 January 2001, Shannon and Ian Styman made contact with each other. Ian Styman picked Shannon up and they went to Taber’s house where they sat with Taber and Leonie, who was in the pool. There was discussion in the presence of Leonie about going to Greenwell Point that evening, but there was no discussion about robbing an old lady. It was decided that if the key fitted the lock then they would go ahead with the robbery. Taber arranged to borrow his mother’s car and Shannon and Ian Styman were to go back to their homes. Ian Styman dropped Shannon home and then returned to pick him up at 6.30 pm.  
     
      
    199 Shannon told Nadia that he would be home before a friend was due to arrive from Sydney and he left with Ian Styman. Ian Styman drove Shannon to Taber’s place. They were all wearing dark clothes. Shannon noticed Taber take cable ties and duct tape from the top of his fridge. They left Taber’s house around 8.30 pm or 9 pm. Leonie was in bed. They drove to Greenwell Point in Taber’s mother’s car. Ian Styman was driving. Taber sat in the front passenger seat. Shannon sat in the back. Ian Styman and Taber pointed out 23 Spies Avenue at around 10 pm. The car was driven down to the reserve where they stayed for a few hours. Taber decided to drive back past the house. On the way, they saw that a light was still on so they drove past and went towards the wharf where they remained for a while. Ian Styman and Taber were waiting for the wind to pick up so they would not make a noise when they tried the key. Finally Taber said that they should drive past the house again. The front light was now off. Shannon asked what would happen if the key worked and Taber said, “We’ll go in and rob Mrs Alchin”. Shannon asked Taber what would happen if she saw them. Taber said that he would just put a sheet over her head. 
     
      
    200 The three of them jumped the fence into the property and went into the back yard. Taber tried the back door with a key and it worked. They decided not to go into the house at that time and retraced their steps to the car and sat for a little while longer. Taber then said, “Let’s do the job”. Gloves were taken out of the boot for each of them and they went back into the back yard. Taber pulled a pair of ladies underwear off the clothes line and put it in his pocket. They walked into the house via the back door with Taber first, followed by Ian Styman and Shannon. They entered the lady’s room and Taber grabbed her. At the time, Shannon stayed at the door. It was dark and he only saw that Taber was crouched down. Ian Styman grabbed the lady’s hands and Taber gave Ian Styman a set of cable ties from his pocket and Ian Styman placed them on her hands. By now Shannon was at the foot of the bed and he grabbed her legs and asked Taber for a set of cable ties. Taber gave them to Ian Styman who passed them to Shannon who put them on her legs. Taber grabbed the underwear from his pocket and “placed them across Mrs Alchin, put the duct tape and the gag … to keep it in place, grabbed a pillowcase, put it over Mrs Alchin’s head, and placed tape loosely around the head”. At about this time, Shannon was holding her legs. Taber told her that she would not get hurt and told her to say where the money was. Ian Styman turned on a lamp and Shannon sat beside the lady and held her down by placing a hand on her shoulder. She was lying still. 
     
      
    201 Ian Styman and Taber searched the bedroom and found nothing and they then went to search the lounge room. Shannon called out to Ian Styman because one of the cable ties was too tight. Ian Styman came in and saw that the lady’s hand was purple so he grabbed a knife from the kitchen and cut off one of the cable ties. He then placed duct tape around her hands. At about this time, her nightie had risen up and she was not wearing underwear so Ian Styman pulled the nightie down. Shannon denied that any of them sexually assaulted her. He did not see duct tape placed around her ankles and he did not see any duct tape removed from the deceased after it was placed on her. 
     
      
    202 Ian Styman eventually found money inside a brown paper bag in the bedroom. He called out to Taber and they decided to leave. Shannon asked if they would untie the lady and Ian Styman said they would ring the police. Taber left the room, tried the front door but he could not open it and came back in the room. The three of them grabbed two bed sheets and put them in between the mattress and tied them around the bed so that the lady could not hurt herself. When they left she was between the mattress and bed with a pillow case and the gag still on.  
     
      
    203 They left by the back door. Shannon rang Nadia at 4.32 am and left a message on the answering machine saying that he was going to Sydney which they had then decided to do. Calls shown on telephone records at 4.29 am and 5.34 am supported his evidence that he had rung Nadia and she had run him back. They had an argument about his going to Sydney.  
     
      
    204 The 000 call was made from the first phone booth they came to. Ian Styman made the call. Taber and Shannon stood outside the phone booth. They then went to Taber’s house and counted the money which came to $23,300. The money was split with Shannon getting $2,300, Ian Styman $7,000 and Taber $14,000. The cash was a mixture of old and new notes. Leonie was present when the money was counted. They set out for Sydney at about 5.30 or 6 am. Shannon denied throwing a bag over the Nowra Bridge. The only thing disposed of was the key by Taber in the bush. 
     
      
    205 Shannon’s evidence was that he spent the money on a TV and a PlayStation. Taber and Ian Styman made purchases at K-Mart and Ian Styman bought a TV unit which was placed in the back of Taber’s new ute. After they returned from Sydney, Shannon went with Ian Styman in his new Suzuki and they drove to Ian Styman’s place where the TV cabinet was dropped off. Shannon then went home and told Nadia that he had robbed a drug dealer. 
     
      
    206 Shannon agreed that he lied to police, when he was interviewed, by saying that he had not been involved with what happened to the deceased. He agreed that after his arrest in Queensland he told police that he had just gone in and taken the cash and that he had refused to nominate his co-offenders. He said he had not meant to harm the deceased and had checked to see that she was breathing before they left the house. He had expected the 000 call to be acted upon and did not think the lady would die. He had listened to the news and did not hear anything to suggest she had been found but he believed that perhaps the police had found her and were conducting a quiet investigation. He did not go to the authorities because he did not want to go to gaol. 
     
      
    207 Shannon had also told the police that it had been he who had fashioned the key to fit the lady’s back door. His evidence was that he said that so that the police would get an understanding of how they entered the house. He had also told police that he had been the one who cut the cable ties off the deceased’s hands. This was because he had not named his uncle Ian Styman to police. He agreed that he had also lied to police by saying that he had only $10,000 and had gone home to sleep afterwards. He had not wanted to mention anyone else who was involved. Shannon denied that Ian Styman had ever suggested to his brother that he tamper with DNA. 
     
      
    208 Nadia Suzanne Donn was called in the Crown case so that she would be available for cross-examination. She said that on 8 January 2001 Shannon bought a new motor bike and he frequently stayed out all night. There was an occasion when a friend was coming to stay at their house and Nadia had expected Shannon to be home but he went out and stayed out all night. The next morning she received a call from him saying that he was going to Sydney with Ian Styman, Taber and Leonie. He was dropped home in the early evening by Ian Styman. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      Summing Up 
       
      
    209 On 25 November 2002, after the completion of the defence cases, the Crown by leave called one more witness, Robert Goetz. Counsel then addressed the jury. On 29 November 2002, Barr J began his summing up to the jury.  
     
      
    210 In the course of directing the jury, Barr J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence of murder is committed when the accused does or is responsible for an act which causes death or when the accused makes an omission which causes death and at the time of the act or omission he fully contemplated it would probably result in death. So before you can find any accused guilty of the murder of Mrs Alchin, you must be satisfied that his act or an act for which he is responsible or his omission caused the death of Mrs Alchin and that the accused fully realised at the time that the probable consequence would be death but was nevertheless prepared to do the act or permit another to do it or was prepared to make the omission and take the chance that death would follow.” (p30-31) 
        
       
      
    211 After referring to medical evidence that Mrs Alchin survived between nine and eleven days without water and that the likely time of her death was somewhere between 16 and 18 January 2001 and the dominant cause of death was dehydration associated with restraint, with smothering happening right at the end when Mrs Alchin was so weak that her face came into contact with the pillowcase obstructing her nose, Barr J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “According to this evidence, the things which set in train the process of death were the binding, the gagging and the abandonment of Mrs Alchin. The abandonment began when her attacker or attackers left her bound and gagged. The abandonment continued until Mrs Alchin died, so it is open to you to find that the act causing death, constituted by the binding, gagging and the abandonment, was complete as soon as her attacker or attackers left her. It is also open to you to find that the omission after the abandonment to remove Mrs Alchin from the danger she was in was an omission which caused her death. 
        
       
       
        
        Was the act causing death that of any accused or did he make himself responsible for it? Apart from the evidence of Shannon Styman, there is no evidence that any particular accused did any particular thing during the course of the attack on Mrs Alchin. Of course, the Crown relies on Shannon Styman’s evidence. The Crown case against all accused is that all three of them took part in the attack against Mrs Alchin and then abandoned her and thereby made themselves responsible for the consequences, and that each is guilty of murder. But insofar as the Crown relies on any positive act, for instance, binding or gagging, the Crown cannot say except by relying on Shannon Styman’s evidence who precisely did what. The Crown says that all are responsible for what happened because they all took part in the attack. Each thereby made himself responsible for what they jointly did. The Crown says this was an enterprise in which they all joined.” (p33-34) 
        
       
      
    212 With due respect, the first quoted paragraph is confusing. What should have been made clear to the jury was that by the acts of binding, gagging and abandoning Mrs Alchin, each accused concerned made himself responsible to take all reasonable and practicable steps to release Mrs Alchin. But the making by the accused of the 000 call meant that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when the accused abandoned Mrs Alchin, the accused fully realised that that act would probably lead to her death. The Crown relied on the accuseds’ omission after the 000 call to take any steps to release Mrs Alchin at a time when the Crown contended the accused fully realised that that omission would probably result in Mrs Alchin’s death. 
     
      
    213 His Honour pointed out that a joint criminal enterprise might be inferred from all the circumstances, including anything said, even though an agreement or arrangement had not been reached at any particular time before the crime was committed. He expanded this and gave examples. He pointed out that it was not any part of the Crown case that the accused went there with any intention of killing Mrs Alchin. There was no evidence from which the jury could conclude that after a time not long after the 000 call at 4.54am on 7 January 2001 any accused encouraged or assisted anyone. Their joint enterprise, if that was what the jury found it was, was complete after they divided up the proceeds of the robbery. That they spent time together afterwards spending the proceeds did not change that conclusion. (p39) 
     
      
    214 Barr J continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have said, each accused who joined in the attack on Mrs Alchin himself abandoned her and continued until the time of her death to be responsible for his own act of abandoning her. The Crown case is that each of the accused did or was responsible for that act and each made an omission, either or both of which caused the death of Mrs Alchin. In so far as there was an omission, the Crown says it was an omission to fulfil a duty cast by the law on any person who was responsible for the attack on Mrs Alchin and deliberately abandoned her, leaving her helpless, to remove the danger she was in. That is what the Crown says. What does the law say? 
        
       
       
        
        The law says that if a person without lawful excuse puts another into a position of danger the first person comes under a duty to remove the danger. If the person fails to remove the danger and harm results, that person will be liable to be held criminally responsible for causing that harm.” (p39-40) 
        
       
      
    215 In the second quoted paragraph the language suggested that the duty owed was an absolute one, which it was not. The crime of murder is made out where an omission by the accused, causing death, is accompanied by reckless indifference to human life. Where the accused has put a person in danger of death, there is a responsibility (to use the term preferred by Lord Diplock in R v Miller at 179) to do everything reasonably practicable to remove the person from danger. A failure to discharge that responsibility is an “omission”. If the omission results in death and is accompanied by the necessary state of mind, the crime of murder is made out. There remains, of course, the need to explain to the jury the meaning of “reckless indifference to human life”. 
     
      
    216 As we have stated, omission accompanied by the necessary state of mind does not constitute the crime of murder unless the omission caused the death. That was not included in the passage quoted above from the summing up. However, the Crown submitted correctly that Barr J made it clear to the jury, elsewhere in the summing up, that the omission to act, ie to take all reasonable and practicable steps to remove the danger, was not by itself sufficient to constitute murder. There had to be an accompanying relevant mental state. 
     
      
    217 The summing up continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I direct you that if any of the accused made himself responsible in any of the ways in which I have directed you for the attack on Mrs Alchin and abandoned her in her helpless state, he was under a legal duty to release her from her bondage or to effect her release by someone else so as to remove the danger she was in. 
        
       
       
        
        I further direct you that if you find that any of the accused by his conduct put himself under that duty to remove Mrs Alchin from danger, his duty was not discharged by the making of the telephone call to emergency services. Because Mrs Alchin continued to be in danger after that call was made, the duty to remove her from it continued, and it continued until she died, some nine to eleven days later. 
        
       
       
        
        In his closing address Mr Wendler asked whether the triple 0 people carried any responsibility and whether we must just ignore the fact that there was no response to the telephone call. He continued, ‘that is going to be quite a controversial question I suggest in your deliberations because as sure as I stand here, had the call gone through, this murder case would not have materialised.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Wendler’s submission was inappropriate. I hope that it is clear from what I have said that you will not be concerned in your deliberations with any question whether the State emergency authorities bear any responsibility for their lack of response to the triple 0 call. State Emergency Services are not on trial here. Neither is any individual person concerned with the triple 0 call other than the accused themselves. In considering this first element in the crime of murder you are concerned only with whether the accused did or was responsible for the act causing death, or made the omission causing death. 
        
       
       
        
        There is another view of the facts which relies on the evidence of Taber and, to some extent, Ian Styman. Mr Taber said to you that Shannon Styman came to him at 3 am on the 7th January 2001 and told him that he had already carried out a robbery, which must have been that of Mrs Alchin. If that is what happened, Shannon Styman is alone responsible for the death. In that case, of course, no question arises as to his responsibility for anyone else’s act. He did everything himself. If he attacked Mrs Alchin and abandoned her he put himself under the same duty to remove her from danger. That duty was not removed by the telephone call but continued until Mrs Alchin died. 
        
       
       
        
        Because you have to consider separately each charge against each accused I shall do so as well. I shall begin with the accused Taber.” (p42-43) 
        
       
       
      Unfortunately, again the duty of each accused was stated in absolute terms. Further, his Honour’s comments about Mr Wendler’s submission preempted the approach which should have been taken to the question of whether the accuseds’ omission after the 000 call to take all reasonable and practicable steps to release Mrs Alchin caused her death. That remained a matter for the jury to determine. 
       
      
    218 His Honour then outlined the Crown case against Taber. A little further on the trial Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The direct evidence of Taber’s whereabouts and activities at the time that the deceased was attacked and abandoned comes from three witnesses, namely, Shannon Styman, Taber, and Ian Styman. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence Shannon Styman gave before you is admissible in the cases of Taber and Ian Styman as well as in his own case. Generally, evidence of what he said to the police informally and by formal interview is admissible only in his own case. However, he was asked in cross-examination about parts of what he said to the police in his three interviews and the things said on those occasions have thereby become evidence in the trial generally.” (p45-46) 
        
       
      
    219 His Honour then summarised Shannon Styman’s evidence, quoting in part from the transcript. His Honour dealt with the responses made to this evidence on behalf of Taber. Reference was made to the evidence of Leonie, parts of which were quoted from the transcript (p91 and following). Again by summary and quotation from the transcript his Honour dealt with the evidence of Peake (p98 and following) and Sharyn Styman (p104). Next his Honour dealt with the evidence of David Taber, the accused’s father (p118). His Honour referred to the things found at Taber’s house noting that, in the end, the Crown abandoned the finding of masks as part of its case (p123). Shannon Styman said that no masks were used. 
     
      
    220 No fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, which suggested gloves were worn. During the police search of Taber’s home, rubber gloves were found. Cable ties, identical to those used on Mrs Alchin were also discovered. Explanations were given, one being that Taber was a builder and builders used cable ties and another was that the gloves were his mother’s. This led to the duct tape found in the utility (p125). The defence attitude was that this was a police plant (p127). Expert evidence was given by Ms Sutton of the testing of this tape and it was noted that Taber had made no submissions to the jury that the jury should doubt the opinion given by Ms Sutton (p127). His Honour said something generally about DNA results (p128). In dealing with the allegation of a police plant his Honour referred to the video of the search which was relied on (p144). On this aspect, the trial Judge referred to the evidence of Meegan Herne (p147).  
     
      
    221 Barr J referred to the reliance by the Crown in the case of Taber on the use of old $100 notes (p153). Ultimately, both Taber and Ian Styman accepted they had these notes in their possession and that they were the proceeds of the robbery of Mrs Alchin but gave an explanation of that. The plan which disappeared and was copied was referred to. The Judge pointed out that the Crown could not, and did not, rely on evidence of its disappearance as evidence of guilt (p156). On the question of motive in Taber’s case, the trial Judge referred to his poor financial position at the time (p158). The trial Judge referred to the evidence of Ms Turner (p160). In relation to part of a conversation at which Ms Turner was present when Leonie said in the presence of Taber “We can always kill her” referring to Mrs Alchin after Mrs Alchin had refused a loan, the trial Judge noted that it was not the Crown case that any accused intended to kill Mrs Alchin (p165). 
     
      
    222 On this part of the case his Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the evidence generally, the Crown submits to you that you would conclude that Mr Taber knew that the deceased had substantial amounts of money, and there is one conversation in one of the tapes that suggests a belief that she had enough money to buy a house. I am not suggesting there is evidence that she had that kind of money but that was what was believed, and that he had reason to believe that she kept it in her house. It is evidence, the Crown says, that Taber considered trying to get his hands on that money by way of loan or, if that wasn’t going to work, by other means, and is evidence that Taber knew that Mrs Alchin lived alone. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Wendler submits to you that it is unreasonable to conclude, first of all, that these conversations took place, or that if they did, Mr Taber ever took part in them. The whole of the evidence, Miss Turner’s and the other evidence of proximity and family, does not establish that Mr Taber knew about the deceased’s money, or had any belief about it, or had any designs on it, and that you should accept Mr Peter Taber’s evidence about that, and his sworn evidence was that he did not know any such things. 
        
       
       
        
        The last topic in Mr Taber’s case on this first question is that Peter Taber and Ian Styman were out of bed at relevant times when you would expect them to be in bed asleep, namely, at 3.25 in the morning and 4.31 am of the morning when the deceased died and not long before the triple 0 call was made.” (p171-172) 
        
       
      
    223 The next topic the trial Judge turned to was what he described as “moving to Queensland” (p174). All the accused left Nowra and went to Queensland between the time when the police questioned them and their eventual arrest. His Honour warned about the danger of misusing this evidence. The jury was not to use it as evidence of guilt. His Honour directed the jury not to draw any inference adverse to any accused from his travelling to Queensland. 
     
      
    224 In due course, Barr J handed the jury a list under the headings “Evidence not generally available in the trial” (other than in the case of the accused concerned), “Evidence available only in the case of Taber”, “Evidence available only in the case of Ian Styman”, “Evidence available only in the case of Shannon Styman”, “Evidence available only in the cases of Taber and Ian Styman” and “Evidence available only in the cases of Ian Styman and Shannon Styman”. The appellants did not challenge the accuracy of this list except to argue that the evidence of the search at 211 Old Southern Road was admissible only against Taber, a submission the trial Judge rejected.  
     
      
    225 Next came the summary of the case against Ian Styman. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is that Ian Styman was present taking part in the attack on Mrs Alchin and, like the others, abandoned her, leaving her helpless. The Crown relies on the evidence of Shannon Styman to that effect and Ian Styman adopted the evidence of Mr Taber. He told you he knew nothing about any attack on anybody until he received an explanation from Shannon Styman after having been summoned to the meeting near the Honda shop by the telephone call from Peter Taber. 
        
       
       
        
        He denied having played any part in the attack on Mrs Alchin and he said that he telephoned the emergency service in order to effect the release of the person that Shannon Styman told him he had tied up. That was because Shannon Styman refused to do so.” (p175-176) 
        
       
      
    226 His Honour referred back to Shannon Styman’s evidence and Ian Styman’s financial position and possession of old $100 notes shortly after the robbery. Reference was made to Ian Styman’s experience in cutting keys (p177) and Shannon Styman’s evidence of the filing down of the key, the testing on the back door of 211 Old Southern Road and its eventual use on the back door of Mrs Alchin’s house at Greenwell Point. In particular, reference was made to Ian Styman’s visit with Shannon Styman to John Styman’s house. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submits that Ian Styman would not have gone there and said what he said unless he knew that he had played his part in the attack on Mrs Alchin. There is no other explanation, the Crown says.” (p178) 
        
       
      
    227 The trial Judge gave an appropriate warning to the jury about this evidence and the elimination of explanations alternative to the one that Ian Styman feared the truth. The trial Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Was it simply a fear of being wrongly accused? If you think that that explains any possibility that Mr Styman did what he did, you may not take this evidence into account in assessing the Crown case.” (p181) 
        
       
      
    228 In relation to a submission by counsel that the video of the search at 211 Old Southern Road was not evidence in Ian Styman’s case his Honour said: “That was wrong; it is evidence in Ian Styman’s case” (p183). 
     
      
    229 Next his Honour came to the case of Shannon Styman (p183) starting with his evidence that he was one of three attackers. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You understand that in the cases of Taber and Ian Styman there is an alternative explanation put forward that things may have happened in the way that Taber and Ian Styman say, namely, that Shannon Styman, without their participation, attacked the deceased and tied her up and all that happened before 3 am on 7 January when he arrived at Taber’s house. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, all that Taber and Ian Styman need to do is to raise in your mind the reasonable possibility that that is the way things happened. If they do, then, of course, you cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were there taking part in the attack. That would be obvious to you I’m sure. 
        
       
       
        
        However you must understand that as between the Crown and Shannon Styman this issue is closed off. They conduct their case the way they wish and the Crown asserts that Shannon Styman was part of a joint attack. So does Shannon Styman. You should understand that there is no room for a finding in Shannon Styman’s case that he attacked Mrs Alchin alone.” (p184) 
        
       
       
      (We interpolate here that this last paragraph was, with respect, incorrect. The evidence of Taber and Ian Styman about whether they were involved in the attack on Mrs Alchin and what Shannon Styman said about it was evidence in the trial as a whole and material which was available to the jury as much in the case against Shannon Styman as it was in the cases of the appellants. Of course, on either account, Shannon Styman was inculpated. This direction was not the subject of any submission either at the trial or here and it is not necessary to consider its potential significance.)  
       
       
      His Honour then summarised Shannon Styman’s evidence.  
       
      
    230 His Honour distributed to the jury, folders for their use containing written directions. These exhaustively and accurately described, with explanatory notes, the circumstances in which each of murder, manslaughter by criminal negligence, manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, breaking, entering and committing a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation, entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation and sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation is committed.  
     
      
    231 Mr Wendler, who appeared for Taber, referred to the use of the expression in the context of the murder charge “the accused realises” in the written direction and submitted that “fully realised” was the right expression which the trial Judge accepted and amended the written direction accordingly. No further objection to the form of this direction was taken. In Royall v The Queen (1990) 172 CLR 378 at 395 Mason CJ spoke of foresight of the probability of death when considering “reckless indifference to human life” and “the need for knowledge, awareness, foresight or realisation (the expression preferred by Barr J) of the probability of death”; see also Brennan J at 399. At 405 Brennan J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was sufficient that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at that time when the accused committed an act causing death, he entertained one or other of the mental states referred to in s18(1)(a).” 
        
       
      
    232 Barr J continued the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any accused did the act causing death or made himself responsible for it or that he made the omission causing death, you must also be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused fully realised when doing the act or making the omission that Mrs Alchin would probably die. That is what the second of these questions says in the written directions. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not necessary that he had that realisation or contemplation at every stage of the act or omission causing death. It is sufficient if he had it at some stage in the period beginning with the act causing death and continuing throughout the period of the omission, beginning when Mrs Alchin was abandoned and ending when she died.” 
        
       
       
      With due respect, it was not sufficient that the accused had the relevant state of mind at any stage beginning with the abandonment of Mrs Alchin. The relevant state of mind on the case made by the Crown based on omission was the state of mind after the 000 call. 
       
      
    233 Barr J continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let me deal first with the time when the attacker or attackers left the house leaving Mrs Alchin lying helpless. In the way the case has been conducted there are two possibilities as to who attacked Mrs Alchin and when. The one contended for by the Crown and counsel for Shannon Styman relies in part on the evidence of Shannon Styman. According to that evidence, the three accused entered Mrs Alchin’s house at about 4 am and left by 4.30 am having decided to telephone the emergency service in order to have Mrs Alchin rescued. 
        
       
       
        
        The second possibility, contended for by counsel for Taber and Ian Styman, is that, according to what Taber says Shannon told him, Shannon Styman had done the robbery and tied up an old lady before 3 am, the time he arrived at Taber’s house. Nothing in that version involves Shannon Styman having been in the company of anyone else. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence establishes that Ian Styman made a telephone call to the emergency triple 0 number at 4.54 am on 7 January 2001. It is only about ten kilometres from Greenwell Point to Nowra and the public telephone from which the emergency call was made was on the Greenwell Point side of Nowra, in east Nowra. Shannon Styman says that the journey took about 20 minutes. If things happened as he says, it could not have taken long to drive from Spies Avenue, Greenwell Point to that telephone box and it might, independently of his evidence, be reasonable to suppose that the telephone call was made within a short time after the abandonment of Mrs Alchin. You will not be considering this element of the crime of murder, of course, unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused whose case you are considering did or was responsible for the act causing death. If you have come to that conclusion in the case of Taber or Ian Styman you must have rejected the version put forward by that accused, the principal effect of which was that he was not present and only found out that somebody had been attacked after Shannon Styman told first Mr Taber and then Ian Styman. It follows that for the purposes of this second element you must also reject their version of the way in which the telephone call came to be made by Ian Styman. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied that Shannon Styman was telling the truth and that all three accused left Spies Avenue intending to telephone the police, it follows that none of the accused would be contemplating that Mrs Alchin would probably die, because they would all be expecting her to be rescued by the police within a short time. The way in which Mrs Alchin was restrained enabled her to breath through the nose. The pillowslip over her head was only loosely secured. Anybody knowing those things would expect her to be rescued alive and without serious physical harm. 
        
       
       
        
        I am going to give you a direction of law now. I direct you that if the telephone call was made on behalf of all the accused to give effect to an arrangement they made before they left the house to have the authorities rescue Mrs Alchin, you cannot find that any accused then realised that she would probably die. Let me repeat that direction in different words. If any accused left Mrs Alchin’s house expecting that a telephone call would be made with the intention of having the police rescue Mrs Alchin, that accused did not then fully realise that she would probably die. 
        
       
       
        
        That would not be the end of your consideration of the matter, however, because you would also have to consider the state of mind of that accused between the time of the telephone call and the time when Mrs Alchin died. 
        
       
       
        
        Mrs Alchin was not rescued and continued to live for a further nine to eleven days. [The evidence of Dr Bradhurst was that Mrs Alchin died sometime between 1pm on 5 January 2001 and midday on 19 January 2001 ‘but more likely sometime between 16 and 18 January 2001’]. If you are satisfied that the accused omitted to rescue Mrs Alchin or have someone else rescue her and so caused her death, you must consider whether during the period of omission he thought that she would probably die but decided nevertheless to do nothing else and leave her to her fate. When I say he thought that she would probably die, I mean fully realised that she would probably die 
        
       
       
        
        This raises the question of what the accused understood or believed was happening about Mrs Alchin between the 7th January and the 16th to the 18th January 2001. Let me just explain those dates. The 16th to the 18th January is the time at which Dr Bradhurst thinks that the deceased most probably died. For these purposes you would have to regard the 16th January, not the 17th and not the 18th, as the date of death, because you have to treat this matter conservatively. You have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about each element of each count including this element that I am discussing now. So you are now considering the period between the 7th January and the 16th January. 
        
       
       
        
        Let me assume that you will decide that the accused contemplated at the time of the telephone call that Mrs Alchin would be found by the police and released without serious harm. Did he continue to think so as time went by and there was no announcement of the rescue of Mrs Alchin? Did his state of mind change or did it remain the same? Did he come around to a realisation that she would probably die? 
        
       
       
        
        In order to prove that during the period between the triple 0 call and the death of the deceased, the accused whose case you are considering realised that the deceased would probably die, you would have first to be satisfied that the accused realised that she had not been rescued. Let me repeat that. Before you can find this second element proved, you must be satisfied that the accused realised, not merely suspected, that the triple 0 call had not produced a response and that she had not been otherwise rescued, for example by a friend or a neighbour or family member or a tradesman, and that, therefore, Mrs Alchin was still where she had been left when the accused abandoned her. You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused realised that there had been no rescue. If you are so satisfied you may go on and decide whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused must therefore have realised that Mrs Alchin would probably die. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown submits in Mr Taber’s case that he continued to live in the district. He continued to live with the niece of Mrs Alchin. He must have been waiting to hear news of her rescue. He must have realised when he heard nothing that the triple 0 call had not been successful. He knew that Mrs Alchin lived alone. He knew that family members were not likely to visit her because of tensions in the family, and that therefore he must have realised that she had not been rescued. It surely would have made news if she had been and there was no news. It is not reasonable to suppose that he would not have been concerned as he continued to look and listen for news of the rescue after such a serious offence, the robbery. It would have been in the forefront of his mind. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Taber said that he believed that the triple 0 call would be successful. He listened to the news on the way to Sydney and again that night. He was concerned at those times. After Sunday night, however, he came round to thinking that Shannon Styman was not telling the truth. He never thought about the matter again, he told you. He did not want to be involved in it in the first place. Of course, if you are considering this element in Taber’s case, you will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was one of the attackers, so you will not accept his evidence about disbelieving that an old woman had been tied up. The evidence of Taber did not otherwise deal with the question whether, after the triple 0 call, he realised that Mrs Alchin had not been rescued and came round to thinking therefore that she would probably die. I will not read you that evidence. I think I have summarised it. 
        
       
       
        
        Now Mr Wendler did not address you on this element, and that is understandable because his client’s case is that it just does not arise. Mr Taber was not part of the attack. Of course you will only be dealing with this if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Taber did the act causing death, so it is understandable why Mr Wendler has not addressed you on that and it cannot be a criticism of his address to you. 
        
       
       
        
        I remind you though, of what could be said on behalf of Mr Taber, that you must be satisfied that he realised, and that means not merely suspected, that not only had the rescue plan not worked, but that Mrs Alchin had not been rescued in any other way, for example by a member of the family and so on, or accidentally by somebody coming to the house. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied in Taber’s case beyond reasonable doubt that he came to realise, fully realise that the deceased had not been rescued, then you can go on to consider whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he realised that she would probably die. 
        
       
       
        
        I can say much the same in the case of Ian Styman. It is not substantially different from Mr Taber’s in this respect. Of course his case is that he was not there, and you are dealing with this element in his case having found beyond reasonable doubt that he was there. Ian Styman was asked no questions about his thoughts about the deceased after the triple 0 call. He was cross-examined. He said that he made no inquiries whether they had found the old lady and didn’t ask Shannon Styman or Taber about it.” (p186-193) 
        
       
      
    234 Shannon Styman’s case was that he always believed that Mrs Alchin would be rescued, having been found by the police or by somebody else. He asked the appellants whether they were going to untie Mrs Alchin before they left her house. Taber and Ian Styman said they would not do that but would ring the police. He said he had never heard anything that suggested that Mrs Alchin had been found. Asked if he believed that that meant she had not been found his answer was “yes and no” (p194). An explanation he gave was that he had on his mind that the police had already found Mrs Alchin and were doing a private investigation. He did not know that she rarely saw people or that her next door neighbour had not spoken to her for many years or that the man around the corner had not spoken to her at all. He did not know about relations within the Ravell family, and in particular that her sisters had not spoken to her for years and did not visit (p197).  
     
      
    235 His Honour said finally that if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any accused did the act causing death or was responsible for it or made the omission causing death but not that it was done fully realising that Mrs Alchin would probably die, the jury must find him not guilty of murder but then go on to consider whether that accused committed manslaughter.  
     
      
    236 His Honour then directed the jury on manslaughter; first, manslaughter by criminal negligence and then manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act (p207). The trial Judge directed the jury that the Crown might secure a verdict of manslaughter by proving that the accused, or a person for whose act he is responsible, did the act causing death and the act was unlawful and it was dangerous (p208). 
     
      
    237 Next Barr J came to the robbery charges against Taber and Ian Styman noting that Shannon Styman had pleaded guilty to this charge at the beginning of the trial (p213). It is not necessary to refer to that part of the summing up which dealt with the sexual offences.238 At 3.32 pm on 5 December 2002 the jury retired to consider its verdict. 
     
      
    239 On 6 December 2002, the trial Judge dealt with a question from the jury asking him to re-read or reiterate the portions of his summing up in relation to the second question of the murder count ie “at the time of the act or omission the accused fully realises that the deceased will probably die but goes on and takes the risk” paying particular regard to the various arguments about the 000 call and the subsequent days until the deceased died. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If any accused left Mrs Alchin’s house intending that the triple 0 call would be made so as to have the police rescue Mrs Alchin, he cannot then have fully realised that she would probably die. It follows that to find this element of murder proved at any time up to the time of the triple 0 call, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not intend to make the triple 0 call or have another one make it on his behalf. If there is a reasonable possibility that the accused intended the call to be made with that purpose, he cannot at that stage have fully realised that the deceased would probably die. Indeed, common sense suggests that his state of mind would be the very opposite; he thought she would probably live. 
        
       
       
        
        That would not dispose of the matter, however, because you would have to consider the accused’s case after the triple 0 call but before the death of Mrs Alchin. You would have to consider whether he came during that period to a full realisation that Mrs Alchin would probably die. 
        
       
       
        
        I remind you that the telephone call was made at 4.54 in the morning on 7 January and that for this purpose you must regard Mrs Alchin’s death as having occurred on 16 January. So it is that period of nine days that you are considering. No time later than the 16th is available for your consideration in this respect. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to succeed, the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused whose case you are considering came to a full realisation during that period of time that Mrs Alchin had not been found and removed from danger. Suspicion would not be enough. Only if you are satisfied about that may you go on and ask yourselves whether you are satisfied that the accused whose case you are considering fully realised that Mrs Alchin would probably die. 
        
       
       
        
        Before you answer that question, you must consider whether having come to a realisation that the deceased had not been found, he thought that she might still by some means or other be found alive. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused fully realised that Mrs Alchin would probably die, your duty will be to find the accused guilty of murder. If you have a reasonable doubt about that, you must find him not guilty of murder.” (p244-246) 
        
       
       
      Again, it must be pointed out that Dr Bradhurst’s evidence that Mrs Alchin died “more likely some time between 16 and 18 January 2001” was not a sufficient basis for a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that she was alive until at least 16 January. 
       
      
    240 His Honour then dealt individually with Taber’s case, then Ian Styman’s case and Shannon Styman’s case. At the conclusion, and after some discussion, his Honour directed the jury (at p256): 
     
      
       
        
        “You have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused whose case you are considering who came to that full realisation in fact, that first Mrs Alchin had not been rescued and then that she would probably die.” 
        
       
      
    241 No further re-direction was sought. On 10 December 2002 the jury asked the Judge to summarise the law relating to the sexual assault charge which his Honour did. In response to a jury note a further direction on the sexual assault case was given on 10 December 2002. 
     
      
    242 On Wednesday, 11 December 2002, the jury returned verdicts against Taber of guilty of murder and of aggravated robbery but not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, against Ian Styman of guilty of murder and of aggravated robbery but not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and against Shannon Styman of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Taylor DCJ on 17 October 2003. Following trial in Goulburn District Court the applicant was convicted on three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. The offences occurred between 4 May 2000 and 20 December 2000. The applicant was acquitted on a count charging aggravated indecent assault alleged to have occurred 27 January 2001.  
     
      
    2 The applicant was born on 28 January 1987 and was therefore aged thirteen years when the offences occurred.  
     
      
    3 His Honour structured the sentences by imposing two years imprisonment commencing on 17 October 2003 with a non parole period of one year expiring on 16 October 2004 on count 3; two years imprisonment commencing on 17 April 2004 with a non parole period of one year expiring on 16 April 2005 on count 1 and four years six months imprisonment commencing on 17 October 2004 with a non parole period of two years expiring on 16 October 2006 on count 2. The lastmentioned date was specified as the earliest date of eligibility for release to parole. Pursuant to the Children (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1987 it was directed that the applicant serve the sentence in a juvenile detention centre. 
     
      
    4 As can be seen in the foregoing, the sentences involved a minimum full time custody of three years. 
     
      
    5 The victim was the same in each case and was a boy born on 4 May 1993. He was aged seven years when the offences took place. It is obvious that the families of the applicant and the victim were acquainted and, on occasions when the victim’s mother was away for purposes of her own, he stayed overnight at the applicant’s home. The sleeping arrangement was for a makeshift bed in the applicant’s bedroom to be used by the younger boy. All three offences occurred in the applicant’s house. 
     
      
    6 The first count related to the boys going to the bedroom in order to sleep. The applicant commenced to kiss the victim on the mouth and intrude his tongue. He told him to remove his pyjamas and asked him to “suck his dick”. After several requests to this effect, the boy complied in that the applicant then placed his penis in the boy’s mouth. Then the applicant said he would show him “a new thing”. He obtained some sort of lubricant from the bathroom which he placed on his penis and he inserted it in the victim’s anus. This act constituted the second count. 
     
      
    7 On a later date, the victim’s mother was again away and he was staying with the applicant’s family. After some kissing, the applicant asked if they “could do it again” and he placed his penis in the victim’s mouth. Count 3 was charged on those facts.  
     
      
    8 The objective seriousness of these offences requires no elaboration. The issues raised on appeal were expressed in two grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour failed to impose a penalty which reflected the individualized treatment required when dealing with an offender who was thirteen years old at the time of the offences.” 
        
       
      
    9 The offences had come to light in 2001 when the complainant was apparently again to go and stay with the applicant’s family and he said that he did not want to go because the applicant had hurt him putting “something up my bottom”. 
     
      
    10 There is no doubt that Taylor DCJ was faced with a difficult sentencing task. He acknowledged that the applicant’s case was to be “considered by reference to the set of principles which are in part embodied in s 6 of the Children (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1987”. He made no express reference to the regard which he had paid in accordance with the mandate within that provision in particular: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) That children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of the child to proceed without interruption;  
        
       
       
        
        (d) That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home.” 
        
       
      
    11 Several authorities referred to by his Honour and in this Court reflect similar themes and no point will be served by recitation of what can be read therein. There is an absence of practical precedent giving applicable guidance in these circumstances. 
     
      
    12 There are no Judicial Commission statistics relating to the commission of these offences by a thirteen year old offender. It is conceivable that there is no other. Senior counsel for the Crown fairly conceded that it must be the case that on any view the applicant is at the bottom of the age range of persons who physically could commit these offences in the sense that he must have been, at most, at the near threshold of sexual maturity. There was no evidence of what stage maturity he had reached when he offended, but, of course, it cannot be ignored that the jury found guilt, in particular of the ingredients making up count 2. 
     
      
    13 Neither are there collated statistics relating to the sentencing of persons aged under eighteen years for this offence. It is significant however that impositions for these offences upon adults are the subject of statistical survey and the effective sentence in this case lies above the middle of that statistical range. Counsel for the applicant contended that this observation could be made and was not contradicted by the Crown Prosecutor.  
     
      
    14 Hence it was submitted that it must follow that these sentences upon a child offender were manifestly excessive. I consider the submission has been made good and the sentences should be set aside and this Court should proceed to resentence. 
     
      
    15 The objective seriousness of the offences may be taken as a constant varying neither at the time of commission, when the applicant appeared for sentence, nor at the present time when considering resentence. The learned sentencing judge recounted the many substantial physical handicaps that had afflicted the applicant and the extensive surgical and other procedures which he has undergone during this lifetime to date. Further surgery is forecast. His physical incapacities have been the subject of teasing by other school pupils in the past and to an extent it would be reasonable to infer he felt excluded from aspects of socialization with his peers.  
     
      
    16 At the time the applicant appeared for sentence, his Honour was provided with an assessment indicating that the applicant’s psycho-sexual development was by that time unexceptional. His Honour described an assessment based upon juvenile sex protocol which indicated lower risk of potential future offending as a significant finding and I see no reason to depart from that observation of his Honour. It is noted that the applicant has no convictions other than the present. 
     
      
    17 In order to proceed to resentence, this Court has a considerable advantage in being able to observe the effect upon the applicant of the custody which he has undergone to the present time. His response has been extremely creditable. 
     
      
    18 In an affidavit he describes going into custody at the centre at Kariong where he continued with HSC studies for a time but it became clear that this was a difficult election. Among other things, the disability in his back made attendance in a classroom for extended periods painful and he candidly concedes that, stressed by this, his behaviour included being rude to teachers. A decision was made with his parents’ support that he commence available courses of horticulture and car detailing. These have been very successful. He has been able to participate in suitable sports. Within weeks of arrival he was classified as entitled to maximum privileges and he has not lost that classification. He describes his relationship with Mr Lowe, his “key worker”, as excellent and he is getting on well with other inmates who recognize his health problems and deal with him accordingly. 
     
      
    19 What the applicant has said is confirmed in an affidavit by Mr Lowe. Included in his testimony is the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “K is a great kid. His behaviour and attitude is exceptional. He has no problems ….. he is excelling in horticulture and recently completed a car detailing course. ….. I am also K’s confidante. He comes to me with his problems, e.g.. problems when he was at school, back problems ….. his footwear had to be adjusted because one leg is longer than the other …. He will be going under the knife. When he was little he had a metal plate put in his back because he has grown it has to be adjusted …. K is very active with sport even with his problem. He has earned the respect of the other boys because of this. They’re aware of his charges but don’t hold it against him, which is unusual. He gets on very well with everyone. … K’s got great family support. Going back to them will be a big plus for him. His parents and young brothers visit fortnightly. I don’t think he will have a problem. I don’t think it will happen again.” 
        
       
      
    20 It is now approaching four years since any offence was committed. There has been no suggestion that the applicant has given any sign of similar urges which led to them. Of course he has gained in years and experience. He has also had, it appears, proper and appropriate guidance. As noted by Mr Lowe he has good family support. 
     
      
    21 Paying particular attention to the applicable principles when sentencing a juvenile offender, I would resentence the applicant so as to structure the sentences enabling him to return home after one year’s detention. His continued progress in rehabilitation is a reason for departing from the proportion between head sentence and non parole period specified in legislation. 
     
      
    22 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal allowed. 
       
      (3) Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (4) In lieu thereof the applicant sentenced as follows: 
       
       
      On count 1, to imprisonment for one year six months to commence on 17 October 2003 with a non parole period of nine months commencing on 17 October 2003 and expiring on 16 July 2004.  
       
       
      On count 2, to imprisonment for two years commencing on 17 October 2003 with a non parole period of one year commencing on 17 October 2003 and expiring on 16 October 2004.  
       
       
      On count 3, to imprisonment for one year and six months to commence on 17 October 2003 with a non parole period of nine months commencing on 17 October 2003 and expiring on 16 July 2004. 
       
       
      (5) The sentences to be served concurrently. 
       
      (6) The applicant ordered released to parole on 16 October 2004. 
       
      (7) The sentences directed to be served in a juvenile detention centre pursuant to s 19(1) of the Children’s (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1987. 
       
      
    23 SIMPSON J: I agree with Grove J.24 SHAW J: I agree with the reasons of and orders proposed by Grove J and wish to add a short observation of my own.  
     
      
    25 Although the learned trial judge referred to the importance or rehabilitation and the youth of the applicant (namely 13 years at the time of the offences) it does not seem to me, with respect, that he gave adequate weight to the principle “that the courts have taken the view that, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth” (see Murray Walter Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at [27]; and generally at 457 - 459). Although the sentencing judge cited R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112, he did not mention specifically or expressly the principles applicable, such the notion “that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance”: see s 6(b) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act ; GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 per Matthews J at 115 (with whom Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA concurred).

        conclusively  
        presumed’ that children over the age of 10 years must bear responsibility for actions classified as criminal. The principle that balances these two provisions is identified in s 6(b) of the Act, which relevantly states: 
        
       
       
        
         
        6 Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
         
         
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
         
         
        …  
         
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and emotional immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
         
         
         
        59 The regime for sentencing a child is therefore considerably different to sentencing an adult. 
         
         
        60 In sentencing any offender once the minimum period of actual incarceration necessary to reflect the proportionate punishment of an offender has been determined (see  
        Power v The Queen  
        (1974) 131 CLR 623), in some ‘ 
        special circumstances 
        ’ the assessment that an offender has better than usual prosects of rehabilitation is reflected in a shorter period of incarceration than would otherwise be appropriate to allow a longer than usual period of supervision whilst reunited with the community from which they have been excluded ( 
        R v Simpson  
        (2001) 53 NSWLR 704). General deterrence is one factor amongst many to be considered in setting that required minimum period of incarceration ( 
        R v Moffitt  
        (1990) 20 NSWLR 114). However it is generally accepted that in sentencing young offenders considerations of general deterrence are not as significant as in the sentencing of an adult. This reflects an accepted norm that the community interest reflected in the sentencing of a child is not advanced by using him or her as an example but rather in seizing the opportunity to direct the child into rehabilitative efforts:  
        Smith 
         [1964] Crim LR 70;  
        Bellavia  
        (Unreported, Hunt J, 16 August 1980);  
        GDP 
         (1991) 53 A Crim R 
         
        112 per Matthews J.  
         
         
        61 Considerations of deterrence are not displaced by a consideration of the rehabilitation of a child:  
        Broad  
        (Unreported, Street CJ, 30 March 1984). In some cases this will override all other considerations:  
        AEM (Snr), KEM, and MM  
        [2002] NSWCCA 58. A proper consideration of the appropriate rehabilitative efforts for the child may even result in an assessment that a long period of time in a detention centre is required: see  
        C, S and T 
         (Unreported, NSWCCA, 12 October 1989) per Gleeson CJ at par 14.  
         
         
        62 As a point of principle, an assessment that the prospects of rehabilitation are poor should not preclude a consideration of those  
        relevant 
         circumstances that proceed on the basis that children are to be sentenced according to a different regime to adult offenders. This is a statutory direction to the courts as well as an ethical, social and intellectual duty for the courts. In this case the emotional immaturity of the applicant, as a child of fourteen at the time the offences were committed, is a material factor that requires a proper assessment of the rehabilitative efforts that may go to at least a distinct possibility of preventing the applicant from re-offending in the future.  
        
       
      
    26 Nor do I think the proceedings at first instance gave sufficient weight to the opinion of the specialist counsellor (Susan Fawaz) to the effect that the applicant’s behaviour and the risks relating to it were “manageable within the community.”27 I would hold that, although “rehabilitation” is mentioned in the remarks on sentence, sufficient weight was not given to its primacy when sentencing a person as young as the applicant, an age which commonsense suggests is about the youngest offender who could or would commit offences of this character.28 The result was an effective total sentence of five and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years, a sentence which statistics indicate is at the top end of the range of sentences imposed on persons committing offences of this nature by persons under 21 years of age.29 The offences are clearly grave. However, in all of the circumstances, I am of the view that the sentences when looked at collectively are excessive and that this court should re-sentence the applicant.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ at Sydney District Court on 8 December 2003. On that occasion the applicant adhered to pleas of guilty previously made before a magistrate to offences of stealing from the person and attempted robbery. In each case the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for fourteen years. 
     
      
    2 It is significant to note that in January 2000 the applicant had been sentenced for an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding to a minimum term of three years imprisonment with an additional term of four years imprisonment. In respect of that sentence he was released to parole in June 2002. The additional term will expire on 30 June 2006.  
     
      
    3 Of the current matters the first offence occurred at about 10.35 am on Sunday 15 December 2002. A nineteen year old girl was walking in George Street, Sydney when she was approached by a co-offender who asked for directions. Being distracted by that approach she did not notice the applicant reach into her backpack and remove her wallet. Money was taken from the wallet, which was later abandoned. The incident was surveyed by security cameras and as a result police who had been contacted arrested the applicant and his co-offender shortly thereafter. The applicant was released to bail and pleaded guilty to the offence mentioned when he appeared in the Local Court. He was, as indicated above, on parole at the time of this offence. 
     
      
    4 The second offence occurred at about 9.35 am on Sunday 2 February 2003 when the victim, a seventeen year old girl was walking along Lawson Street, Redfern carrying a blue denim handbag over her left shoulder. The handbag contained money, a mobile phone and personal items. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was loitering nearby to the entrance of Redfern Railway Station. As the victim approached, he attempted to remove the handbag from her shoulder by pulling at it with both hands. The victim struggled as a result of which the applicant pulled her to the ground. She screamed for assistance and the applicant fled. As a result of being thrown to the ground, the victim had symptoms of soreness in her lower back and grazes to her left wrist and elbow. The incident was also recorded on a surveillance camera. The applicant was known to an employee at the railway station who had come to the assistance of the victim. He identified the applicant to police who located him in the area shortly after 3 pm that afternoon. When called upon to stop the applicant fled on foot but after a chase he was apprehended and taken to the police station where he was charged. At the time of this offence he was still on parole and also on bail in respect of the first offence. 
     
      
    6 On the first charge her Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for eighteen months commencing on 2 February 2003 (the date upon which he was taken into custody in respect of the second offence). On the second charge her Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for four years and six months commencing on 2 February 2004 with a non parole period of two years and six months commencing on that date and expiring on 1 August 2006. 
     
      
    7 As a result of the partial accumulation, the effective minimum custodial term of these sentences amounts to three and half years. It might be observed that the first date of eligibility for parole in respect of these sentences is 1 August 2006 and the expiry date of the sentence imposed for the offence in 2000 is 30 June 2006. A report from the Probation and Parole Service indicates that the Parole Board is considering the question of revocation of parole and monitoring the outcome of the proceedings in respect of these offences. 
     
      
    8 The sole ground of appeal advanced on behalf of the applicant is that the two individual sentences and the aggregate are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    9 No challenge is made against any of the findings of fact made by her Honour for the purpose of sentence. She recounted the handicaps of the circumstances of his upbringing and his early contact with drug taking and, ultimately, his failure to successfully withdraw from heroin addiction. The subjective matters affecting the applicant are not in dispute.  
     
      
    10 It is submitted that the first offence amounted to little more than pick pocketing and it is submitted that “it is not easy to think of an example of the offence that could be less serious than this one”. I reject the implication that it is a matter of minimal seriousness to steal from a person lawfully going about her affairs in the streets of the city on a Sunday morning. The Crown Prosecutor has drawn attention to the remarks of Gleeson CJ in R v Ransee NSWCCA, unreported 8 August 1994: 
     
      
       
        
        “One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others”. 
        
       
      
    11 The amount of money in the young woman’s purse was comparatively small ($10) and in my view it is, in a general sense, just as serious to take a little from those who might have little as to take a lot from those who might have a lot. The victim was a student. In a written submission counsel for the applicant conceded that an imposition of eighteen months imprisonment after an early plea of guilty would not be erroneous for this offence in normal circumstances but submitted that the sentence is too long in this case even allowing for the matter of aggravation created by the circumstance that the applicant was on parole at the time. 
     
      
    12 The thrust of the submissions on behalf of the applicant related to the sentence on the second matter and the partial accumulation. Reference is made to the statistics published by the Judicial Commission and it has been sought to be demonstrated that the ultimate sentence (allowing for discounts indicated by her Honour) can be “seen to be very high” by reference to those statistics. Statistics of course are available for guidance but they do not create a template into which every sentence must fit. I have observed elsewhere that, if it were requisite to put every sentence within the ambit of an extant range of impositions, it is an arithmetical certainty that the inclusion of such impositions into the statistics would diminish the upper margin of the range in a continuity as they came to be included. This would distort the guidance the statistics are designed to offer.  
     
      
    13 It was acknowledged that the figures for attempted robbery were derived from a sample of only eleven offenders. A much larger sample (336 cases) was available of terms of sentence of all offenders convicted of robbery. It was no doubt that these combined sources were the basis of submission that the sentence was “very high” but not, I would observe outside the range of the statistical collation. 
     
      
    14 Given the concession that the learned sentencing judge made no error in finding relevant facts, I conclude that the assertion of error is, in essence, an assertion that this court should differently assess the appropriate sentence from that of her Honour. The intervention of this court is not attracted because this court would, if dealing with the matter itself, have imposed a more lenient term. It is constituted as, and exercises jurisdiction as, a court of error and not a court of review. 
     
      
    15 Having regard to the whole of the circumstances including matters of aggravation and matters of mitigation weighing in favour of the applicant I am unpersuaded that her Honour’s assessment falls outside the range of the sound exercise of her discretion. Nor am I persuaded that the construct reflected in the partial accumulation of sentences leads to any different conclusion. It is also necessary in terms of the applicable statute for it to be considered that some different sentence other than those imposed by her Honour should have been imposed and neither do I reach that conclusion. 
     
      
    16 I propose that application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted but the appeal dismissed.17 SIMPSON J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Grove J. As his Honour has set out the circumstances of the two offences, it is unnecessary that I repeat those. What is in issue is whether either or both or the aggregate of the two sentences imposed was manifestly excessive. In the result I have come to a different view to that of Grove J. In seeking to support his contention that the sentences, in their overall effect, were manifestly excessive, counsel who appeared for the applicant relied upon statistical material provided by the Judicial Commission of NSW. It is commonly observed that these statistics are of limited use. Nevertheless, the statistics available establish to my satisfaction that each sentence imposed, and in particular their aggregation, took the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant to the very top of the range of sentences imposed upon the offenders represented in the statistical samples. 
     
      
    18 There were good reasons why the applicant was facing a severe sentence. Both offences were committed whilst he was on parole, indeed on parole for an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding; and the second offence was committed whilst he was on bail in relation to the first. He has a relatively lengthy criminal history, including the offence which I have just mentioned. The second offence, in particular, was a serious one of its kind, involving the use of real violence. 
     
      
    19 There were, of course, subjective features relevant to the assessment of the applicant’s culpability. His personal history was recounted in a pre-sentence report and the report of a psychologist. In brief, the applicant’s history as a child and adolescent was marked by the alcoholism of both parents and significant violence on the part of his step-father; and a pattern of emotional and physical deprivation too frequently seen in the criminal courts. As a consequence he began at an early age to use alcohol and illicit drugs. 
     
      
    20 There was, however, also evidence of rehabilitation and some hope for a crime-free future. This was particularly related to a relationship with a young woman with whom the applicant now has a child. 
     
      
    21 One significant matter argued on the applicant’s behalf was that the sentencing judge indicated her intention of allowing the applicant the maximum discount available in respect of his pleas of guilty. That is a discount of 25% on the sentence she would otherwise have imposed. Simple calculation demonstrates that the starting point for the sentence in respect of the second offence must thus have been a sentence of six years; and for the first, two years. It is to be remembered that the applicant stood for sentence for an offence of attempted robbery; it was not the completed offence, and not the aggravated form of the offence that incorporates violence. After consideration I have come to the view that these starting points did take the sentences outside the available range. Alternatively, it may be that her Honour did not give full effect to her stated intention to allow the maximum discount in respect of the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    22 As a result, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and quash the sentences imposed. In relation to the first count, of steal from a person, I would impose a sentence of a fixed term of twelve months of imprisonment, commencing on 12 February 2003 and expiring on 1 February 2004. On the second count, of attempted robbery, I would impose a non-parole period of one year and nine months with a head sentence of four years. I would order that that sentence commence at the expiration of the previously imposed sentence, 2 February 2004. The non-parole period would expire on 1 November 2005, and the head sentence on 1 February 2006. 
     
      
    23 SHAW J: I agree with Simpson J.

     The appellant was tried on counts of stealing, or alternatively, receiving five motor vehicles. Crown witnesses included offenders involved in allied crimes in respect of these and other vehicles. They received significant benefits by way of reduction of their own sentences because of their cooperation in seeking to inculpate the appellant. The trial judge restricted the extent of cross examination of those offenders concerning the detail of their crimes. 
      
      
     HELD: The appellant was entitled to put such detail before the jury and should not have been prevented from establishing the extent of the offenders' crimes and the benefits which they received. 
      
      
     The jury found the appellant not guilty on all counts (including a count of receiving one vehicle to which he had pleaded guilty upon arraignment) but returned special verdicts of guilty of ""larceny or receiving"" in respect of two vehicles, one of which he had pleaded guilty to receiving. The directions to the jury did not convey appropriately that the jury needed to be unanimous in determining that the appellant either stole or received any particular vehicle but they could not say which and the directions left open a special verdict following compromise although one or more jurors may have been satisfied of the proof of stealing or of receiving. 
      
      
     HELD: (1) The jury should have been directed that they must be unanimous in accordance with the principles articulated in  
     R v Nguyen 
      NSWCCA unreported 20 February 1997. (2) The judgment of acquittal following the verdicts of not guilty on the counts in respect of which the special verdicts were found are not vulnerable to being set aside. (3) The special verdicts should be set aside by reason of the misdirection (and the apparency of compromise) but the relevant statutory provision creates a possible verdict and not a chargeable offence therefore no new trial order can be made.

     REGINA v NAETHEN JAMES CAMPBELL 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction following trial before Karpin DCJ and a jury in Sydney District Court. Consequent sentences are not the subject of appeal. They were suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is necessary to set out some history to provide context for the appellant’s submissions, particularly in respect of the first of two grounds of appeal which have been presented. 
     
      
    2 On 26 March 2000 seven new Holden vehicles (“the seven Holdens”) were stolen from the yard of Suttons Motors at Rosebery. Jared Scott and Benjamin Walters worked there as mechanics. The value of the stolen vehicles exceeded $450,000. Investigations suggested that one or more of the stolen vehicles was delivered to premises at Kingsgrove occupied by Benjamin Walters and his brother Matthew. On 6 July 2000 police executed a search warrant at the Kingsgrove premises. Stolen car parts requiring two trucks for their removal were found. The Walters brothers were arrested. Included in the parts received were some identifiable as coming from other Holden vehicles (“the three Holdens”) and a Porsche (the white Porsche). The appellant was later tried in respect of these and one other vehicle.  
     
      
    3 The three Holdens were different vehicles from the seven Holdens taken from Suttons Motors on 26 March 2000. 
     
      
    4 Subsequently Jared Scott was also arrested. He and the Walters brothers were charged with numerous offences relating to the theft and stripping of vehicles, sale of parts and “rebirthing” motor vehicles. In addition, Benjamin Walters and Jared Scott were charged and pleaded guilty ultimately to being accessories before the fact to the breaking, entering and stealing of the seven Holdens from Suttons Motors. These three men made statements to police who, thereafter, charged the appellant and one Ilievski as principals responsible for the theft of the seven Holdens as well as other charges. 
     
      
    5 An indictment was prepared charging the appellant and Ilievski which included counts upon which the appellant was eventually tried and which I will later detail. The appellant moved to separate counts charged against him from those counts pertaining to the seven Holdens. Ilievski, but not the appellant, sought vacation of a scheduled trial date. Ilievski was successful in his application. By the time a new trial date arrived Ilievski was in custody in Victoria. The Crown then presented an indictment against the appellant separating the Suttons Motors matters from it (the trial indictment). 
     
      
    6 Following the trial of the appellant on this indictment, we were informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions has determined that a bill of indictment will not be presented against the appellant in respect of the thefts of the seven Holdens. 
     
      
    7 The trial indictment contained ten counts. Counts 1 and 3 charged stealing two of the three Holdens, count 5 charged breaking, entering and stealing the third of the three Holdens and counts 2, 4 and 6 charged, in the alternative to counts 1, 3 and 5, receiving those same vehicles. Count 7 charged stealing the white Porsche and count 8 charged, in the alternative, receiving it. Count 9 charged breaking, entering and stealing another Porsche (the black Porsche), count 10 charged, in the alternative, receiving it. 
     
      
    8 Upon arraignment in the presence of the jury panel, the appellant pleaded not guilty to counts 1 to 9, but guilty to count 10. The Crown Prosecutor stated that such plea of guilty was not accepted in satisfaction of the indictment. The trial then proceeded. 
     
      
    9 Principal prosecution witnesses in respect of counts 1 to 8 were the Walters brothers and Jared Scott. In support of counts 9 and 10 evidence was presented of video film showing the appellant driving the black Porsche from a car parking space in premises leased by him at Rosebery. It was conceded, consistently with the plea of guilty offered to count 10, that the appellant was in possession of the black Porsche knowing it to have been stolen.  
     
      
    10 Before the commencement of the trial of the appellant the Walters brothers and Jared Scott were dealt with in the District Court after pleading guilty to numerous offences. Benjamin Walters pleaded guilty as abovementioned to being an accessory before the fact to the breaking, entering and stealing of the seven Holdens and also seven further counts of receiving stolen motor vehicles as well as having taken into account on a Form 1 seven further charges of receiving stolen motor vehicles and one count of goods in custody reasonably suspected of having been stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained. He received an effective sentence of two years eight months with a non parole period of two years, the sentence to be served by periodic detention. Matthew Walters pleaded guilty to one count of stealing a motor vehicle and three counts of receiving stolen motor vehicles with offences taken into account on a Form 1 of possessing car breaking implements and receiving a stolen motor vehicle, stealing, attempting to steal a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property. He received an effective sentence of two years imprisonment with a non parole period of eighteen months, to be served by periodic detention. Jared Scott pleaded guilty as abovementioned to being an accessory before the fact to the breaking, entering and stealing of the seven Holdens and two counts of disposing of motor vehicles, three counts of receiving stolen motor vehicles and one count of stealing a motor vehicle with offences taken into account on a Form 1 of stealing a motor vehicle and goods in custody. He received an effective sentence of imprisonment of two years six months with a non parole period of twelve months, to be served by periodic detention.  
     
      
    11 Prior to sentence, Matthew Walters and Jared Scott signed undertakings to give assistance to authorities and in particular to give evidence in accordance with a statement which, inter alia, inculpated the appellant in various crimes. Benjamin Walters had cooperated and given assistance to authorities. Chief District Court Judge Blanch dealt with these three offenders and made it clear that these circumstances of cooperation with authority were expressly being taken into account in mitigation of sentences which otherwise would have been imposed.  
     
      
    12 At trial, the appellant was found not guilty on counts 1 to 6 inclusive (relating to the three Holdens) and he was also found not guilty on counts 7 to 10 (relating to the white and black Porsches) but the jury found special verdicts of guilty of “larceny or receiving” in respect of these counts pursuant to s 121 of the Crimes Act 1900. The finding of not guilty on count 10 was, of course, made in the face of the appellant’s plea of guilty on arraignment. Matters relevant to the special verdict will be elaborated when dealing with ground 2. 
     
      
    13 Ground 1 contends: 
     
      
       
        
        “Her Honour erred by ruling inadmissible evidence sought to be adduced by the appellant that demonstrated the particulars of the charges to which Jared Scott, Matthew Walters and Benjamin Walters pleaded guilty.” 
        
       
      
    14 On the first day of trial, Mr Boulten SC for the appellant raised the issue of the scope of intended cross examination of the Walters brothers and Jared Scott about their promises of cooperation and the benefits by way of discount to the sentences which they received for their multiple individual offences. A matter of focus was an intention to adduce evidence of particulars including the value of the seven Holdens, in respect of which Benjamin Walters and Jared Scott had been convicted of being accessories before the fact to breaking, entering and stealing. The Crown Prosecutor expressly objected to that matter being explored. Mr Boulten also indicated that he wished to adduce evidence that the total value of property involved in the charges against the three offenders/crown witnesses was $775,000 (Scott), more than $1.2 million (Benjamin Walters) and over $230,000 (Matthew Walters).  
     
      
    15 After argument her Honour stated “I think the simple way of dealing with it is to uphold the objection”. The objection had, of course, been the subject of exchange between both counsel and the Bench but there were no formal reasons given for the ruling beyond what had passed during the exchange and that statement. 
     
      
    16 The appellant ought not to have been prevented from establishing the facts surrounding the benefits of the Walters brothers and Scott had received by reason of their cooperation. Several authorities deal with the obligation of the Crown to adduce relevant material. That is not the present complaint but it is even clearer that an accused person should not be prevented from raising such material himself or herself.  
     
      
    17 In R v Sullivan [2003] NSWCCA 100 Buddin J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(The Crown) must first of all make full disclosure of all matters which relevantly pertain to the witness to be called. Then, in further discharge of its obligations, it ought to lead in evidence all material of that kind which is relevant in order that the jury is fully informed of those matters which would enable it to make a proper assessment of the witness’ credibility. I respectfully agree with what was said by this Court in  
        Chen  
        (2002 130 A Crim R 300) that the evidence should be led by the Crown without having to be ‘dragged out in cross examination’. “ 
        
       
      
    18 The requirement extends beyond accomplices and those involved in the matter which is the current subject of trial. The relevant material is the benefit which the witness has or is to receive by reason of his or her testimony. In R v Gonzalez-Betes [2001] NSWCCA 226 Greg James J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since well prior to the Evidence Act 1995, indeed since  
        Regina v Booth 
         (1983) 8 A Crim R at 81, it has been incumbent on the Crown when utilising the evidence of an indemnified accomplice, or a person to whom some benefit has or might be extended by dint of that witness’ testimony, to reveal that fact in evidence and the true status of the witness, not for the purpose of increasing the witness’ credibility but to enable the jury properly to consider those matters on the question of whether the witness’ credibility is thereby diminished. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not understand there to be any provision of the Evidence Act 1995 the effect of which might be that that practice or rule of law should be changed. It would be most unfair to an accused not to put those matters into evidence. It is not suggested here that those matters should have been reserved to the cross-examiner to expose. If that were the suggestion then no harm could be said now to have been occasioned by the jury being informed of those matters.” 
        
       
      
    19 And Smart AJ remarked in Sullivan: 
     
      
       
        
        “Telling a jury that a person has received a significant reduction in his gaol term does not tell them a great deal. That lacks the impact and conviction which comes with the supply of detail.” 
        
       
      
    20 It was detail which ought legitimately have been before the jury and which the appellant was prevented from adducing in the present case. 
     
      
    21 Ground 1 is made out. 
     
      
    22 Ground 2 contends: 
     
      
       
        
        “Her Honour erred by failing to direct the jury that, in order to deliver a special verdict pursuant to s121 of the Crimes Act 1900, the jury had to unanimously find specially that they were unable to say whether the appellant stole or merely received the subject vehicle and that the jury could not make such a finding unless they were unanimous that they were unable to say which of those offences was committed.” 
        
       
      
    23 Section 121 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ 
        Verdict of ‘larceny or receiving’ 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        121. Where, on the trial of a person charged with larceny, or any offence which includes larceny, and, also, with having unlawfully received the property charged to have been stolen, knowing it to have been stolen, the jury find specially that the person either stole, or unlawfully received, such property, and that they were unable to say which of those offences was committed by the person, such person shall not by reason thereof be entitled to acquittal, but shall be liable to be sentenced for the larceny, or for the unlawfully receiving, whichever of the two offences is subject to the lesser punishment.”  
        
       
      
    24 As the terms of the provision make clear it does not create a form of offence indictable by charging alternative ingredients of stealing or receiving, but makes available a verdict by a jury in a special form when the alleged offender has been indicted for the chargeable offences of stealing and receiving.  
     
      
    25 It was open to the jury in the present case to find such a special verdict in respect of the “pairs” of alternative counts. They did not so find in respect of counts 1 and 2, 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 (relating to the three Holdens) but did so find in respect of counts 7 and 8 (the white Porsche) and counts 9 and 10 (the black Porsche).  
     
      
    26 Section 121 was legislated to remove an identified difficulty. This was described by Pring J in R v Cassidy 1919 19 SR (NSW) 48: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sect. 121 of the Crimes Act was passed to meet a difficulty which very often occurred. It was often quite impossible to decide on the evidence in a case whether an accused person had been guilty of stealing or of receiving. In such a case as that, before the passing of this section, if the jury could not satisfy themselves with regard to either one or the other count, they were bound to acquit, although they might be perfectly clear that the accused person was guilty of one or the other crime. Sect. 121 removes that difficulty.” 
        
       
      
    27 Before a special verdict can be returned, an application of s 121 obliges verdicts of not guilty on each of the charged counts of stealing and receiving: Saleam v R 1989 41 A Crim R 48. That happened in relation to counts 7 and 8 and counts 9 and 10 in this case. 
     
      
    28 However, it is a further aspect of the operation of s 121 that the jury must be unanimously satisfied of two matters in order to bring in the special verdict. The situation was articulated by Hunt CJ at CL (Ireland J agreeing, Bell AJ dissenting) in R v Nguyen NSWCCA unreported 20 February 1997: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before the special verdict can be given, s 121 expressly requires the jury to make two special findings: (1) that the accused either stole the property or received it, and (2) that they are unable to say which of those offences was committed by him. They must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the first of those matters (and) In accordance with ordinary principles, they must be unanimous in that satisfaction. I see no basis upon which it could be said that their special finding on the second of those matters should not also be a unanimous one.” 
        
       
      
    29 Hence, s 121 is not available where there has been compromise such as where some jurors are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of theft whilst others are satisfied that the accused is guilty of receiving and, possibly others, satisfied that an accused is guilty of one or the other but cannot say which. None of the jurors satisfied of the guilt of an accused of stealing or of receiving would be being true to their oaths in such a hypothesized situation if they brought in verdicts of not guilty on the counts of stealing or receiving as the case may be. That is an implicit reason for the remark in the final sentence of Hunt CJ at CL quoted above. 
     
      
    30 The possibility of a special verdict was canvassed by counsel in address. The Crown Prosecutor referred to the possibility of special verdict and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Firstly, if you are not unanimously satisfied that the Crown has established its case as to stealing and secondly, you are not unanimously satisfied that the Crown has established its case as to receiving, but, thirdly, you are unanimously satisfied that the Crown has established, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused either stole or received the same property but you are unable to say which, that is, out of receiving or stealing, you may bring in a special verdict of guilty of either stealing or receiving. So in those circumstances you may be unanimous and think, well he either stole or received each individual motor vehicle or a particular motor vehicle, but you entertained a reasonable doubt about which of those alternatives it was, you may return a verdict where you say well he’s guilty of either stealing or receiving it. It’s not a difficult notion but it’s a verdict I can tell you which is not written on that indictment but her Honour will give you some clear directions about the route that you can take to that verdict if that verdict were to arise in your deliberations.” 
        
       
      
    31 Counsel for the appellant referred to the special verdict and observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the special verdict mechanism is not there for compromise.” 
        
       
      
    32 It is convenient to observe that after counsel on behalf of the appellant submitted that the evidence was not “good enough” to convict his client on counts 1 to 8 and count 9, he said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “So in those circumstances the right and proper verdict in this case is not guilty of 1 to 9 but guilty of 10.” 
        
       
      
    33 In a written direction to the jury which her Honour read during her charge they were directed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Special Verdict 
        
       
       
        
        1.If you are not unanimously satisfied that the Crown has proved the accused stole a vehicle and; 
        
       
       
        
        2. You are not unanimously satisfied that the Crown has proved that the accused received the motor vehicle, but 
        
       
       
        
        3. You are unanimously satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused either stole or received the vehicle, but you are unable to say which, you may bring in a special verdict of guilty of either stealing or receiving. You will follow the same process in relation to each of the other connected counts.” 
        
       
      
    34 After retirement for deliberation the jury sought clarification and sent a note (MFI 21): 
     
      
       
        
        “Please clarify ‘Special Verdict’? 
        
       
       
        
        (Eg. If 2 people put hand up for guilty on first charge – stealing; and remaining ten jurors put hands up for guilty on second charge – possession – is this a Special Verdict (or do we all need to be unanimous to apply a special verdict?)” 
        
       
      
    35 The word “possession” in the jury note was obviously intended to refer to “receiving”. 
     
      
    36 Her Honour sought the assistance of counsel. The transcript records: 
     
      
       
        
        “BOULTEN: …. Of course. In relation to the directions that your Honour will give the jury in answer to their question, I would ask your Honour simply to add that if in relation to any particular charge, any particular vehicle, one or more of your number has concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of stealing the car or is guilty of receiving the car, then the special verdict is not open. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Mr Crown do you want to be heard on that? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour. “ 
        
       
      
    37 However when the jury were returned to court for further direction her Honour redirected them as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The special verdict arises in these circumstances: 
        
       
       
        
        1. If all twelve of you are unanimously satisfied that the accused was in possession of that particular vehicle, but the twelve of you do not all agree that he possessed it because he stole it, and all twelve of you are not unanimously satisfied that he possessed it because he received it knowing it was stolen, but all twelve of you are unanimously satisfied that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused either stole, or received that particular vehicle, but all twelve of you are not unanimously able to say which, you may bring in a special verdict of guilty of either stealing or receiving.” 
        
       
      
    38 Towards the conclusion of that extract from the redirection it would have been compatible with authority to have placed the word “not” so as to direct: 
     
      
       
        
        “But all twelve of you are unanimously not able to say which” 
        
       
       
      but what her Honour said, was: 
       
       
        
        “But all twelve of you are not unanimously able to say which”. 
        
       
      
    39 The expression leaves open a compromise by the jury which, for the reasons already given is an impermissible process.  
     
      
    40 It is demonstrated by what occurred shortly thereafter that the placement of the word “not” was not an unintended slip.  
     
      
    41 The jury resumed their deliberations after this redirection at 10.35 am. The next recorded time is 11.52 am when verdicts were taken but in the span of time between those points, the jury sent a note stating that they had reached verdicts on all counts.  
     
      
    42 After the note was received but before the jury were brought back to court counsel, for the first time, drew attention to the decision in Nguyen. At the time there was no express complaint about misdirection but her Honour indicated that she regarded any further opportunity for direction as closed by reason of the jury’s indication in their note. That was not the situation. The notification from the jury did not inhibit correction of any requisite matter. The jury indication did not create an end point of their task. A barrier to further deliberation is created by the return of verdict but not by mere indication of a stage which the jury had reached. There is no reason why a judge, if becoming conscious of error, cannot redirect a jury which has not delivered its verdict and invite them to deliberate further in accordance with corrected, amended or supplementary direction then given. 
     
      
    43 Her Honour was placed in what she obviously perceived to be a concluded situation by the delay in drawing the decision of Nguyen to attention and it is a pity that this was not done by counsel more promptly. 
     
      
    44 However, in rejecting the implication that she might consider redirection in the light of that decision, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes I’m not going to redirect them I’m afraid. They’ve told me they have a verdict and I actually don’t believe that I can now do anything about that. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong but it seems to me frankly, I had actually read that decision of Nguyen, it comes back to mind and I thought to myself with great respect to the majority that it didn’t make a great deal of sense because it seemed to me to really go against what the whole intention of s 121 was, it took us all back to where we were before but anyway I’m not prepared to go behind the verdict of a jury and start redirecting them I’m afraid. We’ll have the jury.” 
        
       
      
    45 As I have noted, the situation was mis-stated in that there was not at that point a jury verdict to “go behind”. 
     
      
    46 The majority decision in Nguyen represented binding authority and it was not open to her Honour to reject it. She was, of course, free to express any opinion which she held about the validity of the reasoning but she was not free to decline to apply the law as there declared. The remarks of Lord Hailsham in Cassell & Co v Broome 1972 1 All ER 801 @ 809 are pertinent: 
     
      
       
        
        “….. in the hierarchal system of courts which exists in this country, it is necessary for each lower tier, including the Court of Appeal, to accept loyally the decisions of the higher tiers.” 
        
       
      
    47 Those remarks have been applied in the Australian context: Tzaidis v Child & Ors [2003] NSWSC 667. 
     
      
    48 Ground 2 is made out. 
     
      
    49 A question arises concerning the orders which this Court should, or could make consequent upon grounds 1 and 2 being upheld. This Court has wide powers to order new trial when it quashes convictions upon an indictment: s 8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, but as I have described, verdicts of not guilty on counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 were found in accordance with what was required before special verdicts could be returned. The relevant endorsement was made on the back of the indictment, viz: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not guilty on all counts, but special verdicts on counts 7 & 8 & 9 & 10.” 
        
       
      
    50 The endorsement on the back of the indictment represents the formal record of a court of first instance: R v Carrion 2002 128 A Crime R 29. Thus the judgments of acquittal following the jury verdicts on counts 7, 8, 9 and 10 were perfected: cf R v Holton [2004] NSWCCA 214. 
     
      
    51 The grounds upon which the appellant’s arguments succeeded, relating as they do to matters of evidentiary ruling and jury direction would, in the absence of particular reason, give rise to exercise of discretion by this Court to order new trial. 
     
      
    52 Although the appellant was convicted as made possible by s 121 of a special verdict, s 121 does not create a chargeable independent offence. Hence this Court could not order a new trial upon an indictment charging an offence contrary to s 121 nor can it order a new trial upon counts upon which judgments of acquittal have been entered. 
     
      
    53 The possibility of this consequence was raised and the Crown has submitted that the verdicts of not guilty on the relevant counts were “nothing more than a precursor to the returning of the special verdict” and that this Court should order a new trial on counts 7 and 8 and counts 9 and 10, that is to say, alternative counts charging stealing and receiving the white and black Porsches. 
     
      
    54 The contention is based upon the directions given by her Honour as to how the verdicts would be taken. These were: 
     
      
       
        
        “When you return to court after you have reached your verdict in relation to each vehicle, your foreman will be asked for your verdicts on the relevant alternate counts, and the special verdict using the following formula: 
        
       
       
        
        1. As to the stealing count, is the accused guilty or not guilty? If you have not applied the special verdict, but have found the accused guilty of stealing that vehicle, your foreman will say ‘guilty’, and you will not be asked about the alternate count relating to that vehicle. If you find the accused not guilty of that count, or you wish to return a special verdict, your foreman will say ‘not guilty’. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Then the same formula will be applied to the receiving charge. If you find him guilty on the receiving count, your foreman will say ‘guilty’. If you find him not guilty on the receiving charge or you wish to find him guilty on the special verdict, your foreman will say ‘not guilty’. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Your foreman will then be asked, ‘Do you or do you not return a special verdict that the accused is guilty of either stealing or receiving and you cannot say which’. Your foreman will then say, ‘We return the special verdict’.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    55 The Crown Prosecutor drew attention to Cassidy where Pring J also said (s 121 being in terms not materially different from the present): 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury have said, first ‘we cannot say that the prisoner is guilty under the first count;’ they have said, secondly, ‘We cannot say that she is guilty under the second count.’ That did not amount to an assertion by them that the appellant was innocent under both counts; it merely meant, ‘We cannot satisfy ourselves that she is guilty under one count or the other.’ and they added, ‘We are quite satisfied that she is guilty under one or the other, and we are unable to say which.’ That is exactly the case to which this section was intended to apply.” 
        
       
      
    56 Neither that statement nor the structure of s 121 undermines the circumstance that the jury has not been satisfied to the requisite standard of the proof of guilt of stealing nor have they been satisfied to the requisite standard of the proof of guilt of receiving. Those failures to satisfy vested in the appellant an entitlement to acquittal on those charges. 
     
      
    57 Verdicts of not guilty cannot be categorized as mere precursors of special verdict and they are not vulnerable to being set aside by this Court. The Crown Prosecutor did not suggest that s 7(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act was a source of power to order retrial on counts upon which acquittal had been entered. That provision, in its terms, can be drawn upon where this Court considers “that a wrong conclusion has been arrived at by the court of trial on the effect of ” a special verdict. That is not this case. 
     
      
    58 I am conscious of the apparent anomaly that, in the result, the appellant will, in particular, be the subject of acquittal on count 10 to which he had pleaded guilty upon arraignment. That the jury nonetheless found a special verdict on counts 9 and 10 offers a compelling inference, especially in the light of the content of their note (MFI 21), that the special verdict was returned in circumstances where all members of the jury were not unanimous in finding that the appellant was guilty of either stealing or receiving the black Porsche but they could not say which. It suggests that the special verdict was returned as a result of compromise between at least some jurors who were satisfied of the proof of stealing and others who were satisfied of the proof of receiving of that vehicle. 
     
      
    59 The appeal should be allowed and the special verdicts found on counts 7, 8, and counts 9 and 10 respectively should be set aside and the sentences imposed in respect thereof quashed. 
     
      
    60 SIMPSON J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    61 SHAW J: I agree with Grove J.

     REGINA v Glenn John DAVIES 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read in draft the reasons of Justice Kirby. I agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed.  
     
      
    2 In so far as it was argued that s54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has no application to a case in which there was a plea and that the decision in Regina v Mouloudi [2004] NSWCCA 96 provides support for that proposition, then I wish to express my disagreement with it.  
     
      
    3 It may be noted that the manner in which s54B was to be applied was the subject of consideration in Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131. Specifically in relation to sentences imposed after plea, the Court observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “68 Although there is nothing in Division 1A of Part 4 that expressly says so, the standard non-parole periods in the Table must also be taken as having been intended for a middle-range case where the offender was convicted  
        after trial  
        . This follows from the fact that factor (k), being one of the mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3) which is to be taken into account as a matter which might justify a departure from the standard non-parole period, is ""a plea of guilty by the offender (as provided by s 22A)"". A plea of not guilty can never be an aggravating factor.  
         
         
        69 If the standard non-parole period had been intended to apply to cases where there had been a plea, then it may be safely inferred that such circumstance, which s 22 says ""must be taken into account"" would have already been factored into the assessment of the appropriate period . It would, in any event, be contrary to long-standing sentencing practice, save in exceptional circumstances, for there to be no differentiation in the setting of a non-parole period, between matters resolved by plea, and at trial.  
        
       
       
        
        70 The judgments in  
        Regina v Thomson and Houlton  
        (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and  
        R v Sharma  
        (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 indicate that a deduction in the range of 10 to 25 percent would be appropriate as a general guideline, for the utilitarian value of a plea, depending on its timing. It is true that there is no presumption in favour of, or entitlement to, any specific discount (  
        R v Scott  
        [2003] NSWCCA 286, and there are cases involving such enormity that no discount will be extended: for example  
        R v Kalache  
        (2000) 111 A Crim R 152.  
         
         
        71 Notwithstanding, a plea will, in most instances, have a utilitarian value such as to attract some level of discount. Absent the specification of separate standard non-parole periods, we are of the view that the periods specified in the Table should be understood as having been specified for sentences imposed for midrange cases  
        after conviction at trial  
        . We do not understand the Crown to be contending for the contrary.” 
        
       
      
    4 Subsequently the Court observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “117 In order to give the Division practical utility it seems to us, in the light of the foregoing analysis, that a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question: “are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?”  
        
       
       
        
        118 That question will be answered by considering:  
         
          
           
          (i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind;  
           
           
          (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1).  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        119 Depending upon the considerations referred to in the first of these paragraphs, it may become immediately apparent that the case is not one for which the standard non-parole period specified in the Table was intended to apply.  
        
       
       
        
        120 Whatever be the case in that regard, the considerations referred to in the second paragraph may similarly provide a reason for a departure from the standard non-parole period.  
        
       
       
        
        121 If the question, which we consider should be posed, is answered in the affirmative, then it seems to us that the Court should exercise its sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice and by reference to the matters identified in sections 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the Act. The ultimate objective remains one of imposing a sentence that is just and appropriate, having regard to all of the circumstances of the offence and of the offender, and so as to give effect to the purposes mentioned in s 3A of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        122 In this approach the  
        standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost 
        , 
         along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant. In particular, it can have a direct relevance as a reference point to be compared with the sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment has been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence, and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as any other subjective factor that may be present,  
        including in particular the fact, if it be the case, that the offender entered a plea of guilty. In that regard the sentencing judge will need to keep in mind that the standard non-parole periods were framed upon the assumption that the case was determined at trial and that s 22 of the Act contemplates that the fact of a plea will attract a discount 
        .  
         
         
        123 The reference point has, in this sense, an important role to play in ensuring consistency in sentencing. Because the standard non-parole period will be imposed, subject to s 21A, for matters within the mid range, it will act as a guide for cases that are outside the mid range.” (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    5 In Regina v Mouloudi, Bergin J with whom Simpson and Sperling JJ agreed said (at para 62): 
     
      
       
        
        “62 The first step in re-sentencing the respondent is the fixing of a non-parole period. Both offences were in my view far more serious than an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Although the standard non-parole period does not apply in this case because the respondent was convicted after a plea rather than after a trial, the appellant submitted that it is convenient to ask the question posed in  
        R v Way  
        at par [117] namely “are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period”? It seems to me that in sentencing after a plea the Court may have regard to the standard non-parole period applicable after conviction but it  
        must be remembered that the discretion in fixing a non-parole period after a plea is unfettered. 
        ” (Emphasis added).  
        
       
      
    6 I do not understand her Honour to have intended, by the concluding reminder “that the discretion in fixing a non-parole period after a plea is unfettered”, to suggest that s54B had no application, and was to be ignored in a case where the sentencing followed a plea. To the contrary, it is clear that she recognised, in accordance with para 122 of the judgment in Way, that, in such a case, the standard non-parole period specified in s54B is still to take its place as a reference point. It performs that function in so far as it specifies the standard non-parole period for a mid range case determined after trial, before any necessary adjustment which might be made in accordance with the section.  
     
      
    7 Otherwise the discretion which attaches to sentencing, remains to be exercised in accordance with the principles in Way. To the extent that adjustment may properly be made in accordance with those principles, then it is correct that the traditional sentencing discretion continues. I do not understand the passage in Mouloudi to have gone any further, let alone to have suggested that the sentencing discretion in such a case is entirely at large. Any such proposition would be contrary to principle. 
     
      
    8 KIRBY J: Glenn John Davies (the applicant) filed a late notice in which he seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Christie DCJ on 13 August 2003. Mr Davies was one of three offenders who pleaded guilty to two counts, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : Aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst in company (contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900) (maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : Malicious damage to property (contrary to s195(a) Crimes Act 1900) (maximum penalty: imprisonment for 5 years). 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour sentenced Mr Davies as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : To imprisonment for 4 years 9 months, with a non parole period of 3 years 3 months to expire on 30 June 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : A concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months. 
        
       
      
    10 Before dealing with the submissions made on behalf of Mr Davies, I should describe the circumstances in which the offences were committed. 
     
      
       
      The offences. 
       
      
    11 On 1 April 2003, Mr Davies spent part of his day drinking with two companions, William Marsh and Brian Marsh, who were father and son. Mr Davies was then aged 40 years. William Marsh was about the same age. His son was 19 years. Mr Davies had a defacto wife, Kate. The three men apparently decided that a particular woman, known to each of them, was responsible for a missing credit card belonging to Kate. The card had been used to withdraw money from her account. 
     
      
    12 Mr Davies and his companions determined that they would seek retribution. They went to the woman's home at about 5.00 pm. Each was armed with a weapon. Mr Davies had a block of wood. His companions had a baseball bat and a cricket bat. 
     
      
    13 The woman was at home with her nine year old son and a boarder, a young man aged 17 years. Suddenly she heard the sound of breaking glass. The lounge room window had been smashed. She rushed to the front door and was confronted by the three men who entered the house. 
     
      
    14 It was asserted by Mr Marsh Snr, speaking from the floor of the Court during the sentencing process, that the intention was to smash this woman's property. Whether that be right or wrong, the three quickly resorted to violence against the woman herself. They also smashed her property. Meanwhile the child and the young man fled. The woman was struck across her forehead. She began bleeding profusely. She retreated up the hallway. 
     
      
    15 The three, including Mr Davies, followed her. They demanded to know what she had done with ""Katie's card"". The woman denied any wrongdoing. She said that she was then repeatedly struck by the three men, using their weapons. Again she retreated, this time to the kitchen. As she was pursued, her assailants used their weapons to smash the stereo and a number of windows in the kitchen. 
     
      
    16 Once in the kitchen, the woman said the small refrigerator was knocked over. It ""ended up on top of her"", that is, she was struck by it as it fell. Again all three started punching her. She was dragged out of the house onto the front lawn. 
     
      
    17 The cricket bat had, by this time, splintered. Mr Marsh Jnr, according to the victim, then used the point of one fragment to interrogate her about what had happened to the money. Eventually his father pulled him back. The woman broke away and ran back inside her home. 
     
      
    18 The three men then left. By this time neighbours had summoned the police and an ambulance. The police approached Mr Davies and Mr Marsh Snr in a nearby street. They were arrested. Mr Marsh Jnr was arrested shortly thereafter. 
     
      
    19 The material before the sentencing Judge included statements from the police officers who attended the house in response to the emergency call. They saw a number of pools of blood. Windows had been smashed and the stereo had been damaged. There were smashed CDs strewn on the floor. The police saw pieces of broken baseball bat and cricket bat, which they took into their possession as exhibits. The refrigerator was on its side. There were blood smears on the bedroom door. 
     
      
    20 The victim was photographed. She had a number of bruises to her back and side. They were black and extensive. She received a wound to the head, near the bridge of her nose. She required three sutures inserted at the local hospital. Her left wrist was both bruised and swollen.  
     
      
       
      The subjective case of the applicant. 
       
      
    21 Mr Davies did not give evidence on sentence. He was not seen by the Probation and Parole Service. No other material was tendered describing his background, apart from his antecedents. He was born on 3 September 1962. Before 1998 he had no criminal record, apart from a conviction for being unlawfully on premises in 1987, for which he was fined, and various driving offences. The driving offences, perhaps significantly, included offences for driving whilst under the influence of alcohol (two offences in 1983 and two offences in 1994). On each occasion he was fined and disqualified. One of the offences involved a ""high range PCA"".  
     
      
    22 In 1998 Mr Davies was convicted of common assault. He was placed upon a recognisance for two years. On 22 July 2002 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was ordered to perform 200 hours community service. At the same time he was convicted of having contravened an apprehended violence order. He was placed upon a s9 bond for twelve months, requiring the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The bond was current at the time of these offences. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal. 
       
      
    23 The applicant relied upon a single ground of appeal, that his Honour, in identifying the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty, had erred, in that he had taken into account the strength of the Crown case. His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, said this: (ROS 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The plea of guilty, if I did not mention it, has a utilitarian value to the community in so much as it saves the witnesses having to come here, it saves the cost of a trial and all the usual utilitarian things that flow from a plea of guilty, and this plea was entered, as I say, at the earliest opportunity, and probably entitles the prisoners,  
        even having regard to the strength of the Crown case, probably entitles them to a discount of something between 15 and 20%. 
         A full discount would be about 25%, but in the face of the strength of this Crown case I'm not sure that it is completely applicable here."" 
         
        (emphases in applicant's submissions) 
        
       
      
    24 The strength of the Crown case was not a relevant consideration (R v Carter [2001] NSWCCA 245, paras 13-15). In R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ said this: (at 419) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25% discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge."" 
        
       
      
    25 The Crown acknowledged the error. Indeed, it was a common error, as Howie J recently lamented in R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225, when he said this: (para 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[12] This Court has pointed out, time and time again, that the strength of the Crown case is an irrelevant factor in determining the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. The strength of the Crown case is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse and what weight should be given to that factor in determining the appropriate sentence. The following are but some of the decisions on this point in the four years since  
        Thomson and Houlton 
         was decided, and this is not to indicate that the principle was other than patently obvious from the judgment of the Chief Justice in the guideline judgment. ...""  
         
        (references omitted) 
        
       
       
      Was another sentence warranted? 
       
      
    26 However, error by the sentencing Judge does not necessarily require the Court to intervene. In R v Boulghourgian (2001) 125 A Crim R 540, Spigelman CJ said this: (at para 34) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[34] Even though there is error detected in the reasoning process of a trial judge, s6(3) does not enable this court, much less require it, to interfere with the sentence unless it is of the view that a more lenient sentence should have been passed:  
        Regina v Astill (No 2) 
         (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 per Sully J at 303 and Lee AJ at 304."" 
         
        (see also  
        R v Simpson  
        (2001) 53 NSWLR 704) 
        
       
      
    27 It was said on behalf of the applicant that the plea of guilty was at the earliest opportunity. It was therefore appropriate that the full discount of 25% should have been given. Moreover, his Honour recognised that this was the first time in custody for Mr Davies. The Crown conceded before the sentencing Judge that a finding of special circumstances was warranted. In the applicant's submission a more lenient sentence should have been passed. 
     
      
    28 The Crown, however, drew attention to Pt 4 Div 1(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That Part was introduced in October 2002, with operation from 1 February 2003. It identified standard non parole periods in respect of offences set out in a table which formed part of that Division (s54A). The offence in count 1 (under s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900) was included in the table, setting a standard non parole period of 5 years. The standard non parole period is described as representing ""an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences"" in the table (s54A(2)). The Court is required ""to set the standard non parole period"" unless it determines that there are reasons for setting a longer or shorter period (s54B(2)). The Court may depart from the standard, but only for reasons which are identified in s21A of the Act (s54B(3)). Section 21A obliges the Court, when fixing a sentence, to have regard to aggravating and mitigating factors (which the section identifies), as well as other objective and subjective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence. The Court, by s54B(4), is enjoined to make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non parole period, identifying each factor taken into account. 
     
      
    29 At the time Mr Davies was sentenced, the regime introduced by s54A and s54B was new. His Honour did not have the benefit of the judgment of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J) (handed down on 11 May 2004). In that case the Court identified a number of principles to be used when interpreting these amendments. First, the Court explained what should be understood as ""an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" (paras 72-102). Secondly, it made it clear that the standard non parole period in the table must be taken as referring to an offender who has been convicted after trial (para 68). It would therefore be appropriate, where an offender had pleaded guilty, to use the standard non parole period as a reference point and to take account of the plea as a mitigating factor (s21A(3)(k)). Whilst it was argued that the standard non parole period had no application where there had been a plea of guilty (cf Bergin J in R v Mouloudi [2004] NSWCCA 96 at para 62), it is plain from R v Way that this was not so. 
     
      
    30 His Honour, not having that exposition, did his best in unchartered waters. He said this (referring to the standard non parole period for the offence under s112(2)): (ROS 9/10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Having regard to some of the types of sentences that are distributed throughout this State by some of my brother Judges, I find that level of sentence to be unbelievable and unsustainable. Not because I disagree with it, because simply I do not, but because it is completely out of kilter with any perception that I have of the type of sentences that some Judges in the State visit upon some quite serious criminals."" 
        
       
      
    31 He added: (ROS 10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""But be that as it may, I do not think that this offence attracts, in all of these circumstances, a non parole period of five years for any of these prisoners. I may be in disagreement then with the government in that regard, but it would be completely out of kilter with any understanding or appreciation of the sentencing guides and the sentencing methods presently used in this State. I see a need for increasing sentences. Obviously the government does too, or that section would not have come into existence. I cannot believe that that section is envisaged to be mandatory. Indeed, the Crown agrees with my thinking out loud that it is not so, that it is not mandatory."" 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour concluded by saying: (ROS 10/11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I think these are very serious sentences, and had these men ever committed anything remotely close to this before, they would be looking at very serious sentences, and they would be anyway. But in the presence of a plea of guilty I simply find myself unable to impose a non parole period of five years on any of them."" 
        
       
      
    33 The Crown submitted that his Honour, not having the benefit of R v Way, had not undertaken the task which the section required. Had he done so, he would have been driven to a sentence exceeding that which he passed. In R v Way (supra), the Court made it clear that the sentencing Judge must ask and answer the question: ""Are there reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period?"" That question will be answered by considering the following: (para 118) 
     
      
       
        
        ""(i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s21A(1)."" 
        
       
      
    34 Here, according to the Crown, his Honour implicitly determined that the offence was above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. He said that, whilst it was not in the worst category, ""it cannot be enormously far removed from it"". It was a sustained and vicious attack upon a vulnerable woman, carried out, at least initially, in the presence of a child. There were, in addition, a number of aggravating factors within s21A(2). The actual bodily harm upon the victim was an element of the offence and therefore was not an aggravating factor. The fact that the offence was committed in company was a matter included in the indictment, but would have added to the terror suffered by the victim (R v Way at para 107). The use of a weapon was a matter of aggravation, as was the fact that Mr Davies was subject to a bond at the time of the offence (s21A(2)(j)). 
     
      
    35 There were also matters in mitigation. Mr Davies had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity (s21A(3)(k)). There was some expression of remorse (s21A(3)(i)), although it was far from complete. 
     
      
    36 On the Crown's argument, therefore, had his Honour followed the new regime, as required by the section, and explained in R v Way, and even allowing the full 25% discount for the early plea, he still would have reached a sentence exceeding that which he imposed (approximately 3 years 7 months, cf 3 years 3 months non parole period imposed). 
     
      
    37 His Honour did find special circumstances, it being Mr Davies' first time in custody. Even making an adjustment to take account of that finding, on the Crown's argument no lesser sentence should have been passed, especially since the offence, properly characterised, was worse than ""an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". 
     
      
    38 I accept the Crown's argument. Notwithstanding error, I am not persuaded that a more lenient sentence should have been passed. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    39 I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. That leave to file an appeal out of time should be granted. 
       
       
      2. That leave to appeal should be granted. 
       
       
      3. That the appeal should be dismissed. 
       
      
    40 BUDDIN J: I have read in draft form the reasons of Kirby J. I agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed. I also agree with the additional remarks of Wood CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences which were imposed upon him in the District Court  
     
      
    2 On 26 July 2003 the applicant was convicted by a jury of a charge of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. That offence was committed on 4 June 2002. On 4 August 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery which he had committed on 13 February 2001. The latter offence attracted a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment whilst the offence of armed robbery attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 In respect of the robbery offence, Judge Woods QC sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 3 years to commence on 11 November 2002 and to expire on 10 November 2005 with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on the same day and to expire on 10 November 2004. In respect of the armed robbery offence, his Honour sentenced the applicant to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years with each period to commence on 11 November 2004. The non-parole period was fixed to expire on 10 November 2008. The overall effective sentence for those two matters is accordingly a head sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
     
      
    4 On 10 November 2003 the applicant was presented for trial upon an indictment containing three counts viz steal from the person, threaten to inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse and indecent assault. The applicant pleaded not guilty to all three counts and a jury was empanelled. Later the same day the Crown accepted the applicant’s plea of guilty to the count of indecent assault in full discharge of the indictment. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. In respect of that offence, Judge Charteris sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months with both periods to commence on 11 November 2008. The head sentence was fixed to expire on 10 November 2011 and the non-parole period on 10 May 2010. The overall effective sentence which the applicant is serving is thus a term of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7½ years. 
     
      
    5 It is convenient to refer first to the offences in respect of which the applicant was sentenced by Judge Woods. The robbery offence occurred, as I have said, on 13 February 2001. The facts were not in dispute and may be shortly stated. The victim was walking home alone at 2 am in an inner western suburb of Sydney. He heard footsteps behind him and turned to see the applicant standing there. The applicant, whom the victim had never seen before, accused the victim of abusing his (the applicant’s) friend the day before. The victim told the applicant that he had the wrong person. The applicant then grabbed the victim by the shoulders and forced him to the ground. When the victim got up, the applicant pulled his shirt over his head and also removed his backpack. It contained clothes which then spilt to the ground. As the victim was picking up his clothes, he was hit on the lip by the applicant. The victim feared that he would be hit again and he and the applicant then got involved in a struggle. During the course of the struggle, the applicant reached around to the victim’s rear pocket. The victim indicated that he only had $10, which the applicant then took. The applicant then demanded the victim’s wallet in order that he could ascertain the victim’s address. He told the victim to accompany him to his friend’s house to find out if he (the victim) was indeed the person who had verbally abused him. The applicant and the victim then began walking to Parramatta Road where the victim hailed a taxi. He asked the driver to call the police. The applicant got another taxi and left the scene. Police arrived and pursued the taxi containing the applicant. The taxi cab was stopped and the applicant was arrested. Located in his trouser pocket was the victim’s wallet and its contents. 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge found that although the victim’s financial loss was insubstantial, the applicant’s conduct in striking the victim and occasioning him various injuries, albeit of a relatively minor nature, would have caused him considerable fear. His Honour also referred to the fact that the victim would have felt vulnerable walking alone in a public street in the early hours of the morning. His Honour also concluded, quite correctly, that the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence was a matter of aggravation. The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25% to the applicant on account of his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    7 So far as the armed robbery offence is concerned, the sentencing judge who had presided over the applicant’s trial, found the following facts to have been established by the evidence. His Honour’s narrative of the incident is, with minor alterations, set out below: 
     
      
       
        
        On the relevant date, 4 June, a man called Lawrence was working in Raymond Terrace and living in a caravan park nearby, where a friend of his was also living. Lawrence was at one of the local hotels and decided to leave, either to go home, or to go into Newcastle. He went to wait for a taxi. The offender approached him on the street as he was waiting for a taxi. The jury obviously accepted, and I believe it to be clearly proven to the necessary standard, that the offender at that stage had the purpose of somehow engineering it so that he could get money from Lawrence. There was some discussion and Lawrence … agreed to go with him into Newcastle. Lawrence said he was going to go to one of the brothels in Newcastle and the offender could come along with him. That in fact occurred. They went to the brothel and Lawrence went with one at (sic) the women at the brothel. The offender caused some trouble while he was there in one way or another, apparently trying to get hold of the wallet that Lawrence had left in his trousers while he was [otherwise engaged]. In any event, the offender was not successful in that, and later they got back into a taxi and went back to Raymond Terrace. … From the taxi [Lawrence] rang 000 and tried to alert police or somebody that he was in the taxi with somebody who was behaving in a very eccentric and difficult fashion. One of the key witnesses in the trial was the taxi driver, who essentially confirmed most of what Lawrence said. In any event, as they got back to Raymond Terrace, the offender got out from the cab not far from the caravan park where Lawrence was living, which is itself not far from the town of Raymond Terrace. Lawrence prevailed upon the taxi driver to drive with him up around the town and then back into the area of the caravan park where, worried what ultimately happened might happen, he had a look around to see that there was nobody there lurking in the dark. In any event, the man Lawrence got out in the caravan park. There is no doubt that the offender, having left the taxi, then circled back, went to the caravan park and found where the man Lawrence was. As Lawrence was outside the caravan of a fellow called Mr Field, who was, his friend, the offender held an object against Lawrence’s throat and surprised him. The object was probably a Stanley knife or something like it. The prisoner “held up” Lawrence. He unclipped his watch and tried to take his wallet. I find (and the jury clearly accepted) that Lawrence was under the apprehension that he was about to have his throat cut if he did not comply. …[A]s it turns out, the man Field opened the door of the caravan and surprised the offender just as these events were occurring, so the offender absconded. He was subsequently seen by the man Lawrence some days later and police arrested him and charged him. 
        
       
      
    8 The sentencing judge found that there was a degree of planning involved in this offence and that, unlike the previous matter, the applicant was not entitled to any discount for having entered a plea of guilty. Moreover, it was again a matter of aggravation that the applicant was on conditional bail at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    9 The applicant grew up in Gambia in West Africa and came to Australia in 1988 following his marriage to an Australian woman. That relationship broke down a number of years ago. A subsequent relationship ended when he went into custody. The applicant has a history of gambling. He has also regularly abused illegal drugs and alcohol. Furthermore he has had considerable difficulty in adjusting to life in Australia. It was against that background that his Honour made a finding of “special circumstances”. Such a finding was appropriate, his Honour concluded, because of “the cultural displacement of the offender and the likelihood that he will suffer more severely in custody from the circumstances in which he finds himself than other prisoners will”.  
     
      
    10 So far as the indecent assault offence is concerned, it is convenient to refer to the remarks on sentence of Judge Charteris who found the following facts for the purpose of sentencing the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        On Sunday 3 November the victim and the offender were travelling on a coach from Newcastle to Taree. During the journey the victim formed the view that the accused had stolen some cigarettes, a mobile phone and a walkman from her possession. She reported that to the driver of the coach who on arrival in Taree drove to the police station where the accused/offender and the victim entered the police station. The coach then left. There was apparently some misunderstanding at the police station in that the offender signed his bail reporting card but was not interviewed by police concerning the complaint of theft that the victim had lodged. 
        
       
       
        
        The bail reporting condition related to two matters upon which this accused was on bail in respect of robbery and robbery being armed with an offensive weapon. 
        
       
       
        
        As there was no restraint of him or interview of him in respect of the alleged theft the offender left the police station but was pursued by the complainant and an argument developed outside the police station. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender ran from the area but was followed by the complainant. He entered into a vacant house which was undergoing renovation and the victim followed him therein. When she arrived inside the room the offender attempted to remove her jeans and forced her to the floor of the house and a struggle ensued. 
        
       
       
        
        In the course of that struggle he said to her “I want to fuck you”. She attempted to talk him out of having intercourse with her but he removed her jeans and underwear, removed his own jeans and lay on top of the victim. Although she could feel his erect penis he did not penetrate her. She continued to plead with him. He apologised and got off the complainant and told her to get dressed. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no evidence that he ejaculated during the course of the event and it appears that something caused him to desist from his behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant dressed and left the house having told the offender that she would not report the matter but she ran directly to the police station. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender attended the Taree Police Station eight days later to report for his bail. He was arrested at that time. He refused to be interviewed. 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour found, in the circumstances to which I have referred, that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the first possible opportunity and that his plea had spared the victim from the ordeal of having to give evidence. The sentencing judge was unable however to find any evidence of contrition, particularly as the applicant had provided a totally different and much less serious version of the incident to Dr Nielssen, who had been retained to prepare a report about him. Dr Nielssen indicated that the applicant would benefit from having access, whilst in custody, to a sex offenders treatment program. The sentencing judge found that the applicant would benefit from a longer period of supervision on parole than “the ordinary minimum period” would provide, in order that he could receive ongoing counselling in respect of his unresolved sexual problems. It was upon that basis that his Honour also made a finding of “special circumstances”. This offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was once again on bail at the time of the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    12 The applicant has a not insignificant criminal record. In 1993 he was fined in the Local Court for supplying heroin. In 1994 he was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment for offences of escape lawful custody, hinder police and possess prohibited drug. In the same year he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 4 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 3½ years for an aggravated sexual assault. Further offences of indecent assault and robbery attracted concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment. In 1999 he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months for offences of break enter and steal and other less serious offences. In 2001 an offence of enter enclosed lands attracted a fine. In 2002 he was imprisoned for 4 months for stealing property in a dwelling house and goods in custody. 
     
      
    13 In respect of the sentences imposed by Judge Woods, the applicant contended that his Honour had erred “in failing to make allowance for the totality of the sentences imposed by partially accumulating them”. The relevant principles to be applied where an offender stands for sentence in respect of more than one offence are well established. See Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15. A broad discretion is conferred upon sentencing judges to direct that a sentence of imprisonment be served either wholly or partly consecutively with another term of imprisonment. See also s 55(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No complaint is made about the length of the individual sentences that were imposed. Nor is it submitted that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the requirements enunciated in Pearce. Moreover it was not suggested that it was not appropriate, given that these were two entirely separate offences committed well over a year apart, to impose cumulative sentences. The submission, in essence, is that in the ultimate result the sentencing judge has imposed sentences which are manifestly excessive. In support of that proposition, it is submitted that the sentencing judge has failed to give proper effect to the principle of totality. 
     
      
    14 I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge has fallen into error of the kind identified. Each offence was a serious instance of criminality. The second offence in particular required the imposition of a salutary penalty. Nor in respect of it, did the applicant have the benefit of any discount for a plea of guilty. In relation to each offence the applicant was, as I have said, on bail at the time. Furthermore, the applicant had a criminal record which suggested that he had learnt nothing from his previous encounters with the law. Moreover his record included a prior conviction for robbery. Accordingly, this ground of appeal should be rejected.  
     
      
    15 The next complaint is that his Honour, having found “special circumstances” and having imposed individual sentences which reflected that finding, then structured those sentences in such a way as to deny the applicant the benefit of that finding since the ultimate overall effect of the sentences imposed was to produce a non-parole period which was 75% of the head sentence. His Honour was aware of that outcome because he remarked that “if it should appear that no apparent benefit accrues to the prisoner from the findings I have made of ‘special circumstances’, that is an artefact of the sentences imposed for repeat offences”. If his Honour was there suggesting that he was in some way constrained to arrive at that outcome notwithstanding his finding of “special circumstances”, then I would find that his Honour had fallen into error. However I express no concluded view about the matter as I am unable to determine if that is what his Honour was actually intending to convey by those remarks. 
     
      
    16 The applicant contends that he is left with a legitimate sense of grievance in that he has been deprived of the benefit of a finding to which the sentencing judge said he was entitled. In short, it is submitted that his Honour erred in not giving effect to his finding of “special circumstances”. It is convenient to deal with this submission in conjunction with a similar submission which is made in respect of the sentence imposed by Judge Charteris.  
     
      
    17 Finally, the applicant contended that he should have received the benefit of a period of pre-sentence custody. The applicant was arrested and taken into custody on 11 November 2002 in respect of those matters which ultimately culminated in his conviction for indecent assault. He has been in continuous custody since that date. As is apparent, Judge Woods ordered that the sentence for the robbery offence should commence on that date. There was considerable debate before his Honour concerning the appropriate commencement date for that offence given that the applicant had had his bail revoked in respect of the two robbery matters when he was arrested in respect of what I shall refer to, for convenience, as the indecent assault matter. The debate arose because, as at the time of the proceedings before Judge Woods, the indecent assault matter remained unresolved. Given that that matter has now been finalised, it is unnecessary to revisit that debate. 
     
      
    18 Nonetheless it is common ground that the applicant had also spent two discrete periods of time in custody (totalling 43 days) prior to 11 November 2002. Indeed the Crown specifically brought that matter to the sentencing judge’s attention. His Honour’s failure to refer to that aspect of the case is undoubtedly due to the fact that the focus of the debate was solely upon whether 11 November 2002 or some later date was the appropriate commencement date for those offences. In any event, a sentencing court is required to take into account any pre-sentence custody which is referable to the relevant offence or offences in question. See s 24(1)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588. In the circumstances, and particularly given the sentencing judge’s failure to give reasons for not taking that period into account, I would uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    19 The applicant also relies upon a number of grounds in support of his application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him by Judge Charteris. The applicant submits that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective criminality of this crime particularly as his Honour was disposed to find that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the offence was opportunistic in the sense of there being no premeditation or planning; 
       
       
      (b) the applicant did not ejaculate whilst committing the offence; and 
       
       
      (c) the applicant apologised to the victim and permitted her to get dressed and to leave the scene of the incident. 
       
      
    20 Moreover, it was submitted that as the applicant had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, the sentencing judge must have erred in imposing a sentence of 3 years imprisonment against a maximum penalty of 5 years. Counsel for the applicant also called in aid Judicial Commission statistics concerning the range of penalties which have been imposed in other cases of indecent assault. 
     
      
    21 Allied to that contention was a submission that his Honour had found that there were aggravating features of the offence which were not open on the evidence. In that context it was submitted that there was no basis for his Honour to have concluded that “the offence involved threatened use or inferred use of violence” and that “there was injury or emotional harm likely to have been caused to the victim”. 
     
      
    22 It is convenient to deal with that submission first. Whilst it is true that the sentencing judge did not have the benefit of a victim impact statement, it was, in my view, nonetheless well open to the sentencing judge to infer from all the circumstances that the applicant’s conduct carried with it the threatened use of violence. The facts disclose that there was a struggle during the course of which the applicant removed the victim’s jeans and underwear against her will. Having said to her that “I want to fuck you”, he then removed his own jeans and lay on top of her. It takes no imagination to conclude that the victim would have been terrified by the applicant’s conduct. Moreover it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the threat of violence on the part of the applicant was anything other than ever present throughout the duration of the incident.  
     
      
    23 Similarly it was well open to the trial judge, in my view, to conclude that the victim was likely to have suffered emotional harm as a result of this incident, even in the absence of explicit evidence upon the issue. Indeed counsel for the applicant at the sentencing hearing conceded that “the inference can be drawn that there may be some psychological injury” to the victim. One of the aggravating features which is identified in s 21A(2)(g) is the fact that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. It is submitted that his Honour purported to rely upon that provision as a matter of aggravation. This, it was submitted, was an error because even if some emotional harm had been occasioned to the victim, it was not open upon the evidence to conclude that it was substantial. So much may be accepted. However his Honour did not say at any stage that the harm likely to have been caused was in fact substantial. His Honour was entitled nevertheless to arrive at the conclusion which he reached without having to determine that the harm was substantial. His Honour was quite entitled to have regard, in assessing the objective gravity of the offence, to the likely impact of the offence upon the victim. Indeed one of the very purposes of sentencing is to recognise the harm done to the victim and to the community. See s 3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Furthermore s 21A(1)(c) indicates that the court is to take into account “any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence”. I am not persuaded in the circumstances that his Honour was purporting to rely upon s 21A(2)(g), as opposed to the more general provisions to which I have just referred. I would not, in any event, discern in relation to this issue, any error of the kind that would attract the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
    24 On any view of the matter, this was a serious example of an offence of indecent assault and it warranted the imposition of an appropriate penalty. Moreover, the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on bail for other serious offences and against the background of prior sexual offences. In any event the way in which his Honour structured the head sentence for this offence had the effect of extending his overall head sentence by only twelve months although the non-parole period was extended by 18 months. In those circumstances I would reject the ground of appeal which asserts that the head sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    25 It is next submitted that the sentencing judge erred in not taking into account the fact that the offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court. In support of this submission the applicant relied upon a line of authority which includes R v Griggs (1999) 109 A Crim R 484; R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 and R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115.  
     
      
    26 In R v Crombie, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Simpson J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        This Court has acknowledged that the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge, see 
         Dalton-Morgan 
        , Court of Criminal Appeal 14 December 1989, 
         Jason Clyde Smith 
        , Court of Criminal Appeal 11 September 1991, and 
         Shepherd 
         (1991) New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 162.  
        
       
       
        
        None of those decisions go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Moreover, where it appears that in the circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal. 
        
       
      
    27 In Doan (supra) this Court held that when a person is being dealt with in a higher court for an offence that could have been dealt with in the Local Court with a consequent lower maximum sentence, that is a matter that may, rather than should, be taken into account in mitigation. It is not a universal factor for reduction of sentence.  
     
      
    28 A failure by a sentencing judge to mention that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court cannot of itself constitute error. In R v Sivyer [2002] NSWCCA 410, Wood CJ at CL, in a passage which is particularly apposite to the present case, said; 
     
      
       
        
        It was submitted that, by failing to advert to this fact, or to the possibility that the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court under S 32 of the  
        Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
        , his Honour must have overlooked this consideration. However, as I pointed out in  
        Regina v Crombie 
         [1999] NSWCCA 297, there is no absolute principle of law that a sentencing judge must proceed upon the basis that the maximum sentence available in such a situation (here, imprisonment for three years) should be that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. The facts in  
        Crombie 
          
        are markedly different from those in the present case, where the applicant had multiple convictions for similar offences; had served several terms of imprisonment and has re-offended while on parole. The simple fact is that the applicant chose to plead not guilty in the Local Court, and the DPP had every right to elect to proceed upon indictment in view of the prior record. 
        
       
      
    29 In my view, there is no substance in this ground of appeal and it ought to be rejected given all the circumstances of the case and particularly in view of the applicant’s antecedent criminal behaviour. I am fortified in that view by the fact that counsel who appeared on the applicant’s behalf during the sentencing proceedings did not see fit to make a submission of the kind which is now advanced. 
     
      
    30 Finally it is contended that the sentencing judge failed to take into account in structuring this sentence, the principle of totality. It was not contended that a measure of accumulation was not required. The complaint is that notwithstanding the sentencing judge’s finding of “special circumstances”, the applicant has nonetheless received in the final analysis a non-parole period of 7½ years against a head sentence of 9 years. That is, the overall non-parole period represents 83.3% of the total sentence.  
     
      
    31 Although his Honour did not expressly refer to the principle of totality in calculating the total effective sentence which was ultimately imposed, I am not disposed to conclude that his Honour overlooked the relevant principles which are to be applied. Nevertheless the fact remains that the applicant has received an overall non-parole period which exceeds by some margin the statutory proportion of 75% provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, notwithstanding the fact that two different sentencing judges have each made a finding of “special circumstances” in his favour. 
     
      
    32 There is a well established principle that the accumulation of sentences is itself a basis upon which a finding of “special circumstances” may be made. See R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; R v Close (1993) 31 NSWLR 743; R v Clissold [2002] NSWCCA 356. In Close Hunt CJ at CL said the principle of “totality is not limited to connected or roughly contemporaneous offences…. In such circumstances, all of the sentences which are accumulated should usually be adjusted downwards to produce an acceptable result” (At 748).  
     
      
    33 I am persuaded that error has been established and that the court must intervene to remedy what is an anomalous outcome. There are plenty of examples of instances, of which Close and Simpson are but two in which this court has intervened in circumstances which parallel the present case. See R v Bolamatu [2002] NSWCCA 454; R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215; R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86. It is appropriate to do so in this case as well. 
     
      
    34 Accordingly, although for the reasons which I have earlier expressed there is no warrant to interfere with the length of the overall head sentence, there will need to be some adjustment to the overall non-parole period. In my view that can best be achieved by reducing the non-parole period in relation to each of the sentences imposed for the offences of armed robbery and indecent assault respectively. Nevertheless it is important to ensure that the purposes for which an appropriate non-parole period is fixed are reflected in the ultimate result. See R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. 
     
      
    35 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Leave to appeal against sentence for robbery committed on 13 February 2001 granted and appeal allowed but only as to the commencement date. The non-parole period of 2 years is now to commence on 30 September 2002 and to expire on 29 September 2004 with the balance of the term of 1 year to expire on 29 September 2005. 
       
       
      2 Leave to appeal against sentence for armed robbery committed on 4 June 2002 granted. 
       
       
      3 Appeal allowed (in part). 
       
       
      4 Confirm the total sentence but quash the non-parole period. 
       
       
      5 In lieu thereof fix a non-parole of 3 years and 3 months to commence on 30 September 2004 and to expire on 29 December 2007. The balance of that term of 2 years and 9 months is to expire on 29 September 2010. 
       
       
      6 Leave to appeal against sentence for indecent assault committed on 3 November 2002 granted. 
       
       
      7 Appeal allowed (in part). 
       
       
      8 Confirm the total sentence but quash the non-parole period. 
       
       
      9 In lieu thereof fix a non-parole period of 1 year to commence on 30 December 2007 and to expire on 29 December 2008. The balance of that term of 2 years is to expire on 30 December 2010. 
       
       
      10 The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 29 December 2008.

    3 BUDDIN J: Teck Lee Lew (whom I shall refer to as the applicant) was jointly tried with David Ng. Ng was found guilty of the murder on 22 May 2001 of Nigel Stiffe. He was also found guilty of having at the same time robbed Mr Stiffe whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was found guilty of being an accessory before the fact to the murder by Ng and a person by the name of Wai Kit Lo. He also pleaded guilty at the outset of the trial to being an accessory before the fact to the armed robbery (albeit upon the basis that the weapon was an offensive weapon and not a dangerous one). That count was charged as an alternative to the count of being an accessory before the fact to murder. The Crown declined to accept his plea in full discharge of that count in the indictment and accordingly the trial against the applicant proceeded in respect of what I shall refer to as the primary count. I shall shortly return to consider the significance of that fact in light of the jury’s verdict upon the primary count. The applicant also pleaded guilty to a further count of being an accessory before the fact to an attempt by Lo and a person named Tran on 14 May 2001 to rob Mr Stiffe whilst they were armed with an offensive weapon. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment to date from 5 July 2001 in respect of the offence committed on 14 May 2001. He was sentenced to a further fixed term of 5 years imprisonment in respect of the offence of being an accessory before the fact to armed robbery on 22 May 2001. Each of those offences attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 In respect of the primary count, the applicant was sentenced to a term of 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years. That sentence, and the sentence imposed in respect of the other offence committed on the same day, were each ordered to commence on 5 July 2002. The effective overall sentence was thus one of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years. The maximum penalty for the primary count is, by reason of the combined operation of ss 19A and 346 of the Crimes Act 1900, imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    7 Lo, who gave evidence at the applicant’s trial, was sentenced by the trial judge to a term of 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13½ years for the murder of the deceased. His Honour allowed an overall discount of 40% to that offender on account of his plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities. But for those features of the case, it can be inferred that Lo would otherwise have received a head sentence of 30 years imprisonment. The trial judge sentenced Ng to a term of 35 years imprisonment for the murder of the deceased. The effective overall sentence imposed upon Ng for that offence and for the offence of armed robbery was 37 years with a non-parole period of 27 years and 9 months. In sentencing Lo and Ng, the trial judge found that although neither of them had planned to kill the deceased and that the killing was not therefore premeditated, it was nonetheless a deliberate and cold blooded execution on their part. 
     
      
    8 Following his plea of guilty to the attempted robbery on 14 May, the offender Tran received a sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 12 months to be served by way of periodic detention. He too received a significant discount for giving assistance to the authorities which also entailed his giving evidence at the trial of the applicant and Ng. 
     
      
    9 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him although in fact no submission was advanced concerning the sentence which was imposed in respect of the offence committed on 14 May 2001.  
     
      
    10 Before dealing with the challenge to the two remaining sentences, it is necessary to first consider a challenge to the applicant’s conviction for the offence of being an accessory before the fact to armed robbery on 22 May 2001 to which, as I have said, the applicant pleaded guilty, it having been charged as an alternative count. The jury’s verdict of guilty upon the primary count had the consequence that there was no need for a verdict to be taken upon the alternative count. In those circumstances, no sentence should have been imposed in respect of the alternative count. The applicant’s record should not include a conviction for this matter as if it were in some way a separate offence. It would appear that this issue was simply overlooked at the sentence hearing. Accordingly, it is common ground that the conviction and sentence for that offence should be quashed. 
     
      
    11 It is also common ground that this conclusion will have no practical impact upon the other sentences which were imposed because the sentence imposed for this offence was concurrent with, and wholly subsumed by, the sentence imposed in respect of the primary count. 
     
      
    12 That leaves the application for leave to appeal against what is asserted to be the severity of the sentence imposed upon the applicant following his conviction in respect of the primary count. In order to properly assess the submissions which were advanced on behalf of the applicant, it is convenient to refer to the trial judge’s sentencing remarks. Contained therein are his Honour’s findings of fact upon the critical question of the applicant’s role in the offence: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Stiffe was killed by the offender, Ng, in company with one, Wai Kit Lo, who pleaded guilty to murdering Mr Stiffe on 5 May 2003 and gave evidence at the trial of Ng and Lew. I sentenced Wai Kit Lo on 9 May 2003 and in the course of giving reasons for the sentence set out in detail the circumstances of the case. Although it is not necessary for me to set them out again some salient features need to be mentioned. 
         
         
        Mr Stiffe was the manager of the Market City Tavern. Wai Kit Lo had been employed there for about six months but had resigned, perhaps involuntarily, some months before the offences. Teck Lee Lew was supervisor or shift manager at the Tavern and it was on his recommendation that Lo obtained work there. However, after Lo left that employment he and Lew remained in contact with each other. It was Lo’s evidence that Lew suggested to him that the Tavern should be robbed and that he should find a gun for that purpose. Although the offender, Lew, admitted that he was a party to the plan to rob the Tavern he said that it was Lo’s idea and that as he was then in desperate need of money he agreed to turn a blind eye to its commission. He denied that he ever discussed the possibility of the use of a gun or, for that matter, a knife in the robbery. He said that the only plan discussed was that Lo would use a metal bar, later described as a shopping trolley pole, to render Mr Stiffe unconscious by a blow to the head. On the whole I am minded to believe Lew’s evidence on this point. Certainly Lo had something to gain, and he probably thought it would be a good deal, from alleging that Lew instigated the crime and proposed the use of a gun and not him. Furthermore, there is evidence, which I am minded to accept, that Lew at an earlier time warned Mr Stiffe that Lo had talked about a robbery and asked to ban him from the Tavern. In the absence of any supporting evidence I do not think that Lo’s credibility is such that I could believe his evidence either as to Lew’s instigating the offence, or as to the gun, or, for that matter, as to the knife.  
         
         
        On 14 May 2001, Lo and Tran were armed with a metal pole taken from a dismantled shopping trolley and a knife belonging to Lo’s brother. In the result when it came to the point of actually attacking Mr Stiffe they desisted and left the premises before any alarm was raised. 
         
         
        So far as the offences that occurred on 21 May (sic) are concerned, Ng became involved some days before, although the precise date is uncertain. On the day of the crime Lo and Ng went from Lo’s home to the Tavern, taking with them a change of clothes, including tracksuits and balaclavas, a metal pole, Lo’s brother’s knife and a pistol. The evidence does not permit me to conclude who of Lo or Ng obtained the gun though I think that Lo procured the knife and the pole. I have no doubt that Ng was well aware that the pole, knife and gun were being taken to the robbery. Nothing turns on who obtained or who carried what. The two men remained hidden overnight in the fire stairs where, later, fingerprints of Ng and cigarette butts containing his DNA were found. At about 6.40am on Tuesday 22 May, Mr Stiffe arrived for work at the Tavern and about an hour later he entered the cool room/office area where he normally counted the Tavern’s overnight takings. A few minutes later Ng and Lo entered the office area wearing balaclavas and caps to conceal their identities from the closed circuit television cameras operating throughout the premises and also from Mr Stiffe. Again, who was armed with what is uncertain since I cannot accept Lo’s evidence on this point beyond reasonable doubt. This is immaterial since I am satisfied that both of them had agreed that the respective weapons would be used as necessary although I accept that they expected that it would be sufficient to obtain Mr Stiffe’s compliance if he were threatened with one or more of them. As the offenders entered the office Mr Stiffe got up and walked into the cool room and was struck from behind with a metal pole, it being again planned that he would be rendered unconscious. This, however, did not disable him and a struggle ensued during which the balaclavas worn by the offenders came off. Eventually Mr Stiffe was overpowered and forced to lie on the floor. He was then killed, the autopsy revealing that he suffered a fatal wound inflicted by the knife to his throat as well as a bullet wound to the back of this head. 
         
         
        Lo’s account of what happened was calculated to reduce his own responsibility for the acts of killing Mr Stiffe but although there is good reason for believing that Ng indeed played the major role I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was so. However, whoever took the major role I have no doubt that both offenders were fully complicit and for all practical purposes equally culpable.  
         
         
        It is clear that Mr Stiffe was executed because he was able to identify the offenders, although he only knew Lo from previous acquaintance. Although the offenders had not planned on killing Mr Stiffe so that in that sense his death was not premeditated nevertheless it was a deliberate execution in cold blood. The offender, Lo, gave evidence on his plea as to the circumstances of the killing. I was prepared to accept that he was the follower, not the instigator, of the lethal assaults and the murder was not premeditated in the sense that it was planned from the beginning (taking and wearing the balaclavas being the strongest evidence of this) and thus that the case was not in the worst category of case. The evidence does not permit me to find as against Ng that he was the instigator of the killing. So far as he is concerned, therefore, I find that the crime does not fall into the worst category of case but not by much.  
         
         
        The offenders stole about $50,000 in cash from the office safe and fled taking money, knife, metal pole and pistol with them. In all the circumstances I think it likely that Ng became involved in the crime by agreement with Lo who was its instigator but he needed no persuading and thereafter enthusiastically participated in it so that the distinction in culpability is, I think, relatively slight. The aftermath of the offences is sufficiently set out in my reasons for sentence in respect of Lo and I do not intend to repeat them here. 
         
         
        It was the case of Teck Lee Lew that, although he was a party to the attempted robbery in respect of which he pleaded guilty on 14 May 2001 and was also an accessory before the fact to the robbery with an offensive weapon of 21 May 2001, (sic) he had not adverted to the possibility that Mr Stiffe would be seriously injured or wounded though he was aware that Lo intended to use a trolley pole to render Mr Stiffe unconscious. 
         
         
        Lew said in his evidence that although a metal pole had been first mentioned the trolley pole was later agreed on and he was unaware what such a pole was made of and it did not occur to him that it might cause serious injury or wounding though I do not doubt that he realised that such a pole would be made of metal and I have also concluded that he was aware that a blow to the head sufficient to cause unconsciousness could well cause serious injury or wounding though I do not think that I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he adverted to the risk that grievous bodily harm might be inflicted. In the result, of course, no serious injury was, it appears, caused by use of the pole. I am satisfied that Lew did not intend to contemplate the possibility that Mr Stiffe might be killed and I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he contemplated the possibility that Lo would take either a gun or a knife. 
         
         
        Lew said that he told Lo some days before the robbery that he no longer wished to be involved and attempted to dissuade Lo from proceeding by saying that he would be identified from the video security and would be caught. The robbery took place when Lew was absent from the premises and it is obvious that Lo did not think he needed to rely on Lew to assist him to accomplish it. In the end I am disposed to think that Lew’s evidence about attempting to withdraw from his involvement in the crime might well be true and I consider that he should be sentenced on this basis. Of course, the fact that he privately indicated to Lo that he no longer wished to be involved in the robbery was no defence to the charge since he took no steps to attempt to ensure that the crime did not occur, steps which he could easily have taken had he so wished. I infer that he did not wish to raise the alarm because he knew that his earlier complicity would thereby be exposed and that he might lose his employment. 
         
         
        Lew’s criminality is aggravated, however, by reason of his position of trust as an employee of the tavern. As a result Lew was complicit in a crime that resulted in Mr Stiffe’s death and his conviction for murder although the involvement of Lo and Ng was greater and more culpable by a very considerable margin. 
         
        
       
      
    13 A little later his Honour made the following observations: 
     
      
       
        
        I regard it as significant from the point of view of the offender’s chances of rehabilitation as well as reflecting on the seriousness of the crime that he did not participate in the crime in the result although his withdrawal was insufficient to comprise a defence to the charge. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The extent of his actual involvement does not demonstrate nearly the level of criminal culpability shown by the offender, Ng, or, for that matter, the offender, Lo. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        So far as Lew is concerned his culpability is significantly less, as I have already said, than that of either Lo or Ng since not only did he play no part in the killing of Mr Stiffe and did not intend or foresee the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon him, though, as I have said, I think that he did foresee significant injury, at least amounting to a wounding, he did withdraw from active participation in the crime. … 
        
       
       
        
        Lew has been convicted of three crimes of which attempted robbery is so separate in point of time and occasion as to require some accumulation with the other offences. It is obvious from what I have already said that his conviction of the offence of being an accessory before the fact to murder arose from his involvement in the joint enterprise of robbing Mr Stiffe and his guilt is thus derived directly from the fact that Mr Stiffe was killed in the course of that crime, Lew having adverted to the substantial risk that serious injury amounting at least to a wounding might be inflicted. As it is so inextricably bound up in the offence of being an accessory before the fact to the armed robbery no sensible separation can be constructed and the sentences should for the same reason be served concurrently. 
        
       
       
      
    14 The applicant’s background was summarised by the trial judge in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender, Lew, was born in Singapore and is now aged thirty-six years. He came to Australia with his parents in 1979 when he was thirteen years old, attending a local high school for three years, leaving with his School Certificate in 1982. He has been in continuous employment since leaving school, lastly, of course, at the Market City Tavern. The offender has a large and supportive family. He was married for one year and has a daughter now aged twelve with whom he had regular and frequent contact until his arrest and incarceration. His daughter visited him once at the remand centre but was so frightened by the experience that she has not visited him since. Following his divorce the offender commenced another relationship which lasted for about five years. He is the father of another daughter, now aged seven years, who has visited him mostly with his parents but sometimes with her mother. In 1997 the offender married again. Lew has no significant criminal antecedents. 
         
        
       
      
    15 The applicant had a prior conviction in the Local Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in respect of which he was placed on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for two years. However, as is apparent, the trial judge clearly regarded that matter as having no significance to the present proceedings. That was a very generous finding particularly in view of the fact that the applicant was still subject to that recognisance, at least when the offence of 14 May was committed. 
     
      
    16 The trial judge then made the following observations concerning other aspects of the applicant’s subjective case: 
     
      
       
        
        In many ways both Ng and Lew have been model prisoners, especially the offender, Lew, who has undertaken responsible work assisting Asian inmates to adjust to the correctional centre environment and avoid potential conflicts. An additional factor in Lew’s case is that he pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery charge and indicated that he would do so at an early stage. He has also pleaded guilty to the charge of being an accessory before the fact of robbery and I should repeat here, as I have already pointed out, that this was robbery with an offensive, rather than a dangerous weapon, which is an important distinction in point of seriousness. Although in the circumstances his trial on the charge of murder was not thereby averted the plea simplified the trial significantly and involved admissions as to his complicity which the Crown could by no means have been confident of proving to the requisite degree of certainty. It seems to me that I should acknowledge the significance of those pleas in the sentence which I intend to impose. I regard it as significant from the point of view of the offender’s chances of rehabilitation. … I accept that Lew’s involvement in this crime was an aberration and that he is most unlikely to offend again. 
        
       
      
    17 The applicant does not contend that the trial judge fell into any error which can be identified. Nor is there any challenge to any of his Honour’s findings of fact. Indeed the submission, when refined to its essence, is that given the favourable findings of fact which were made by the trial judge, the ultimate sentence which was imposed is manifestly excessive. It follows, it is submitted, that the trial judge concluded that his role was a rather limited one. In support of that proposition the applicant referred, in his written submissions, to the following features of the case: 
     
      
    · The applicant was a party to an agreement with Lo that there be a robbery at the Tavern, but his Honour accepted the applicant’s version that the idea originated with Lo; 
     
      
    · the applicant’s role in this plan was limited – in the attempt on 14 May 2003 he was to “turn a blind eye”; 
     
      
    · the applicant had no knowledge or belief about any weapon being employed in the robbery apart from an item referred to as a “ shopping trolley pole”; his Honour declined to find that the applicant contemplated the possibility that a gun or knife would be taken to the robbery; 
     
      
    · the applicant adverted to the possibility of the metal pole causing a wounding, but his Honour specifically refrained from finding that he adverted to the possibility of it causing grievous bodily harm; 
     
      
    · the applicant had no involvement in the planning for, or carrying out of, the robbery on 22 May 2003. In fact, he attempt (sic) to withdraw from the enterprise but had to concede that he had not done all that he reasonably could to undo the effect of his previous participation; and 
     
      
    · the applicant received no share of the substantial proceeds of the robbery on 22 May 2003. 
     
      
    18 The applicant submitted that his liability for the offence was “somewhat technical” in the sense that even though he was found not to have participated in the robbery on 22 May and indeed had sought to distance himself from it, he nonetheless had to concede his guilt of that offence because he had not done what the law regards as being sufficient to have withdrawn from the enterprise. See R v Tietie & ors (1988) 34 A Crim R 438; R v Truong (NSWCCA unreported 22 June 1998). The trial judge found that the applicant’s conviction upon the primary count depended upon the operation of the felony-murder rule, in that the applicant was a party to the commission of the foundational offence of armed robbery with wounding which, pursuant to s 98 of the Crimes Act, attracts a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. His Honour had also found that the applicant’s conduct had placed him within the reach of s 98 because he had contemplated the possibility that the deceased would be wounded during the course of the armed robbery.  
     
      
    19 It is nevertheless accepted by the applicant that there is no impediment to a conviction being based upon a person’s complicity which arises from his or her participation in a joint criminal enterprise in a felony murder. See R v Sharah (1992) 63 A Crim R 361; R v R & G (1995) 79 A Crim R 191. Nor did the applicant contend that a conviction which is based upon the operation of the felony-murder rule, is necessarily less serious than other forms of murder. See R v Mills (CCA unreported 3 April 1995).  
     
      
    20 Regardless of what legal ingredients provided the basis for the applicant’s conviction, what remains of critical importance for sentencing purposes is an assessment of what act or acts he performed or omitted to perform in furthering the criminal enterprise and the consequences which relevantly flowed from that conduct. 
     
      
    21 In order to make that assessment, it is necessary to recall the context in which this offence occurred. The applicant gave evidence at the trial during the course of which, as counsel who appeared on his behalf in this court acknowledged, he had made a number of concessions concerning his complicity in various aspects of the overall enterprise. The applicant gave evidence the he had had lost about $3,500 whilst gambling at the tavern in the period shortly before the abortive robbery on 14 May. The applicant said that he had taken the money from the till even though he was not supposed to borrow money for the purpose of gambling.  
     
      
    22 The applicant said that he and Lo had had a conversation in the early hours of 13 May in which Lo had also asked him for a loan of $4,000. He said that he had then informed Lo that he had gambled away the $3,500. Thereafter, he said, Lo had discussed with him the plan to rob the premises. He said that Lo had promised him $15,000 for his assistance in facilitating the execution of the plan. The plan involved his turning a “blind eye” when Lo and his companion entered the premises to commit the robbery.  
     
      
    23 The applicant and Lo continued to maintain regular telephone and face to face contact after the failed robbery attempt. Indeed the applicant had initially believed that the robbery was to be rescheduled for the following day although it did not go ahead at that time either.  
     
      
    24 Eventually the applicant repaid the money which he had taken. This, he said, had eased his financial pressures. He said that he had informed Lo that the robbery attempt had been captured on the closed circuit television system and that he did not wish to continue his involvement in the scheme. Nevertheless the applicant said that Lo had told him that he still intended to proceed with it. Although the applicant expressed concerns about his doing so, he said that “[Lo] assure me that he can continue, he got the better plan to do it”. 
     
      
    25 As the trial judge found, the applicant was, initially at least, a willing participant in the enterprise to rob the premises. He was aware that it would involve two offenders who were to be armed with an offensive weapon. He was aware that in order that the robbery could be carried out a metal pole was going to be used with sufficient force as would render the victim unconscious. He no doubt would also have appreciated, given that the deceased was a large man, that very considerable force would have been required to achieve that objective. He was also aware, as the trial judge found, of the possibility that the victim would, as a result of the blow or blows which were in contemplation, be wounded. 
     
      
    26 The applicant was undoubtedly, by reason of his position of responsibility in the business, very familiar with the layout of the premises and the work practices of the deceased who was ultimately responsible for the takings of the business. His knowledge of the tavern’s business was no doubt important to the success of the overall plan. Indeed as the trial judge remarked, a significant aggravating feature of the applicant’s conduct in participating in this offence was the fact that in doing so he had seriously abused the position of trust in which he had been placed by his employer.  
     
      
    27 The applicant’s motivation for involving himself in this offence was the financial pressure that he was under at the time. He conceded in his evidence that “greed sort of overtook the whole thing”. He said that he had wanted to use the proceeds of the robbery to cover the gambling debt which he had incurred to his employer in the hope that the debt would not be discovered. Understandably he was fearful of losing his job if it were to be discovered. His conduct was that of a man acting out of desperation. 
     
      
    28 The applicant, on his own admission, remained aware of the fact that Lo still intended to carry out the robbery. The trial judge found that the applicant “attempted to dissuade Lo from proceeding by saying that he would be identified from the video security and would be caught”. His Honour also indicated that he was prepared to accept the applicant’s evidence “about attempting to withdraw from his involvement in the crime”. Accordingly his culpability is to be clearly differentiated from that of a person who continues to actively encourage the commission of an offence. Ultimately however the applicant did nothing of any material significance to prevent the commission of the robbery on 22 May notwithstanding that he well knew the circumstances in which it was to be carried out. He did not notify the deceased of what was in prospect for him and nor did he inform the police. His criminality is also to be measured to some extent by reference to the tragic consequences which flowed from his failure to do what he could to prevent the planned robbery from going ahead.  
     
      
    29 Nonetheless it is apparent that the trial judge has drawn a sharp distinction between the sentence which was imposed upon the applicant (namely one of 14 years) and those imposed upon his co-offenders Lo (30 years before the discount for factors which are absent in the applicant’s case) and Ng (35 years) respectively. Without passing any comment about the appropriateness of either of those sentences, what that differentiation demonstrates is that the applicant’s sentence has been significantly ameliorated to take into account in his favour the various matters which his Honour concluded had reduced his culpability for this very serious offence. It is accordingly clear that the trial judge imposed a sentence which had the effect of tempering the objective gravity of the applicant’s conduct by reason of his efforts to withdraw from the enterprise albeit that they were ultimately ineffective. See R v Wright (CCA unreported 8 July 1997). 
     
      
    30 In passing sentence, his Honour no doubt had regard to a submission made on the applicant’s behalf during the course of the sentence proceedings. The following exchange appears in the transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        HIGGINS: This is a matter where your Honour could impose a sentence on an accessory before the fact which is less than that received by one of the principals that being Mr Lo, despite a 40 per cent discount that he received for his assistance, age and cooperation generally with the police and plea of guilty that he received on sentence such that the total term for count 3 and 5 is capable of earning less than the 18 years imposed on Mr Lo. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You are saying that the starting point for Mr Lo which is obvious when you do the maths is 30 years. The starting point for your client should be considerably less because his actual intent was less culpable than that of Lo. 
        
       
       
        
        HIGGINS: Yes and one step further: not only considerably less but would not be more than 18 for its total term, being the total term for Lo. The level of culpability of Lew could not be greater than that of Lo even with a 40 per cent discount for all those various features. 
        
       
      
    31 The trial judge, as I have said, imposed an effective overall sentence of 15 years and thus appears, in the exercise of his discretion, to have acceded to counsel’s submission concerning the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    32 This was, on any view of the matter, a very difficult sentencing exercise. His Honour was confronted with a highly unusual set of circumstances and there were a number of factors to be carefully weighed in the balance. Prominent amongst those considerations was the need to properly reflect in the sentence to be imposed, recognition of the fact that the applicant had on the one hand endeavoured to withdraw from the common enterprise but on the other had ultimately been ineffective in preventing it from being carried out. 
     
      
    33 In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the challenge to the head sentence has been made good. The trial judge however imposed a non-parole period which was in excess of the statutory proportion of 75% provided for by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Indeed the effective overall non-parole period imposed upon the applicant was 80% of the total sentence. It is to be noted that the trial judge imposed an effective overall non-parole period of 75% in respect of the co-offender Ng having determined in his case that there were no “special circumstances” such as to warrant a departure from the statutory proportion. His Honour does not however appear to have considered this question in respect of the current applicant. Certainly his Honour did not indicate why he had chosen to impose a non-parole period which exceeded the statutory proportion. In failing to do so, I am of the view that his Honour has inadvertently fallen into error. In those circumstances I have come to the view that the court should intervene and substitute a shorter non-parole period. I am of the view that it is appropriate to make a finding of “special circumstances” in the applicant’s case by reason of the accumulation of the sentences which were imposed upon him. The adjustment will however be a modest one. In arriving at that conclusion, I have borne in mind the principles that govern the imposition of an appropriate non-parole period. See R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. 
     
      
    34 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Allow appeal against conviction for being an accessory before the fact to armed robbery on 22 May 2001. 
       
       
      2 Quash the conviction and sentence in relation thereto. 
       
       
      3 Refuse leave to appeal against the sentence imposed for being an accessory before the fact to attempted armed robbery on 14 May 2001. 
       
       
      4 Grant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed for being an accessory before the fact to murder. 
       
       
      5 Allow appeal (in part). 
       
       
      6 Confirm the total sentence but quash the non-parole period. 
       
       
      7 In lieu thereof fix a non-parole period of 10 years to commence on 5 July 2002 and to expire on 4 July 2012 at which time the applicant will be eligible for release to parole. The balance of the term of the sentence is thus 4 years. The sentence itself will expire on 4 July 2016.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Terrance James Price, is to be sentenced for the manslaughter on 10 February 2003 of Rockwell Montgomery Hodson. The deceased was a drug dealer who used to supply the offender with heroin. About ten days before the day of the deceased’s death the offender agreed to lend the deceased his mobile telephone and in return the deceased agreed to supply the offender with a quantity of heroin on every day on which he continued to have the telephone. Apparently there was no agreement about how long that arrangement should last. After about a week the offender asked for the telephone back but the deceased did not return it. The offender and a friend, Ms Lahema Richards, called on the deceased a number of times to ask for the return of the telephone. 
     
      
    2 On 2 February 2003 they went to his house. While the offender was out of the room an argument erupted between Ms Richards and the deceased over a debt and the deceased took Ms Richards’ handbag and made as if to keep it. They fought and the deceased pinned Ms Richards to the wall, his hands around her throat. The offender heard the commotion and re-entered the room. He saw what the deceased was doing. The fight ended with the offender and Ms Richards leaving and promising to return to collect the telephone. 
     
      
    3 On one of the occasions when the offender and Ms Richards visited the deceased, probably on 2 February, the deceased threatened to stab the offender and, according to a statement of Ms Richards, intimidated the offender. 
     
      
    4 They returned on 8 February and there was an argument. It was obvious that the deceased no longer had the telephone and the offender believed from something he had been told the day before that he had parted with possession of it. The offender demanded the return of the telephone or $200 in compensation. The deceased said that he would get $150 or the telephone. The conversation continued, but again the meeting ended unsatisfactorily, with the offender and Ms Richards saying that they would be back. 
     
      
    5 The offender, Ms Richards and the deceased spoke in the street in the early hours of 9 February, but there was no mention of the telephone and the conversation was peaceable. Later on the same day the offender went to the deceased’s house but the deceased was asleep and the offender left. 
     
      
    6 On 10 February the offender was riding his bicycle in the street and saw the deceased and his companion, Ms Kathy Mahina. The offender called out and walked across the street to speak to the deceased. He asked him for the money and the deceased refused to pay. The offender asked him if he could let him have $50. The deceased said he would pay him on the following day. A number of people saw the events that followed. One was Ms Mahina, another was Mr Broome, the proprietor of a local business, and a third was an off-duty police officer, Constable Smith. 
     
      
    7 Constable Smith had the best view and gives the clearest evidence of what happened. He was about three metres from the group comprising the offender, the deceased and Ms Mahina. The offender and the deceased were standing half a metre apart, arguing with voices raised. The deceased punched the offender in the head and the offender leaned back and pushed his bike towards the deceased. The offender took a knife from his shorts, drew it back past his head in his right hand until the forearm was parallel to the ground and the knife was pointing to the sky, then swung his arm forward, still having the knife in his clenched fist, and downwards towards the deceased’s chest. The knife penetrated the deceased’s chest and the offender stepped back. Then the deceased threw a bottle of drink that he had been holding, but it missed the offender. Of the three bystanders, Constable Smith was the only one to see the knife blow delivered and the only one who could say which of the knife thrust and the bottle-throwing came first. 
     
      
    8 The offender tried to get away, but Constable Smith and his companion stopped him and arrested him. They recovered the knife. 
     
      
    9 The knife was a sharp-bladed, pointed kitchen knife, having a blade about fifteen centimetres long. It penetrated the deceased’s chest to a depth of eleven centimetres. It damaged the lower edge of the first rib, entered the pericardial sac and perforated the aorta and the common pulmonary artery. The knife blow was delivered with considerable force. The deceased died within a few minutes. 
     
      
    10 The offender was committed to this Court on a charge of murder and his trial was fixed to begin on 19 April 2004. Shortly before that day he offered and the Crown accepted a plea of guilty of manslaughter in discharge of the indictment. However, the parties did not agree about the proper basis for a manslaughter conviction. The Crown submitted that the proper basis was excessive self-defence and the offender manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. The fact is, and the parties are agreed, that this difference may be resolved simply by deciding whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that when he stabbed the deceased the offender intended at least to cause him grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    11 The Crown tendered a statement of facts. It accords with the facts asserted in the statements of several witnesses which also came into evidence. The account I have set out above is taken primarily from the statement of facts. However, the offender gave evidence denying some of the assertions of fact and those I have omitted from the account I have given. As it turns out, the case is a clear one and there is no need for me to resolve those issues. 
     
      
    12 I am satisfied that by 10 February the offender had built up a strong feeling of resentment of the deceased for the way he had dealt with him over the telephone and for the way he had treated Ms Richards. I am satisfied from evidence adduced by the offender at committal that on one of the visits to the deceased’s house the deceased threatened in the presence of Ms Richards to stab the offender. 
     
      
    13 The evidence shows that the offender habitually carried a knife. I think that he carried the knife on the day the deceased died not only because he often or generally carried one, but because he had half a mind that he might use it. Although he had not formed an intention to attack the deceased with it, he carried it in case it should be needed. 
     
      
    14 The offender gave evidence. He said that he was looking at the deceased’s hands and saw that he had a bottle. He, the offender, had been attacked with a bottle once before and injured, so he was concerned. He said that he did not exactly recall the manner in which he had stabbed the deceased. He wanted to scare him off. He did not know whether the bottle was thrown before or after he stabbed him. He did not know he had stabbed him until he saw blood. 
     
      
    15 I do not accept that all the offender was trying to do was scare the deceased off. All that would have been necessary for that would have been for the offender to remove and present the knife. I do not accept that the offender did not know until he saw the blood that he had stabbed the deceased. I think that he knew as soon as the fight began what he was going to do and what he was doing. He stabbed the deceased because he meant to. 
     
      
    16 The efficient manner in which the offender took, raised and thrust the knife and the force with which the blow was delivered imply an intent no less than to do grievous bodily harm. That manner of the use of the weapon made it inevitable that the deceased would be very seriously hurt even if he was not killed. I do not think that the facts enable me to infer beyond reasonable doubt that there was an intention to kill, however. I conclude that the only available basis for a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter is, therefore, that there is a reasonable possibility that the offender believed it necessary to stab the deceased in order to defend himself but that there is no reasonable possibility that his conduct was reasonable in the circumstances as he perceived them: Crimes Act ss 418, 421. 
     
      
    17 The factors bearing on an objective assessment of the offender’s criminality are the dispute about the telephone, the fact that the offender approached the deceased and began the argument, a show of force first made by the deceased, the relative sizes of the two men and a comparison of the weapons that they respectively had available and the means and the intent with which the offender did the act causing death. 
     
      
    18 I need say no more about the first three matters. The offender is a fairly slim man of medium height. He was almost thirty years old at the time of these events. The deceased was taller and more heavily built. He was thirty-five years old. The deceased had only his fists and, if he wished to use it, the bottle to fight with. If he threw the bottle, of course, he would no longer be able to use it to fight. 
     
      
    19 Notwithstanding the evidence adduced on his behalf in the Local Court, the offender made no claim to any apprehension that the deceased might be armed with a knife. 
     
      
    20 I think that the offence was a serious one of its kind. It was the offender who approached the deceased. Even thought the first act of violence came from the deceased, the offender was by no means cornered and could easily have retreated. The court has often said that it is necessary to impose substantial sentences on offenders who use knives. The offender’s criminal history, incorporating as it does a number of convictions for carrying a knife and a number of custodial sentences, aggravates his criminality. 
     
      
    21 The offender grew up in a family of six children. His father was an alcoholic who became violent after drinking and the children’s mother had sometimes to take them to a refuge for their protection. The family remained together, however. The father was a strict disciplinarian. The offender did not do well in high school. He said that he was picked on because he was aboriginal. He left school without the school certificate. Since leaving school he has done a number of unskilled jobs, has spent periods of time on unemployment benefits and has been in custody a good deal. 
     
      
    22 He drank heavily when he was young but decided in 1997, after having been involved in a violent affray, that he would not drink any more. He does not now drink alcohol. In January 1992 he was sentenced to his first period of full-time detention and he appears to have spent the better part of 1992 in custody. While in gaol he began taking illegal drugs. He has resorted to them on and off ever since. Later on he turned to heroin to relieve himself against stress. 
     
      
    23 At the present time he is on a methadone programme but still uses heroin from time to time. 
     
      
    24 Since 1994 he has been convicted six times of having a knife or a cutting weapon or an offensive implement or of possessing ammunition. Four of the convictions relate to knives or cutting weapons, though there is no evidence that he has ever used such a weapon to injure. He has been sentenced to imprisonment on a number of occasions and appears to have spent a good part of the last ten years in custody. 
     
      
    25 Ms Vicki Gibbs, a psychologist, wrote a report, having examined him. She reports that he is not mentally ill and possesses intelligence in the broad average range. He is depressed, it seems in reaction to tragic circumstances that have overtaken friends and members of his family. He has a negative self-image. He is worried about the health of his parents, neither of whom is well. 
     
      
    26 He told Ms Gibbs that he would like to change, and I think that he was probably telling the truth. He will need enormous help if he is to change, however, because his pattern of life, of use of drugs and of offending is so well settled. There are prospects of rehabilitation, however, and he has the support of his family. 
     
      
    27 The offender is entitled to consideration for his plea of guilty. Although it came only a short time before his trial was due to commence, it came, as I understand it, virtually as soon as the Crown indicated that it was prepared to accept the plea to the lesser charge in discharge of the indictment. It is some evidence of contrition as well, though he has still not been able fully to acknowledge the part he played in his attack on the deceased or give a completely frank account of his offence. 
     
      
    28 Defence counsel acknowledged that the principles explained in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, that apply to some aboriginal offenders, do not apply in the present case. 
     
      
    29 I think that the special needs that the offender has to come to grips with his drug dependency and to establish a stable and more acceptable way of life gives rise to a need to impose a parole period which exceeds one-third of the non-parole period of the sentence that I shall impose. No doubt rehabilitation programmes will begin well before the commencement of his parole period, but it will be especially hard for him when he enters the community again. He will need professional intervention for a substantial time, I think. 
     
      
    30 Victim impact statements were tendered on behalf of Mrs Hodson, the mother of the deceased and Mrs Roberts, his sister. I have carefully read the statements. Mrs Hodson and Mrs Roberts have both been badly affected by the loss of their son and brother. Their hurt has been greater because of the violent circumstances in which he died. 
     
      
    31 Of course, the Court cannot take the resulting hurt into consideration in determining the sentence to be imposed on the offender. What the Court can do, and what it does, is extend its sympathy to Mrs Hodson and Mrs Roberts in their loss. It is to be hoped that their suffering may be relieved by these proceedings. 
     
      
    32 Terrance James Price, I set a non-parole period of five years. The balance of your sentence will be three years. Your sentence will be taken to have commenced on 10 February 2003 and you will become eligible for release on parole on 9 February 2008. Your sentence will expire on 9 February 2011.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: On 3 October 2003 the Applicant was sentenced by his Honour Patten DCJ to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years, each to date from 15 March 2003, for an offence of receiving, to which he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court.  
     
      
    2 The property in question consisted of a quantity of jewellery and a knife, which had previously been stolen from David Plummer, and which the Applicant acknowledged having received for the purpose of sale so as to finance the purchase of drugs. 
     
      
    3 On first blush the sentence might appear severe for a single offence of receiving in respect of which a plea of guilty had been offered. In that regard, counsel for the Applicant submits that error has been disclosed in that, while his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “he is to be sentenced for a crime, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for ten years, and although he is entitled to the benefit of his plea of guilty, there must, I think, be a significant custodial sentence imposed”,  
        
       
       
      the extent of that benefit or discount for it was not disclosed. 
       
      
    4 In my view, this is an application for leave to appeal that is devoid of merit for the following reasons:  
     
      
       
      (a) The sentencing judge was not bound to expressly quantify the discount so long as it was clear that the offender had the fact of the plea appropriately taken into account in his favour:  
      R v Thomson  
      (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at para 160 per Spigelman CJ, and  
      R v Deluca 
       [2002] NSWCCA 446 at para 15 per Bell J.  
       
       
        
        The observations of Howie J in  
        R v Sutton 
         [2004] NSWCCA 225 at paras 16 to 17, as to the desirability of judges nominating the utilitarian value of a plea were timely, in so far as such a disclosure is capable of reassuring offenders that their pleas have been properly taken into account, thereby potentially avoiding the incidence of appeals. His Honour’s remarks, however, expressly did not qualify what was decided in  
        Thomson 
        . Neither did the decisions in  
        R v Lloyd 
         [2003] NSWCCA 45 and  
        R v Young 
         [2003] NSWCCA 276 which were cited by the Applicant in argument.  
        
       
       
      (b) Where the discount is not nominated, then it becomes necessary, as it does here, for the Court to review the sentence as a whole in order to determine whether the plea was given sufficient weight and whether, for that reason or otherwise, it was manifestly excessive.  
       
       
      (c) In the present case, the sentence could not be said to have been manifestly excessive once it is appreciated that it was directed to be served concurrently with a sentence which, having been passed on 28 June 2002 for an offence of break and enter with intent to steal, had thereafter been converted from a suspended sentence to one of full-time custody for two years with a non-parole period of one year, commencing on 15 March 2003. That had occurred as a result of a number of subsequent offences which were dealt with in Local Courts between 28 June 2002 and the time of the Applicant’s arrest for the present offence. The effective result was to add two years to the overall head sentence and one year to the overall non-parole period. 
       
       
      (d) Moreover, the seriousness of the offence was aggravated by the fact that the Applicant had re-offended during a period of conditional liberty (see  
      R v Readman 
       (1990) 47 A Crim R 181,  
      R v Vranic  
      NSWCCA 7 May 1991 and s 21A(2)(j)  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ), and by the fact that he had a lengthy criminal record in New South Wales and Queensland for offences of dishonesty, as well as a history of anti-social behaviour, which had seen him serve a number of custodial sentences. 
       
       
      (e) While the motivation for the offences arose from the Applicant’s drug addiction, a problem which he had attempted but failed to address, that was a factor which provided a reason for the offending rather than a circumstance operating in mitigation.  
       
       
      (f) His Honour expressly did not overlook the support provided by the Applicant’s parents, his desire to secure rehabilitation, his remorse and insight, and the fact that his custodial condition might be somewhat harsh because of a prior conviction for escape. However, these were insufficient to overcome the significance of his earlier record and the fact of his re-offending while at conditional liberty, each of which matters were required to be taken into account under s 21A(2)(d) and (j). The favourable factors and the potential availability of employment were appropriately reflected in the finding of special circumstances which led to a significant reduction in the non-parole period.  
       
      
    5 I am not persuaded, once these circumstances are taken into account, that a lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been imposed (see s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 79-80 per Spigelman CJ and at para 100 per Sully J).  
     
      
    6 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    7 BARR J: I agree. 
     
      
    8 HOEBEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    9 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will, therefore, be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The Applicant was arraigned, on 28 April 2003, on an indictment containing three counts. The first was a count of causing his former partner Emma Semlitzky grievous bodily harm with intent to murder her. On the day that he appeared for trial, he pleaded not guilty to that charge, but guilty to an alternative count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm to that person with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm (s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900). That plea was accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment, to which there was also a plea of guilty to one count of maliciously wounding Christopher Robert Harper (s 35 of the Crimes Act).  
     
      
    2 The maximum available sentences for the two offences were imprisonment for 25 years and 7 years respectively.  
     
      
    3 The Applicant was sentenced on the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, to a head sentence of 10 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 7 years, and on the count of malicious wounding to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years. The sentences were directed to be served concurrently. 
     
      
       
      FACTS 
      
    4 On 11 October 2002, the Applicant entered the home of the victim, his former defacto partner, without her permission, at night, and contrary to the terms of an Apprehended Violence Order, which had been made against him on 30 January 2002 at the Windsor Local Court. He armed himself with a filleting knife which was 26 centimeters in length with a blade 21 centimeters in length. Using that knife he inflicted stab wounds to the chest, abdomen, left wrist and head of Emma Semlitzky resulting in a hemothorax, collapse of the lung, and damage to her transverse colon. She suffered some injuries to the head when the Applicant kicked her, as well as a compound fracture of the left wrist. 
     
      
    5 At Nepean Hospital she underwent operations and was discharged 18 October 2003. She later required further surgical treatment and suffers from a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder such that she can no longer carry out her normal duties and has been unable to sleep at night.  
     
      
    6 The attack upon her occurred while she was making a 000 call following an attack which the Applicant had already made on the other victim, who, during the course of the struggle initiated by the Applicant, was struck with a knife to the back of his head, opening up a wound that bled and required suturing. 
     
      
    7 A conversation was recorded on the answering machine while the attack on Emma Semlitzky took place. That recording has the Applicant making observations such as ""you fucked with the wrong person"", ""you are dead"", ""are you ready to die?"" ""you haven't let me see my daughter you cunt"", ""you are a goner, you are a fucking goner"", ""you fucking piece of shit"" and so on.  
     
      
    8 By the time of this offence, which his Honour noted occurred during the existence of an Apprehended Violence Order, the Applicant had acquired a number of prior convictions including convictions for violence, the most recent of which was an offence which had been dealt with in 1995 of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    9 The Applicant gave evidence in the course of the sentencing proceedings, in which he professed shame and disgust at what had occurred, recognised that he had a problem with anger management and alcohol, and also acknowledged having taken a knife from the kitchen in the victim's home before the attack on the two persons.  
     
      
    10 His mother gave evidence to suggest that he was remorseful, that he had been worried about his relationship with his daughter and that he had a history of difficulty with alcohol and drugs which had forced her, on one occasion, to take out an Apprehended Violence Order in relation to him.  
     
      
    11 The step father also gave evidence to show that the Applicant was a person who had been easily led and had acquired, at an early age, a problem with alcohol and gambling. 
     
      
    12 Evidence was tendered in the form of reports from Dr Westmore and Anita Duffy, each of which eliminated the presence of any significant mental illness, suggested that the Applicant was of average intellectual capacity, and noted that he had a problem with alcohol and that he would benefit from counselling. Ms Duffy noted that he appeared to be suffering from a degree of depression. Dr Westmore recorded him as being a ""distressed person"". 
     
      
       
      THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
      
    13 The Applicant appeared before us in person and seeks leave to appeal his Honour's sentence upon a number of grounds, one of which might have been taken to be a request to have his conviction, for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, set aside, upon the basis that he had been misled into offering a plea in response to an assurance that he would receive a 25 percent discount for a plea, and could expect a three to four year non-parole period. He has, however, this morning, indicated that he does not seek leave to appeal against the conviction, rather his appeal is confined to the question of sentence. 
     
      
    14 The remaining grounds largely turn upon the proposition that he received poor legal representation, with the result that various matters, that may have assisted him in relation to sentence, were not placed before the Court. In summary his complaints in this regard involve assertions that: 
     
      
       
      (a) He only saw his counsel for 30 minutes on the day of the sentence hearing; 
       
       
      (b) His counsel did not place before the judge the following facts: 
       
       
        
        (i) that he had notified police of his concerns that the victim Harper had been guilty of child abuse in relation to his daughter; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) that he had, at various times, contacted the Police, DOCS, Legal Aid, the Salvation Army, a Chamber Magistrate, Family Law specialists and a Family Law Registrar to complain of the abuse or at least to seek some assistance in relation to it; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) that he had only entered the victim’s home after hearing his daughter crying; and, 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) that he had made various attempts to discuss, with his former partner, his concerns in relation to their daughter or to secure a meeting through one or other of the agencies that may have been in a position to assist. 
        
       
       
      (c) His counsel had failed to tender: 
       
       
        
        (i) a 16 page letter which he had prepared; and  
        
       
      (ii) a letter and affidavit from his mother. 
       
       
      (d) His representatives had not asked for a pre-sentence report, which may have been beneficial, had one been prepared; 
       
       
      (e) they did not obtain copies of the medical reports in respect of the various knife wounds which, had they been procured, would have shown, on his account, that the wounds were not significant; 
       
       
      (f) the statement of the facts which was tendered had been altered by them without his approval; and 
       
       
      (g) objection had not been taken to the tender of the transcript of the conversation, between himself and the Ms Semlitzky, which happened to have been recorded on the answering service, while the telephone line was open during the course of the 000 call. 
       
      
    15 Additionally, it is contended that his Honour erred in so far as: 
     
      
      (a) He found that the offences occurred without provocation, and also in so far as he found that the injuries to Ms Semlitzsky’s arm were occasioned when the Applicant jumped up and down on it, as distinct from occurring when she fell to the ground 
       
       
      (b) The discount for the plea was only 10 percent, which was an insignificant reduction for the utilitarian value of the plea. 
       
       
      (c) No discount was given for the fact that he surrendered himself to the police, and had done so after being turned away from the police station that he first attended. 
       
       
      (d) No consideration was given for the fact that he would serve the sentence on protection. 
       
       
      (e) Insufficient weight was given to the gap between the present offences and his prior offending, a matter which was said by him to be suggestive of the fact that the offending was out of character. 
       
       
      (f) Insufficient weight was given to the state of his mental health, in so far as there was a difference between Dr Westmore and Anita Duffy which, on his account, may have been reconciled in his favour had a further psychiatrist been qualified and provided a report, and, 
       
       
      (g) The case was not one that was an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. 
       
      
    16 Finally, it is contended that the Applicant observed the victim Harper looking at him through the doorway which is used by judges to enter the court room, that being suggestive, on his account, of some improper contact having occurred between the victim and his Honour.  
     
      
    17 Affidavits have been filed for the appeal from Ms Winston in relation to the state of the Applicant's custody; from counsel who appeared for the Applicant at trial, and from the solicitor who had the carriage of the matter. A statement from Mr Harper has also been tendered. Together they answer most, if not all, of the various grounds which have been argued and tend to show, at least in some respects, that the Applicant has been sparing with the truth. 
     
      
       
      Should Leave to Appeal be Granted? 
       
      
    18 I turn first to what initially appeared to have been an attempt to go behind the plea for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, with intent. The acceptance of the plea in full discharge of a more serious count, it may be noted, was very much in the Applicant's favour. Although, the Applicant does not now seek to go behind that plea, I think it appropriate to note that the circumstances in which an application can be made to set aside a conviction after a plea has been accepted, and a sentence imposed are very limited. Having regard to the facts in this case, I am satisfied that it is not a case which could be said to have come within the area of improper pressure, from legal representatives, that was considered in R v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 and R v GB [2002] NSWCCA 11.  
     
      
    19 The relevant principles which apply in this context are those set out in R v Toro-Martinez [2000] NSWCCA 216, which was applied by this court in R v Cooney [2004] NSWCCA 255.  
     
      
    20 However, since the point is not now taken I leave it aside and turn to the remaining grounds which were argued. 
     
      
    21 First, the evidence of Ms Winston shows that the Applicant's custody will not be any more onerous than that for a main stream prisoner. He has been held in the Junee Correctional Centre as a Special Management Placement Prisoner at his own request. As such he is not on segregation, and he has access to the programmes and facilities which are there available. His classification is not affected by the placement. The case is, therefore, not one that, within the principles discussed in R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 and R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 28, calls for any reduction of the sentence or for a finding of special circumstance on this account. 
     
      
    22 Secondly, Mr Harper has provided a statement denying that he ever entered the area reserved for judges, or that he was in the courtroom other than in his balcony. 
     
      
    23 Thirdly, there is no possible issue concerning the extent and severity of the wounds that were occasioned to Ms Semlitzsky and it is somewhat surprising for the Applicant to suggest that the medical reports may have shown they were any less severe than as earlier described. The precise circumstances in which the arm injury was occasioned do not appear to me be of any great moment. Whether it was inflicted by the Applicant stomping upon the victim, or by her being forced to the ground in the course of a knife attack, the criminality involved would be equally serious. In any case, this court is a court of error. It is not open to it to review contested facts or findings where there is evidence available, as there was in this case, to support the finding made. 
     
      
    24 Fourthly, there is no basis for the submission that a presentence report would have assisted the Applicant. He had a bad prior record, he had detailed psychiatric and psychological reports placed before the Court, and he had evidence from his mother and step father which comprehensively dealt with his subbjective circumstances. The case is not one where any tangible benefit in the provision of a presentence report has been demonstrated. It clearly was a matter taken into account by the Applicant’s legal advisors who were content to place before the Court the more detailed information, which was available from the sources mentioned. 
     
      
    25 Fifthly, the Applicant was not entitled to any discount for having handed himself in to a police station. He was wanted for the offences, his identity was known and his arrest was inevitable. 
     
      
    26 Sixthly, the evidence obtained from the answering machine was properly admissible under s 12(2)(d) of the Listening Devices Act 1984. 
     
      
    27 Seventhly, the case was one that was eminently suitable for a significant element of general deterrence to be built into the sentence, for the reasons which were identified in R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436. 
     
      
    28 Eighthly, as appears from the transcript of 3 October the reason that the 16 page letter was not tendered was that the Applicant had not brought it with him. Counsel did his best thereafter to give him a full opportunity to deal with such matters as had been referred to in that letter and to advance any matter that he wished to put. As appears from the affidavits, a forensic decision was made that the preferable approach was not to seek to justify the offence but to address his thoughts about the offence, his remorse and his appreciation of the effects of the offence on the victims. It is simply untrue for the Applicant to assert, as he did, that counsel ignored his directions in relation to this letter. 
     
      
    29 Ninethly, the Applicant's mother was called to give evidence. There is no reason to suppose that anything which may have been contained in the letter, or affidavit, was not placed before his Honour. In this regard the solicitor has said that the matter was discussed with the Applicant, and in the course thereof, he confirmed his instructions that she should give evidence directly rather than via the documents. 
     
      
    30 Tenthly, so far as an allegation is made that the statement of facts was inappropriately amended, or amended without his authority, it may be noted that the document which was signed has a single alteration which changed the word ""they"" in the sentence ""they resided at 4 Wilcox Drive, Richmond"" to ""she resided"" at that address. The ""she"" in question was the victim. I am unable to see how that could have had any relevance whatsoever in relation to the objective severity of the offence. 
     
      
    31 Eleventhly, as appears from the affidavit of counsel, as well as from the affidavit of the solicitor, the argument that evidence concerning the Applicant's approaches to the various agencies mentioned, was not placed before the Court is not supported by the documents which were subpoenaed from the Windsor Police, the Department of Community Services, the Salvation Army and the Commissioner of Police. In those circumstances it is difficult to understand what could have been placed relevantly before his Honour, or indeed what relevance it would have had. It is perfectly plain, as will be noted later, that these offences arose out of a dispute concerning custody and access of a child. 
     
      
    32 Twelvethly, the observations as to the lack of provocation which appear in the reasons for sentence were obviously directed to the period immediately preceding the offences. That is plain from the terms of the relevant passage in the sentencing remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown makes a valid submission that it was a case of an immediate attack, there was no provocation, there was nothing, no behaviour emanating from the two victims whatever to merit a sudden attack with a carving knife. And if he had some obsessive worry about Mr Harper taking over his role as father of the child, then why having attacked Mr Harper did he turn his attention to Emma and strike her with six knife blows and then another eight blows to the wall.” 
        
       
      
    33 Any suggestion that the Applicant had been provoked by the conduct of either victim, on the occasion of his attendance at Ms Semlitzky’s home, would have been comprehensively contradicted by the available evidence as to the events which unfolded and by the violent words of the Applicant captured on the answering machine.  
     
      
    34 It is clear that the sentencing judge was not unaware of the wider history of the relationship since that was referred to in some little depth in the histories taken by Dr Westmore and by Ms Duffy. It is true, when those documents were tendered, objection was taken to them being used other than as a basis for their expert opinions. So far as there was any difference in their opinions, it was one of only a minor degree, involving a distinction between depression and anxiety and a distressed state. 
     
      
    35 His Honour noted the substance of their opinions as well as the fact that the Applicant had been worried about his daughter. Assuming in his favour that the Applicant had genuine concerns for the welfare of his daughter, as distinct from a desire to have his own will so far as she was concerned, his response and his resort to violence would not have been mitigated by that circumstance. As I indicated in Edigarov this kind of dispute is not to be settled by personal violence. There is a time and a place for custody and access issues to be resolved and that has to be confined to the justice system. 
     
      
    36 In any event his Honour made it clear that Ms Duffy’s assessment of him was taken into account in relation to the finding of special circumstances that was made.  
     
      
    37 Thirteenthly, the gap between these offences and the prior offences was not particularly significant given the nature of the offending involved and the poor record of the Applicant. It cannot have seriously been put to his Honour that he did not have a problem with alcohol and anger management, or that the offence was out of character. 
     
      
    38 Fourteenthly, so far as the Applicant seeks to demonstrate appellable error in relation to the alleged incompetency of his legal advisors, he needs to bring himself within the principles determined in this Court in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. In my view he has singularly failed in that attempt, having regard to the affidavits which have been filed by his counsel and solicitor, which indicate that counsel was provided with a full brief, and which also indicate that the solicitor attended conferences with him, on a number of dates both at the Penrith District Court, and at the Remand Centre, between July 2003 and October 2003. 
     
      
    39 So far as it has been suggested, additionally, that he was misled in relation to the plea, that was directly contradicted by the solicitor, who has said that it is incorrect for any allegation to be made that he assured the Applicant that he would receive a three or four year non-parole period.  
     
      
    40 As I have indicated the decision which was made at trial was to not to seek to justify the conduct, which would have been a fruitless exercise, but rather, to concentrate on matters of remorse, contrition and insight. That decision was a justifiable and understandable tactical approach to the sentencing exercise, and I am not persuaded that any error was made in that regard, of the kind that would attract intervention. 
     
      
    41 There is one matter, however, which seems to me to be of concern. That relates to his Honour's assessment that the plea was not an early plea, and that a 10 percent discount was properly to be given in relation to it, that being a discount at the lower end of the range suggested in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  
     
      
    42 The fact is that the Applicant had indicated a willingness, at a much earlier date, to plead guilty to the alternative count, as well as to the remaining count, as is confirmed in the report of Dr Westmore which was dated 6 December 2002.  
     
      
    43 His Honour acknowledged that the Applicant was entitled to consideration for having avoided the need for Ms Semlitzky to give evidence, and that the plea had been entered into after discussion and agreement between counsel as to the agreed facts.  
     
      
    44 Erroneously, in view of the long line of decisions in this court, he said, in relation to the plea “the Crown makes the valid point that it was an extremely strong Crown case”. District Court Judges must recognize that the strength of the Crown case is irrelevant in this context, a point that was made with considerable strength in R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225.  
     
      
    45 The case is one in which it seems to me that once it became clear that the Crown would accept the plea to the alternative count then that should have been taken into account. The plea should not have been regarded as a late plea for the reasons identified in R v Dibb [2003] NSWCCA 117. Nor should its utility have been devalued because of an assessment that the Crown case was strong. In my view a discount within the range of 15 to 20 percent was justified.  
     
      
    46 That is a circumstance which justifies leave to appeal being granted and also justifies some reduction in the sentence. Otherwise, however, I am satisfied that the offences were such as to merit the imposition of very substantial period of full-time custody for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
      (a) They involved a substantial amount of actual violence in a domestic setting, a matter of relevance having regard to the decision in  
      Edigarov,  
      which I have previously mentioned and also s 21A(2)(b) of the  
      Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) They involved the use of a knife, a matter which this Court has indicated, repeatedly, includes a form of conduct which the community regards with the greatest of abhorrence, see  
      R v Doorey 
       [2000] NSWCCA 456, see also 22A(2)(c) of the Act; 
       
       
      (c) The Applicant had a record of previous convictions such as to indicate that particular weight needed to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and protection of the community: See  
      R v Johnson 
       [2004] NSWCCA 76; 
       
       
      (d) The injury and emotional harm caused by the offences were serious: S 21A(2)(g); 
       
       
      (e) The offences were committed at night. 
       
       
      (f) The offences were committed in the home of one of the victims: see  
      R v Lardner 
       NSWCCA 10 September 1998, and  
      R v Pearson 
       (2002) 137 A Crim R 419;  
       
       
      (g) The Applicant asked that offences of contravening an Apprehended Violence Order, and possession of a prohibited weapon without a permit, be taken into account on a form 1, thereby necessitating the imposition of additional imprisonment, for the reasons discussed in  
      Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 
       (2002) 137 A Crim R 180 at paras 40 to 42; 
       
       
      (h) His Honour was required to impose a sentence that properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offence:  
      R v Hayes 
       [2001] NSWCCA 358 and  
      R v Rushby 
       [1977] 1 NSWLR 594; and, 
       
       
      (i) The imposition of wholly concurrent sentences for the offences was favorable to the Applicant, having regard to the principles of totality noted in  
      Pearce v the Queen 
       (1998) 194 CLR 610 such that his Honour would have been fully within his rights in imposing a sentence that was at least partially accumulative, having regard to the fact there was more than one victim: See  
      R v Cotter 
       [2003] NSWCCA 273 and  
      R v K M and others 
       [2004] NSWCCA 65. 
       
      
    47 While I would not interfere with the sentence in relation to the count of malicious wounding of Christopher Harper, I am of the view that there should be some reduction both of the term of sentence, and of the non-parole period, in relation to the count of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent. I propose the following orders in relation to that count: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      2. Appeal allowed. 
       
      3. Sentence quashed, and in lieu thereof the Applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years to commence on 12 October 2002, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months, to date from 12 October 2002, and to expire on 11 January 2009. The earliest date, therefore, on which the Applicant would be eligible for release on parole would be 11 January 2009. 
       
      
    48 BARR J: I agree. 
     
      
    49 HOEBEN J: I agree.  
     
      
    50 WOOD CJ at CL:  The order of the Court will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Respondent was a Detective Sergeant of the New South Wales Police Service. On 8 April 2004 he pleaded guilty to the most serious of six counts on an indictment which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. The charge to which he pleaded guilty was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 27 April 2003 and 25 July 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales he did pursue a course of conduct in order to procure Steven Ho to plead guilty to a charge of ‘goods in custody’ knowing that Steven Ho was not guilty of the charge with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice.” 
        
       
      
    2 The man Steven Ho referred to in the charge was related to Huong Nguyen, the Respondent’s wife. 
     
      
    3 The offence is created by s319 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    4 27 April 2003, the date on which the course of conduct constituting the offence to which the Respondent pleaded guilty commenced, was the day on which Huong Nguyen, a flight attendant with Vietnam Airlines, arrived at Sydney International Airport to perform her duties on a departing Vietnam Airlines flight. Customs officers searched her hand luggage and found ten mobile phones. During the course of the search Huong Nguyen’s personal mobile phone was contacted on about five occasions. Ms Nguyen disclosed that the caller was her husband and identified him as a New South Wales police officer. 
     
      
    5 On 28 April 2003 Customs officials provided advice to the Special Crime and Internal Affairs Command and an investigation was launched. Inquiries confirmed that four of the handsets were stolen.  
     
      
    6 The Respondent apprehended that his wife’s involvement could impact on her application for residency in Australia. 
     
      
    7 Between 28 and 29 April 2003, the Respondent made contact with Customs officers in an attempt to claim the mobile phones, allegedly on behalf of the owner. Customs provided advice to the Respondent that if the mobile telephones were not now leaving Australia, they could be collected pending the presentation to Customs of proof of ownership, an authority from Huong Nguyen, together with identification of the persons claiming the mobile phones. This advice was provided despite the fact that Customs officials had referred the matter to police and despite the fact that at least four of the mobile phones were confirmed as being stolen. 
     
      
    8 On 29 April 2003 the Respondent made arrangements with a Customs officer to have the IMEI numbers for the phones faxed to him claiming that the owner needed the IMEI numbers in order to find the correct receipts. He said the owner was a “Mr Tran”, but claimed not to know his contact number. Customs complied with the request. 
     
      
    9 On 28 and 29 April 2003 the Respondent contacted Steven Ho on a number of occasions. Mr Ho had family links to Huong Nguyen when she lived in Vietnam. He had previously been the operator of a mobile telephone business called Baulkham Hills Cellular World. During those conversations the Respondent persuaded Mr Ho to pretend that he was the owner of the mobile phones.  
     
      
    10 Mr Ho had no prior knowledge of the telephones. He was asked to fabricate receipts for them, but refused. He provided information about his business that allowed the Respondent himself to prepare false receipts. The Respondent told Mr Ho that the mobile phones had been given to his wife by a third person, who could no longer be found and reassured Mr Ho that the phones were not stolen. 
     
      
    11 During the course of 28 and 29 April the Respondent prepared a permission slip from Huong Nguyen and two documents purporting to be receipts for the mobile phones. At about 5pm on 29 April 2003 he met Mr Ho and took him to Sydney International Airport. On the way he showed Mr Ho the false receipts and advised him to pretend to Customs officers that he could not speak English. In fact Mr Ho spoke English, although poorly. 
     
      
    12 The Respondent and Mr Ho attended at Customs at the airport and the Respondent purported to be there as a translator. The receipts and other documentation were handed to the Customs officer and both men provided identification. Shortly after, by prior arrangement with Customs, two detectives from the Botany Bay Local Area Command came in to pursue their investigation. I will set out the events in greater detail below. It is sufficient to note certain matters at this stage. The detective informed the Respondent that some of the mobiles were stolen. In discussions that took place the Respondent denied any knowledge of the phones, or links with the business associated with the receipts, and affirmed his role as a translator only. Mr Ho was arrested. The Respondent took Detective Sergeant Richardson aside and informed him that he was a police officer and reaffirmed his role as a translator who was assisting a friend. 
     
      
    13 Following his arrest Mr Ho was taken to Mascot Police Station where he declined to participate in any further questioning. He was charged with having goods in custody and with receiving. He was granted bail. The Respondent provided Mr Ho with money for a taxi. 
     
      
    14 In telephone conversations, that were lawfully intercepted, the Respondent arranged a meeting between Mr Ho and his legal representatives and undertook to pay the legal fees of Mr Ho. Mr Ho indicated that he was scared of going to prison but the Respondent assured him that no one would go to prison over such a small matter. 
     
      
    15 On 5 August 2003 Mr Ho participated in an induced statement with police, and as a result proceedings against him were withdrawn. 
     
      
    16 On 25 August 2003 the Respondent was arrested and charged. He declined to participate in an interview with police. 
     
      
    17 Ellis DCJ, in his remarks on sentence, found that between 27 April 2003 and 30 May 2003 Huong Nguyen was in Vietnam. His Honour found that during the course of that visit she was subject to threats when she failed to produce the mobile phones to the intended recipients in Vietnam. His Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would appear that Mrs Nguyen’s explanation was not accepted by the intended recipients in Vietnam and I accept that the offender’s wife was very scared and that she conveyed her fears to her husband …” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour also made the following findings of fact: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner gave evidence that when he was told by police that four of the mobile phones were stolen that he panicked, that he was scared for himself because of his position as a police officer, and scared for his wife because of the issue of her current application for permanent residency. He gave evidence that apart from providing a cab fare on one occasion and undertaking to pay the legal fees, that he provided no money to Mr Ho and indeed offered no other money to Mr Ho. I accept his evidence in that regard. I also accept his evidence that he never threatened Mr Ho but he acknowledges that he continued to request or pressure Mr Ho to go along with the scam and that when Mr Ho changed his mind he pressed him to continue to accept the plea of guilty. But I accept that ultimately he told Mr Ho that Mr Ho had to do what he believed to be right and that on Mr Ho’s declining to continue with the plea he did not in fact attempt to further pressure him, threaten him or provide him with a bribe of some type.” 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour further found:  
     
      
       
        
        “I accept his explanation that his motivation was fear for his wife’s safety, concern about the impact on her Australian residency application, and concern about his career being jeopardised.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour also made the following findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find as a matter of fact that this offender used his friendship with Steven Ho to encourage or pressure Steven Ho to plead guilty. It is clear to the Court that the offender did not use violence nor threaten Mr Ho in any manner at all. The Court finds that the offender did not abuse or misuse his position as a police officer in any manner at all, this is not a case involving corrupt conduct by a police officer. This is the case of a person who happens to be a police officer committing an offence in his private capacity. That this offender was a police officer is no more relevant other than subjectively, than it would have been had he been a bank manager or a plumber. The Court finds that the offender did not stand to and did not personally gain at all from his offending conduct. The Court finds that the offender was motivated purely by his desire to protect his wife against the possibility of physical violence when she was in Vietnam, and in relation to the jeopardising of her application for Australian residency. The Court agrees with the psychologist’s conclusion that the offender’s loyalty to his wife created a panic reaction which substantially impaired his otherwise reasonably sound judgment.” 
        
       
      
    21 Ellis DCJ referred to the range of specific offences associated with interference with the course of justice found in s314 to s326 of the Crimes Act. He described s319 as being “intended to otherwise cover the field of potential perversions of the course of justice”. On this basis he described it as “a protean crime the continuum of criminality that reveals offences calling for sentences and imprisonment towards the upper range of the maximum penalty at one extreme, and offences calling for non-custodial punishment at the other”. His Honour went on to refer to the “nearly limitless potential factual circumstances that could constitute a general offence of perverting the course of justice”.  
     
      
    22 His Honour referred to the importance of the protection of legal proceedings and the need to punish an offender and to deter others. He acknowledged the authorities which establish that corrupt conduct by police officers in the course of their duties and corrupt conduct by individuals motivated by self-gain will lead to sentences of full time imprisonment. His Honour accepted that a case involving police corruption, i.e. by a police officer in the course of his duties, and offences motivated by personal gain would call for a sentence of full time imprisonment. His Honour did not regard the circumstances of this case as falling within either category. 
     
      
    23 His Honour stated that he assessed the criminality of the Respondent as being within “the lower to mid range of seriousness for offences” within s319. Nevertheless he said that this was “an extremely serious offence that at least prima facie calls for a sentence of full time imprisonment”. His Honour reiterated the significance of general deterrence in sentencing for offences of this character, the need to protect the community and to denounce such conduct. 
     
      
    24 He noted that there were no applicable aggravating features from the list contained in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He identified a range of mitigating factors in the personal circumstances of the Respondent.  
     
      
    25 The Respondent is a man of 30 years of age with no prior criminal convictions and of good character. His Honour formed the view that he was “unlikely to re-offend, has good prospects of rehabilitation, has shown remorse and is prepared to make reparation in the sense that he has indicated preparedness to pay for the legal fees of Mr Ho”. His Honour also referred to the plea of guilty, the utilitarian value of which he assessed at the top of the range identified in judgments of this Court. 
     
      
    26 Ellis DCJ went on to refer to s5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) which requires the Court to consider all sentencing alternatives and to conclude that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. His Honour did conclude that in this case no penalty other than imprisonment would be appropriate, in view of the range of sentencing objectives that needed to be served, including punishment and specific and general deterrence.  
     
      
    27 His Honour noted that because of the offender’s background as a policeman he could be at risk in a periodic detention environment, referring to the report from the Probation and Parole Service. He also referred to a psychologist’s report that expressed the opinion that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is a serious, responsible young man with traditional values whose actions in this offence were out of character and against his usual decision-making. It was noted that the offender was deeply ashamed, regretful of his behaviour and offered the view that he has let his parents and work colleagues down very badly.” 
        
       
      
    28 His Honour referred to the evidence of the Respondent, which he generally accepted. He set out the personal background of the offender. His Honour noted his contribution to the police force, particularly in the Asian Crime Squad and as a Detective Sergeant in the South East Asian Crimes Squad. It is unnecessary to set out his Honour’s observations in full. It is sufficient to say that the Respondent’s background is entirely without blemish and reflects the achievement of a competent young man who has been, and remains capable of being, a useful and important citizen.  
     
      
    29 His Honour noted the Respondent’s fear of being imprisoned, particularly the possibility of coming into contact with Asian gang members who, as one of the few Asian detectives in the New South Wales Police Force, he had been responsible for arresting, and also with members of a number of Lebanese criminal gangs. In particular he referred to his work as an undercover operative. His Honour noted that in these circumstances it was inevitable that the Respondent would be placed on strict protective custody with limited opportunity to participate in programs available in the prison. His imprisonment would be far harsher than otherwise would be the case. On this appeal the Crown has not sought to challenge the reliance Ellis DCJ placed on such allegedly harsher conditions of incarceration (cf R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97 at [179]-[180]; R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 at [176]-[177]). 
     
      
    30 His Honour summarised the Respondent’s position in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “… As a consequence of committing this offence, the offender has lost a successful and promising career as a police officer. He has lost the respect and regard that is, a loss of face of his work colleagues, the Vietnamese community, his family and friends, and he has lost financially through lost income and legal expenses for himself and those he has undertaken to pay on behalf of Mr Ho.” 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour did draw the conclusion that “no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate” and imposed a sentence of two years and six months which, by reason of the plea, was reduced to a period of one year and ten months. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the exceptional subjective features of the offender, the punishment and penalties already suffered by the offender, that the offender is unlikely to re-offend, that he has excellent prospects of rehabilitation and that it is inappropriate to send the offender to gaol for the first time, especially as any such sentence would need to be served on protective custody, the court has concluded that the sentence should be suspended.” 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour noted that a suspended sentence is still capable of reflecting both general and specific deterrence and referred to R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. 
     
      
    33 His Honour imposed the sentence and suspended it pursuant to s12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, on condition that the Respondent enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    34 The Crown appeals from what it submits is the manifest inadequacy of the sentence. It submitted that any sentence other than full time custody was inappropriate in all the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    35 The Crown submitted that the offence was carried out in a calculated manner: approaching Mr Ho to assist; preparing false documents; knowing the documents to be false, using them in approaches to Customs officials; persuading Mr Ho to pretend to be unable to speak English and explaining his own presence as an interpreter; permitting Mr Ho to be charged with an offence which he knew he had not committed and pressuring him to plead guilty. 
     
      
    36 The Crown submitted that specific legal error occurred by his Honour’s failure to treat the fact that the Respondent was a serving police officer as a matter of aggravation. It also submitted that his Honour’s characterisation of the criminality as “low to medium” in the range was an error. Finally, it submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate in the requisite sense. 
     
      
    37 I have extracted above the passage from his Honour’s remarks on sentence in which his Honour dismissed as irrelevant the fact that the Respondent was a police officer. His Honour emphasised that this offence was not committed in the course of duty, but in a “private capacity”. In my opinion, his Honour’s analysis is flawed.  
     
      
    38 The fact that the offence of perverting the course of justice is committed by a person directly involved in the administration of justice is a relevant consideration, even if the conduct does not occur in the course of that person’s official duty. Furthermore, it is not accurate to say, with respect to the present case, that the Respondent’s status as a police officer had nothing to do with the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    39 There is authority in this Court to the effect that it is relevant that a person who commits an offence with respect to the administration of justice is a police officer. In R v Chapman (NSWCCA, unreported, 21 May 1998) the Court was concerned with a charge of making a false statement on oath, contrary to s330 of the Crimes Act 1900. The Respondent to a Crown appeal was a police officer who had shot a deer in a national park. In the course of giving evidence in the Local Court, with respect to a contravention of the National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974, the Respondent had denied that he went to the national park with a rifle. Two weeks after that evidence it was clearly established that he had taken his rifle to the national park. 
     
      
    40 Simpson J, with whom Studdert and Newman JJ agreed, said in the course of dealing with a Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Another matter argued by the Crown concerned the circumstances that the Respondent was, at the time he gave his evidence, a serving police officer. The Crown argued that this was a factor calling for more severe penalty. On behalf of the Respondent it was argued that, as he was charged, and gave evidence, in his private capacity, that fact should not operate against him on sentence. I do not agree. Those concerned in the administration of the law must be taken to appreciate the supreme importance of truthful evidence being given in judicial proceedings. The Respondent did not cease being a police officer, or carrying out the duties and responsibilities, and having the privileges of that office, because these events arose out of recreational and not professional activities. He must be taken to have known, better than most, how important the curial procedure is, and with what respect it must be treated. 
        
       
       
        
        These matters all tended to severity rather than leniency.” 
        
       
      
    41 Later in her judgment, her Honour reiterated the proposition when she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that the Respondent was a serving police officer underlines the seriousness of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    42 This reasoning is applicable to the present case. There are a number of other authorities to similar effect. (See Fox & Frieberg Sentencing: State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed) Oxford Uni P, Melbourne, 1999 at [3.622]; note particularly the unreported Victorian case of R v Edwards (Victorian Full Court, unreported, 6 October 1981) discussed in Fox & Frieberg. See also R v Moyse (1988) 38 A Crim R 169 esp at 171-172, 176, 177; R v Wright (No 2) [1968] VR 174 at 181 lines 15-40; R v Whelan [1997] VSCA 232 at 4; R v Pilarinos [2001] VSCA 9 at [15]-[16].) 
     
      
    43 One of the purposes of sentencing is the denunciation of the conduct in which an offender has engaged. This purpose is now expressly stated in s3A(f) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. In my opinion, the fact that a person, like a police officer, who is directly involved in the administration of justice acts in a way that perverts the course of justice means that the object of denunciation is entitled to greater weight in the sentencing exercise than it is in the case of other offenders.  
     
      
    44 For these reasons his Honour erred in proceeding on the basis that the fact that the Respondent was a police officer was irrelevant to the sentencing exercise because the conduct occurred in a private capacity rather than in any official capacity. 
     
      
    45 Furthermore, as I have indicated above, the Respondent’s position as a police officer was not entirely irrelevant to the circumstances of the offence. I put to one side the fact that the false documents were concocted on a Police Service computer at the Cabramatta Police Station, during the period when the Respondent was attending to his operational duties and the fact that he used a covert police vehicle to transport himself and Mr Ho to Sydney International Airport. I set these matters aside, although they are pertinent background facts, because they did not constitute conduct involved in the course of committing the offence to which he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    46 As noted above, the Respondent presented himself as an interpreter for Mr Ho in an attempt to deceive Customs officials with respect to the provenance of the mobile phones. It was during the interview between police officers and Mr Ho and the Respondent at the airport that he became aware of the fact that a number of the mobile phones were in fact stolen. He realised immediately that the situation was more serious than he anticipated. I have quoted above his Honour’s finding of fact that at this time the Respondent panicked and became scared both for himself “because of his position as a police officer” and for his wife, because of her application for permanent residency.  
     
      
    47 Contrary to the Crown submissions made to this Court, the actual offence for which he was convicted was an offence which was spontaneous. The degree of planning and pre-meditation that went into the preparation of the documents and the arrangement for Mr Ho to appear was not a form of pre-meditation that is pertinent for the sentencing exercise for the offence to which he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    48 It was in this context that he informed the police officers who had interviewed Mr Ho that he was a Sergeant with the New South Wales Police. After indicating that fact to the investigating police, he reaffirmed his role as a mere translator and permitted the arrest of Mr Ho to continue.  
     
      
    49 Mr D Fagan SC who appeared for the Respondent submitted that as nothing was put to the Respondent in his cross-examination that he was using his status as a police officer in order to ensure that the matter proceeded against Mr Ho personally, it cannot be said that he must have understood that that was what he was doing. That may be so. The fact remains that he informed the police officers of the fact of his occupation and permitted the matter to proceed in the light of that knowledge. 
     
      
    50 Furthermore, the evidence before the sentencing judge included a number of intercepted conversations in one of which Mr Ho told the Respondent that his barrister advised him that he would, as a result of pleading guilty to the offence, have a record and that he may be imprisoned. The Respondent assured Mr Ho that “no-one will go to prison because of a small matter like that”. In this respect he was using his knowledge of the criminal justice system in a manner calculated to convince Mr Ho to continue with the course of conduct in which he had embroiled him. 
     
      
    51 For these reason also, in my opinion, the sentencing judge erred when he proceeded on the basis that the Respondent’s status was an irrelevant factor in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    52 The Crown also relied on the proposition that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and drew particular attention to the sentencing judge’s characterisation of the criminality of the offender in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court has assessed the criminality of this offender as being within the lower to mid range of seriousness for offences that fall within the ambit of s319.” 
        
       
      
    53 In this part of his reasons, his Honour appeared to be referring only to the objective gravity of the offence. It was later in his remarks on sentence that his Honour outlined the strength of the Respondent’s subjective case. On any view an offence in the “mid range of seriousness” of offences under s319 would call for a full time custodial sentence, save in the rare case. No doubt for this reason Mr Fagan SC emphasised the “low” part of his Honour’s reasoning. 
     
      
    54 I do not see that the objective gravity of this offence could be assessed as “low”. Encouraging a person to plead guilty to an offence, which that person did not commit, and thereby allowing a citizen to acquire a criminal record and to suffer criminal punishment is, in my opinion, a significant form of the offence of perverting the course of justice. 
     
      
    55 Ellis DCJ distinguished a number of authorities in this Court on the basis that the offences had been committed by some person with a view to them obtaining monetary gain for themselves. However, personal advantage can take many forms. Greed may be regarded as a less worthy motive than protection of a family member. The latter is no less a form of personal gain to an offender and, often, is a more powerful motive. Protection of the system of criminal justice should not be significantly less vigilant where its perversion is attempted for reason of family ties, rather than the expectation of monetary gain. 
     
      
    56 Furthermore, in this case, on his Honour’s findings of fact and on the agreed statement of facts before the Court, the Respondent’s motivation was not entirely to protect his wife and their relationship. In part it was motivated by his wish to protect himself from the consequences of his involvement up to that point of time, by producing false documents for an illegal purpose. The Respondent was placed in the position where many people find themselves placed who commence a course of improper or illegal conduct. In order to protect themselves they have to exacerbate the severity of the conduct in which they engage. The dilemma, such as it is, is self-made. 
     
      
    57 It is plain that the reason the sentencing judge imposed a short sentence, which he proceeded to suspend, was the strength of the Respondent’s subjective case. On any view his Honour was entitled to give that case considerable weight. Nevertheless it was not entitled to such weight as to result in the considerable leniency of a suspended sentence. In my opinion, notwithstanding the Respondent’s subjective case, the end result that the Respondent served no time in custody was a sentence that was manifestly inadequate in the relevant sense. For this alternative reason this Court should intervene. 
     
      
    58 As often happens with a case in which a criminal offence has been committed by an individual who would normally be punctilious about observing his obligations and who is most unlikely to re-offend, there is a high sense of tragedy associated with the events which propelled the offender to commit the crime. Most of those circumstances are set out in the judgment of Ellis DCJ and it is not necessary to repeat them here. It is clear that the Respondent has already suffered to a very substantial degree from the aberrant behaviour in which he engaged. He has lost his job and to a considerable, but not necessarily irreversible, degree he has lost his reputation and his future prospects. From the point of view of society, the administration of justice has lost a person who has made a substantial, indeed in many respects unique, contribution to the rule of law in this community and was clearly capable of continuing to make such contribution for many years in the future. 
     
      
    59 Notwithstanding the strong subjective case which the Respondent has made, I have nevertheless come to the conclusion that the objective gravity of the offence, particularly one committed by a serving police officer, requires a period of actual custody in order to serve the purposes of general deterrence and denunciation of the conduct. 
     
      
    60 The total length of sentence which Ellis DCJ imposed of one year and ten months could well be regarded as inadequate. The Crown made no submission about the length of the sentence but concentrated on the failure to impose full time custody. 
     
      
    61 In the context of a Crown appeal and the restraints upon this Court in such an appeal, the Court should accept the period which his Honour reached after taking into account a wide range of factors, including the plea. This appeal has come before the Court expeditiously and the Respondent has been at risk under the suspended sentence for a period of almost three months. Section 70 of the Sentencing Procedure Act prevents this Court backdating a sentence to his Honour’s commencing date of 30 June 2004. This requires an adjustment of the term. 
     
      
    62 Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1 Appeal allowed and sentence imposed by Ellis DCJ on 30 June 2004 quashed. 
       
       
      2 The Respondent is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of one year and six months to date from 8 October 2004, expiring on 7 April 2006. 
       
       
      3 Direct that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
       
      
    63 BARR J: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    64 HOEBEN J: I agree with Spigelman CJ.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN AJA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months imposed by Bell DCJ on 5 May 2004 at Moree. The applicant had pleaded guilty, on indictment, to a charge of break ,enter and steal. This is an offence contrary to the provisions of s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which provides a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The offence occurred shortly after 6.30 pm on Saturday 16 November 2002. The applicant, together with a co-offender, Darren Bruce Caldwell, who was her partner, entered premises, they located an amount of cash totalling $14,230 in a sock drawer in one of the bedrooms. The applicant and the co-offender took the money, together with several cans of Tooheys beer and a packet of bacon. 
     
      
    3 Shortly after the offence, the applicant and her co-offender attended the premises of an acquaintance, Tony Gray. Gray drove the offenders to a bottle shop where they purchased a carton of bourbon and cola cans and a packet of cigarettes, totalling $60. Gray became suspicious as she considered it unusual that the applicant had money and she went to Casino police station and reported her dealings with the offenders. 
     
      
    4 Police attended the premises of the applicant and her co-offender. The applicant eventually gave the police permission to search the premises. Six pairs of men's socks and a packet of bacon were located in the lounge room. A sum of $13,800 was located in a coat worn by the applicant. Both offenders were taken to Lismore police station and charged. 
     
      
    5 The applicant entered into her bail on 18 November 2002. She was committed for trial on 18 February 2003. Apparently at the time of the committal proceedings, the applicant was facing a charge of aggravated break, enter and steal pursuant to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The applicant failed to appear for arraignment and was subsequently apprehended pursuant to a warrant. She was given bail to appear at Dubbo District Court on 5 December 2003, whereupon she entered a plea of guilty to one count of break, enter and steal pursuant to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    6 The applicant has a minor record with no matters of a similar kind. His Honour accepted that in light of the applicant's upbringing, her record ""…was, if anything, one of slight importance and almost one of commendation."" 
     
      
    7 The co-offender was sentenced by Ducker ADCJ on 21 May 2003 to a term of imprisonment of eighteen months with a non-parole period of nine months. When imposing the sentence, Ducker ADCJ took into account five matters on a Form 1, which were filed pursuant s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The matters were: 
     
      
       
      1. Two counts of larceny pursuant to s 117 of the  
      Crimes Act. 
       
       
      2. One count of disposing of stolen property pursuant to s 188(1) of the  
      Crimes Act. 
       
       
      3. One count of receiving stolen property pursuant to s 189 of the  
      Crimes Act. 
       
       
      4. One count of break, enter and steal pursuant to s 112(1) of the  
      Crimes Act. 
       
      
    8 The co-offender had a criminal record which was more significant than that of the applicant. He had been convicted in 1999 of one count of break, enter and steal, which was dealt with by way of a s 558 recognisance. He also had a number of convictions for contravening an apprehended personal violence order and, on 27 January 2000, he was dealt with by way of imposition of a fixed term of twenty-three days imprisonment for matters of assault and contravening an apprehended personal violence order. It would seem these difficulties of the co-offender arose from the relationship he had with the applicant. 
     
      
    9 Two reports were tendered on behalf of the applicant during the sentence proceedings. The first was a pre-sentence report dated 20 January 2004. The second report was prepared by Cecilia Blackwell, a welfare worker and counsellor, dated 3 May 2004. The reports disclose that the applicant is of aboriginal descent and was aged thirty-one at the time of sentence. She was born into a family of thirteen children. Her mother died when the applicant was five years old. The cause of death appears to have been related to alcohol abuse. Her father was also prone to abusing alcohol. During her childhood, the applicant was subjected to violent beatings by her older siblings which, on occasion, resulted in her being hospitalised. 
     
      
    10 The applicant herself commenced drinking at the age of eighteen. Her use of alcohol escalated over the years. She endured violent personal relationships which caused her to further abuse alcohol. As a result of her increasing alcohol consumption, the Department of Community Services intervened to remove four children from her care. 
     
      
    11 At the time of sentence she had the sole care of her fifth child, a son aged twelve months. Since the birth of her fifth child, she had reduced her alcohol consumption and had hopes of resuming the care of her other four children. 
     
      
    12 As I have indicated, the sentence imposed by Bell DCJ on the applicant was the same as that imposed by Ducker ADCJ on the co-offender. The applicant submits that, in the circumstances, this was an error which should be corrected by this Court. 
     
      
    13 When considering the appropriate sentence to impose on the applicant, Bell DCJ carefully considered the Remarks on Sentence of Ducker ADCJ in relation to the co-offender. Although the co-offender is apparently a physically strong man, he has been found by a psychologist to be borderline mentally disabled. Ducker ADCJ accepted that his mental functioning ""is at a very low ebb."" 
     
      
    14 Having regard to this diminished level of mental functioning, it was submitted to Ducker ADCJ that the co-offender was under the intimidation of the applicant. While denying any possibility of physical intimidation, his Honour indicated that ""it may be that the domination is mental, not physical."" However, his Honour also expressed the conclusion that he was ""in no position to say just how dominant Miss Pitt may have been."" 
     
      
    15 Although Bell DCJ expressed the view that it was ""a task verging upon the impossible for me to be able to analyse accurately and reliably which of the two persons was the prime move in the offence"", his Honour clearly formed the view that the applicant was the dominant person in the relationship. His Honour also formed the view that Miss Pitt was a ""very active participant in the commission of this offence."" 
     
      
    16 Having determined that the applicant was probably not affected by alcohol at the time of the offence, his Honour turned to the matter of parity and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is my considered view that on the matter of parity, the degree to which Mr Caldwell received leniency at Judge Ducker's hands because of mental disability, is, in effect, nullified by the degree of active participation in the matter by Miss Pitt, which ultimately produces something of a balancing exercise resulting in, as Mr Balding has submitted, perhaps a neutrality finding and a finding of equal responsibility for the offence in respect of both people."" 
        
       
      
    17 Later in his remarks on sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I repeat, I am treating the matter as one in which they are equally responsible for the commission of the offence."" 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In coming to the view that the same penalty should be imposed upon Miss Pitt as upon Mr Caldwell, I take full cognisance of the fact that Mr Caldwell also had matters on a Form 1 schedule put before his Honour, and that he had a more extensive criminal record than Miss Pitt. But the matters to which I have made reference as to the degree of her involvement satisfy me that notwithstanding the principle of parity where Mr Caldwell may appear to be a more serious offender, Miss Pitt's engagement in this serious offence is such that she too should receive a sentence of 18 months after the discount for her plea, and that that too should be divided equally between the non-parole and parole periods in order to allow her to resume the maternal relationship under supervision of the Probation and Parole Service in order to ensure her small child has the availability of his mother's care."" 
        
       
      
    19 As I indicated earlier, the applicant submits that Bell DCJ erred by imposing the same sentence on the applicant as was imposed on the co-offender. The submission is founded upon the fact that Ducker ADCJ, when sentencing the co-offender, was required to have regard to the matters on the Form 1. The offences on the Form 1 were described by Ducker ADCJ as ""not trivial crimes."" 
     
      
    20 Accordingly, it is submitted that the absence of Form 1 matters in the case of the applicant meant that her overall criminality was less than that of her co-offender. In those circumstances it is submitted his Honour erred in concluding that the same sentence should be imposed upon the applicant as was imposed upon her co-offender. It is submitted that this error was compounded by his Honour's failure to give appropriate weight to the applicant's relatively minor record as compared with the more extensive antecedents of her co-offender. 
     
      
    21 These factors, it is submitted, placed the matter in a category where there was a basis for a proper degree of disparity, which is not obvious in the sentence outcome (R v Leonard [2000] NSWCCA 28). 
     
      
    22 The applicant further submits that any suggestion that to have imposed a lesser sentence on the applicant would have been to impose a manifestly inadequate sentence upon her, is also erroneous. Although it is accepted that it is unclear whether his Honour concluded that the sentence imposed on the co-offender was manifestly inadequate, it is submitted that, having regard to the available statistics, such a conclusion would not have been appropriate. Even if the Court considers the co-offender's sentence to be light, it is submitted that the principle of parity will still apply (R v Joseph Anderson NSWCCA, 25 March 1993, unreported). 
     
      
    23 Notwithstanding the care which the applicant's case has been presented to the Court, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed by Bell DCJ was such that the Court should intervene. In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the serious nature of the offence, which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years. Although it was almost all recovered, the amount of money taken was substantial (see R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at 337). In the circumstances of this offence, a custodial sentence was clearly appropriate. 
     
      
    24 With respect to matters of parity between the applicant and the co-offender, although the co-offender obviously possessed greater physical strength, the applicant was intellectually superior and the dominant personality in the relationship. When sentencing the co-offender, Ducker ADCJ was entitled to have regard to his limited intellectual ability, which diminished the need to consider matters of general deterrence (R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50-51), and the fact that he would find custody more difficult. 
     
      
    25 Furthermore, the co-offender pleaded guilty on arraignment whereas the applicant had absconded. Bell DCJ expressly declined to find the applicant was remorseful - a significant matter when imposing sentence. 
     
      
    26 I accept that the matters on the co-offender's Form 1 increased the degree of criminality to which Ducker ADCJ was required to have regard. However, when sentencing the applicant, Bell DCJ was required to fix a sentence which reflected the serious nature of the offence and the need for general deterrence (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 718). 
     
      
    27 The jurisdiction of the Court to intervene to correct any disparity of sentence imposed upon co-offenders was authoritatively discussed by Mason J in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610-611: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Just as consistency in punishment - a reflection of the notion of equal justice - is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice. It is for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community."" 
        
       
      
    28 His Honour considered the role of an appellate court in the process and concluded that (at CLR 613-614): 
     
      
       
        
        ""… a court of appeal is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance, by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate."" 
        
       
      
    29 Dawson J expressed the law in the following terms (at CLR 623-624): 
     
      
       
        
        ""… the interference of a court of appeal is not warranted unless the disparity is such that the sentence under appeal cannot be allowed to stand without it appearing that justice has not been done."" 
        
       
      
    30 In the present case, I am not satisfied, having regard to the considerations relevant to the sentence which it was appropriate to impose on each offender, that the applicant's sentence was such that it could be concluded that justice was not done. Furthermore, this Court is bound by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, of which the Chief Justice said in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 720-721: 
     
      
       
        
        ""By s 6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power 'to quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor' is not satisfied."" 
        
       
      
    31 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    32 GROVE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Justice McClellan and the reasons which he has given. 
     
      
    33 JAMES J: I also agree. 
     
      
    34 McCLELLAN AJA: The orders of the Court will be as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: Nexhmedin Bala (the appellant) seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed on him by O’Reilly DCJ at Sydney District Court on 19 December 2003. The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of being an accessory after the fact to breaking, entering and stealing and to five counts of receiving stolen property. He asked to be taken into account three offences of goods in custody pursuant to the Form 1 procedure. On each of the six counts his Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for two years commencing on 19 December 2003 with a non parole period of fifteen months commencing on that date and expiring on 18 March 2005. The appellant had been arrested and charged on 31 May 2002. He was initially refused bail but this was granted on 13 December 2002 and entered by him on 16 December 2002. He was returned to custody on the commencement date of the sentences mentioned above and thus, prior thereto, he had been kept in custody for six months and sixteen days. 
     
      
    2 The offences were detected following the formation of a police task force as it had become apparent that premises in affluent parts of Sydney were being targeted for the purpose of breaking, entering and stealing. In the course of investigation Gzima Berisha (Berisha) was identified as an employee of an insurer who was accessing confidential information in his employer’s data bank specifically concerning premises where valuables were kept and alarm systems were not present. Berisha was supplying this information to Dino Danuca (Danuca) and the appellant. 
     
      
    3 There were some variations in the charges brought against Berisha to reflect his criminal conduct but ultimately he was indicted and pleaded guilty to a charge pursuant to s 308C of the Crimes Act 1900 which may shortly be described as causing an unauthorized computer function with the intention of facilitating commission of a serious indictable offence. Berisha appeared for sentence on 7 February 2003 before Shillington DCJ. It was conceded that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. His offer to cooperate with authority and give evidence against Danuca and the appellant was noted and he was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non parole period of six months. In imposing that sentence Shillington DCJ took into account five additional charges on a Form 1, three of these relating to receiving stolen property which his Honour presumed was payment for his services to the other offenders, one charge of goods in custody and a charge of breaking, entering and stealing when he had accompanied Danuca when an offence of attempted breaking, entering and stealing took place, although his participation consisted of driving the vehicle. 
     
      
    4 Danuca and the appellant are in fact brothers. The appellant (born 24 February 1964) is the elder by about five years. Danuca appeared with the appellant for sentence before O’Reilly DCJ where he pleaded guilty upon indictment to seven counts of breaking, entering and stealing. Of the three offenders, Danuca was in common parlance the active burglar. He asked to be taken into account on sentence matters comprised on three separate Form 1 documents comprising six counts of receiving stolen goods, one further count of breaking, entering and stealing and three counts of goods in custody. The construct of sentences imposed upon Danuca effectively amounted to eight years imprisonment with eligibility for parole after service of six years and six months.  
     
      
    5 The arrest of the appellant followed the carrying out of a surveillance operation by police upon residential premises at Guildford. These premises were occupied by the families of the appellant and Danuca as well as another brother who was not alleged to be involved in the criminal activity. A search warrant was executed. The loot from the various offences can only be described as huge but it must be borne in mind that the involvement of the appellant is limited to the offences to which he pleaded guilty and asked to be taken into account. The learned sentencing judge detailed the relevant matters and no challenge was made in that regard and it is unnecessary for present purposes to recite his findings. The appellant raised five grounds of appeal expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentence imposed upon the applicant fails to have sufficient regard to the impact of the period of six and half months spent in custody prior to being released on bail for a period of approximately twelve months until the time sentence was imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentence imposed on the applicant fails to have sufficient regard to important mitigating factors pursuant to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentence imposed on the applicant is manifestly excessive when compared with that imposed on one of the co-offenders, Gzima Berisha such as to leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance that he has been dealt with unduly severely. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The sentencing judge erred in failing to extend the applicant a discount on the otherwise appropriate sentence to recognize the fact of his pleas of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentence imposed on the applicant fails to reflect in an overall sense the finding by the judge that there were special circumstances for the purpose of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.” 
        
       
      
    6 It is convenient to deal with grounds 1 and 5 together. In imposing sentence his Honour specified the period of imprisonment for two years and then stated that he would fix a non parole period of fifteen months “having made the findings of special circumstances by reason of, one significant reason he is being forced back into custody, having had a chance to get his life back under control for twelve months. It will be very onerous, in my opinion, for him.” Given the statutory formula, it is reasonable to infer that what his Honour had in mind was that, absent special circumstances, the non parole period would have been specified as eighteen months. Shortly after imposing sentence his Honour invited counsel to seek any clarification, as a result of which he stated that he “came to that figure of two years” after he bore in mind that the appellant had already served six months and he went on to say “I did not reduce it, mainly for the reason that I was going to give fifteen months non parole period in any event, so I just felt obliged to impose some full time but not a lot.” 
     
      
    7 A difficulty asserted by the appellant is that the actual service of six months and sixteen days, if taken into account in addition to the sentence actually imposed, extinguishes in any practical way the benefit that the appellant would have by departure from the statutory formula in harmony with his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. The thrust of the appellant’s argument can be perceived if one were notionally to imagine that the period of six months and sixteen days immediately preceded the sentence date and a total sentence of two years six months and sixteen days had been assessed. A reflection of the finding of special circumstances would not involve the appellant being kept actually in custody for twenty one months and sixteen days.  
     
      
    8 Ground 2 essentially was sought to be supported by contention that his Honour had given insufficient weight to various factors scheduled in the statutory provision. It is not contended that his Honour overlooked any relevant matter but it was sought to argue that his Honour should have applied the statutory injunction that effectively gaol is a “last resort”. I see no error in his Honour’s determination that the appellant’s offences be met with full time imprisonment. 
     
      
    9 Ground 3 can sufficiently be described as a “parity” argument. O’Reilly DCJ was expressly aware of how Berisha had been dealt with and he included reference in his remarks. The charge against Berisha was of course different in nature from those preferred against the appellant. Berisha’s position is also distinguishable from that of the appellant in that he pleaded guilty at the very earliest opportunity and was entitled to consideration for his cooperation including offers to give evidence against the appellant and his brother. 
     
      
    10 The argument on behalf of the appellant contended that the objective criminality of the appellant was significantly less than that of Berisha, however the flaw in that approach is that it is an attempt to compare unlike offences. I would reject the appellant’s argument on ground 3. 
     
      
    11 As observed, the appellant appeared for sentence following pleas of guilty. It was conceded by senior counsel appearing for the Crown that the learned sentencing judge did not state that he had applied any discount to reflect the value of the appellant’s pleas of guilty on a utilitarian basis or any other. In this regard there is a distinction to be drawn between the appellant and his co-offender brother Danuca in respect of whom his Honour expressly said he had allowed a 20 percent discount.  
     
      
    12 It was submitted by the Crown that despite the absence of reference it should be concluded not only that the sentencing judge had not failed to extend any discount for the applicant but rather that it should be concluded that the same 20 percent discount as had been given to the co-offender Danuca should be regarded as having been given to the appellant. I am unable to accept that submission.  
     
      
    13 His Honour had mentioned that the appellant’s pleas of guilty represented considerable social utility and were “an important contribution to the criminal justice system” and he found that both the offenders then appearing before him would be taken to be contrite by reason of their respective pleas of guilty. That his Honour made these references adds highlight to the distinction between the co-offenders in that there was an express discount on sentence granted to one but no expression in respect of the other. The approach contended for by the Crown raises compounding difficulties in trying to formulate in realistic figures how a 20 percent discount was applied, having regard to the complication of the six months and sixteen days time actually served being “taken into account” without being part of the specified sentence imposition. I would sustain ground 4.  
     
      
    14 I would proceed to resentence. The appellant had no prior convictions. He had arrived in Australia with his wife and three children only a short time before the commission of these offences and was a member of an Albanian community which had fled from the conflict in Kosevo. O’Reilly DCJ recited favourable factors upon which the appellant could draw when facing sentence and I would adopt what his Honour has said. I would also find special circumstances for congruent reasons with those expressed by him.  
     
      
    15 It cannot be overlooked that on the construct of sentences imposed by O’Reilly DCJ the appellant will be due for release to parole less than six months hence. As he has succeeded in making good the grounds above indicated the resentencing by this Court should reflect that success in a practical way. I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      2. Appeal allowed and sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof the appellant be sentenced on each count to imprisonment for eighteen months commencing on 19 December 2003 and expiring on 18 June 2005 with a non parole period of ten months commencing on 19 December 2003 and expiring on 18 October 2004.  
       
      4. The offences on the Form 1 taken into account in the imposition on the first count.  
       
      5. All sentences to be served concurrently. 
       
      6. The appellant be ordered released to parole on 18 October 2004. 
       
      
    16 SIMPSON J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    17 SHAW J: I agree with Grove J.

    1 McCLELLAN AJA: I will ask Grove J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This appeal comes before the court on a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentences imposed in the Campbelltown District Court by Moore ADCJ on 28 January 2004. 
     
      
    3 As will appear from matters which I will later recite, there have arisen unusual difficulties in relation to this appeal and it will provide no basis for precedent in other cases. 
     
      
    4 The respondent, when aged just short of eighteen years, joined with other youths and older men in serious criminal activity, all of which occurred on Wednesday 2 May 2001 at the Liverpool Catholic Club. 
     
      
    5 Disguised, a group of approximately eight offenders entered the club while at least two of them were armed with machetes. There were numerous offences committed in and against patrons of the club. The respondent was arrested shortly after the offence.  
     
      
    6 The prosecution of proceedings against him took an unfortunate turn. 
     
      
    7 Initially, investigators were, no doubt by reason of the disguises worn by the offenders, unable to identify the roles of each in the particular crimes. In original charges it was proposed that the respondent would be brought before and dealt with in the Children’s Court. It is apparent from the papers before the court that representatives of the prosecution and the respondent were engaged in what may be described as “negotiations” as to what appropriate charges should be brought against the respondent. It was plain that the respondent did not deny being one of the intruders involved in entry into the club, it is equally plain that difficulty was being encountered in specifying appropriate charges to reflect his involvement and that, once these could be determined, the respondent was willing to acknowledge his responsibility by plea. 
     
      
    8 In any event, by February 2002 the Director of Public Prosecutions, in correspondence, indicated that certain particular charges would be laid against the respondent and concluded his letter with these observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “This office would not seek to have the matter committed to the District Court for sentence although I note that it is ultimately a question for the court and not a matter for the DPP to make an election.” 
        
       
      
    9 Investigation, or at least analysis, of what had occurred at the club, apparently continued. This led to a further letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions on 8 May 2002, making reference to what was described as the “full facts” and observing that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It appears that there has been a misconception on both sides (Crown and Defence) in terms of how your client can be sentenced.” 
        
       
      
    10 There were then references to an intention to charge the respondent with offences different from those earlier indicated, and the letter concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is also the present intention of the Crown to seek to have the sentence proceedings dealt with in the District Court jurisdiction.” 
        
       
      
    11 In the course of time applications were made for a stay of proceedings on behalf of the respondent and there were other matters not initiated by him which contributed towards delay. It does not seem profitable to investigate the detail as to the reasons for delay, what is now significant is that long delay did in fact occur. As I stated at the outset, the respondent appeared for sentence on 28 January 2004; that is almost two years nine months after the offence had been committed. The respondent first was brought before a court on 4 May 2001, that is within two days of the commission of the offence. A count has revealed that the current hearing is the thirty-eighth listing in a variety of courts since then. 
     
      
    12 I should record that submissions were made concerning the specific delay in instituting this appeal. The affidavit of Elsbeth Philpott sworn 1 October 2004 details the relevant circumstances and establishes that notification of intention to appeal and service of the notice were given in accordance with what was practicable. This is not a case where delay for reasons of dilatoriness leads to determination, but, as I have said, irrespective of cause time was elapsing. 
     
      
    13 The respondent was a young man with no prior convictions. Nevertheless, the offences which he committed on this occasion were of a very serious order. The actual charges eventually preferred against him all arose out of the events of the evening that I have mentioned. They were contained in two counts, the first a count of armed robbery and a second count charging robbery in company. Taken into account on a Form 1 were two further offences of robbery in company and an offence of being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner. 
     
      
    14 By the time the respondent appeared for sentence there had been what his Honour found to be “remarkable achievements” by him. He had obviously matured during the ensuing years and he had, in particular, gone with a group to spend time with indigenous people, both in Bourke and in Central Australia. Many people were able to inform his Honour as to how, after this, there had been a noticeable change for the better in his life. He has formed a stable relationship and become the father of a child. He has remained in steady employment.  
     
      
    15 It should be mentioned that the evidence showed that the plaintiff came from a close knit, supportive and spiritually sensitive extended family. It is unnecessary to detail the arrangements whereby he was brought up somewhat unusually within the extended family. 
     
      
    16 It was able to be detected that his fall from grace seemed to follow a trip to Hawaii for some six months in the year 2000 when he was trying out for a basketball scholarship. The arrangements for his residence had fallen through and, pursuant to ad hoc arrangements, he came under the influence of people who were, to say the least, undesirable. His family noticed that, when he returned home after failing to obtain the scholarship, there had been a change for the worse. That culminated in his participation in the very serious offences for which he stood for sentence. 
     
      
    17 The learned sentencing Judge was able to observe, however, that there was no evidence that the respondent took part in any of the physical acts of violence on the occasion, although his plea of guilty conceded that he was a principal in the sense that he remained nearby, ready to assist if called upon. His Honour’s findings in this regard have not been the subject of challenge. 
     
      
    18 His Honour came to the conclusion that the whole of the circumstances were so truly exceptional that, despite the seriousness of the offences, non custodial sentences were appropriate.  
     
      
    19 What his Honour purported to do was to sentence the respondent on the first count to imprisonment for eighteen months commencing on 28 January 2004 and expiring on 27 July 2005, which he suspended upon the respondent entering a bond to be of good behaviour for the period of eighteen months. On the second count he ordered that the respondent serve five hundred hours community service. The matters on the Form 1 were taken into account on the sentence in respect of the first count. 
     
      
    20 The Crown has vigorously argued that, despite the favourable subjective circumstances of the respondent, the objective seriousness of his participation in these offences was such that his Honour ought have met them by the imposition of a sentence of full time custody. 
     
      
    21 There are, however, two matters which I regard as of signal importance in dealing with this particular Crown appeal. In different ways they touch upon the matter of delay. I have already adverted to the long delay between the commission of the offence and the appearance of the respondent for sentence and the further delay that has taken place pending the appeal to this court. 
     
      
    22 This has had an unusual consequence in this particular case in that if full time custody were imposed, by reason of the lapse of time it is no longer possible for an order to be made that the respondent serve his sentence in a juvenile detention centre. That is because the option ceases to be available once an offender has, as the respondent has, attained the age of twenty one.  
     
      
    23 It might be observed that one co-offender had also been sentenced to non custodial penalty and that an appeal to this court was allowed when pursued by the Crown. Nevertheless, the consequence in that case was that that offender was ordered to serve twelve months in actual custody in a juvenile detention centre. Purely by reason of the lapse of time, such is no longer available to the respondent. 
     
      
    24 The second matter is the circumstance that it is acknowledged, both on behalf of the Crown and on behalf of the respondent, that the purported sentence on the second count was made without jurisdiction. The respondent is therefore, in the situation where almost three and half years have now passed since the commission of the offence and yet imposition of sentence cannot be finalised today.  
     
      
    25 There are several reasons for the invalidity of the sentence on the second count. One fundamental matter is that, by reason of the age of the respondent when the offences were committed, the Children (Community Service Orders) Act 1987 was applicable. Not only does it apply because of its own terms, but it can be observed that the parallel legislation applicable to adults expressly excludes its application to this respondent (see s 8(3), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999).   
     
      
    26 One of the consequences is that, even if the learned sentencing judge had adverted to the correct legislation, there would have been, in the circumstances of this respondent, jurisdiction to make an order for community service not exceeding two hundred and fifty hours, whereas his Honour purported to impose five hundred hours.  
     
      
    27 I said that that was only one of the matters relating to the invalidity. It is common ground that, although there was oblique mention of recommendation in Juvenile Justice Reports which were before his Honour, there was neither appropriate undertaking sought from the respondent nor other requisite procedures undertaken in order to fulfil the statutory steps necessary to be taken in order to utilize community service as a sentencing option. 
     
      
    28 There is a discrete procedural matter, if I can so describe it, to which I should make reference, and that is, in imposing the sentence of eighteen months imprisonment on the first count, which his Honour suspended, he did not specify a non parole period.  
     
      
    29 There are complications which could follow intervention by this court simply to repair that omission. The power to suspend a sentence is vested by s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. S 12(3), subjected to stated exclusions, provides that Part 4 of the Act which deals with procedures for imprisonment does not apply. An exclusion in s 99(1) would operate in the event of revocation. The principal complication is in seeking to replicate the jeopardy to which the respondent would be subject if a non parole period were now to be set. The power to “backdate” a sentence is vested by s 47 which is within Part 4 and hence does not apply (s 12(3)) if sentence is suspended. 
     
      
    30 Although his Honour did not give a reason for declining to set a non parole period, his sentence is not invalidated thereby (see s 45(4)) and the most practical course, in the event that this court did not determine to impose a custodial sentence, was acknowledged by counsel to be to refrain from specification of a non parole period. 
     
      
    31 It does not seem to me that this court can deal with the second count. This court has no jurisdiction to act as a court of first instance sentencing and it is inevitable, therefore, that the matter will have to be returned to the primary court for that purpose. 
     
      
    32 Thus, although all of the criminal activity of the respondent was consequent upon a series of events on a single occasion, it will not be possible to deal with matters as a whole. 
     
      
    33 Irrespective of any view as to the inadequacy of the sentence on the first count, I do not consider that the interests of justice could be served by committing the respondent to custody after some three and a half years in the legal “system”. The discretion of this court to dismiss a Crown appeal on sentence should be in any event invoked. The purported sentence on the second count is a nullity and the respondent is unsentenced in respect of it. 
     
      
    34 In order to accommodate these quite peculiar circumstances that have arisen I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. To the extent that the Crown appeals against the sentence imposed upon the first count (in relation to which the matters on the Form 1 were taken into account) in the exercise of the Court’s discretion, the Crown appeal be dismissed and the sentence imposed in the District Court confirmed. 
       
       
      2. In relation to the second count of robbery in company the appeal allowed and the purported sentence quashed by reason of its invalidity and the matter of sentence on the second count remitted to the District Court to be dealt with in accordance with law. 
       
      
    35 McCLELLAN AJA: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J and with his reasons therefor. 
     
      
    36 JAMES J: I also agree.  
     
      
    37 McCLELLAN AJA: The court’s orders accordingly will be as Grove J has announced.

     Matter No IRC 6749 of 2003Sherif Mohamed and Reuben F Scarf (Retail) Pty LimitedApplication under S.84 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1996 
      
      DECISION 
       
       
      [2004] NSWIRComm 1113 
     Preliminary1 Mr Sherif Mohamed was employed as store manager by Reuben F Scarf (Retail) Pty Limited which conducts twelve retail stores in New South Wales selling men's clothing and employs approximately sixty persons in its operations. Mr Mohamed was employed at the Bankstown store. His services were summarily terminated on Tuesday, 11 November, 2003 for misconduct after four years of employment for the alleged theft of moneys for banking to the value of $1,170.00. Mr Mohamed denied that he had stolen the money and he subsequently lodged an application under Part 6, Unfair Dismissals, of Chapter 2, Employment [Ss.83 to 90] of the 1996 Industrial Relations Act. 2 The matter was set down by Registry staff for a conciliation and directions hearing on Thursday, 11 December, 2003 and a mention on Friday, 6 February, 2004. There was no appearance for Mr Mohamed at the mention on Friday, 6 February, 2004 and I adjourned the mention for Wednesday, 24 March, 2004. (In fact, Mr Russo, representing Mr Mohamed in the proceedings, did appear later on Friday, 6 February, 2004 and I informed him of the adjournment of the matter.) The police had been involved in this matter but on Wednesday, 24 March, 2004 I was informed that for ""...budgetary reasons..."", ie in the light of the amount of money involved in the alleged theft measured against the resources for the police, they would not be continuing with the matter which they regarded as only a ""...soft crime..."". 3 Conciliation failed to resolve the matter. I programmed it for arbitration which occurred on Monday, 25 October, 2004. It was originally intended that the hearing would proceed on Tuesday, 26 October, 2004 but that additional day was not required. Mr Russo represented Mr Mohamed in the hearing, calling him to give evidence. Ms Brus represented Reuben F Scarf in the hearing. She called three witnesses to give evidence in the hearing - Mr Andrew Scarf, the general manager of Reuben F Scarf, and two tellers employed by Westpac Bank at its Bankstown Square Branch: Ms Maria Barounis and Ms Jannette Robles.4 Mr Mohamed's claim in his Part 6 application is confined to monetary compensation - six month's salary, ie the maximum amount of remuneration available in accordance with S.89(5). But Mr Mohamed's claim must be considered bearing in mind the provisions of S.89(6), viz: 
      
       
        
         
        ""When assessing any compensation payable, the Commission is to take into account whether the applicant made a reasonable attempt to find alternative employment and the remuneration that would have been payable if the applicant had succeeded in obtaining alternative employment."" 
         
         
        
       
      On Sunday, 23 November, 2003 Mr Mohamed had taken up work for another menswear store on a salary greater than that which he received when he was working for Reuben F Scarf. Indeed, Mr Mohamed had worked on a part-time basis for that menswear store during his period of employment with Reuben F Scarf. In doing so, it appears to me that he was acting contrary to directions in the policy and procedure manual which provides that: 
       
      
       
        
         
        ""...staff may not engage in outside employment with the competitors during the time of his employment..."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Mohamed claimed in his evidence that the other menswear store was retailing a product for another market than that which Reuben F Scarf had directed its sales. But that may be a fine distinction which the policy and procedure manual was not contemplating. The fact remains that both Reuben F Scarf and the store with whom Mr Mohamed also worked were selling menswear.  
     5 In any event, as far as the assessment of monetary compensation is concerned, S.89(5) involves identifying loss of income by the dismissed employee, not an assessment of damages [Henderson v. Rural Lands Protection Board (1997) 74 IR 142 at p.50]. It is fairly settled law now in this State that such monetary compensation is neither punitive, punishing an employer for any wrongdoing on his part, nor designed to enrich the dismissed employee at the expense of his former employer. Because Mr Mohamed found alternative employment so soon after his dismissal, it must follow that the amount of monetary compensation to which he may become entitled is substantially reduced. 6 I accept that S.89(6) should not provide merely for a simple mathematical formula in the assessment of monetary compensation - a sum representing the amount of income over the period of six months immediately prior to the dismissal, compared and contrasted with the remuneration received in the alternative employment and considered against the length of time that an employee was out of work [D and R Commercial Pty Limited v. Flood (2002) 113 IR 344 at p.363]. Whilst S.89(5) does provide a clear jurisdictional limitation of the six month ceiling in S.89(5), the rest is a matter for my discretion. But in exercising that discretion, I am directed by S.89(6) to have regard to efforts made by a dismissed employee to mitigate his loss and the fact that Mr Mohamed had obtained employment, with a higher salary than he had formerly received when he was working for Reuben F Scarf, must serve to limit the amount of monetary compensation he may receive. (That is a matter which Ms Brus also suggested gave rise to an argument that his claim was really frivolous and vexatious and justified costs being ordered against him. I will discuss the question of costs later in this decision). 7 That brings me to the issue before me in this hearing. It is, of course, trite to say that the theft of money from an employer is a ground for his summary dismissal. But, in the light of Mr Mohamed's denial of the allegation against him, the onus of proof rests with Ms Brus to establish that he was guilty of the theft [Pastrycooks Employees, Biscuit Makers Employees and Flour and Sugar Goods Workers Union v. Gartrell White (No.3) (1990) 35 IR 70 at pp.83 and 84]. The position was confirmed by the Full Bench of the Commission [Cahill J - Vice President, Hill J and French C) in Wang v. Crestell Industries Pty Limited (1997) 73 IR 454 at pp.463 and 464, viz: 
      
       
        
        ""…The onus of proof in such a case is on the employer and the standard of proof must be such as to enable a positive finding that the misconduct occurred. The standard is, of course, the civil and not the criminal one, but the requisite degree of satisfaction must have regard to the seriousness of the alleged conduct and the gravity of the consequences of the finding. The satisfaction must be such as to warrant a positive finding of the type referred to by the High Court of Australia in  
        M 
         v.  
        M 
         (1988) 63 ALJR 108 and by Dixon J in  
        Briginshaw 
         v.  
        Briginshaw 
         (1938) 60 CLR 336 at p.362…"" 
         
         
        
       
      The fact that the police are no longer considering laying charges against Mr Mohamed does not in any way resolve the issue before me. That would especially be the case since it has been suggested in the proceedings that the reason they have not laid charges against Mr Mohamed was not because they did not believe that Mr Mohamed did not have a case to answer on the basis of the criminal standard of proof - beyond reasonable doubt - but simply because of budgetary constraints on their resources to pursue the matter further.  
     The Evidence8 On Monday, 13 October, 2003 Mr Mohamed took money representing the store takings out of the safe at the back of the store, put it in a plastic bag, walked the short distance to the bank and placed it in the business express deposit box. It is Mr Mohamed's emphatic claim that there were three envelopes that he deposited in the deposit box at the bank - $934.00, representing the store takings for Friday, 10 October, 2003, $1,170.00, representing the store takings for Saturday, 11 October, 2003 and $793.45, representing the store takings for Sunday, 12 October, 2003. The envelope containing $1,170.00 has gone missing. On Friday, 7 November, 2003 the financial clerk employed by Reuben F Scarf approached Mr Scarf and told him that she had been informed by the bank that the store takings for Saturday, 11 October, 2003 had not been received by it. Mr Scarf raised the matter with Mr Mohamed over the telephone.9 Ms Barounis' duties at the bank include emptying the business express box and processing its contents. She does so always in the presence of another bank employee. In an affidavit which formed the basis of her evidence in this hearing she recorded the procedure she had adopted on Monday, 13 October, 2003, viz: 
      
       
        
        ""...I collected the deposits from the business deposit box with...Ms Robles in accordance with correct Westpac procedure. We then emptied the contents of the box into a basket. The collected amount of envelopes was first counted at this stage and recorded in a register and signed by both myself and Ms Robles. I then took the basket containing the business express deposits to my desk and entered the details into the computer. The details include the account numbers and the amount and the business express deposit number. I processed several Reuben F Scarf deposits on Monday, 13 October, 2003.  
         
         
        At the time of processing the deposits, I was not aware of which Reuben F Scarf store the particular deposits came from. When the bank received an inquiry regarding a missing deposit in early November, 2003, we were able to confirm that the amounts received and deposited from the Bankstown store were $934.00 and $793.45. Neither of the deposits I processed from the Bankstown store nor from any other Reuben F Scarf deposit was for the amount of $1,170.00."" 
         
         
        
       
      Ms Barounis had a key to the deposit box but only opens it in the presence of another bank officer. The manager of the bank also holds a key to the deposit box but to my mind it is simply not plausible that such a senior and responsible member of the bank staff may have accessed the box and taken the missing money as Mr  
      Russo 
       appears to me to have been suggesting in his cross-examinatin of Ms Barounis and Ms Robles.  
       
        
       
     10 Mr Scarf met with Mr Mohamed on Monday, 10 November, 2003. It is Mr Mohamed's claim in the affidavit that he provided as the basis for his evidence that he:  
      
       
        
        ""…had no idea what the meeting was about but I suspected something was going on..."" 
         
         
        
       
      I reject Mr Mohamed's claim in that respect. Mr Scarf had already spoken to Mr Mohamed over the telephone concerning the missing money and Mr Scarf asserted in his evidence that when he had again telephoned Mr Mohamed to arrange the meeting he spoke of the missing money, asked him if he would like a witness to be present in the meeting and, when Mr Mohamed did not respond, arranged for Mr Joe Karam, the area manager to attend the meeting as his witness.  
     11 Mr Scarf claimed that in the telephone conversation Mr Mohamed stated that: 
      
       
        
        ""I banked the money and nobody but the bank could possibly have the money."" 
         
         
        
       
      That is an assertion which Mr Mohamed continued to make during the meeting, even when Mr Scarf suggested to him the possibility that he may have dropped the missing money on the way to the bank, viz: 
      
      
       
        
        ""I could not have dropped it because of the way I was carrying it."" 
         
         
        
       
     12 Mr Scarf had asked Mr Mohamed to outline the procedure he had followed on Monday, 13 October, 2003. Mr Mohamed's explanation to Mr Scarf, outlined in his affidavit, was as follows: 
      
       
        
        ""...On Monday, 13 October, 2003 I opened the store safe and got out three days banking, double checked that I had three days banking and went to the bank as usual..."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Scarf recalled Mr Mohammed saying that for Saturday, 11 October, 2003: 
      
      
       
        
        ""I closed off the till, counted the cash, balanced the till, drew up a banking sheet, put the money in a sealed banking bag, then took it to the safe. I then turned the alarm off, the lights off and walked out. I pulled down the shutters at around 4.00pm."" 
         
         
        
       
      And for Monday, 13 October, 2003: 
       
      
       
        
        ""I opened the shutter, turned off the alarm, then turned on the lights. I then counted the Sunday takings, filled in the banking slips, counted the float. By about 9.30am Sunday's takings were in the safe. When I put the money in the safe, I saw the banking from Friday and Saturday in the safe."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Mohamed confirmed that no other person had access to the keys to the safe. He has no other explanation for the missing money. Mr Scarf wrote out minutes of the meeting. It was signed by Mr Scarf, Mr Mohamed and Mr Karam. 
     13 On Tuesday, 11 November, 2003 Mr Scarf had a further conversation with Mr Mohamed. Mr Scarf recalled Mr Mohamed summarising the position in the following manner: 
      
       
        
         
        ""It was either me or the bank. It wasn't me as I definitely remember taking the three days banking from the safe and taking them to the bank and placing them in the express slot... The bank stole the money and have set me up. The banks steal money."" 
         
         
        
       
      At a further meeting at midday Mr Scarf asked Mr Mohamed for a further explanation and Mr Mohamed reasserted that ""...there were only two possibilities - me or the bank..."". Mr Scarf formed the view that Mr Mohamed had stolen the money and summarily dismissed him. He asked Mr Mohamed to hand over the keys to the store and the safe, collect his personal belonging and leave. Mr Mohamed refused to hand over the keys and remained at the store. Mr Scarf claimed that Mr Mohamed threatened him, viz: 
       
      
       
        
        ""If I have to sell my home, I am going to fix you and your brother up in court."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Mohamed denied that he made any such threat. But Mr Scarf called the local police and two police officers attended the store, ordering Mr Mohamed to hand over the keys and leave the premises. Mr Mohamed complied but remained outside the store. Mr Scarf asked the police officers to direct Mr Mohamed not to enter the store again. 
      Conclusion 14 Mr Mohamed has consistently argued that the missing money is the responsibility of the bank. His claim is that he did not steal the money and the only other alternative is that bank officers have done so. He sees the issue in purely black and white terms in that respect. However, in this hearing, I do not believe that I am strictly bound to those two alternatives. Notwithstanding Mr Mohamed's claim that the ""...bank has stolen the money..."", I have looked for another explanation for the missing money, eg that it was dropped in the street. Ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Mohamed is correct in that assertion at least - the money has been taken either by him or bank officers and there are really no other options. It is apparently only a short distance that he travelled from the store to the bank. The deposit box is inside the bank and if it were dropped on the floor it would have been seen there by bank staff. Mr Mohamed is emphatic that he deposited the money in the deposit box at the bank. 15 Mr Mohamed had total control of the money from the time it was allegedly placed by him in the safe until he deposited it in the deposit box at the bank. Indeed, no other person has seen the missing money from the time Mr Mohamed claims that he placed it in the safe. I do not believe that the procedure which has been adopted by the bank for the processing of deposits placed in the deposit box would permit an error or theft to have occurred at that end. Ms Barounis and Ms Robles provide complimentary evidence in this hearing of the action that was taken by them. By comparison, Mr Mohamed's version of events is totally uncorroborated. 16 I therefore reject Mr Mohamed's version of the incident. I am satisfied, according to the standard of proof required of Ms Brus in accordance with the reasoning in Wang v. Crestell Industries Pty Limited - the civil standard on the balance of probabilities - that Mr Mohamed was entirely responsible for the missing money at all material times and the fact that it has gone missing must mean that he stole it. I therefore see no justification for my intervention in support of him and dismiss his Part 6 application.17 However, I also reject Ms Brus' application for costs against him. Costs in Part 6 proceedings are governed by S.181(2)(c), viz: 
      
       
        
        ""...the Commission may award costs against a party to proceedings under Part 6 of Chapter 2 (Unfair dismissals), who, in the opinion of the Commission, unreasonably failed to agree to a settlement of the claim or whose application was frivolous or vexatious..."" 
         
         
        
       
      Ms  
      Brus 
       has argued that Mr Mohamed's Part 6 application was vexatious because (i) the short period of time before he found comparable alternative employment would confine his claim to a modest amount only and (ii) the threat that Mr Scarf alleges he made - ""...I am going to fix you and your brother up in court..."" (but which Mr Mohamed denies) reveals his real motive for pursuing his Part 6 application. 
      18 A frivolous or vexatious action is one where the party bringing it is not acting in good faith and merely seeks to annoy or embarrass an opponent or which is not designed to produce any practical result of benefit to him. In order to bring a case within the description of frivolous or vexatious it is not sufficient merely to say that the applicant has no cause of action. It must appear that the cause of action is, on the face of it, clearly one which no reasonable person could properly treat as bona fide and contend that he has a grievance which he was entitled to bring before the court. A frivolous or vexatious claim is, to use the language of Barwick CJ of the High Court in General Steel Industries Inc v. Commissioner for Railways (1964) 112 CLR 125 at p.129: 
      
       
        
        ""…so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed; manifestly groundless; so manifestly faulty that it does not admit of argument; discloses a case which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed; under no possibility can there be a good cause of action; so manifest that to allow them (the pleadings) to stand would involve useless expense…"" 
        
       
      
      
      Whilst I am satisfied that Mr Mohamed's Part 6 application had no merit, my assessment has been made on the basis of the balance of probability. I do not hold myself up as infallible in my assessments and my conclusion that Mr Mohamed stole the missing money on the basis of that civil standard does not, in my view, support a claim that he is precluded from mounting a claim under Part 6. Consequently, I do not consider that he was acting frivolously or vexatiously in pursuing his claim under Part 6. He has every right to exercise the rights he has in that respect.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Court has before it an interlocutory application for access to certain material that has been sealed in an envelope by order of Justice Dunford on 29th July 2004. 
     
      
    2 The Appellant appeals against his conviction on certain charges. One of the grounds he seeks to agitate on appeal concerns the identity of a juror whom he wishes to allege was a person who knew the Appellant and also knew of adverse information regarding the Appellant’s character and reputation. 
     
      
    3 Critical to the pursuit of this particular ground of appeal is, of course, the identity of the juror. Evidence has been placed on affidavit before the Court, although those affidavits have not at this stage been read. The Court is aware there is evidence identifying a certain person to be a juror and evidence of a general character of the relationship between that juror, if he or she was a juror, and the Appellant. 
     
      
    4 Justice Dunford was dealing with an application similar to the one now before the Court, made on behalf of the Appellant, to disclose the contents of a report by the Sheriff’s Office relating to the possible identity of the juror. His Honour rejected the application. In the course of doing so his Honour relied upon the provisions of s68 of the Jury Act 1977 and concluded that that section prevented the Court disclosing the information on the application. 
     
      
    5 Section 68 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person shall not, except in accordance with this Act, wilfully publish any material, broadcast any matter or otherwise disclose any information which is likely to lead to the identification of a juror or former juror in a particular trial or inquest.  
        
       
       
        
        Penalty: In the case of a corporation, $250,000; in any other case, 2 years imprisonment or 50 penalty units (or both). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the identification of a former juror with the consent of the former juror. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A reference in this section to the identification of a juror or former juror includes a reference to the disclosure of the address of the juror or former juror. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Subsection (1) does not apply to the disclosure of information by the sheriff to any of the following bodies or persons for the purposes of an investigation or prosecution of a contempt of court or an offence relating to a juror or a jury:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a court, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the New South Wales Crime Commission, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the Independent Commission Against Corruption, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the Police Integrity Commission, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) the Australian Crime Commission, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) the Director of Public Prosecutions, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the Police Service, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) the Australian Federal Police. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) Subsection (1) does not apply to the disclosure of information by the sheriff to a person in accordance with an authority granted by the Attorney General for the conduct of a research project into matters relating to juries or jurors. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) In this section:  
        
       
       
        
        court 
         includes any tribunal, authority or person having power to require the production of documents or the answering of questions.” 
        
       
      
    6 Justice Dunford referred to the investigation by the Sheriff and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “[5] The Sheriff has now furnished a reply but I decline to order that either the Crown or the appellant’s counsel have access to the communication from the Sheriff. I emphasise however, that this should not be understood as indicating either that the nominated person was a member of the jury or was not a member of the jury at the appellant’s trial. My reason for doing so is that I consider I have no power or discretion to permit such disclosure having regard to the provisions of s 68 of the  
        Jury Act 1977. 
        
       
       
        
        [6] Even if I did have the power, I consider that in the proper exercise of any discretion I should not exercise it. My reasons are that the terms of s 68 make it clear that there should be no disclosure of the identity of a juror except in the very limited circumstances therein specified, and indicate a legislative intention that such disclosure should not take place unless absolutely necessary. Whether the fact that a person known to the appellant was on the jury could constitute a valid ground for setting aside the jury’s verdict, particularly in the circumstances of this case, is a matter that should be determined by a full bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and not by a single judge sitting on a directions hearing. 
        
       
       
        
        [7] In this regard I assume that the provisions of s 38(7) of the  
        Jury Act  
        were complied with and that before the selection of the jury the judge directed the Crown Prosecutor to identify the accused and the principal witnesses to be called for the prosecution, and that the judge called on the jurors on the panel, to apply to be excused if they considered they were not able to give impartial consideration to the accused’s case. If the nominated person was on the jury panel he either did not recognise the appellant or if he did, he apparently considered that he was able to give impartial consideration to the accused’s case.” 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour refused the application and made certain directions. His Honour also made directions as follows with respect to the information: 
     
      
       
        
        “[13] I direct that the name of the possible juror identified by the deponents of relevant affidavits, be contained in a sealed envelope, and written submissions refer to such person as XYZ. The envelope containing the name, when sealed, is not to be opened except by direction of the Court. 
        
       
       
        
        [14] I further order that the response from the Sheriff, dated 18 June 2004, be placed in a sealed envelope and not to be opened except by order of the Court.” 
        
       
      
    8 In my opinion his Honour erred in reaching the conclusion that the Court had no discretion to permit disclosure by reason of s68 of the Jury Act. 
     
      
    9 I would direct, in accordance with his Honour’s order, that the two envelopes, or if both documents are in a single envelope, the single envelope, be opened to be inspected by the Court and then made available to the legal representatives of the parties only at this stage.  
     
      
    10 The Court has been assisted by submissions in this respect by Mr Byrne SC on behalf of the Appellant and Mr Cogswell SC on behalf of the Crown. 
     
      
    11 Mr Cogswell made certain submissions in order to assist the Court and adopted a devil’s advocate role, directing the Court’s attention to certain aspects of the statutory scheme. 
     
      
    12 In my opinion the word “person” in s68(1) does not extend to a Court. There is a strong line of authority which indicates that, as a matter of ordinary language, the word “person” would not ordinarily encompass a court. (See, e.g. Canadian Pacific Tobacco Co Ltd v Stapleton (1952) 86 CLR 1 at 6; Miller v Miller (1978) 141 CLR 269 at 277; Hilton v Wells (1985) 157 CLR 57 at 87.) 
     
      
    13 The issue of whether the word “person” includes a court has often arisen in the case of statutory provision prohibiting or regulating disclosure of information by or to “a person”. The answer in all cases that I have identified is: No it does not. (See Canadian Pacific supra; Cowan v Stanhill Estates Pty Ltd (1966) VR 604 at 606-629; Miller v Miller supra; Parkes Management Limited v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (1979) 1 NSWLR 274 at 277;  Hilton v Wells supra at 67, 87; Kizon v Palmer (1977) 72 FCR 409 at 430-431.  
     
      
    14 Plainly, the matter must turn on the particular statute. I am reinforced in my conclusion by the terms of s68(4) itself which I have set out above. The provision is directed at permitting the sheriff to make disclosure, for certain limited purposes, to a range of organisations, some of which posts are occupied by a single individual. The permission is expressed in terms of “the following bodies or persons”. Here, in s68 itself, is an indication that the word “person” is used in a narrower sense than a concept extending to include the court, otherwise the use of the word “bodies” as well as the word “persons” in subs (4) would not have been necessary.  
     
      
    15 I do not mean to suggest by these remarks that each of the organisations referred to in the respective sub paragraphs of subs (4) could not be bound, themselves, by subs (1). Nor would I wish to make any observations as to the broader construction of the word “person”. One issue that often arises in such a context is whether a body corporate constitutes a person. Subsection 68(1) puts that matter beyond doubt by providing for a separate penalty in the case of a corporate offender. 
     
      
    16 Section 68(4) permits the disclosure of information. It operates as an exclusion from the prohibition in subs (1). There are, however, two additional exclusions. An individual juror can consent to disclose his or her identity pursuant to s68(2). Further, the Attorney may permit the disclosure of such information for the purpose of jury research under s68(5). These particular exceptions do not suggest that any one of them is intended to be exhaustive in any sense. 
     
      
    17 Subsection (4) appears to me to be precautionary. It is designed to ensure that no issue will arise with respect to disclosure by the Sheriff to the particular bodies and persons identified in the subsection. 
     
      
    18 A similar issue arose in the Parks Management case to which I have referred. That case involved s13 of the Securities Industry Act 1975. Subsection (2) of that section contained a similar permission, which was also construed so as not to be an exhaustive list of exceptions to the prohibition in subs (1) of s13, for the reasons identified by Needham J at p277. Although each statute must be construed in accordance with its own terms I reach a similar conclusion to his Honour with respect to s68 of the Act. 
     
      
    19 Perhaps the principal reason for doing so is that s68(4) is limited to a specific range of matters involving the administration of justice. It extends, “to the investigation or prosecution of contempt of a court or an offence relating to a juror or jury”. The range of circumstances that can arise in a jury trial which give rise to a possible miscarriage of justice is wide. The width of this range suggests to me that, in the context of s68(1), Parliament would not have intended to prohibit a Court from making information available which may lead to a course of inquiry that can disclose a significant miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    20 The matter was considered, for example, in Minarowska & Kozio v R (1995) 83 A Crim R 78 where Gleeson CJ said, at 85: 
     
      
       
        
        “A distinction has been drawn between evidence, first-hand or hearsay, as to the deliberations of a jury, and evidence, sometimes described as relating to ‘extrinsic matters’, which proves a material irregularity in the proceedings. Thus, for example, it is permissible to lead evidence to show that inadmissible and prejudicial material of an evidentiary nature was sent into a jury room and was available to be considered by the jury ( 
        Rinaldi  
        (1993) 390 NSWLR 5605; 68 A Crim R 284), or that a sheriff’s officer wrongly intruded into the jury’s deliberations and expressed a view that the accused were guilty ( 
        Emmett  
        (1988) 14 NSWLR 327; 33 A Crim R 340), or that a jury bailiff suggested to a jury that an accused had previous convictions ( 
        Brandon  
        (1969) 53 Cr App R 466), or that a juror was drunk, or could not speak English, or refused to participate in deliberations ( 
        Tuia  
        [1994] 3 NZLR 553). 
        
       
       
        
        The distinction between evidence relating to a jury’s deliberations, and evidence of an irregularity in their conduct or procedures, or in the conduct of the trial in a manner capable of affecting the jury, although it may be blurred in some cases, is of considerable antiquity. However the dividing line between proof of a jury’s deliberations and proof of an irregularity in the proceedings may, as the present case illustrates, be difficult to draw”. 
        
       
      
    21 These observations were made in the context of disclosure of jury deliberations, a matter covered by the provision of s68A of the Jury Act. Nevertheless they appear to me to have an analogy for purposes of s68. Where, as in the present case, the identity of a juror arises in a context where a miscarriage of justice may have occurred, Parliament would not have intended subs (4) to constitute an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which disclosure, at least by a court, of the identity of the juror would be permitted.  
     
      
    22 Subsection (4), limited as it is to contempt and an offence relating to a jury, does not encompass the full range of circumstances in which the identity of the juror can give rise to the need for disclosure in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    23 The Court should be slow to construe legislation so that it prevents the Court from taking what steps it should take to ensure that miscarriages of justice do not arise by reason of the identity of a juror and, perhaps, knowledge by a juror about a particular accused. 
     
      
    24 For those reasons in my opinion the Court should direct that the envelope be opened and, after inspecting the envelope or envelopes, to make them available to the legal representatives of the parties. 
     
      
    25 BUDDIN J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    26 SMART AJ: I also agree.

     Judgment 
      1 WOOD CJ AT CL: The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence which was imposed upon him, by Greg James J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, on 16 November 2001, following his plea of guilty to one count of murder. He was sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non parole period of twelve years.  
     
      
      FACTS 
       
      
    2 The victim was the Applicant’s wife, Maria Badanjak. There had been a long history of violence, on the part of the Applicant within the marriage due mainly to his resentment in relation to her emerging independence, and her complaints about his excessive drinking. He had been convicted of an assault on his wife in 1983. He had committed a number of breaches of apprehended violence orders, and there had been periods of separation followed by a resumption of co habitation.  
     
      
    3 In January 2000 Mrs Badanjak indicated a desire to move out of the matrimonial home and to live apart from the Applicant, a proposal that did not meet with his approval. 
     
      
    4 During the late afternoon of 24 January 2000, he repeatedly stabbed his wife to death. The immediate causes of death were two stab wounds to her chest, which pierced her heart, and two stab wounds to her neck which severed her jugular vein. The frenzy with which she was attacked was indicated by the large number of additional knife wounds to her chest, arms and head, which were apparent at post mortem examination. 
     
      
    5 The sentencing judge found that the murder was premeditated, by reference to the circumstance that, about two hours before the murder, the Applicant told an acquaintance, Kevin Frances that his wife wanted him to move out of their home, and that he was returning home to kill her and his daughter. Although his Honour did not refer to it, there was also evidence before him to show that, two days before the murder, the Applicant had informed another friend, Frank Novak, that if his wife persisted with her plan to make him leave the matrimonial home then he would kill her. 
     
      
    6 The Applicant appeared in person and relied upon two grounds of appeal which were reduced to writing. Additionally, this morning, he tendered two documents, in one of which he repeated the submission concerning the advice which he alleges was given to him by counsel as to the extent of the discount for a plea of guilty, that he might expect. To the substance of that ground I will return. However, before proceeding to deal with the two specific grounds which have been identified, it was established with the Applicant that his appeal remains one against sentence. He does not bring any application before the court to re-open the conviction appeal. Upon that basis I will proceed to deal with the two grounds which have been identified. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 1 - ERROR IN A FAILURE TO FIND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. 
       
      
    7 The Applicant submits that the sentencing judge erred in not finding special circumstances, by reason of the fact that he suffered from a back injury and deteriorating mental health at the time of the sentencing, which would make custody more difficult for him. In this regard attention was drawn to the observation of his Honour: “I do not see that the offender is suffering from some such substantial condition as would warrant some special mitigation of sentence, which might otherwise be appropriate”.  
     
      
    8 Although those observations were passed in the context of his Honour’s consideration of the question of deterrence, they may be taken as indicating a general finding that the Applicant did not suffer from any serious condition, which would justify a significant mitigation of sentence. 
     
      
    9 It was held in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589, an authority to which the Applicant made express reference, that while the health of the offender is relevant to the type and length of any sanction imposed, generally speaking it will only be a factor tending to mitigate punishment when there is evidence to show that there is a serious risk that imprisonment will be a greater burden on an offender, by reason of ill health, or where there is a serious risk that imprisonment will have a grave adverse effect on the offender’s health. 
     
      
    10 That decision was applied by the High Court in Bailey v DPP (1988) 62 ALJR 319, and by this court in R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 and R v L NSWCCA 17 June 1996: see also R v Burrell (2004) 114 A Crim R 207 and R v Azar [2000] NSWCCA 26.  
     
      
    11 It remains the responsibility of the Corrective Services Authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for prisoners: R v Vachalec, and R v Krasser NSWCCA 2 September 1993. Most conditions can be adequately managed by those authorities without the need for mitigating the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate, and it is only in relatively rare cases that the Smith principle is applicable. 
     
      
    12 In this case there was no evidence before the sentencing judge to suggest that the Applicant’s mental health was deteriorating at the time of the sentence. The report of the psychologist, Ms Devlin, of 16 October 2001, indicated that there had been a gradual decline in his intellectual functioning due to alcohol abuse, but there was nothing to indicate any increase in that decline between the time of the killing and the sentence. She also noted his history of depression.  
     
      
    13 Dr Bruce Westmore expressed an opinion, in his reports of 19 July 2001 and 27 September 2001, that the Applicant was not suffering from a major depressive illness or displaying any psychotic features. Dr Westmore also noted that, despite the Applicant’s claim to memory loss: 
     
      
       
        
        “he was an attentive and alert historian who appeared to be able to provide, if accurate, a good autobiographical history”.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    14 Both parties agreed, on sentence, that while the Applicant’s intellect had declined over the years due to alcohol abuse, he should be sentenced on the basis that his intellectual decline had played no role in the commission of the offence. He was sentenced on that basis.  
     
      
    15 Dr Westmore said that the Applicant might be prone to episodes of depression over the next few years, but that is hardly an unexpected consequence for an offender sentenced to imprisonment. His abstinence from alcohol, while in custody, is likely to be a favourable factor for him. 
     
      
    16 There was no medical evidence tendered on sentence concerning the extent of his back injury, other than for the history which the Applicant gave to Ms Devlin and Dr Westmore. That was a history of an injury which had occurred nine years earlier, at work, and which had involved a disc.  
     
      
    17 Surgery eighteen months after the injury had helped, although it was recorded that the Applicant still needed a TENS machine to treat pins and needles and cramps, and that he took Panadeine Forte for the pain.  
     
      
    18 The Applicant had been in custody for eight months by the time that he was seen by Dr Westmore, and he made no complaint of any deterioration in his back condition when asked about his health. 
     
      
    19 There was again no evidence before his Honour suggesting a risk of deterioration, and no evidence was tendered on appeal to show that his condition had been worse than was expected at the time of sentencing.  
     
      
    20 It is the fact that there were tendered this morning (although they had also been attached to the earlier submissions), some photographs of x-rays which show the pins which had been inserted in the vertebrae of the Applicant at the time of his original surgery. It is evident from the attached card and the accompanying photograph of the Applicant that these were x-rays taken at the time of surgery. They are not fresh x-rays. It is impossible to draw any conclusion from the bare fact of the x-rays that anything was overlooked in relation to the Applicant’s back condition. 
     
      
    21 During the proceedings on sentence counsel for the parties were specifically invited to make submissions in relation to the way in which his Honour should take into account the Applicant’s physical or mental condition. His counsel, no doubt in recognition of the principles which I have cited, submitted that these matters would make custody more difficult for him but said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That might be a matter taken into account eventually if he comes before the Parole Board in relation to release, but I do not think there is much a court could do apart from give some consideration to the length of sentence to assist the prisoner who has serious physical problems like this prisoner has. Those matters will be in the hands of the prison authorities”. 
        
       
      
    22 He did not submit that his Honour should find special circumstances. Rather, it was submitted that the Applicant’s physical and mental health were relevant to the question of the overall length of the sentence. 
     
      
    23 The state of his health was expressly taken into account by his Honour in this way. His Honour accepted the histories set out in the reports of the psychologist and psychiatrist, except for the suggestion, which had no foundation whatsoever, that the offence involved any element of self defence or provocation. He also expressly took all of the Applicant’s subjective circumstances into account in fixing both the sentence and the non parole period. 
     
      
    24 The present case is not one where the Applicant was suffering from some illness or injury which was not identified or known by his Honour at the time of sentencing, and it is, accordingly, distinguishable from cases such as R v Vento NSWCCA 6 July 1993, R v Dowe NSW CCA 1 September 1995 and R v F NSWCCA 21 May 1998.  
     
      
    25 In the event of the Applicant’s condition deteriorating in the future then the principles summarised by the court in R v L apply:  
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that an offender suffers from an illness does not necessarily mean that a prison sentence should not be imposed, or that the sentence should be less than the circumstances of the case would otherwise require. It is the responsibility of the executive to provide for the care and treatment of its prisoners:  
        R V Vachalec 
         (1981) 1 NSWLR 351, per Street CJ at 353-4. If a prisoner’s condition deteriorates during the course of the sentence such that his or her release ought to be permitted on humanitarian grounds the executive is empowered to deal with the situation. Section 53 of the Sentencing Act 1989 preserves the royal prerogative of mercy and s 25A(1) of the Act enables the Offenders’ Review Board to grant parole at any time if the prisoner is dying or there are other “exceptional extenuating circumstances’”.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    26 In my view there was no error in the exercise of his Honour’s direction, insofar as he declined to find special circumstances.  
     
      
    27 As was noted by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 (paras 63 and 65) the ultimate constraint on the discretion of a sentencing judge to find special circumstances, warranting a reduction of the non parole period, is that the non parole period, must itself reflect the criminality involved in the offence, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence.  
     
      
    28 His Honour continued (para 67): 
     
      
       
        
        “Where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of the head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non parole period. Before a sentencing judge further reduces the non parole period by reason of that circumstance he or she must undertake a process of analysis which travels beyond that which has been undertaken in the course of determining the head sentence”.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29 In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 the Chief Justice observed at para 18: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘Double counting’ for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence and therefore already reflected in the non parole period must be avoided. (See Simpson at {47}). Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur’.  
        
       
      
    30 His Honour went on to note that the flow of appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the issue of special circumstances had not abated, despite the fact that the court had said, in Simpson, that it would be unlikely to interfere unless the non parole period was found to be manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    31 It is beyond question that the Applicant in the present case killed his wife because he resented her attempts to separate from him. The sentencing judge correctly referred to those authorities in which the courts have emphasised the abhorrent nature of domestic murder, and to the circumstance that considerable weight must be given, in such cases, to the need for punishment and general deterrence (see R v Cheung NSWCCA 11 December 1995).  
     
      
    32 The Applicant’s health, including his cognitive deficits and his age, were expressly taken into account in fixing the sentence, as was the loss which he had suffered in effectively terminating contact with the remainder of his family as a result of his conduct. Each was automatically reflected in the non parole period which is at the lower end of the range for an offence of murder. Any further reduction of the non parole period by reason of a finding of special circumstances, referable to the Applicant’s health, would have involved erroneous double counting and it would also have resulted in a sentence that did not reflect the objective criminality involved. 
     
      
    33 This ground is not made good.  
     
      
      GROUND 2. ERROR IN FAILING TO GIVE THE APPLICANT A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DISCOUNT FOR HIS GUILTY PLEA. 
      
     34 It is apparent from the record before us that the Applicant entered a plea of guilty on 3 September 2001, which was the date fixed for the commencement of the trial.  
     
      
    35 The record shows the matter then came before the court on 26 October 2001, on which occasion the Applicant was represented by counsel. Upon that date evidence was received, and some submissions were placed before his Honour concerning the appropriate range. It is evident from the discussion which took place that Mr Austin of counsel, who represented the Applicant, accepted that a range of fifteen percent to twenty five percent, by way of a discount for the plea, was appropriate. There was discussion between his Honour and counsel to the effect that the relevant non parole period was within the range of twelve to eighteen years.  
     
      
    36 As his Honour pointed out, the Crown pointed to the higher end of that scale and Mr Austin accepted that the lower end of the scale would be appropriate.  
     
      
    37 His Honour indicated that, after a discount for the plea he would end up with a non parole period within that range.  
     
      
    38 It is also evident from the record that, subject to the reception of the victim impact statement, all relevant evidence and submissions had been received on 26 October.  
     
      
    39 The sentence was, in fact, handed down on 16 November, following the tender of the victim impact statement.  
     
      
    40 The Applicant has submitted, in a letter provided this morning, that he has concerns in relation, not only to the advice which he claimed was given to him by counsel concerning the possibility of him receiving a twenty five percent discount, but also in relation to the asserted absence of counsel when the matter came back before the court on 26 November.  
     
      
    41 We have had the benefit of perusing a copy of the associate’s record which shows that the case was called on at 12.06pm, at which point Mr Austin apologised for not having attended earlier. The record then shows that there was a discussion concerning the victim impact statement, after which his Honour proceeded to pronounce sentence.  
     
      
    42 That record does not bear out the assertion which is made in the document, provided this morning, to the effect that there was no one to argue on sentencing on behalf of the Applicant on that day. Nor does it bear out the assertion that counsel said that he did not have any paperwork for sentencing and did not have a date for sentencing.  
     
      
    43 It is apparent, as I have indicated, that for all practical purposes the reception of evidence and submissions had already been completed, and all that remained on 16 November, was for his Honour to receive the victim impact statement and then to pronounce sentence. The matter of which the Applicant complains could not possibly have acted to his prejudice.  
     
      
    44 It may be noted that additionally there was an indirect suggestion in this document that the Crown Prosecutor and the Judge had some kind of discussion, and that the sentencing did not occur until after lunch and then only in the absence of counsel. It is perfectly apparent that those facts are incorrect. It is also inconceivable that the Crown Prosecutor had any discussion with his Honour in private. 
     
      
    45 The case is one where the sentencing judge had accepted that the Applicant had shown some remorse and fixed a discount of fifteen percent to encompass the utilitarian value of the plea and the remorse.  
     
      
    46 In R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 a range of between ten percent and twenty five percent was suggested as the appropriate range of discount for a guilty plea. The Chief Justice there said (at para 155): 
     
      
       
        
        “The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, for example on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial.”  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    47 It is to be observed this is a case where the plea first came on the date fixed for trial. It is not a case where there were any particular benefits from the plea arising in relation to the prospective length and complexity of a contested trial. 
     
      
    48 As was said by Howie J, with whom Dunford and Adams JJ agreed, in R V Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at para 24: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted that the plea of guilty, coming at the earliest opportunity and before the magistrate, should have alone resulted in a discount of twenty five percent. This is an argument that converts a guideline into a rule. It has been said repeatedly by this court that the discount for the plea is a discretionary matter and that a particular offender has no entitlement to any particular discount:  
        R v Scott 
         [2003] NSWCCA 286;  
        R v Newman 
         [2004] NSW CCA 113”.  
        
       
      
    49 There were no exceptionally complex matters, or other reasons in this case warranting a discount for the plea and remorse greater than fifteen percent. There was never a basis for the Applicant’s contention that defences of provocation, or self defence or of substantial impairment may have been available to him and required investigation, let alone that they provided a defence. 
     
      
    50 Although the Applicant says that he only pleaded guilty because of the advice, the record does not suggest that he was in any way disadvantaged by the approach which was taken in relation to the value to be given to the plea.  
     
      
    51 The Applicant has, accordingly, failed to establish error in sentencing principle. He has also failed to show that some sentence other than that passed was warranted in law and should have been passed (S6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912), for an offence of domestic murder involving the significant attack which was inflicted upon the victim. It appears to me that the sentence was, in fact, a lenient sentence. Any other sentence would have been manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    52 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.53 McCLELLAN AJA: I agree. 
     
      
    54 SMART AJ: I also agree.  
     
      
    55 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the court will be as I proposed.  
     
      
     oooOOOooo

     JAMES J 
     : This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5F (3A) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act  
     against the respondent, who I will refer to as “MM” or “the respondent”, against certain decisions on the admissibility of evidence made by his Honour Judge Maguire in the District Court in a reserved judgment handed down by his Honour on 20 May 2004. 
      
       
        
       The Charges 
        
       
      
     4 On 5 April 2004 the respondent had been arraigned before his Honour on an indictment containing a number of counts. On the hearing of this appeal the Court was informed by counsel that the indictment on which the respondent had been arraigned had been incorrectly transcribed in the transcript of the proceedings on 5 April 2004 and a further complication is that one of the counts which was included in the indictment presented on 5 April 2004 has since been withdrawn. This appeal has proceeded on the basis that the following charges were included in the indictment presented on 5 April 2004, that on 5 April 2004 the respondent pleaded not guilty to all of these charges and that these charges are the charges which the Crown wishes to press against the respondent. All of the charges involve the same complainant, who was the respondent’s step-daughter. 
      
       
        
       1. Between 1 December 2001 and 30 March 2002 the respondent indecently assaulted the complainant, she being at the time under the age of ten years, namely seven years. 
        
        
       2. Between 1 December 2001 and 30 March 2002 the respondent committed an act of indecency with the complainant, she being at the time under the age of ten years, namely seven years. 
        
        
       3. Between 1 December 2001 and 1 November 2002 the respondent indecently assaulted the complainant, she being at the time under the age of ten years, namely seven or eight years. 
        
        
       4. Between 1 November 2000 and 1 November 2002 the respondent committed an act of indecency towards the complainant, she being at the time under the age of ten years, namely six, seven or eight years. 
        
        
       5. Between 1 November 2000 and 1 November 2002 the respondent had sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person under the age of ten years, namely six, seven or eight years. 
        
        
       6. Between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2002 the respondent incited the complainant to commit an act of indecency towards him, she being at the time under the age of ten years, namely seven or eight years. 
        
        
       7. Between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2002 the respondent committed an act of indecency towards the complainant, she being at the time under the age of ten years, namely seven or eight years. 
        
        
       8. Between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2002 the respondent indecently assaulted the complainant, she being at the time under the age of ten years, namely seven or eight years. 
        
       
      
     5 The charges of aggravated indecent assault (charges one, three and eight) were charges brought under s 61M(2) of the  
     Crimes Act 
      for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for ten years; the charges of committing or inciting an aggravated act of indecency (charges two, four, six and seven) were charges brought under s 61O(2) of the  
     Crimes Act 
      for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years; the charge of having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years (charge five) was a charge brought under s 66A of the  
     Crimes Act 
      for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
      
       
      
     6 From November 2000 the respondent, the complainant’s mother and the complainant lived together in a house in a New South Wales country town. The respondent had a study in the house in which there was a computer with access to the Internet. The proposed Crown case on each of the charges can be briefly summarised as follows:- 
      
       
      
     7 The first three charges are based on conduct which the Crown says occurred on the same occasion. The Crown case is that on this occasion the respondent and the complainant were in the study in the house, both were naked and the complainant at the respondent’s direction was sitting on the respondent who was sitting in a chair and the respondent was showing the complainant images on the computer that included images of an adult male and two female children, all of whom were naked and were engaging in sexual acts, including one of the female children kneeling in front of the man and performing some act in relation to the man’s penis. The second charge is based on the respondent’s conduct in showing the complainant the images on the computer. The first charge is based on an allegation that, in the circumstances which have just been described, the respondent held his arms around the complainant below her chest. The third charge is based on an allegation that, in the circumstances which have just been described, the respondent touched the complainant in either her genital or her anal area.  
      
       
      
     8 The fourth charge is based on an allegation that on another occasion while the respondent and the complainant were together in the study the respondent masturbated in front of the complainant. 
      
       
      
     9 The fifth charge is based on an allegation that on still another occasion while the respondent and the complainant were together in the study, the complainant, at the direction of the respondent, performed fellatio on him. 
      
       
      
     10 The final three charges are based on conduct which the Crown alleges all occurred on the same further occasion. On this occasion the complainant was dressed in her school uniform and was ready to go to school. At the direction of the respondent, the complainant went into the study. In the study the respondent told the complainant to pull up her skirt and the complainant complied (charge six). The respondent took a photograph of the complainant with her skirt pulled up (charge seven). The respondent then rubbed the complainant’s genital area with something like a tape recorder which he had in his hand (charge eight). 
      
       
        
       Background 
        
       
      
     11 It is necessary to outline some further facts, none of which would appear to be in dispute. 
      
       
      
     12 In July 2001 the complainant’s mother discovered by chance on the computer in the study a file dealing with child pornography. She spoke to the respondent about the file. 
      
       
      
     13 On 26 March 2002 the complainant’s mother discovered further child and adult pornography on the computer. On the following day 27 March 2002 the complainant’s mother reported what she had seen on the computer to police and made a statement to police. On 2 April 2002 the respondent was interviewed by police in a lengthy recorded interview and he made a number of admissions about downloading child pornography on his computer. 
      
       
      
     14 On 3 June 2002 the respondent was convicted in a Local Court of an offence of possessing child pornography to which he had pleaded guilty. Pursuant to s 9 of the 
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      the Local Court magistrate directed the respondent to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years. The conditions of the bond were:- 
      
       
        
         
         “1. To be of good behaviour 
          
          2. To appear before the court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of this bond. 
          
          4. To accept the supervision and guidance of the New South Wales Probation Service for such of the period as that Service deems sufficient. 
          
          
         If the offender appears before the court for failing to comply with any of the conditions of the bond, the court may -  
          
          
          take no action for the failure to comply; or 
          
          vary the conditions of the bond or impose further conditions on the bond; or 
          
          revoke the bond and re-sentence the offender for the offence to which the bond relates”. 
          
         
        
       
      
     15 The conditions of the bond were explained to the respondent and he entered into the bond. In compliance with condition 4 of the bond, the respondent attended regular meetings with a Probation and Parole officer, which commenced on 20 June 2002 and continued for more than twelve months. 
      
       
        
       The Proposed Crown Case 
        
       
      
     16 The complainant was interviewed by police on 13 June 2003 and 17 June 2003 in long electronically recorded interviews. In the first interview she did not make any allegation of sexual misconduct on the part of the respondent. However, in the second interview she gave answers on which the various charges against the respondent are based. 
      
       
      
     17 Apart from evidence from the complainant, the Crown wishes to rely, at the trial of the respondent on the charges, on evidence from the Probation and Parole officer with whom the respondent had meetings, evidence from the complainant’s mother and evidence of answers made by the respondent when he was interviewed by police on 2 April 2002. It was the admissibility of this evidence (or parts of it) which was in issue at the voir dire hearing before Judge Maguire. 
      
       
        
       (i) Evidence of the Probation and Parole officer 
        
       
      
     18 The Probation and Parole officer made a statement to police on 11 September 2003. To this statement were attached extensive case note reports or file notes, which the officer had made while she was supervising the respondent pursuant to condition 4 of the bond. Many parts of the case notes would clearly be inadmissible at any trial of the respondent, for example on the ground that they merely record reflections or other thought processes of the officer about the respondent. However, in her statement the officer said that she had recorded in her case notes a number of things which the respondent had told her at case meetings during the supervision. The officer did not claim that she had made a verbatim record of what the respondent had said and the quotations I will now give are simply quotations from the case notes. 
      
       
      
     19 At the first case meeting with the respondent on 20 June 2002 the respondent disclosed that “he prefers to have sex with females who have no pubic hair”. On the same day the respondent said that “he masturbated while watching child pornography images”. 
      
       
      
     20 At a case meeting with the respondent on 17 July 2002 the respondent disclosed that “he does fantasise about children he has seen… fantasises about a female child giving him oral sex” and that “he does fantasise about his step-daughter… aged eight”. 
      
       
      
     21 At a case meeting with the respondent on 24 September 2002 the respondent said “having a child give him oral sex would be better because he could tell her what to do”. 
      
       
      
     22 At a case meeting with the respondent on 8 October 2002 the respondent said that “the media presented children in a manner that made them to look sexy”. 
      
       
      
     23 It is necessary to refer to further passages in the officer’s file notes, which the Crown would not be seeking to adduce in evidence at the trial but which are relevant to the admissibility of the parts of the file notes to which I have already referred. 
      
       
      
     24 In the file note of the first case meeting on 20 June 2002 the officer recorded that she had told the respondent “it is not normal (to view child pornography)… and male adults who view child pornography go on to sexually abuse children”. At this meeting she informed the respondent that she would have to make a report to the Department of Community Services “as concerns for the safety of the children (of the complainant’s mother) were paramount”. 
      
       
      
     25 In the file note of the second case meeting on 3 July 2002 the officer stated an opinion she had formed that the respondent was minimising the seriousness of viewing child pornography and was not being honest in denying to her that he fantasised about having sex with children. The officer stated “supervision will need to focus on (the respondent) admitting his fantasies and then being able to challenge him on the possibility that he could act on his fantasies”.  
      
       
      
     26 In the file note of a case meeting on 17 July 2002 the officer recorded that “further time was spent eliciting information from him in relation to his sexual fantasies of children”. In the same file note the officer expressed the opinion that it was more than likely that the respondent had (sexually) abused the complainant. 
      
       
      
     27 The Probation and Parole officer gave oral evidence in the voir dire inquiry and I will refer to parts of her oral evidence. She said that part of her role as the respondent’s supervisor was to discuss the respondent’s fantasies with him. She agreed that she saw “as part of the supervision for his benefit” the eliciting of admissions from the respondent that he had sexual fantasies about children and that she “questioned and cross-questioned” the respondent until he eventually admitted that he had fantasies and that she then further questioned the respondent to narrow down what the fantasies were.  
      
       
      
     28 The officer agreed in cross-examination that, if the respondent had declined to talk to her about his sexual fantasies, she would not have regarded him as co-operating in the supervision required by condition 4 of the bond. She did not warn the respondent that his answers to her questions might be used in criminal proceedings against him. She accepted that it was no part of her function to gather evidence in support of a criminal proceeding. Her conversations with the respondent were regarded by her as confidential, subject to an obligation to report to the Department of Community Services any matter which might justify further investigation by the Department and to make a report to the District Court about matters relevant to the conditions of the bond. The officer had made her statement to the police, after police had contacted her to make a statement. 
      
       
        
       (ii) Evidence of the Complainant’s Mother 
        
       
      
     29 The complainant’s mother made a series of statements to the police on 27 March 2002, 23 June 2003, 26 August 2003 and 12 January 2004. Before Judge Maguire the admissibility of a fairly large number of paragraphs in these statement was contested. However, in the Crown’s notice of appeal to this Court the only parts of the complainant’s mother’s statements which are referred to are pars 5-9 of her statement of 27 March 2002 and pars 17, 18 and 19 of her statement of 23 June 2003 and I will confine my attention to those parts of the complainant’s mother’s statements. 
      
       
      
     30 Paragraphs 5-9 of the statement of 27 March 2002, which referred to events of the previous day, were in the following terms:- 
      
       
        
         
         “5.  
         When I was checking the computer I saw a lot of new programs on the computer which I did not recognise. 
         
        
        
         
         6. I came across a program called “IMESH”. A click on this program into a folder called Clients then skins then green 2 then new folders which had been created on our computer on the 13.03.02. 
         
        
        
         
         7. When I opened this folder I saw about 15 images of pornographic down loads. I opened these downloads and saw young female children who were naked showing genital areas with adult men who were also naked showing their genital area. 
         
        
        
         
         8. One example was a female child about 7 years old lying flat on her back with her legs apart and the adult male naked with erect penis either touching or just penetrating the girl. 
         
        
        
         
         9. There were other similar images. M (the respondent) had previously about 8 months ago, accessed child porno where we discussed it and he was going to seek him, this time the porno was a narrower age range, between 7-14, last time it was up to teenage years”. 
         
        
       
      
     31 Paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 of the complainant’s mother’s statement of 23 June 2003 were in the following terms:- 
      
       
        
         
         “17. In late July 2001 I located a file on our home computer with child pornography. I questioned M about this being illegal. M began telling me a lot of lies in relation to his life. I left the issues about the computer images as M agreed to stop using the computer for those purposes. 
         
        
        
         
         18. On the 26th of March 2002 I was using the computer in the study of our house. I began looking through different files and located yet another batch of child and adult pornography. I became very concerned. I contacted several different agency to see where I could get help to find out what to do about the computer images and to see if my daughter was OK. I was hoping to have the computer images traced to stop that kind of thing. 
         
        
        
         
         19. M and I still begun having problems. This was still related to the images I had seen on the computer. The computer images involved adult males having sexual intercourse with a seven year old female. On the bottom of the screen it read similar to ‘Father and seven year old daughter’. I became concerned that M may have been violating my daughter”. 
         
        
       
      
     32 It is obvious that, on any view, much of pars 17, 18 and 19 of the complainant’s mother’s statement of 23 June 2003 would be inadmissible at a trial of the respondent, for example as merely being evidence of states of mind and thought processes of the complainant’s mother. On the other hand, there is in par 19 of this statement some additional information about the content of some of the images the complainant’s mother saw on the computer on 26 March 2002. 
      
       
        
       (iii) Evidence of Admissions of the Respondent 
        
       
      
     33 The questions and answers in the interview of the respondent on 2 April 2002 which are identified in the Director of Public Prosecutions notice of appeal are questions and answers 31, 56-57, 86-88, 99, 101, 107-109, 114-121, 125-153, 156-163, 168-173 and 177-183. 
      
       
      
     34 There is much repetition in these questions and answers. In his answers the respondent admitted that he had downloaded child pornography on his home computer from the internet; that he had downloaded images of adults and of children from the ages of seven or eight years up to eighteen years, showing their genital parts and showing them in sexual positions and performing sexual acts. One image showed a young female child with her legs apart with an adult male with an erect penis entering the child’s vagina. Another image depicted oral sex between an adult and children. 
      
       
        
       The Voir Dire Hearing 
        
       
      
     35 At the voir dire hearing before Judge Maguire counsel for the respondent submitted inter alia that:- 
      
       
        
       (i) The evidence of the Probation and Parole officer which the Crown wished to adduce was evidence which had been obtained improperly within s 138 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        and should be excluded pursuant to s 138 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       . Alternatively, the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer should be excluded under s 90 or s 137 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       . 
        
        
       (ii) The evidence of the complainant’s mother which the Crown wished to adduce at the trial of the respondent and the evidence of the questions and answers in the respondent’s interview which the Crown wished to adduce (and the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer, if not otherwise excluded) should be excluded for various reasons but particularly as being inadmissible “tendency” evidence (s 97 of the  
       Evidence Act) 
       . Notices had been given by the Crown of an intention to adduce this evidence as tendency evidence. 
        
       
      
     36 In his judgment of 20 May 2004 Judge Maguire dealt first with the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer. His Honour made the following findings of fact about the officer:- 
      
       
        
         
         “1. That she was engaged for some years in a Department of the Government of the State of Victoria, where she had a role in the investigation of offences alleged to have been committed upon young children. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Thereafter she was employed as a parole officer in Victoria. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Thereafter she was employed as a parole officer in New South Wales at Queanbeyan. 
         
        
        
         
         4. That having taken on the supervision of the accused, she formed the opinion that he was abusing his stepdaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         5. That she thereupon commenced to interrogate him from time to time, with a view to investigating that matter. 
         
        
        
         
         6. That she made it clear to him that she had the authority to do so and that he was obliged to answer her questions. 
         
        
        
         
         7. That in the course of such questioning, she elicited from him admissions which support the charges before the court”. 
         
        
       
      
     37 After referring to counsel for the respondent’s submission that the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer which the Crown wished to adduce had been improperly obtained and should be excluded under s 138 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The obtaining of this evidence is fundamentally flawed. The witness completely misconceived her duty. Investigation of criminal activity and the interrogation of suspects are no part of her charter. They fall into the charter of the New South Wales Police and the Department of Community Services”. 
         
        
       
      
     38 His Honour then proceeded straight to s 138(3) of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . After quoting the terms of s 138(3) of the  
     Evidence Act 
      his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I shall deal with each of those paragraphs in turn.  
         
        
        
         
         (a) Clearly the evidence has some probative value. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Having read the evidence of the child, I am of the opinion that evidence objected to has limited importance in the proceedings. To exclude it would not bring the Crown case to an end. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) I do not see the nature of the relevant offences alleged as having any particular bearing on the exercise the discretion provided for. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) I regard the gravity of the impropriety as being of the gravest kind. Parolees expect to be supervised. They are entitled to expect not to be investigated or policed. In the circumstances of this case, I have particular regard to this factor. To exercise my discretion in favour of allowing this evidence would undermine confidence in the parole system. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) The impropriety was clearly deliberate. 
         
        
        
         
         (f), (g) and (h) do not arise for consideration in the circumstances of this case. 
         
        
        
         
         On the balancing these factors, I reject the evidence”. 
         
        
       
      
     39 In his judgment Judge Maguire then turned to what he described as the “tendency evidence”, being the evidence from the complainant’s mother, the evidence from the Probation and Parole officer and the questions and answers in the respondent’s interview. 
      
       
      
     40 His Honour noted submissions by counsel for the respondent that “the collection and viewing of the pornographic material is different in nature from the acts for which the accused stands charged... he (counsel for the respondent) says that the former is a one-sided cerebral activity”. His Honour noted a submission that the decision of the High Court in  
     BRS v The Queen 
      (1996-1997) 191 CLR 275 supported a submission “that evidence of fantasies cannot establish a guilty passion or a tendency to act in the ways alleged in the indictment”. 
      
       
      
     41 Judge Maguire accepted the submissions made by counsel for the respondent and ruled that all of the “tendency evidence” was inadmissible. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal 
        
       
      
     42 The Director of Public Prosecutions’ amended notice of appeal to this Court asserts that Judge Maguire erred in refusing to admit evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. Of the Probation and Parole officer … as not satisfying tests for admission under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 and/or, constituting inadmissible tendency evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Of the Complainant’s mother based on paragraphs 5 to 9 of her Statement of 27 March 2002, paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 of her Statement of 23 June 2003, as inadmissible tendency evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Of questions and answers 31, 56 to 57, 86 to 88; 99; 101; 107 to 109; 114 to 121; 125 to 153; 156 to 163; 168 to 173; and 177 to 183 of the accused’s ERISP with Police of 2 April 2002, as inadmissible tendency evidence”. 
         
        
       
      
     43 The judgment or order sought in the amended notice of appeal is:- 
      
       
        
         
         “1. An order vacating the judgment or order made by his Honour Judge Maguire. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court thinks fit”. 
         
        
       
      
     44 As previously indicated, the appeal is brought pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act,` 
      which provides:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case”. 
         
        
       
      
     45 Section 5F(5) provides:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Court of Criminal Appeal: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against”. 
         
        
       
      
     46 If this Court decides that a decision or ruling made by Judge Maguire and falling within the terms of the amended notice of appeal was erroneous, then this Court should clearly vacate that decision or ruling. However, if the Court does vacate such a decision or ruling, a question will arise, to which I will return later in this judgment, about whether this Court, having vacated a decision or ruling by Judge Maguire, should itself make some other decision or ruling. 
      
       
        
       The Probation and Parole officer’s evidence 
        
       
      
     47 I have already referred to parts of the officer’s statement, file notes and evidence in the voir dire hearing and to the part of Judge Maguire’s judgment relating to her evidence.  
      
       
      
     48 There was evidence to support each of Judge Maguire’s seven primary findings of fact about the officer and those findings of fact could not be successfully challenged. 
      
       
      
     49 Having made those primary findings of fact, Judge Maguire did not in terms say that the evidence which the Crown sought to adduce from the officer was evidence which had been unlawfully obtained but such a finding is clearly implicit in his Honour’s finding that the obtaining of the officer’s evidence was fundamentally flawed. The reason given by his Honour for such a finding was that the Probation and Parole officer had misconceived her functions and had undertaken functions, namely the investigation of criminal activity and the interrogation of suspects, which belonged to the Police Service and the Department of Corrective Services. 
      
       
      
     50 I am, with respect, unable to agree with the reason given by his Honour for his finding. At the second case meeting on 20 June 2002 the officer, as the member of the New South Wales Probation Service having the responsibility of supervising and guiding the respondent, who had pleaded guilty to and been convicted of an offence of possessing child pornography, formed a judgment that the respondent was not being honest in denying that he fantasised about having sex with children and made a further judgment that “supervision will need to focus on (the respondent) admitting his fantasies and then being able to challenge him on the possibility that he could act on his fantasises”. Pursuant to this judgment made by her, the officer questioned the respondent, with a view to eliciting admissions from him that he did have sexual fantasies about children. 
      
       
      
     51 I do not consider that it was open to the judge of first instance to find that, in proceeding as she did, the Probation and Parole officer “completely misconceived her duty” and assumed functions which could only properly be performed by the Police Service or the Department of Community Services. The officer was performing her functions as a Probation and Parole officer in the way in which she as an experienced officer considered they should be performed, in order that she should provide effective supervision and guidance for the respondent and I do not consider that it was open to Judge Maguire to find that the officer was wrong in deciding how she should perform her functions. In questioning the respondent the officer was not purporting to act as an agent of the Police Service. I accordingly consider that Judge Maguire’s finding, that evidence by the Probation and Parole officer of admissions made to her by the respondent was evidence improperly obtained because the officer had misconceived what her proper functions were, was erroneous and should be vacated. 
      
       
      
     52 Even if Judge Maguire’s finding, that the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer had been improperly obtained for the reason given by his Honour, had been correct, I consider that there were errors in his Honour’s exercise of the power to exclude improperly obtained evidence conferred by s 138 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . 
      
       
      
     53 His Honour did not expressly state the test in subs (1) of s 138, that is that the evidence which has been obtained improperly should not be admitted “unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained”. However, I would be prepared to accept that his Honour did apply the statutory test. 
      
       
      
     54 However, when referring to the matters in subs (3) of s 138, his Honour said, with reference to par (c) (“the nature of the relevant offence”), that he did not see the nature of the offences as having any particular bearing. One of the offences charged (charge five) was an offence of having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years and was a very serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty-five years. In  
     R v Dalley 
      (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal (Spigelman CJ at 172 (7) and Blanch AJ at 189 (102)) held that the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime is entitled to greater weight in a case of crimes of greater gravity both at common law and pursuant to s 138(3)(c). With reference to pars (d) and (e) of s 138(3), his Honour held that the impropriety was “of the gravest kind” and that the impropriety was deliberate. In my opinion, there was no evidence capable of supporting either of these findings. 
      
       
      
     55 I have already held that Judge Maguire’s finding, that evidence by the Probation and Parole officer was improperly obtained evidence for the reason given by his Honour, was erroneous and should be vacated. However, that does not necessarily mean that the evidence by the Probation and Parole officer would be admissible in a trial of the respondent. It may be that there is some other basis on which the evidence should be excluded under s 138. Before Judge Maguire counsel for the respondent submitted that the Probation and Parole officer’s evidence, if not excluded under s 138, should be excluded under s 90 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      (the discretion to refuse to admit evidence of admissions, if, having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence) or under s 137 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      (the obligation of a court to refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecution if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused). At the hearing before this Court other conceivable grounds on which the Probation and Parole officer’s evidence might be excluded were mentioned.  
      
       
      
     56 At the hearing before this Court counsel for the respondent submitted that this Court should itself decide all questions concerning the admissibility of the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer. Counsel for the Crown submitted that this Court should decide all questions of admissibility under s 138 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      but should not enter upon a consideration of other sections of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . 
      
       
      
     57 In my opinion, notwithstanding the power granted to this Court by s 5F(5)(b) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     , this Court should not in the present case take upon itself to decide any further questions concerning the admissibility of the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer (apart from Judge Maguire’s finding that the Probation and Parole officer’s evidence was also inadmissible as tendency evidence). The present appeal is an appeal by the Crown and par 1 of the Crown’s grounds of appeal, which relates to the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer, is limited to asserting that the judge of first instance erred in refusing to admit evidence “as not satisfying tests for admissibility under s 138 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      and/or constituting inadmissible tendency evidence”. More fundamentally, I consider that this Court as an appeal court should be cautious in taking upon itself to decide questions about the admissibility of evidence which have not been decided or even considered by a judge of first instance. This is particularly so, when the questions involve an exercise of discretion or the assessment and weighing of criteria such as “probative value” and “unfair prejudice”. I note that in  
     R v Sophear Em 
      [2003] NSWCCA 374, an appeal under s 5F(2) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act,  
     this Court held that a decision by the judge of first instance excluding certain evidence had been erroneous and should be vacated but considered it inappropriate to make any further ruling of its own about the admissibility of the evidence. As stated,  
     Sophear Em 
      was an appeal under s 5F(2) and not s 5F(3A), but the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal conferred by ss (5) of s 5F are the same in both kinds of appeal. 
      
       
        
       The “Tendency” Evidence 
        
       
      
     58 In his judgment Judge Maguire accepted submissions by counsel for the respondent that the collection and viewing of child pornography is different in nature from the criminal acts with which the respondent has been charged and that evidence of sexual fantasises by the respondent could not establish a tendency to act in the ways in which the Crown alleges the respondent acted. 
      
       
      
     59 It is not entirely clear on what basis his Honour rejected the evidence as being tendency evidence. Issues which can arise when evidence is tendered by the Crown in criminal proceedings as being evidence of a tendency on the part of the accused, include:- 
      
       
        
       (i) Is the evidence relevant as evidence of a tendency on the part of the accused (s 55 of the  
       Evidence Act) 
        
        
       (ii) If the evidence is so relevant, is the evidence adduced to prove that the person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way (s 97 of the  
       Evidence Act). 
        
        
       (iii) If the evidence is within s 97 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       , are pars (a) and (b) of s 97(1) complied with, that is was notice given of intention to adduce the evidence and does the court think that the evidence has significant probative value. In the present case notice was given. 
        
        
       (iv) If s 97(1) is complied with, does the probative value of the evidence substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused (s 101(2) of the  
       Evidence Act 
       ). 
        
       
      
     60 In his judgment Judge Maguire did not refer to either s 97(1) or s 101(2) of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . Any finding by his Honour that the evidence did not fall within s 97 would be a finding in favour of admitting the evidence, not excluding the evidence, because s 97 is a rule of exclusion of evidence. It would appear to me that his Honour held that evidence that the respondent collected and viewed child pornography and fantasised about sexual acts with children, regarded as evidence of a tendency the respondent had, was simply irrelevant, that is to say it was not evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of whether the respondent had committed any of the offences alleged by the Crown or, differently expressed, was not evidence that, if it were accepted, could establish any relevant tendency to act in a particular way. 
      
       
      
     61 I do not accept that the evidence, regarded as evidence of a tendency the respondent had, was irrelevant. Evidence that the respondent, as a person charged with offences of child sexual assault, had collected and viewed child pornography and had fantasised about sexual acts with children satisfies the criterion of relevance under s 55 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , in that the evidence is capable of rendering more probable that the respondent acted in the ways in which he is alleged by the Crown to have acted. In my opinion, no expert evidence was required in order to make such evidence admissible. It is in accordance with common human experience that a person who has had thoughts, particularly persistent thoughts, about some type of act is, at least to some extent, more likely to perform an act of that type than a person who has never had such thoughts. It is not to the point that many persons who fantasise about some act never actually do it. 
      
       
      
     62 A finding by Judge Maguire that the “tendency” evidence was irrelevant would be inconsistent with his Honour’s own finding, when considering par (a) of s 138(3) of the  
     Evidence Act  
     in relation to the Probation and Parole officer’s evidence, that the Probation and Parole officer’s evidence “clearly…has some probative value”. 
      
       
      
     63 In my opinion, any finding by his Honour that the “tendency” evidence was irrelevant derives no support from the decision of the High Court in  
     BRS v The Queen 
     . In  
     BRS 
     , a case decided under common law principles, the majority of the High Court held that evidence given by a witness W, not being the complainant H, that the accused had engaged in sexual acts with W using a lubricant and a towel, although admissible because it tended to confirm certain aspects of the complainant’s evidence about the presence of a lubricant and a towel, was not admissible as evidence of a propensity on the part of the accused and that the trial judge should have given the jury a direction that they could not rely on W’s evidence as evidence of propensity. The finding that W’s evidence was not admissible as evidence of propensity was based, not on its being irrelevant, but on its not satisfying the stringent common law principles for the admissibility of evidence of propensity. In  
     BRS 
      there was no evidence that the accused had collected or viewed pornography or that the accused had sexual fantasises and there was no consideration of such matters in the judgments. 
      
       
      
     64 I note that in the present case evidence that the respondent collected and viewed child pornography on the computer would be relevant (quite apart from any relevance as evidence of a tendency the respondent had) as being evidence tending to corroborate or confirm certain aspects of the complainant’s evidence, at least in relation to the first three counts in the indictment. 
      
       
      
     65 I have held that Judge Maguire’s decision, that all of the “tendency” evidence was inadmissible for the reasons given by him, was erroneous and should be vacated. On the interpretation I have put on Judge Maguire’s judgment, his Honour held that the “tendency” evidence was inadmissible simply on the basis of its being irrelevant and his Honour did not consider either s 97(1) or s 101(2) of the  
     Evidence Act 
      or any other provision of the  
     Evidence Act 
      which might be relevant. As in the case of the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer which I have already separately considered, I do not consider that this Court as an appeal court should take upon itself to decide questions of admissibility of evidence which were not decided or even considered by the judge of first instance and that, consequently, this Court should not make any decision in relation to the “tendency” evidence, beyond vacating Judge Maguire’s decision, leaving it to a trial judge to determine whether the evidence or parts of it should be admitted. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
     66 In my opinion, the orders this Court should make are that the appeal be allowed and that the orders made by Judge Maguire on 20 May 2004 rejecting evidence be vacated.

     REGINA v Ireanus UGOCHUKWU 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN AJA: On 15 February 2002 the applicant was found guilty of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited import contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), namely narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin, being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin. 
     
      
    2 The quantity of pure heroin the subject of the charge was 217.9 grams. The trafficable quantity of heroin under Schedule VI of the Customs Act is 2 grams pure. The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence is twenty-five years imprisonment and/or a fine of $500,000. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was found guilty by a jury and was sentenced on 19 April 2002 by Taylor DCJ to imprisonment for seven years and four months with a non-parole period of five years. In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In my opinion a sentence of 11 years imprisonment is appropriate for this sentence. I adjust that sentence pursuant to section 16G to seven years and four months. The sentence is further reduced to five years by reason of the subjective factors. The offender has been in custody since 15 February. He also spent 11 days in custody, bail refused, following his arrest. Ireanus Ugochukwu is convicted and sentenced to seven years and four months imprisonment. The sentence is taken to have been commenced on 4 February 2002 and I impose a non-prole period of five years to expire on 3 February 2007."" 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal and advances the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      1. His Honour erred in the imposition of sentence in imposing as a non-parole period a period in respect of which his Honour had previously reasoned should be the head sentence. 
       
       
      2. That the sentence imposed upon the appellant is excessive in all of the circumstances. 
       
      
    5 The facts found by the sentencing judge were that on 10 June 2001, officers from the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service identified a package from a random search which had arrived in Australia as postal mail through Australia Post. The package, which had arrived from Bangkok, Thailand, was examined and found to contain a black handbag, a pair of shoes, clothing and three envelopes. The package was x-rayed. This revealed a substance secreted in another package in the handbag. The package was then transferred to the Australian Customs Service. 
     
      
    6 On Monday 11 June 2001 the applicant attended the Formule-1 Motel, 178 Princes Highway, St Peters and prepaid in cash for a room from Tuesday 12 June to Thursday 14 June 2001. The applicant stated that he was booking the room for a friend from overseas. 
     
      
    7 On Tuesday 12 June, members of the Australian Federal Police, notified by the Australian Customs Service that the package had been seized, took possession of the package. The police physical evidence team found fine white powder concealed in the front and back of the handbag. Analysis revealed that the powder was heroin, the total weight being 326.6 grams. The package was reconstructed with an inert substance replacing the heroin and consigned to ""Ms Fiaona Dickson, Motel Formule-1, 178 Princes Highway, St Peters, 2044, New South Wales, Australia, 02-9519 0685."" The consignor details marked on the package were as follows: ""Supranee Phintong, 87 Wireless Road, Lumpini Patumwan, Bangkok, 10330 Thailand 01-2916145."" 
     
      
    8 The Federal Police attempted to deliver the reconstructed package to the motel on Wednesday 13 June 2001 but failed. Later that day, the applicant entered the motel and asked if anything had been delivered in the name of Fiaona Dickson. The staff informed him there was nothing in that name. He was also advised that a courier had attempted to deliver a package and a signature was required to effect delivery. The applicant also requested to extend the occupancy of the room until Friday 15 June 2001, again paying in cash. 
     
      
    9 About 9.29 am on Thursday 14 June 2001, the Federal Police again attempted to deliver the package to room 230. No person was present and the package was unable to be delivered. The Federal Police delivering the package then left an Australia Post calling card instructing the receiver to contact a mobile telephone number to arrange delivery. The Australian Federal Police subscribed to this mobile telephone. 
     
      
    10 At 5.19 pm a female identifying herself as Fiaona Dickson contacted the mobile telephone number left on the calling card. The female stated that she worked late and subsequently made arrangements for the package to be delivered the following day at 9.30am. The female stated that she might send a friend to collect the package on her behalf. Enquiries conducted with Telstra revealed the phone call to have originated from a Telstra pay phone located at 1 Seaview Street, near Marrickville Road, Dulwich Hill, which is approximately 500 metres from the applicant's premises. 
     
      
    11 About 9.19 am on Friday 15 June the applicant was seen entering the motel at St. Peters. A short time later he exited the motel and walked around the outside. He then remained outside the motel. At 9.28 am an Australian Federal Police officer, acting as a courier, attended the motel, whereupon the applicant approached him. The applicant stated that he was waiting to pick up a package. They then entered the foyer of the motel. The applicant then gave the Federal police officer a letter signed by Fiaona Dickson giving authority for the applicant to receive the package. The applicant walked away and exited the reception area of the motel. He then walked to a vehicle and proceeded to get into the car where he was arrested. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was conveyed to the Sydney office of the Australian Federal Police where he declined to participate in a record of interview. The Australian Federal police executed a search warrant at the applicant's residence and found in a rubbish bin a letter similar to the one handed to the courier giving permission to pick up the package. This was apparently signed ""F Dickson."" Also located during the search was a brochure for the Formule-1 Motel. 
     
      
    13 Enquiries conducted with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs indicated that the applicant had entered Sydney from overseas between 9 June 2001 and 15 June 2001. The street price of heroin at April 2002 was apparently $70 per cap (0.2 grams). Accordingly, the heroin could have realised approximately $100,000. 
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge found that the applicant was very active in facilitating delivery of the package. His Honour had no doubt that the person Fiaona Dickson did not exist. The sentencing judge found that the applicant booked the room at the motel in St Peters and maintained contact with the reception desk, staffed by one of the managers. He came and went from the motel as the delivery arrangements were delayed. He maintained a deceit concerning Miss Dickson, including the production of a letter of authority. He did everything that was practically open to ensure that he secured the package. However, his Honour found that there was no evidence that the applicant did anything more than facilitate the delivery of the package. He was arrested shortly after he picked it up and his role, if any, in the distribution from that point is not known. This was apparently a single importation of drugs. 
     
      
    15 His Honour found that it was difficult to attribute the applicant with actual knowledge of the quantity of narcotics. However, his Honour also found that the applicant's role in the venture was at the critical point of collection of the narcotics upon entry into Australia. The evidence suggests that the applicant had the role of a courier.  
     
      
    16 The applicant pleaded not guilty and his Honour accordingly found that he has not expressed any remorse or contrition.  
     
      
    17 With respect to subjective matters his Honour found the applicant to be thirty-eight years of age. He emigrated to Australia from Nigeria and is an Australian citizen. At the time of sentencing, he was expecting a child by his partner in a few months. Apart from the offence for which he was being sentenced, the applicant has apparently led an exemplary life in Australia. His Honour found the applicant to have been a hardworking and well regarded businessman by his employer and those who know him socially. 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge said when fixing the sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In fixing sentence I have to take into account the subject of remission or reduction and consistent with the principals [sic] explained in  
        DPP v Karahani  
        a reduction of one third is allowed."" 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour also recorded that the applicant had pleaded not guilty and, having regard to the requirements of s 17A of the Crimes Act, his Honour was satisfied that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate. 
     
      
    20 His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Prior good character is of reduced significance in drug matters. The usual leniency extended to a first offender is not of benefit to people convicted of drug offences,  
        R v Payne  
        105 A Crim R 474. In my opinion a sentence of 11 years imprisonment is appropriate for this sentence.  
        
       
      
    21 These remarks were immediately followed by the remarks his Honour made as to the adjustment of the sentence to which I have already referred. 
     
      
       
      Ground One 
       
      
    22 The applicant submits that the apparent confusion in his Honour's remarks as to the steps in computing the appropriate sentence reveals error. It is submitted that his Honour should be understood to have intended to impose a sentence of five years with some lesser non-parole period. I do not accept this submission. 
     
      
    23 Although an error in the expression of the appropriate elements of the sentence has undoubtedly occurred, I am satisfied that the sentencing judge has imposed the sentence which his Honour intended. Although it was expressed as a reduction in the ""sentence"" for ""subjective factors"", it is likely that his Honour was intending to refer to the non-parole period which he proposed to impose. In his immediately preceding statement his Honour had indicated that a ""sentence of 11 years imprisonment is appropriate for this (offence)"" but that this sentence should be adjusted pursuant to s 16G of the Crimes Act. Then, when imposing sentence, his Honour indicated that ""the sentence is taken to have been commenced on 4 February 2002 and I impose a non-parole period of five years to expire on 3 February 2007."" This statement is clear. 
     
      
    24 Accordingly, in my opinion, although an error may have occurred in his Honour's preliminary remarks, there can be no doubt that his Honour intended to impose a head sentence of seven years and four months with a non-parole period of five years. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two 
       
      
    25 In support of ground two, the applicant emphasises the fact that the sentencing judge found that there was no evidence that the applicant did other than facilitate the delivery of the package. His role in the distribution of its contents was unknown. Furthermore, it is emphasised that his Honour found that it was not possible to conclude that the applicant knew the actual quantity of narcotics which would be contained in the package. It is submitted that the applicant is to be regarded as at the lower end of the hierarchy involved in an importation of narcotics (see Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270). 
     
      
    26 The applicant's submissions drew attention to the applicant's previous good character. Emphasis is also placed on the fact that the total weight of pure heroin was 217.9 grams and there was no evidence as to the amount of money, if any, which the applicant would have received for his role in the importation. Attention is drawn to other cases which have resulted in an imposition of a sentence of less than that imposed on the applicant (see R v Lawless (unreported, NSWCCA, 24 June 1994: 440 grams, five years head sentence with three years non-parole). Attention is also drawn to R v Yu [1999] NSWCCA 6, R v Ho [1999] NSWCCA 440 and R v Hollins (unreported, NSWCCA, 31 May 1996). It is submitted that there have been a number of cases involving importation of heroin with a longer head sentence but a non-parole period of five years. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion, the sentence which his Honour imposed was within the appropriate range. This Court has, on many occasions, indicated that sentence appeals are not to be determined by a simple comparison with cases in which a lesser (or greater) sentence was imposed: see R v Jason Paul Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; R v Che Yook & Sae Sung (1995) 84 A Crim R 432. However, assistance can be gained from consideration of a range of sentences imposed in previous cases.  
     
      
    28 This Court considered the appropriate sentences for various drug offences in R v Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340. Although that decision was subsequently quashed by the High Court in Wong & Leung v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584, the reasons of the Chief Justice remain of considerable utility, as was pointed out in R v Taru [2002] NSWCCA 391 by Hidden J at [12] (with whom Levine and Howie JJ agreed): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Those guidelines remain useful notwithstanding the subsequent High Court decision arising from that case, because they were expressed to be based on the existing pattern of sentence at the time that the judgment was delivered. Indeed, much of the judgment of the Chief Justice was devoted to consideration of other cases and the patterns of sentence which emerged from them."" (See also  
        R v Marchando  
        [2003] NSWCCA 71;  
        R v Cerullo  
        [2003] NSWCCA 201;  
        R v Rivadavia & Ors  
        [2004] NSWCCA 284. 
        
       
      
    29 Wong & Leung indicates that a conventional range of sentence for cases involving mid-level trafficable quantities of heroin and cocaine: that is, between 200 grams and 1 kilogram is a head sentence of between 6 and 9 years. This was said to be the range of sentences which may apply to couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation. This range was provided in circumstances where an offender may have pleaded guilty and where he was being sentenced after a trial. 
     
      
    30 In the present case, although the applicant must not be penalised for the fact of his plea of not guilty, it means he was not entitled to any discount for his willingness to facilitate the course of justice nor for any expression of remorse or contrition. The quantity of heroin involved was in the mid-range in circumstances where the trial judge accepted that the applicant must have known that a significant quantity of heroin was being imported. There is no suggestion that the applicant required the drug for his own purposes. The only conclusion is that he was involved for the purpose of obtaining some financial gain. 
     
      
    31 Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had no prior convictions, both the head sentence and the non-parole period fell within the appropriate range. Although perhaps at the higher end of that range, I see no error in his Honour's decision. 
     
      
    32 I propose that the application for leave be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    33 ADAMS J: As the learned presiding judge has already said, this appeal is in part complicated by some unfortunate language appearing in the sentencing reasons of the learned sentencing judge. The crucial sentence is ""the sentence is further reduced to five years by reason of the subjective factors."" I agree with McClellan AJA that this appears to be a reference to the non-parole period which his Honour intended to impose. However, it is plain that a non-parole period is not set or reduced by reason of subjective as distinct from objective factors. Both objective and subjective factors are relevant to both the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
     
      
    34 I have, however, come to the conclusion that the sentence, if indeed it is correctly transcribed, was a garbled reference to the sentencing process and did not reflect the egregious error of thinking that a non-parole period is set at a lower level than the head sentence by reason of subjective factors. 
     
      
    35 Accordingly, that sentence must be disregarded. When this is done the balance of the process is clearly set out and demonstrates no error. 
     
      
    36 I agree with the conclusions of McClellan AJA that the sentence itself, although high, is not appealably wrong. 
     
      
    37 SMART AJ: I agree with the judgments which have been delivered. 
     
      
    38 McCLELLAN AJA: The orders of the court are that the application for leave be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 LEVINE J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: On the late evening of 6 May 2001, Romeo Nasr (the deceased) was driving a motor vehicle in Frederick Street, Campsie. His uncle, Fadi Nasr, was seated beside him as a passenger. Suddenly a gunman rushed towards the vehicle. He began firing a handgun, discharging seven bullets. Several hit the vehicle. One struck Romeo Nasr in the back, entering his heart. He died soon thereafter. 
     
      
    4 On 10 May 2001 Mr Abou-Chabake (the appellant) was arrested. He was charged with the murder of Romeo Nasr and the attempted murder of Fadi Nasr. On 19 November 2002 Mr Abou-Chabake stood trial before Howie J and a jury. He pleaded not guilty to each charge. On 2 December 2002 the jury found him guilty of the murder of Romeo Nasr, and not guilty of the attempted murder of Fadi Nasr. 
     
      
    5 The Notice of Appeal raises three grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1: 
         The appellant seeks leave to rely upon what is said to be ""fresh evidence"". He asserts that, had this evidence been before the jury, there is a significant possibility that he would have been acquitted. 
         
         
        Ground 2: 
         It is said that Manslaughter by an Unlawful and Dangerous Act was open, and should have been left to the jury as an alternative to Murder. No such directions were given by the learned trial Judge. 
         
         
        Ground 3: 
         Further, it is said that Manslaughter as a result of Excessive Self-Defence was open. It should have been left to the jury by the trial Judge. 
        
       
      
    6 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. He asserts that there was error in the sentence imposed by Howie J (20 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 15 years). His Honour ought to have found certain facts in mitigation.  
     
      
    7 I shall first describe the Crown case, attempting to follow a broad chronology. I will then deal with each ground of appeal and the complaints made against sentence. 
     
      
       
      The evidence called by the Crown. 
       
      
    8 At about 11.30 am on 6 May 2001, Romeo Nasr telephoned his cousin, Elias Sarkis. He wanted Mr Abou-Chabake's telephone number ""just to sort things out"". Mr Abou-Chabake managed a snooker hall and social club at Burwood. He lived with his parents and wife (Cheryl) on the ground floor of a block of units, 71 Frederick Street, Campsie. 
     
      
    9 Mr Bakhousse Hadid (""Bek"") also lived in Frederick Street, Campsie. Mr Abou-Chabake rang Mr Hadid at about 4.30 or 5.00 pm on 6 May 2001. He told him ""to come past, I am going to work"". Mr Hadid did so. He sat down inside the lounge room and they talked. Their conversation was interrupted by a telephone call on Mr Abou-Chabake's mobile phone. Mr Hadid heard Mr Abou-Chabake say, ""I'm coming out now"". He left the room. 
     
      
    10 Shortly after Mr Hadid heard a loud bang ""like a body hitting a colour bond fence"". He went to investigate, as did Mr Abou-Chabake's father. He saw Romeo Nasr on top of Mr Abou-Chabake. Both were throwing punches. He and Mr Abou-Chabake's father pulled them apart. Mr Abou-Chabake was then given a hand gun. 
     
      
    11 Neither the appellant nor his father gave evidence. Mr Hadid was the only witness to the fight who gave evidence. However, both he and Romeo Nasr spoke to a number of people in the hours following the fight, describing what had occurred. Evidence was given of these conversations. They were used as a basis for cross examining Mr Hadid, and were the foundation for the suggestion that the real fight was between Bek Hadid and Romeo Nasr. 
     
      
    12 A number of matters concerning the fight were clear. First, it was a physical fight between Mr Abou-Chabake and Romeo Nasr, no-one else. Mr Abou-Chabake sustained certain injuries. Mr Hadid attributed to him the following words, spoken later that evening, an hour or so before the shooting (T51): 
     
      
       
        
        ""My wrist is fucked, the way I smashed him, I smashed him."" 
        
       
      
    13 Mr Hadid could see that Mr Abou-Chabake's hand was swollen. Senior Constable Lowry made the same observation the next day as he searched Mr Abou-Chabake's home. He saw the swelling close to the knuckles, and blood at the base of one finger. Senior Const Lowry also noticed a graze on his left hand (T371).  
     
      
    14 Secondly, there was no real doubt as to what Mr Abou-Chabake did, even though his motives remained obscure. Romeo Nasr gave a consistent account of what had occurred. Andrew Abou-Chabake had taken what he termed ""a cheap shot"", that is, he had punched him without warning. He told his uncle by telephone the following: (T194) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I was walking up the driveway and got jumped by Andrew. He started punching me."" 
        
       
      
    15 His account to his friend, Michael Ishac, was in similar terms. Andrew Abou-Chabake had ""king hit him"" from the side, and they got into a fight (T133). 
     
      
    16 Thirdly, having been pulled apart, the fight ended when a gun was handed to Mr Abou-Chabake. It was given to him either by Mr Hadid or the appellant's father. According to Mr Hadid, Romeo Nasr was then heard to say: (T41) 
     
      
       
       ""I am not finished with you, I am still standing."" 
       
      
    17 The only confusion concerned who had handed Mr Abou-Chabake the gun. If it was Mr Hadid, what inference could or should be drawn from that fact? Mr Hadid, in his testimony, denied that he had provided the gun. He said he first saw the gun as he walked back to the house after the fight. It was in the possession of Mr Abou-Chabake's father. 
     
      
    18 Mr Hadid's account was strongly challenged in cross examination. Alice Nasr recounted a conversation with Mr Hadid shortly after the incident. He told her that before the fight Mr Abou-Chabake handed Mr Hadid a gun and some cash from the snooker hall. Mr Hadid had an association with Mr Abou-Chabake in that business. Mr Hadid said, according to Alice Nasr, that he was holding the gun when he heard the commotion outside. He put the cash to one side and went outside, still holding the gun. Mr Abou-Chabake asked him for the gun, so he gave it to him. The account of Ms Alice Nasr was put to Mr Hadid and denied. 
     
      
    19 Shortly after the fight, Romeo's uncle, Fadi Nasr, rang Mr Sarkis, a cousin of the deceased. He said, referring to Mr Hadid, ""Where's Bek, the little cunt? Did Bek run out with a gun and give it to Andrew, when he punched up with Romeo?"" (T31). Fadi Nasr, according to Mr Sarkis, added: (T35) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The little cunt wants to pull a gun on Romeo. Who does he think he is? He comes to my house to visit me. You bring him round. You catch up to him for me and get back to me."" 
        
       
      
    20 Later that evening Mr Hadid telephoned Mr Sarkis. According to Mr Sarkis, the following conversation took place: (T34) 
     
      
       
        
        (Mr Hadid) ""I heard that your uncle Fadi is after me?"" 
        
       
       
        
        (Mr Sarkis) ""What do you reckon, pulling out a gun on Romeo. What do you expect him to do?"" 
        
       
      
    21 Mr Hadid denied having pointed the gun at Romeo Nasr. He told Mr Sarkis he ran out and handed the gun to Andrew (Mr Abou-Chabake) (T36).  
     
      
    22 These conversations were the basis for the following suggestion put to Mr Fadi Nasr, the uncle of the deceased: (T236) 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Is it your position that, as far as you were aware, Romeo was looking for Andrew that night to have a fair fight with him, is that correct? 
         
        A. That's correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And do I take it by that answer that neither you nor Romeo were concerned about the man Bek? 
         
        A. No, not at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were concerned about the man Bek? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You weren't concerned, all right. That is simply not true, is it? 
         
        A. Yes, it is, it's true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Your main concern that night was Bek, wasn't it? 
         
        A. No, it wasn't."" 
        
       
      
    23 There was no evidence of any dispute between Romeo Nasr and Bek Hadid. Mr Hadid described himself as a friend of both Romeo Nasr and Mr Abou-Chabake. His Honour ultimately instructed the jury on this issue in these terms: (SU72) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Steirn did not put to the witnesses any other scenario as to what happened during the fight, and perhaps the only significance of this very truncated review of what is said to have happened in the fight is that there is no evidence to suggest let alone prove that it was Bec Hadid who had threatened the deceased with the gun. Quite the contrary, the account is that it was either the accused or his father."" 
        
       
      
    24 After the fight, Mr Hadid went back inside Mr Abou-Chabake's unit. Mr Abou-Chabake was very angry. Soon after Mr Hadid walked home. He phoned Romeo Nasr. According to his evidence, the conversation proceeded as follows: (T43) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. ... He answered. The first thing you said, he said, is, 'Where is Andrew now?' 
         
        A. Yes. I said, 'I don't know. I am not with him.' He goes, 'Tell him I am not finished with him.' I said, 'What was that about?' He said, 'Don't worry about it', and I said, 'Goodbye'."" 
        
       
      
    25 Some time after 6.00 pm Romeo Nasr telephoned a friend, Michael Ishac. He asked him to come to his home. Mr Ishac did so. Mr Steve Balbarki was already there. Larry Elters, a friend of both Romeo Nasr and Mr Abou-Chabake, was also present. Romeo Nasr had an icepack on his face. His face was swollen and bruised. He described what had happened. According to Mr Elters they talked for five or ten minutes before they went their separate ways. It was the night of the State of Origin football match. Each went home to watch the game. 
     
      
    26 According to Michael Ishac, before they parted, Romeo Nasr asked Steve Balbarki to call Andrew Abou-Chabake. He wanted them ""to meet and have a go like a man and get it over and done with"". If Michael Ishac and Steve Balbarki were present, it would be a fair fight. Steve Balbarki then made the call. Mr Ishac heard him say, ""Hello Andrew"" (T135). Mr Balbarki said that he was with Romeo who would like to ""meet up"". After the call the following conversation took place: (T136) 
     
      
       
        
        (Balbarki): ""Didn't want to meet up."" 
        
       
       (Romeo Nasr): ""See mate, he's a coward. He's a coward."" 
       
      
    27 The evidence put forward as ""fresh evidence"" is that of Mr Steve Balbarki. In essence (and I will come to the detail shortly) Mr Balbarki supports an alibi. He says that Mr Abou-Chabake was with him on the evening of 6 May 2001. They were alone watching the football. The game began some time after 8.00 pm. It ended soon after 10.00 pm. Mr Abou-Chabake remained for a further 20 minutes or more. The shooting was at 10.12 pm. 
     
      
    28 That evidence is completely at odds with the evidence of Mr Hadid, given at the trial. Mr Hadid said that Mr Abou-Chabake phoned him earlier in the evening. He suggested they go to Steve Balbarki's to watch the match. He picked him up in his car. Mr Balbarki lived around the corner at 44 Moore Street, Campsie. According to Mr Hadid, Mr Balbarki was on the phone when they arrived. He said he had been speaking to Romeo Nasr who wanted a fight ""one on one"". The appellant responded: (T50) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I don't want to fight him. He will come and stab me or something."" 
        
       
      
    29 They watched the game for a time. Someone telephoned Mr Hadid. He walked outside but could hear Mr Abou-Chabake speaking loudly to someone. Mr Abou-Chabake then said to Mr Hadid: ""Let's go home."" According to Mr Hadid, they then left in Mr Abou-Chabake's car. Mr Abou-Chabake dropped him off at his home at Frederick Street, Campsie, and continued on. 
     
      
    30 Having arrived home, Mr Hadid said that he remained there for half an hour. He then rang Steve Balbarki, who invited him back to watch the rest of the game. He walked over to Mr Balbarki's home, which was in an adjacent street. He saw Elias Sarkis and his friend, Errol Erkin. Aref Boutros arrived at Steve Balbarki's shortly after 10.00 pm, just as the game was finishing (although Mr Hadid later amended that time to 9.00 pm or thereabouts). He and Mr Boutros drove to a Chinese takeaway restaurant which was close by. They then drove back to the home of Steve Balbarki. Mr Hadid said that whilst he was sitting on Mr Balbarki's balcony, Mr Abou-Chabake ""rocked up"". Mr Hadid said he remained at Mr Balbarki's for a further 10 or 20 minutes. 
     
      
    31 It was put to Mr Hadid that he had made up the story about going to the Chinese restaurant to distance himself from the area at the time of the shooting (T79). Mr Hadid denied that suggestion. 
     
      
    32 Mr Boutros gave evidence. He said he telephoned Mr Hadid and made arrangements to pick him up at Mr Balbarki's home at Moore Street. He arrived between 9.00 and 10.00 pm. They then went to the Chinese restaurant, which closed at 10.00 pm. He drove Mr Hadid back to Moore Street. He saw a couple of people, including Mr Abou-Chabake. 
     
      
    33 Mr Boutros, it has to be said, was not a satisfactory witness. He made two statements to the police. The second contradicted the first, as he acknowledged (T187). He said in his second statement that he went to the Chinese restaurant by himself. He had not seen Mr Hadid and had not returned to Steve Balbarki's home. He had not seen Mr Abou-Chabake. 
     
      
    34 Mr Boutros explained the contradiction by saying that he had been bashed. He was a frightened man (T187). He was suffering from a psychiatric condition which had affected his memory. Nonetheless, he said in his evidence that the first statement was the truth. The second statement was false (T187). He had seen Mr Abou-Chabake at Mr Balbarki's home at a time, inferentially, which was after the match. 
     
      
    35 Fadi Nasr, the deceased's uncle, invited Romeo to his home to watch the match. Romeo arrived shortly after it began. His face was badly bruised. He was holding an icepack against it. He was agitated and distressed. He made a number of telephone calls during the match. Just before the game finished, Romeo said to his uncle that he was shocked by what had happened. He wanted to settle the score (T196). He wanted an explanation for what had happened. He intended to drive past Andrew's house. According to his uncle, he said this: (T215) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Uncle, I want to go down and take the mother fucker one-on-one. Show him who is a man."" 
        
       
      
    36 Mr Ishac gave evidence along the same lines. He said this: (T137) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did you hear from him again that night? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that by way of a telephone call? 
         
        A. Yes it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Romeo say something in the conversation? 
         
        A. I believe he said he was with his uncle and he was going down to Campsie to sort the situation out."" 
        
       
       
      The shooting. 
       
      
    37 Mr Fadi Nasr decided to accompany his nephew as he drove to Frederick Street. Romeo stopped the car outside Mr Abou-Chabake's home. He called out several times: (T198) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Andrew, come out you dog. Come out and fucking finish what you started."" 
        
       
      
    38 Fadi Nasr said that he saw the lights in the house go off. He saw someone through the curtains (T197). No-one came out. 
     
      
    39 Romeo Nasr then drove to the other end of Frederick Street. He intended to visit his cousin, Elias Sarkis. However, it was obvious that he was not at home. He then did a U-turn and again drove slowly up Frederick Street. About 20 metres along Frederick Street Fadi Nasr saw Mr Abou-Chabake ""running out and just started shooting at us"" (T199). He saw his face clearly (T199). He said this: (T199) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What was the vehicle doing as this was happening? 
         
        A. As Andrew came out and started shooting one, two, three Romeo started swerving the car trying to dodge the bullets then he's ducked and I ducked. As he went past kept shooting, Andrew kept shooting. Then I got up and had a quick look at the back of me and noticed Andrew kept shooting at the back of the car. I turned around and looked at Romeo. He had all blood coming down the side of his face and then his head hit the steering wheel ..."" 
        
       
      
    40 Mr Nasr said that the appellant was about 15 metres away when he started shooting. The vehicle was travelling at about 20 or 30 kph. The area was well lit. Mr Abou-Chabake was wearing ""a grey sloppy joe sports jumper"" and trousers like ""black track suit pants"" (T201). 
     
      
    41 A resident in the block next door to Mr Abou-Chabake, Ms In Sook Park was called. On the evening of 6 May 2001 she heard a male shout out, ""Andrew"". About a minute later she heard something that sounded like three or four gunshots. 
     
      
    42 Ms Julie Hong lived in the same block (69 Frederick Street, Campsie). She gave the following evidence: (T103) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What do you recall hearing? 
         
        A. It was a loud voice. It said, 'Come out, Andrew', a name that I couldn't recognise 'is looking for you. I know you're in there, I will come back for you.'"" 
        
       
      
    43 Ms Hong saw an old blue Laser Hatchback (which was Romeo Nasr's car) drive past, down Frederick Street. One or two minutes later she saw the same car coming back along Frederick Street. 
     
      
    44 A resident in an adjacent street, Mr Darren Fellew, gave evidence of noises he heard at 10.12 pm, which were like a car backfiring or gunshots. He said this: (T147) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Like there was three, then a pause, then one, then a pause, then another three."" 
        
       
      
    45 Mr Anthony Karam was in Moore Street when he heard gunshots. He worked as a security guard and was familiar with the sound of a weapon being fired. It was about 10.10 pm. At that moment his mobile phone rang. He stopped his car on the corner of Moore Street and Frederick Street to take the call. He then noticed a male walking from Frederick Street into Moore Street. It was very dark. He could see, nonetheless, that the male was of medium build. He was wearing dark pants and a long sleeved top which was also dark, but not as dark as his pants (T57). 
     
      
       
      The identification evidence. 
       
      
    46 The police questioned Mr Nasr at the Canterbury Hospital. He was asked whether he knew the identity of the shooter. He said that he did not. He added: 
     
      
       
       ""I do not know who would want to shoot at us."" 
       
      
    47 The police also asked for a description. The description provided by Mr Nasr was consistent with the appellant, but so general as to be worthless. That night Mr Nasr went with the police to the scene. Again, nothing was said to implicate Mr Abou-Chabake. 
     
      
    48 Mr Nasr later that evening made a formal statement. He did not identify Mr Abou-Chabake. Indeed, he said it was too dark. Everything had happened too quickly to be able to identify the person responsible. The statement made no reference to the fight that afternoon between his nephew and Mr Abou-Chabake. He did say, however, that Romeo was on his way to see ""an Andrew"".  
     
      
    49 The police interviewed Mr Abou-Chabake on 7 May 2001. The same day they searched his home. However, he was not charged. He was allowed to leave the police station. 
     
      
    50 The following day, 8 May 2001, a large group of relatives and friends of Romeo Nasr went to the Campsie Police Station. They asked to see Detective Wood, who was in charge of the investigation. They wanted to know why Mr Abou-Chabake had been allowed to leave. Detective Wood explained that there was no evidence against Mr Abou-Chabake. Shortly thereafter (as Detective Wood acknowledged) Mr Fadi Nasr presented himself, wishing to make a further statement. His second statement identified Mr Abou-Chabake as the person responsible. 
     
      
    51 When cross examined, Mr Nasr acknowledged that he had lied to the police when first questioned. He had deliberately withheld information because he said he was in a state of shock and was in fear. He had seen Andrew Abou-Chabake, whom he knew. Mr Abou-Chabake had also seen him (T225). He feared retribution. He said this: (T232) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. I concealed his identity because I feared for my life and my family's life. Simple as that."" 
        
       
      
    52 Mr Nasr said that immediately after the shooting he trusted no-one. He had a young baby. He wanted to reassure himself that his family was safe (T230). Having satisfied himself that they were, he then made the second statement. He denied having made that statement at the urging of friends and relatives, turning surmise into recognition of the assassin. 
     
      
    53 Mr Nasr's evidence was attacked as implausible. Romeo was his favourite nephew. He was like a younger brother to him. He had been shot and was now dead. Mr Nasr, as a passenger in the vehicle, had also been put at risk. According to the appellant, had he known the identity of the shooter, he would have disclosed it immediately. The suggestion that he was in fear should be rejected. Even in his first statement, he had disclosed that Romeo had intended to see ""an Andrew"". 
     
      
    54 There is obviously some force in each of these arguments. Not surprisingly, his Honour warned the jury to approach the evidence of Mr Nasr with caution, conscious of these matters and conscious of the dangers of identification evidence (SU 36-62). 
     
      
       
      Suggestions of drug dealing. 
       
      
    55 A number of witnesses, including Mr Fadi Nasr, were cross examined concerning their knowledge of the deceased's involvement with drugs. The deceased had a criminal record. It included a conviction for supplying drugs, and convictions for robbery and fraud. There was no suggestion, on the other hand, that Mr Abou-Chabake was involved with drugs (T412). When the deceased's clothing was examined, two ""deals"" of cocaine were found concealed within his underwear. His girlfriend, Ms Paula Nassour, said that she could not introduce Romeo (whom she had known for a year) to her parents because he was known to be involved in drugs (T336). Mr Hadid said that he knew the deceased was a drug dealer because he had been to gaol for a drug offence. Mr Ishac, who regarded the deceased as one of his best friends, knew of his conviction. He had been required to undertake periodic detention. It was his belief, however, that he was no longer selling drugs (T145). Mr Larry Elters said that he had no knowledge of Romeo dealing in drugs, although he was more close to him than his own brother. 
     
      
    56 This material was used by the defence as the foundation for a suggestion that there was a reasonable possibility that the death of Romeo Nasr was in some way connected to drug dealing. 
     
      
       
      The Crown's circumstantial case. 
       
      
    57 Apart from the identification evidence of Fadi Nasr, the Crown relied upon a circumstantial case. The following circumstances, according to the Crown, irresistibly pointed to Mr Abou-Chabake as the person who fired the shots: 
     
      
    · First, in the context of a shooting of Romeo Nasr which occurred at 10.12 pm, there had been a fight between Romeo Nasr and Mr Abou-Chabake shortly after 5.00 pm. It had not been a trivial dispute. The deceased, according to the Crown, had been lured to Mr Abou-Chabake's home. Then, without warning, he had been forcibly struck on the jaw. 
     
      
    · Second, the fight had only ended after a gun had been given to Mr Abou-Chabake. Mr Abou-Chabake plainly had access to a gun later that evening. 
     
      
    · Third, the fight had not ended with the parties shaking hands. It had ended with a challenge by Romeo Nasr to the appellant (""I'm not finished with you.""). 
     
      
    · Fourth, in the hours that followed, Romeo Nasr had endeavoured, through friends, and principally through Steve Balbarki, to arrange a ""fair fight"" with Mr Abou-Chabake. Mr Abou-Chabake had refused to meet him. 
     
      
    · Fifth, some time shortly after 10.00 pm, Romeo Nasr determined that he would look for Mr Abou-Chabake ""to have the matter out"". That was his intention according to his uncle, Fadi Nasr, and according to his friend, Michael Ishac, who spoke to him on the telephone. 
     
      
    · Sixth, Romeo Nasr had then driven with his uncle to Frederick Street, Campsie. He had stopped his vehicle outside Mr Abou-Chabake's home and again challenged him. The challenge was heard by neighbours, including Ms Hong. Ms Hong heard Romeo Nasr say: ""Come out Andrew ... I know you're in there. I will come back for you."" 
     
      
    · Seventh, a minute or so later, having driven to the end of the street and then made a U-turn, Romeo Nasr drove slowly along Frederick Street towards Mr Abou-Chabake's home. He was then shot in Frederick Street not far from the appellant's home. 
     
      
    · Eighth, there were two people in the vehicle, Romeo Nasr and his uncle. It was Romeo Nasr who was shot, not his uncle. 
     
      
    · Ninth, very shortly after the shooting, Mr Karam, whilst seated in his vehicle on the corner of Moore Street and Frederick Street, saw a male of medium build. Mr Abou-Chabake was a man of medium build. The person was wearing clothes consistent with those described as having been worn by Mr Abou-Chabake that day. He was walking towards Moore Street. Steve Balbarki lived in Moore Street. Mr Abou-Chabake was said to have ""rocked up"" to Steve Balbarki's home at a time which, by inference, was shortly after the shooting. 
     
      
    58 Against that background, the Crown made a submission in these terms, as recorded by his Honour in the summing up: (SU79) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown submits that, on this evidence considered as a whole, that you would find there is no possibility that coincidentally someone else had decided to shoot the deceased and chose Frederick Street to do it and at a time just after the deceased had left the accused's home and just before he returned to the vicinity of the accused's house."" 
        
       
      
    59 Counsel for Mr Abou-Chabake sought to meet that case by pointing to a number of matters. First, it was said that there was no motive for Mr Abou-Chabake to carry out what was, in effect, an execution-style murder. Secondly, Mr Abou-Chabake was a person of good character. You would not expect such behaviour from a person of good character. Thirdly, Mr Abou-Chabake behaved after these events in a way which was not consistent with a person who knew himself to be guilty. At a time when the police were searching his home, he returned home. He attended the police station on 10 May, knowing the police wished to speak to him. He was then arrested. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Constable May. 
       
      
    60 On the day following the shooting, the police canvassed the area. Constable May knocked on the door of Mr Abou-Chabake's home at 71 Frederick Street, Campsie. He spoke to the appellant and his father. He had with him a form which he completed as he went from house to house. He specifically asked whether anyone was home the previous night. The ""younger man"" (the appellant) said that he had been working at a club near Mac's Liquor in Burwood and did not see anything. The ""older man"" (his father) said that he had been out that night visiting relatives. Nobody was home. 
     
      
    61 When cross examined, Constable May acknowledged that he could not recall what everyone had said to him that day. He had simply completed the form, ticking a box according to whether they were home or not. He spoke to many people that day. He had been asked the following day by a senior officer to recall what had been said when he went to 71 Frederick Street. He then provided that officer with his best recollection, The following questions were asked by counsel for Mr Abou-Chabake: (T307) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You said to this court 'Mr Chabake', that's the accused, 'handed me back the completed form and said words to the effect of, 'I was working at a club near Mac's Liquor in Burwood. I didn't see anything.' When you say 'words to the effect', you mean by that that's your best recollection, don't you? 
         
        A. Yeah, my best recollection. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You're not suggesting for a moment they were the actual words said, are you? 
         
        A. I'm just suggesting words to the effect of. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. See, I suggest to you he used the word 'Liquorland' and not 'Mac's'? 
         
        A. I don't know."" 
        
       
      
    62 Having set out the evidence at some length, I am now in a position to address each of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at the trial of fresh evidence. 
       
      
    63 The authorities in respect of fresh evidence have recently been collected and analysed by Giles JA in R v Bikic [2002] NSWCCA 227, and Heydon JA in R v M [2002] NSWCCA 66 at paras 61-64; see also R v Sleiman [2003] NSWCCA 231 paras 101-105. The test was stated by Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 518-520 (McTiernan, Stephen and Jacob JJ agreeing). It was reaffirmed in Lawless v The Queen  (1979) 142 CLR 659 by Mason J at 674-5 (Barwick CJ and Aiken J agreeing). The principles may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
    · First, a distinction is made between ""new evidence"" and ""fresh evidence"". Fresh evidence is evidence not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial by the exercise of due diligence. 
     
      
    · Second, great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial (Ratten v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 512). 
     
      
    · Third, the Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301). 
     
      
    · Fourth, the issue of whether there has been a miscarriage is to be approached on a number of levels, depending upon the order sought (whether a verdict of acquittal or a new trial), and the capacity of the new or fresh evidence to sustain the order sought. 
     
      
    · Fifth, where a verdict of acquittal is sought and the new evidence is of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction, or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the guilty verdict will be quashed and the appellant discharged. In such circumstances, it does not matter whether the evidence is fresh or simply new (Ratten v The Queen (supra) Barwick CJ at 518/519; cf Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 398/399). 
     
      
    · Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively:· Is the evidence fresh?· If it is, is it ""credible"" or at least capable of belief (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 395), or ""plausible"" (Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301)?· If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Brennan J at 410) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Mason and Deane JJ at 402)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey & Gaudron JJ at 301-302. 
     
      
    · Seventh, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not an abstract investigation of truth (cf an Inquiry under s474D Crimes Act 1900). It is an investigation in the context of the adversarial nature of a criminal trial. Where deliberate tactical decisions are made on the part of the accused as to the evidence that should or should not be called, and the issues that should or should not be pursued, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such decisions, even though it is conceivable that other decisions or something else may have worked rather better (Ratten v The Queen (supra) at 517). 
     
      
    64 Here, a new trial is sought. It was not suggested that the evidence put forward as ""fresh evidence"" demonstrated innocence or was of such cogency that, without more, it gave rise to a reasonable doubt. It was evidence to be weighed with other evidence called at the trial. According to the appellant, had it been before the jury, it is likely that he would have been acquitted. The appellant must therefore demonstrate that the evidence is both ""fresh"" and credible. 
     
      
    65 As mentioned, the evidence put forward as ""fresh evidence"" is that of Mr Steve Balbarki (supra para 27). The appellant also relied upon affidavits from Mr Georges Elias, his solicitor, and Mr Clive Steirn SC who appeared for Mr Abou-Chabake at the trial. 
     
      
       
        
        No evidence from Mr Abou-Chabake. 
        
       
      
    66 Before going to Mr Balbarki's evidence, I should deal with one aspect that arose in the course of argument. Mr Abou-Chabake did not give evidence at his trial. His solicitor and counsel each swore affidavits in which they stated that Mr Abou-Chabake instructed them, during the course of the trial, that he was innocent. He claimed he was with Mr Steve Balbarki at the time of the shooting. On this appeal there was, however, no evidence from Mr Abou-Chabake. In circumstances where he was seeking to persuade the Court that there had been a miscarriage of justice, there was argument as to whether the absence of an affidavit from the appellant might be used as the basis for an inference adverse to him. 
     
      
    67 The appeal having been argued on 10 and 25 June 2004, and the decision having been reserved, the appellant then sought leave to reopen the appeal in order to permit further affidavit evidence. The Court wrote to the appellant (with a copy to the respondent) requiring written submissions, accompanied by such affidavit evidence as the appellant sought to rely upon. On 11 August 2004 the appellant provided further written submissions, together with affidavits from Mr Abou-Chabake and his wife. The submissions included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""4. The appellant seeks to have the hearing of the appeal re-opened so that this evidence may be received. The only purpose for adducing the evidence is to meet the concerns of the members of the Court regarding the drawing of possible adverse inferences from the absence of such evidence on the appeal. The evidence is not sought to be used in any positive way - it is accepted that the evidence was reasonably available at the time of the trial and cannot be regarded as fresh evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Even if the evidence is not received, the appellant maintains the submission made in oral argument that the Court should not draw any adverse inference from the absence of such evidence (T69-72). In particular, reference is made to the submission made at T69.30 that it never occurred to counsel for the appellant that it would be necessary or appropriate that the appellant (and, by inference, his wife) should give evidence on the appeal ."" 
        
       
      
    68 The Crown opposed the reopening. The evidence was not fresh, as the appellant acknowledged. The Crown added: 
     
      
       
        
        "".... the Crown does not submit that an adverse inference against the appellant should be drawn by reason of this material not being given in evidence."" 
        
       
      
    69 On 31 August 2004 the Court determined that it would not reopen the appeal. The affidavits of the appellant and his wife were not put forward as new evidence that ought to be received in support of a verdict of acquittal. They could not be regarded as fresh evidence (in support of a new trial). They should therefore not be admitted on this appeal. However, no adverse inference should be drawn from the absence of an affidavit from the appellant.  
     
      
       
        
        Is the evidence fresh? 
        
       
      
    70 Is the evidence of Mr Balbarki ""fresh evidence"", that is, evidence not available, actually or constructively, at the time of the trial? Mr Abou-Chabake (and his lawyers) certainly knew of Mr Balbarki and his whereabouts. They knew, on the appellant's case, that his evidence would assist the appellant, corroborating an alibi. However, the solicitor for the appellant, Mr Elias, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""5. Before the trial, I made several attempts to speak to Steve Balbarki. I was never able to make contact with him. I formed the firm opinion that he was deliberately avoiding talking to me. I also formed the opinion that he was afraid of something in relation to the trial. I had no idea what he would say if he testified at the trial. In those circumstances, the defence team acting under instructions for the appellant at his trial made a decision not to subpoena Steve Balbarki to give evidence."" 
        
       
      
    71 Mr Steirn SC had the same understanding. Detective Hallinan gave evidence in the Crown case that he had tried to interview Mr Balbarki and had been met with the following response: (T281) 
     
      
       
        
        ""No, I'm not giving you a statement. You're going to have to deal with my solicitor if it comes to that."" 
        
       
      
    72 However, the Crown submitted, and with some plausibility, that the decision not to pursue Mr Balbarki was an informed tactical decision. A subpoena could have been issued, and an attempt made to confer with him at court to determine what he would say. The accused may even have asked for a Basha type enquiry in the absence of the jury. Instead, according to the Crown, they saw it as ""more tactically advantageous"" to exploit Mr Balbarki's absence from the Crown case. In his closing address, Mr Steirn SC made the following submission: (T471) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown said to you that there is no evidence that [Beck] was the shooter. I must say for our part we do not suggest [Beck] was the shooter but this court is not being told the truth as to what occurred that night.  
        There is a conspiracy of silence, we put to you, as to what actually occurred and the key witness in this matter, Steve Balbarki, has simply refused to assist police 
         - not only key witness but a material witness. He lives at 44 Moore Street, the T intersection cross-section at the bottom of Frederick Street. We have heard no evidence from him whatsoever. On any view of it he is the person who can alibi [Beck] and can assist the Crown to get to the truth of what occurred. As I say, this Court is not being told the full story and  
        if you come to that view that the court is not being told the full story you cannot convict my client. ..."" 
        
       
      
     (emphasis added) 
     
      
    73 His Honour took up that aspect in his summing up where he said this: (SU 64) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... you can have regard to the fact that some relevant evidence has not been placed before you, such as what Balbarki might have been able to say if he had been prepared to co-operate. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not mean by that that you can infer anything from his failure to give police a statement, or that you should speculate on what he might have said had he done so. But if you feel that there may be a gap left in the evidence led by the Crown in this part of the case, or that, as Mr Steirn put it, you are not being told the whole truth by the witnesses called, you may as a result be less likely to draw the inference that the Crown asks you to do from the facts that are before you. You might find that you are not prepared to draw the conclusion the Crown asks you to draw with sufficient confidence to be able to act upon it."" 
        
       
      
    74 An issue arose during the trial which turned on whether Mr Balbarki (and another individual) could, for the purposes of the Evidence Act 1995, be regarded as ""a person"" who is ""not available"", permitting (under s65(2)) the reception of statements which would otherwise be excluded as hearsay. The Dictionary to the Act defines a person as ""unavailable"" if, amongst other things, the following were proved: 
     
      
       
        
        ""4(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if: 
         
          
           
          (f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    75 In the course of argument, the following exchange took place between counsel for Mr Abou-Chabake and his Honour: (T388) 
     
      
       
        
        ""STEIRN: Well, I place my submission on the word 'reasonable', your Honour. We have had a Detective Sergeant of Police speak to him on the phone. I appreciate technically subpoenas should have been taken out and that sort of thing, but I just say by way of example, in the case of Balbarki, the prosecution made no attempt to take out a subpoena because they knew it would be useless in all of the circumstances. That's not uncommon. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: They don't have to rely upon a provision of an Act that has a definition. The difficulty for you is whether or not you have taken all reasonable steps to secure his or her attendance. It's hard to say they have without issuing a subpoena."" 
        
       
       
        
        STEIRN: He has told Detective Sergeant Wood, even if your Honour was to issue a warrant, that would not succeed. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I think a warrant might succeed."" 
        
       
      
    76 Yet nothing was done to secure the presence of Mr Balbarki. Mr Balbarki, of course, gave evidence on this appeal, having been subpoenaed. The appellant would argue, no doubt, that the circumstances were different in that the appellant had since been convicted, which Mr Balbarki found disturbing because he believed him innocent. 
     
      
    77 I accept that before the trial Mr Balbarki had refused to make a statement to the police or to the solicitors for Mr Abou-Chabake. I further accept that he did not want to be involved. I would have expected, nonetheless, that attempts would have been made to at least subpoena Mr Balbarki to secure his presence at Court in the hope that he would speak to the lawyers acting for the accused. 
     
      
    78 Here, it is really not surprising that Mr Balbarki was not subpoenaed to appear at the trial. By the time of the trial, the decision had been taken as to the way in which the case would be run by the defence. Mr Steirn SC said that it was his understanding before the trial began that his client would not be giving evidence (T35). Mr Abou-Chabake would not rely upon an alibi. No alibi notice had been served, as required by s48 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It would not be suggested that Mr Abou-Chabake was with Mr Balbarki.  
     
      
    79 Such a course had a number of advantages. Apart from the suggestion that the Crown case was deficient by reason of the absence of Mr Balbarki, it opened up another possibility. Senior Counsel, in his final address, said that the Crown had not excluded, as a reasonable possibility, that Mr Abou-Chabake was at work in Burwood on the evening of the shooting. This was an alibi of sorts (although different from the alibi that is now put forward), arising from the evidence called by the Crown. Mr Steirn SC made the following submission to the jury in his closing address: (T483-484) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is something else I really need to deal with and it is this; we are unable to say who shot the deceased that night. The evidence discloses that. We were not there.  
        You recall the evidence of Constable May who spoke to the deceased (sic; accused) the very next day and the deceased (sic; accused) told him that he was at work and there is no evidence to the contrary.  
         One assumes that, having given that version, that would have been checked out, but you can only speculate.  
        There is no evidence to suggest he was not at work.  
        The only evidence contrary to that is the evidence of Bek. Even Bek, I suggest to you, gives some confirmatory evidence that the accused intended to go to work that day because in evidence he gave when the Crown called him I suggest to you he, in effect, slipped up because he told you that Andrew was going to drop him off at Steve Balbarki's place then go off to work. I am just trying to find that reference. I will come back to that. That is some confirmatory evidence, I suggest to you, which confirms that the accused's stated intention was to go to work that day and we have the evidence of Constable May who he told the very next day where he was and therefore was not at the scene."" 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    80 Counsel added, referring to the evidence of Bek Hadid: (T485) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He is the only person apart from Boutros who puts the accused in the immediate area. That much is inconsistent with what the accused told Constable May and it is inconsistent with what [Beck] told you, that the stated intention of the accused was to go to work that day. You have heard evidence of Detective Sgt Wood that the accused does or did in fact own a snooker parlour or billiard room in Burwood Road Burwood."" 
        
       
      
    81 In the tactical decision to pursue or not pursue Mr Balbarki, no doubt Counsel and the client were very conscious of the inconsistency between the suggestion that Mr Abou-Chabake was with Mr Balbarki that evening, and the account Constable May said Mr Abou-Chabake gave him the next day (that he was at work). If the defence put forward the suggestion (through Mr Balbarki) that Mr Abou-Chabake was with Mr Balbarki, the Crown could have sought a direction that the contradictory statements provided by the appellant as to his whereabouts were capable of being regarded as lies, told with a consciousness of guilt (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193). 
     
      
    82 In short, I believe the decision not to further pursue Mr Balbarki was made for sound tactical reasons. One may doubt in these circumstances that his evidence can be regarded as ""fresh evidence"".  
     
      
    83 However, a number of authorities have emphasised the ""great latitude"" that must be accorded to an accused in determining whether evidence is ""fresh"" (Leuschel v Police (1999) 75 SASR 231; Ilic and Sammut (2000) 117 A Crim R 378). In Ilic and Sammut the accused were charged with unlawful wounding and other offences as a result of an incident outside a nightclub. On appeal, Ilic sought to rely upon evidence from three new witnesses. Two were crowd controllers who said that they had not gone to the police because of a confidentiality agreement with their employer. The other was Ilic's employer. Ipp J said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[57] Ordinarily, where the evidence was available, and the accused knew that the witness in question existed, and ought to have realised that the witness might be able to give relevant testimony, the evidence will not be regarded as fresh, even though the accused had no actual knowledge of what the witness might say:  
        Lawless 
         per Barwick CJ (at 666) and Mason J (at 677); see also  
        Mickelberg 
         (1989). It is accepted, however, that in a criminal trial 'great latitude' is afforded to an accused in determining whether evidence is fresh or only new ... "" 
        
       
      
    84 Speaking of the due diligence that can be expected of an accused person facing trial, Ipp J added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[71] Firstly, although Ilic did not pursue Mirosevich, Johnston and Douglas with due diligence, it is apparent that, had he done so, it is highly unlikely that they would have agreed to tell him what they knew. Both Mirosevich and Johnston indicated that they would not speak without the authority of their employer. They were not given authority to speak to the police or to anyone else. It is for that reason that they did not come forward prior to the trial and inform the prosecution of what they knew. Douglas was asked by the police for information, but omitted to give them the statements by Mirosevich and Johnston that had been given to him. In effect, he lied to the police by telling them that he had no information about the charges brought against Ilic. Douglas knew that Ilic was being charged and that the statements would assist Ilic, but he did not give the statements to the authorities. He deliberately provided as little information to the police as possible.  
        In summary, prior to the trial, the attitude of these three witnesses was one of obstructiveness and complete unco-operation. In the circumstances, I do not think that their evidence was 'available' to Ilic. 
        
       
       
        
        [72] Secondly, although Ilic did not pursue inquiries with due diligence, and deliberately decided not to press Mirosevich and Johnston for information, I am satisfied that he did so because of his view of their personal attitude to him and his belief that they would not assist him. Relevantly, he did not refrain from making inquiries because he suspected that they would produce evidence against him, or because he was making a tactical decision in regard to the conduct of the trial. He was motivated solely by a subjective view that their feelings would be antagonistic to him and a belief that they would not help. In regard to the latter I consider, for the reasons I have expressed, that he was correct in his assessment."" 
        
       
        
      (emphasis added) 
       
      
    85 Here, as stated, the failure to pursue Mr Balbarki arose, at least in part, from tactical considerations. It therefore requires some charity to view the material as fresh evidence. Without finally determining that issue, I am prepared to assume the evidence of Mr Balbarki is fresh evidence in order to examine the remaining issues. I will return to the issue of fresh evidence if it becomes necessary. 
     
      
       
      Mr Balbarki's evidence. 
       
      
    86 Mr Balbarki declined to make a statement or swear an affidavit for the purposes of this appeal. His account of the evening of 6 May 2001 (given on 10 June 2004) was provided some three years after the event. He said that he had known the appellant since he was ""a kid"". He had known Romeo Nasr for about the same time. In describing his relationship with the appellant he said, ""We were very good friends"" (T6). 
     
      
    87 He said that at about 6.30 pm Mr Abou-Chabake came to his home with Bek Hadid. They said ""they had a fight"" (T7) with Romeo, an answer capable of suggesting that Mr Hadid had been involved. However, it was clear from the balance of Mr Balbarki's evidence that the fight (as asserted by the Crown) was between ""Andrew"" (the appellant) and Romeo Nasr. Mr Balbarki said that Andrew had told him ""it wasn't his fault"" (T7). Mr Balbarki said that he later went to Romeo Nasr's home. Romeo said that he felt he had been ""cheap shotted"". He wanted ""to have a go like a man"" (T14). Mr Balbarki thereafter acted as the ""go between"" for Andrew and Romeo (T13). He telephoned Andrew stating that he was with Romeo. Romeo wanted to fight him again. Andrew Abou-Chabake declined (T15).  
     
      
    88 The only departure from the Crown case was Mr Balbarki's assertion that Romeo told him Bek Hadid pulled the gun, something denied by Mr Hadid. Mr Balbarki said that, having spoken to Romeo briefly, at Romeo's home, he returned to his own home, arriving home shortly after 7.30 pm. Mr Abou-Chabake was already there. No-one else was present. They spoke until about 8.00 pm. Mr Abou-Chabake then went home, returning at about 8.30 pm. They then watched the game. Mr Abou-Chabake never left his presence (T9). They were alone. Towards the end of the game his parents came home and went to bed. Mr Abou-Chabake left about half an hour after the game (T9). During that half hour he spoke to his wife, Cheryl, on the phone. Elsewhere in his evidence Mr Balbarki suggested that Mr Abou-Chabake may have remained 45 minutes after the game before going home. 
     
      
    89 The time of the shooting was fixed at about 10.12 pm. A document (Exhibit C) set out the following details in respect of the telecast of the match.

    90 Telephone records, including mobile phone records, were also tendered. A summary was tendered on this appeal and used in the cross examination of Mr Balbarki. The summary identified 35 calls between 3.30 pm on 6 May 2001 and 10.47.22 pm the same day, including the following (where the name of the person in possession of the mobile phone, according to the evidence, has been substituted for the name of the subscriber):

    91 The account of Mr Balbarki was, as mentioned, completely at odds with that given by Mr Hadid and Mr Boutros, who each described a large number of people coming and going to Mr Balbarki's home at Moore Street, Campsie, during and after the match. Mr Balbarki said that he did not see Mr Hadid again after 7.30 pm (T10). 
     
      
    92 When cross examined upon the telephone records, Mr Balbarki stated that the call at 10.13 pm (for 60 seconds), from the landline at the appellant's home to the landline at his parents' home, was from the appellant's wife, Cheryl (T20). He remembered having told Mr Abou-Chabake to keep it short, since his parents were asleep. The telephone was next to their bedroom. He asked that Mr Abou-Chabake tell his wife to ring on his mobile, rather than the landline, which she did (T21). Calls 34 and 35 were, according to Mr Balbarki, telephone conversations with the appellant after the appellant had returned home, in which they discussed the game (T22). He said he first heard that Romeo had been shot between 11.00 and 11.30 pm that evening (T25). 
     
      
       
      The Luncheon adjournment. 
       
      
    93 The cross examination was interrupted by lunch. When the Crown resumed, there was a marked change in Mr Balbarki's evidence. Before lunch the Crown had asked the following: (T13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When was the first time you were asked any questions about the details of this night by anyone associated with Mr Abou-Chabake's legal team? 
         
        A. When was the first time? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. Today. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You think your memory might be a little bit wrong? 
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    94 After lunch Mr Balbarki lost that certainty. Plainly it was critical to know when, in relation to the game, Mr Abou-Chabake had left Moore Street to return to his home. The cross examination after the break included the following questions, referring to the time of Mr Abou-Chabake's departure: (T29/30) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. It was a short time after the game finished, wasn't it? 
         
        A. Sorry. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was a short time after the game finished? 
         
        A. I really couldn't say. It could have even been earlier. I can't say exact times. It's just too difficult. You're asking me about something that happened approximately three or four years ago. I don't even remember what I did yesterday. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It could have been before the game finished? 
         
        A. It could very well have been. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you just can't say one way or the other? 
         
        A. I can't pinpoint times, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If you were to walk from your place to Andrew's place at that time, how long would it take you, just with a normal stroll? 
         
        A. Three to five minutes max. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you don't have any specific recollection whether or not Andrew was still at your house when the final whistle blew on the game, is that right? 
         
        A. I can't pinpoint exact times, like I said. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So it could have been before the final whistle, it could have been after that Andrew left? 
         
        A. That's right."" 
        
       
      
    95 Mr Balbarki also said that you would have to give or take 15 or 20 minutes from his estimates of time. He denied having had any discussion with anyone during the luncheon adjournment as to the length of time before Andrew left. 
     
      
    96 In re-examination, Mr Balbarki said that his parents returned home towards the end of the game. However, he could not remember whether at that time Mr Abou-Chabake was still present. He reaffirmed his evidence that Mr Abou-Chabake's wife had telephoned. Counsel for the appellant later submitted that the call from Cheryl Abou-Chabake must have been Call 25 at 10.13.08 pm. However, in the context of that call, Mr Balbarki added: (T31) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. After the telephone call had concluded, what happened then? 
         
        A. Nothing, watched the game."" 
        
       
      
    97 That cannot be right. By 10.13 pm the game had long since finished (9.51 pm), and the telecast as well (10.12 pm). 
     
      
    98 Later in the re-examination, Counsel for Mr Abou-Chabake returned to Call 25 (at 10.13 pm). He asked Mr Balbarki the following questions: (T33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Can I take you to call 25, a phone call made to your phone at your house. Is that the phone call that you recall that you answered and the wife of Andrew Abou-Chabake spoke to you asking to speak to her husband .... 
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION. WITNESS HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THAT CALL AND HAD GIVEN HIS ANSWER. QUESTION PRESSED. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. To the best of your ability, is that the phone call? 
         
        A. What time was that? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It is at 22.13, 10.13? 
         
        A. I would like to say yes, but, like I said, I can't be sure, and I'm just so confused with these times, I don't know."" 
        
       
      
    99 Counsel concluded his re-examination with the following questions: (T33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Has anybody threatened you in respect of your evidence today? 
         
        A. Is anybody in hospital? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Could you answer my question, please? 
         
        A. No, I don't take too lightly to threats so, no, nobody has threatened me."" 
        
       
      
    100 After Mr Balbarki left the witness box, the Crown said that certain matters had been drawn to his attention by the investigating police officer, Detective Wood, which were of concern. A number of witnesses thereafter gave evidence. Without recounting in detail what each said, the following emerged: 
     
      
    · First, that Mr Balbarki left Court at the luncheon adjournment and was approached by Mr Abdullah, a friend of the Nasr family, who had been sitting in Court. There was what Junior Counsel for Mr Abou-Chabake at the trial described as a ""confrontation"". Mr Abdullah said to Mr Balbarki, ""You are helping them"". Mr Balbarki protested that he was only telling the truth. Mr Abdullah suggested that they go into the toilet, which they then did, as did other members of the Nasr family. 
     
      
    · Secondly, that Mr Balbarki then went to lunch where he sat in a group which included members of the deceased's family, namely, his uncle, his sister, and his sister's fiancé (Mr Halou). 
     
      
    · Thirdly, although Mr Halou denied that Mr Balbarki's evidence was discussed (T51), it was plain from cross examination that it was. Mr Halou said that Mr Balbarki was ""unsure about times"" and ""confused about the whole actual case"" (T54). 
     
      
    101 The appeal was adjourned to a date to be fixed. The hearing resumed on 25 June 2004. Mr Balbarki was served with a notice to attend. He telephoned the officer in charge of the investigation on the morning of 25 June stating that he was undergoing an urgent ultrasound. The Crown indicated that it required Mr Balbarki for further cross examination. 
     
      
    102 Mr Odgers SC ultimately submitted that such damage as occurred after lunch, at the conclusion of Mr Balbarki's cross examination, had been satisfactorily repaired by re-examination. Mr Balbarki had, in his submission, maintained his evidence concerning the phone call between the appellant and his wife. Having regard to the time of that call (10.13 pm), the time of the shooting (10.12 pm), and the geographical separation between Mr Balbarki's home in Moore Street and the location of the shooting in Frederick Street, it was submitted that Mr Abou-Chabake could not have been the shooter, if Mr Balbarki's evidence were accepted. In these circumstances Mr Odgers SC (for the appellant) said this: (T75) 
     
      
       
        
        ""MASON P: And you don't place any reliance on any evidence that something happened during the lunch hour that affects the testimony in the afternoon. 
         
        ODGERS: No, I don't place any reliance on it."" 
        
       
       
      Is the evidence credible? 
       
      
    103 The credibility of the evidence of Mr Balbarki is to be assessed in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) at 301). That context does not include any evidence from Mr Abou-Chabake. It does include the statement attributed to Mr Abou-Chabake by Constable May, which contradicts the account of Mr Balbarki. It also includes the circumstantial case of the Crown, which the trial Judge, in his remarks on sentence described, accurately in my view, as ""overwhelming"" (R v Abou-Chabake [2003] NSWSC 125, Howie J, para 15). 
     
      
    104 An acceptance of Mr Balbarki's evidence ultimately depends, first, upon an acceptance that Mr Abou-Chabake was present for at least 20 minutes after the game, and secondly, an acceptance that his wife made call number 25 at 10.13 pm and spoke to her husband. 
     
      
    105 On the first issue, there was, of course, a marked difference between Mr Balbarki's evidence before and after lunch. After lunch, he could not even be certain that Mr Abou-Chabake was still at his home when the final whistle blew (T28). The final whistle blew at 9.51 pm, 20 minutes before the shooting. Mr Odgers SC, in re-examination, sought to anchor Mr Balbarki's evidence to certain events which demonstrated that he was still there at the end, and beyond the end. He was there when his parents arrived home. They arrived home ""towards the end of the game"" (T30). However, as stated, the end of the game (although not the telecast) was 9.51 pm. The scene of the shooting was only a couple of minutes away by foot. The testimony of Mr Balbarki on the first issue does not provide a convincing alibi. 
     
      
    106 Let me then move to the second issue, the call between Cheryl Abou-Chabake and her husband, said to have taken place at 10.13 pm. This is the critical issue. If the appellant's wife spoke to her husband whilst he was at the Balbarki home (being a minute after the shooting), it may be accepted that it was most unlikely that he was the shooter. Although Mr Balbarki also expressed uncertainty concerning that call at the end of his cross examination, he did appear to reaffirm his testimony in re-examination. 
     
      
    107 The context within which his evidence is to be assessed does not include evidence from the appellant's wife that she, in fact, made the call and spoke to her husband. An acceptance of Mr Balbarki is therefore dependent upon his recollection of the timing of one amongst many phone calls that evening. Mr Balbarki's uncertainty as to the time Mr Abou-Chabake left his home inevitably undermines his testimony concerning the phone call. If he left before the game ended, he was not involved in the phone call at 10.13 pm. 
     
      
    108 Although Mr Abou-Chabake did not give evidence, cross examination of Crown witnesses during the trial provided some insight into his version. It is instructive to compare the cross examination of Mr Hadid with the version put forward on this appeal by Mr Balbarki. They appear to be inconsistent. Mr Balbarki suggested that when he got home at about 7.30 pm, having returned from Romeo Nasr's, Mr Abou-Chabake was waiting for him (T7/8). They then talked. They were alone. They remained together until about 8.00 pm. Mr Abou-Chabake then left briefly, returning to Moore Street at about 8.30 pm. Thereafter he and Mr Balbarki watched the game. Mr Abou-Chabake left (on one version) some time after the game had concluded. 
     
      
    109 Contrast that version with the cross examination of Mr Hadid at the trial, which was as follows: (T94) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Finally, you said early in the afternoon before the fight that Andrew was going to work that day, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The work you are talking about is the work at his club where he is the manager, is it not? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The club is at Burwood, is it not, Burwood Road, Burwood, near a liquor store, across the road from a liquor store? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Eventually after the fight Andrew picked you up again didn't he? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In his car? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He dropped you off at Steve Balbarki's home didn't he, in Moore Street? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is the last you saw of him that night wasn't it? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest you did not see him again after he dropped you off? 
         
        A. No. I did see him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When was the last time you say you saw Andrew? 
         
        A. When we came back from the Asian restaurant. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest you never ever went to the Asian restaurant? 
        
       
      A. You weren't even there. He was there man. I seen him."" 
       
      
    110 The obvious purpose of asking Mr Hadid these questions was to buttress the suggestion that the appellant was at work that evening, confirming the account given by Constable May. The cross examination was consistent with Mr Hadid's account that he was at the home of Mr Balbarki that evening during the game. 
     
      
    111 Further, in assessing Mr Balbarki's credibility, one must take account of the lateness of his testimony. He said that he was a very good friend of Mr Abou-Chabake. His friend had been charged with murder. He was in a position to give evidence to demonstrate his innocence (as he claimed to the appellant's solicitor after the conviction). Yet he did not do so. His explanation was as follows: (T12/13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. It has taken you a long time to be uncomfortable about your friend in gaol and to come forward to tell the truth? 
         
        A. Each to their own. I only look after my immediate family and I do not care what happens to anyone else. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You do not care that you were friends since you were a child and that Mr Abou-Chabake has been in gaol for a considerable length of time? You did not care about that sufficiently to come forward and tell us what you know now sooner? 
         
        A. No. Like I said, like, basically you guys forced me to come here today. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who has forced you? 
         
        A. The subpoena forced me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it did not trouble you that for all that time your friend was in gaol? 
         
        A. Mate, like I said, I feel for both of them, okay? But end of the day I look out for my parents and my sisters and nobody else matters."" 
        
       
      
    112 Most would think that odd and discreditable. It may be accepted that Mr Balbarki was apprehensive about giving evidence. Mr Fadi Nasr, the deceased's uncle, likewise expressed fear, which he gave as his explanation for not having named Mr Abou-Chabake when first interviewed. However, Mr Abou-Chabake having been arrested, and the trial process having begun, many members of the same community gave statements and ultimately gave evidence. If Mr Balbarki was in a position truthfully to demonstrate his friend's innocence, it would be remarkable if he refrained from doing so. 
     
      
    113 To my mind the more likely explanation of the series of telephone calls following the shooting, including call 25, is that the appellant's wife, having heard the gun fire in the street, endeavoured to locate her husband. She spoke to Mr Balbarki, and thereafter continued to phone various numbers (including Mr Balbarki's mobile) in an effort to find him. It was, of course, the Crown case that Mr Abou-Chabake went to Mr Balbarki's after the shooting. Mr Karam gave evidence of having seen someone who, in a general way, matched the description of Mr Abou-Chabake, walking from Frederick Street to Moore Street immediately after the shooting. Mr Hadid gave evidence that after the match Mr Abou-Chabake ""rocked up"" to Mr Balbarki's home. Mr Boutros said the same. Call number 33 at 10.27.37 (56 seconds) was made ten minutes after the shooting. It was a call between the Abou-Chabake home and Mr Balbarki's mobile phone. It may even have been a call between Mr Abou-Chabake's wife and the appellant, after his arrival at Moore Street. 
     
      
    114 But whether the explanation for the series of phone calls be right or wrong, I do not find Mr Balbarki's evidence credible or plausible. I do not believe that his evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, would have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 
     
      
    115 I would reject ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
       
      
    116 It was submitted that, for a number of reasons, the jury may have doubted that the shooter intended to cause at least grievous bodily harm. While acknowledging that the shots were clearly aimed at the car, the jury, according to the appellant, may have doubted that they were intended to harm the occupants. It was open to them to regard the shots as having been fired to warn off or scare those in the vehicle. 
     
      
    117 The appellant pointed, amongst other things, to the following: 
     
      
    · First, although seven shots were fired, only three hit the vehicle. A fourth, presumably the fatal shot, apparently passed through an open window, hitting the deceased in the back. Those that struck the vehicle hit the body fairly low. One hit the rear bumper, another the rear passenger light, and a third the front mudguard. 
     
      
    · Second, there was evidence that the appellant did not want to fight Romeo Nasr. He refused more than once a further confrontation. 
     
      
    · Third, there was evidence that Romeo Nasr was a drug dealer. It was open to the jury to infer that Mr Abou-Chabake may have known that fact. 
     
      
    · Fourth, there was evidence that may, according to the appellant, have supported the inference that Mr Abou-Chabake feared the possibility that Romeo Nasr was armed, possibly with a gun. 
     
      
    · Fifth, it was conceded by the Crown that Mr Abou-Chabake was a person of good character. That fact was relevant to whether it was reasonably possible that he intended to shoot anyone. 
     
      
    118 It was acknowledged that no request was made to direct the jury that manslaughter was open. Indeed, counsel for Mr Abou-Chabake specifically asked the trial Judge not to do so. Rule 4 applies. However, insofar as manslaughter was reasonably open on the evidence, the trial Judge was obliged to leave it, even where defence counsel argued otherwise (Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 at 117-118). 
     
      
    119 The Crown submitted that manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act was not reasonably open. The issue was carefully considered by the trial Judge. Indeed, it is instructive, according to the Crown, to examine the way in which the issue evolved. Howie J was well aware of Pemble v The Queen and the need to instruct the jury if the issue was reasonably open. After the conclusion of the evidence his Honour posed the following question to the Crown: (T436) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: The principal count. I mean could the jury reasonably find there is insufficient evidence of intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I respectfully submit no. It is patently obvious the way the shots were fired, the deliberateness with which the shooter first of all approached and fired three shots in close proximity then continued to fire and hit the car twice as it was leaving the scene."" 
        
       
      
    120 The following day, having reflected on the matter, his Honour stated his intention as follows: (T438) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Yes, now my present intention is to sum-up on manslaughter and unlawful and dangerous act, only on the basis that if the jury are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, firstly, that the accused was the shooter and he shot at the vehicle with intention to do grievous bodily harm. Only on that basis. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: If it please your Honour."" 
        
       
      
    121 Mr Steirn SC responded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""STEIRN: I would like it put on record that I have specifically asked your Honour not to do that."" 
        
       
      
    122 Counsel for Mr Abou-Chabake indicated that he would not be submitting to the jury that the shooter did not intend to inflict at least grievous bodily harm. In the discussion that followed, his Honour identified the question which he needed to address. He said this: (T439) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: I suppose, ultimately, it is my call to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility on the evidence that the jury could conclude that the person who fired the weapon at the vehicle did so other than with intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm. That is, intending perhaps to warn off the person or persons in the vehicle."" 
        
       
      
    123 The Crown, in response, acknowledged the following possibility: (T439) 
     
      
       
        
        ""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. I guess the jury's chain of logic could be well we accept the accused fired the shots, accept he intended to shoot at the car, but we are not satisfied he necessarily intended to hit anyone."" 
        
       
      
    124 Counsel then addressed. The Crown dealt with the ballistics evidence in some detail (T450-459). That evidence had been given by way of report. Two bullets had struck the deceased. Apart from the fatal shot, the bullet that entered the vehicle through the front mudguard also struck Romeo Nasr's leg. Counsel said this: (T451) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Have a look at photo number 58. If you have a look at 58, you will see that that depicts one of the bullet holes going into the mudguard of the vehicle and then, if you turn the page, 59, and then go to 60, you will see that the trajectory of the bullet is actually traced by those rods. The first thing you might think about that is that it was certainly aimed at the driver. It virtually ends up, and you know that it actually makes contact with Romeo Nasr's left leg, the bullet was fired on that occasion. I would ask you to accept the intention there was to try and hit the driver of the vehicle. Just as importantly, this information indicates to you that the shooter was to the right and to the front of the vehicle and that is, of course, the explanation that Fadi Nasr gives."" 
        
       
      
    125 The analysis continued, matching the ballistics evidence with the description provided by Fadi Nasr. Having heard that analysis, his Honour said this: (T468) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Mr Steirn I have thought about the matter of manslaughter while the Crown was addressing. I do not intend to leave manslaughter. I think what the Crown said about the shots just does not seem to me to be open. If a person was actually going to fire a shot to scare somebody he wouldn't be firing the shots at a motor vehicle continuously as the vehicle was going away one would have thought. That is what you want me to do and I tell the jury that there is no dispute whoever fired that weapon intended to at least do grievous bodily harm and the only question is when you get to the second count you are also satisfied he also attempted to kill. ..."" 
        
       
      
    126 The summing up by his Honour was then given as follows: (SU32-33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown says if you consider the number of shots fired and from where they were fired in relation to the vehicle and the direction in which they were fired, you would have no difficulty concluding that the person who fired the weapon intended to kill the occupants of the vehicle. The Crown submission is to the effect if you consider the trajectory of the bullets and the nature of the wounds to the deceased, you will have no doubt that the shooter intended to kill the deceased. The Crown says it could not possibly have been a case of simply wishing to scare the deceased and inadvertently striking him with a bullet. In effect, the Crown says that you would infer from the conduct of the shooter, whoever it was, the intention that has to be proved for the offence of murder. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, Mr Steirn for the accused has taken a commendably sensible approach to this trial and has not sought to put that matter in issue before you: That is, it has not been contended that the shooter, whoever it might have been, had other than an intention to at least inflict really serious injury upon the deceased and therefore be guilty of murder."" 
        
       
      
    127 In my view there was no error. There was no basis upon which the jury might reasonably have entertained the possibility that the appellant's intention was only to warn or scare. 
     
      
    128 I would refuse leave to argue ground 2. 
     
      
       
       
      Ground 3: Excessive self defence. 
       
      
    129 By the Crimes Amendment (Self Defence) Act 2001, the Crimes Act was amended to insert Division 3 - Self Defence. That Division included s421 which was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""

         (c) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The person is not criminally responsible for murder but, on a trial for murder, the person is to be found guilty of manslaughter if the person is otherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter."" 
        
       
      
    130 The deceased was shot on 6 May 2001. However, the Division applies where proceedings (other than committal proceedings) were instituted after the commencement of the Division. Here the indictment was presented, and Mr Abou-Chabake arraigned, on 31 March 2002 (R v Taylor (2002) 129 A Crim R 146). Hence, s421 was available as a possible basis by which murder may be reduced to manslaughter, if it was open to the jury to view Mr Abou-Chabake's conduct as amounting to excessive self defence. 
     
      
    131 The appellant claimed that view was open for many of the same reasons set out in respect of ground 2. Although Mr Abou-Chabake did not give evidence concerning his state of mind, his belief could be inferred from material in the Crown case. Based upon that material it was, according to the appellant, open to the jury to regard as a reasonable possibility that Mr Abou-Chabake believed that it was necessary to shoot to hit Romeo Nasr to defend himself. 
     
      
    132 The Crown responded by asserting that there was simply no material before the jury as to the way in which the appellant perceived the circumstances in which the shooting occurred. He neither provided evidence, nor a version of events in a record of interview. In some cases, no doubt, an inference may be drawn as to the accused's state of mind. However the material in the Crown case did not allow that possibility. There was no possible basis for a suggestion of self defence. Further, the direction which the appellant now suggests should have been given was not sought by Counsel appearing at the trial. Rule 4 should be applied. 
     
      
    133 In my view, manslaughter by excessive self defence was simply not open. There was no basis upon which it could be inferred, as a reasonable possibility, that Mr Abou-Chabake believed it necessary to shoot Romeo Nasr to defend himself. Before Romeo Nasr drove with his uncle into Frederick Street, Campsie, Mr Abou-Chabake was probably at home. He was certainly in a location in Frederick Street unknown to Romeo Nasr. He was armed. Romeo Nasr issued his challenge from the kerbside, and then drove off. A minute or so later he returned. He was driving a car. Mr Abou-Chabake chose to leave the safety of the house, or wherever he may have been concealed, and run towards the car. The circumstances hardly justified a pre-emptive strike. As the trial Judge remarked (infra para 139), the deceased had not been armed that afternoon when he went to Mr Abou-Chabake's home. He was not armed at the time of the shooting. He had that evening repeatedly asked for a fair fight. There was no basis to infer that Mr Abou-Chabake believed that he was armed with a gun. He had no reputation for violence. He got no closer to Mr Abou-Chabake than the kerbside outside his home. At the time he was shot he was, I repeat, driving a car. It is unsurprising that counsel appearing at the trial made no request for the direction which it is now suggested should have been given. 
     
      
    134 I would refuse leave under Rule 4. 
     
      
       
      Sentence. 
       
      
    135 The only complaint made by the appellant in respect of the sentence imposed by Howie J concerned his Honour's refusal to find, as a matter of probability, that Mr Abou-Chabake acted out of fear. Such a finding ought to have been made, according to the appellant, having regard to the following: 
     
      
    · First, the evidence of Bek Hadid that Mr Abou-Chabake said on the evening of 6 May that he did not want to fight Romeo Nasr: ""He will come and stab me or something"" (T50). 
     
      
    · Second, the fact that Romeo Nasr had been to prison for drugs, and it was reasonable to infer that the appellant would have been aware of that fact. 
     
      
    · Third, the possibility that Romeo Nasr may have been armed, including with a gun. 
     
      
    · Fourth, the repeated challenges from the kerbside in Frederick Street shortly before the shooting. 
     
      
    136 The task of his Honour was difficult because Mr Abou-Chabake neither gave evidence during the trial, nor on sentence. His Honour said this: (ROS6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I find it difficult if not impossible to understand how a young man, such as the offender, could possibly have laid in wait for the deceased in effect to ambush and kill just to avoid the consequences of a fistfight. Yet on the available evidence that is what the offender did."" 
        
       
      
    137 When dealing with Mr Abou-Chabake's prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour made the following remark: (ROS8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""As I have indicated, the killing was grossly disproportionate to the situation in which the offender found himself and is unexplained by any circumstances that might go any way to account for that reaction. I cannot conclude otherwise than that there was some motivation unknown to me that caused the offender to behave as he did or his conduct reflects a complete lack of regard for human life."" 
        
       
      
    138 In dealing with the particular issue which is the subject of complaint, that is, whether Mr Abou-Chabake was actuated by fear, his Honour said this: (ROS 4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""10 Mr Steirn SC, in his address on behalf of the offender in the sentencing proceedings, placed considerable weight on this piece of evidence in order to explain the offender's conduct in shooting the deceased. Although he accepted that self-defence was not open on any view of the evidence, Mr Steirn submitted that I should find that the offender acted out of fear of what the deceased would do when he was forced to confront him on the deceased's return. However, I have very serious misgiving about the reliability of any evidence given by Bek Hadid and I warned the jury that they should not place any weight upon his account. The fact that they convicted the accused of murder does not mean that they accepted his evidence."" 
        
       
      
    139 His Honour added: (ROS4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""11 But even if the offender did express that fear on hearing of the challenge, he had no basis for it on the evidence before me. There was no suggestion that the deceased was armed when he attended the offender's premises in the afternoon prior to the shooting and was there attacked and threatened with a firearm by the offender or his father. There was no evidence that the deceased was armed at the time of the shooting. There was no weapon of any sort found in his motor vehicle. There was nothing before the jury to suggest that the deceased was generally regarded as a violent person and there was no evidence that, prior to the incident at the offender's home, the deceased had threatened violence to the offender or his family. There was no evidence at all to indicate that the offender could have had any reason to fear that the deceased would do other than engage in a fistfight with him in order to settle the score as a result of the earlier incident. Quite the contrary, the deceased was expressing his intention of having a fair fight in front of his uncle, a young man not much older than him, but apparently with some standing amongst the young men in the community. Although the offender might have had some fear of coming off the worse in such a fight, there was nothing to suggest that he would have suffered any serious injury except to his pride and his standing in the community."" 
        
       
      
    140 In my view it was open to his Honour, on the material he had, to form that view. No error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    141 The orders I would propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. That leave to appeal against sentence be granted. 
       
       
      2. That the appeals against conviction and against sentence be dismissed.

     REGINA v DANIELLA DAWES 
     
     
      
       
      The Crown appealed against a 5-year bond imposed on the respondent following her pleading guilty to manslaughter of her 10 year old autistic son. The plea to manslaughter, accepted by the Crown, was based on substantial impairment of her capacity due to an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, namely a major depressive illness ( 
      Crimes Act 1900 s 23A 
      ).  
       
       
      The respondent’s son was diagnosed as suffering from autism when he was about 18 months old but, despite the respondent’s best endeavours, she and her husband (the child’s father) were unable to obtain appropriate intervention until he was about 6 years old, at which time they were advised that his progress had been jeopardised by the delay. At this time the respondent’s husband suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to work for about 2 years. 
       
       
      In September 2001, the family moved from Ballina to Sydney in the hope of obtaining more support in the larger city, but such additional support was generally not forthcoming. There were also problems in the respondent’s marriage due to her husband’s physical and verbal abuse, excessive use of alcohol and gambling. In January 2003, the respondent told her husband to leave the family home, which he did, but shortly afterwards he threatened suicide and was hospitalised for 3 days. He returned to the family home at about Easter 2003 although the marriage was not reconciled. In May 2003, she learned that her stepfather had been indecently assaulting their daughter and on 28 July, the daughter self-harmed. Meanwhile, on 12 June 2003, the respondent’s father died after a long illness and there were disputes with her stepmother concerning his burial and estate, and her grandmother was taken to hospital seriously ill, although she subsequently recovered. The respondent was receiving treatment for depression for which she was taking prescribed medication and in the previous month she had lost almost 10kgs in weight. 
       
       
      On 4 August 2003, when she attempted to get her son ready for school, he would not cooperate and ran off into the house’s rumpus room. The respondent followed him and held her hand over his mouth and nose, thus suffocating him. She then attempted to commit suicide by slashing her wrists and very nearly succeeded. When spoken to by police, she made full admissions, and she pleaded guilty when first offered the charge of manslaughter in the Local Court. Four psychiatrists, included one instructed on behalf of the Crown, diagnosed the respondent as suffering a major depressive illness at the time. 
       
      
    HELD:  Dismissing the Crown appeal,  
     
      
      (1) (per Dunford and Hoeben JJ) The Sentencing Judge had erred in not imposing a custodial sentence, but,  
       
      (2) In the exercise of the Court’s discretion, having regard to (a) the principle of double jeopardy, (b) the Crown’s failure to seek a custodial sentence at first instance, and (c) the respondent’s progress in rehabilitation in the meantime, the appeal would be dismissed,  
       
      (3) (per Barr J) There was no error on the part of the Sentencing Judge.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed on the respondent by his Honour Judge Ellis in the District Court at Parramatta following her plea of guilty to the manslaughter of her 10 year old autistic son, Jason Taylor Dawes. The basis of the plea was pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 on the ground of substantial impairment of her capacity by reason of an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, namely a major depressive illness.2 The respondent was initially charged with the murder of her son on 4 August 2003, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on 5 March 2004 when such plea was first offered by the Crown. On 2 June 2004, she was sentenced to a five year good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act) on the following conditions: 
     
      
    · Appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time; 
     
      
    · Be of good behaviour; 
     
      
    · Advise the Clerk of the Court at Parramatta of any change of residential address; 
     
      
    · Accept the supervision of and obey all directions of the Probation and Parole Service during the term of the bond, especially in relation to treatment and counselling for her depressive illness at the discretion of the Probation and Parole Service; 
     
      
    · Obtain regular psychiatric review of her depressive illness at the discretion and direction of the Probation and Parole Service; 
     
      
    · Report to the Probation and Parole Service, Blacktown within 48 hours; 
     
      
    · The Court to be informed of any breach at the earliest convenience. 
     
      
    3 The Director of Public Prosecution’s Notice of Appeal, dated 25 June 2004 was served on the respondent on 27 June 2004.  
     
      
    4 Before proceeding any further, it is appropriate to set out the principles and constraints which govern sentence appeals to this Court, particularly Crown appeals. They are conveniently summarised in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562-3 as follows (omitting the authorities cited): 1. A Court of Criminal Appeal which is dealing with an appeal against sentence does not simply embark upon the task of sentencing afresh, substituting its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge, and increasing the sentence if it considers it to be inadequate, or decreasing the sentence if it considers it to be excessive. An appellate court will only interfere if it is demonstrated that the sentencing judge fell into material error of law or fact. Such error may appear in the reasons given by the sentencing judge, or the sentence itself may be manifestly excessive or inadequate, and thus disclose error. However, the facts and circumstances of individual cases are often such that sentencing judges have a substantial discretion, and the appellate court does not intervene simply on the basis that the members of that court would have exercised their discretion differently from the judge at first instance.  
     
      
    2. Crown appeals against sentence are relatively infrequent. The High Court has said that such appeals “should be a rarity”. One reason for this is the element of double jeopardy that is involved in such appeals. Rules designed to safeguard against double jeopardy are deeply embedded in our system of criminal justice…. 
     
      
    3. If a Crown appeal against sentence is successful and the appellate court re-sentences the respondent it does so in the light of all the facts and circumstances as at the time of re-sentencing. Events which have occurred after the original sentencing may be relevant.  
     
      
    4. Where in response to a Crown appeal, the Court decides to re-sentence an offender, it ordinarily gives recognition to the element of double jeopardy involved (in twice standing for sentence) by imposing a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    5. An appellate court has an overriding discretion which may lead it to decline to intervene, even if it comes to the conclusion that error has been shown in the original sentencing process. In this connection, the conduct of the Crown at the original sentencing proceedings may be a matter of significance.  
     
      
    5 Jason was born on 2 September 1992, the younger of two children of the respondent and her husband, Craig Dawes, and was almost 11 years old at the time of his death. Their other child, a daughter, was born on 28 April 1990 and was accordingly aged 13 at the time of Jason’s death. At the time of Jason’s birth, his parents were conducting a take-away food store at Ballina and working the long hours which such a business entailed. 
     
      
    6 Jason’s autism was diagnosed in March 1994 when he was 18 months old. His parents were advised that he was in need of early intervention but, despite their best endeavours, they were unable to gain access to the appropriate unit near where they were living in Ballina at the time, and their son went for some years without appropriate intervention. When Jason was about 6 years old, they were advised by a specialist in Brisbane that his progress had been jeopardised by the lateness of the intervention.  
     
      
    7 About this time, and on one view as a result of this information, the respondent’s husband suffered a nervous breakdown, for a period of about two years he was unable to work and the respondent “carried the family for all of that time”.  
     
      
    8 Jason was described as profoundly handicapped and was suffering, inter alia, from the following: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Severe communication disorder with functional language comprehension around the three-year-old level; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Global development delay assessed as functioning in the moderate to severe range of intellectual disability; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Severe expressive language disorder and severe speech output disorder consistent with oral dyspraxia/aphasia (speechlessness) and; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Motor planning and sequence disorder consistent with motor dyspraxia, being a disturbance in the ability to carry out skilled voluntary movements. 
        
       
      
    9 The practical reality was that the care in terms of daily responsibility to feed, toilet, bathe, educate, entertain and love Jason fell to his mother and the learned sentencing judge found that this was an unrelenting, tiring, frustrating and never-ending task that very few people have ever experienced or are even capable of fully comprehending. 10 Eventually, in July 1999, Jason, then aged almost 7 years, started part-time at Holy Family Catholic Primary School in Ballina and from February 2000 he attended school for a full day each week. As he became more comfortable in the school, attempts were made to integrate him into other classes such as maths and language, and he demonstrated a number of splinter skills during this time, but as he became stronger, he developed the habit of grabbing teachers by the throat or fingers and bending their fingers backwards. 
     
      
    11 In February 2001, aged 8 years, he was enrolled as a full-time student in the school and showed further improvement, but still required continual maintenance at a very high level. He began to sign and learned his first words during this period, but outside the school environment, he was vastly different; he was constantly on the go and very difficult to manage.  
     
      
    12 In September 2001, the family sold their property in Ballina and moved to Kings Langley in the hope that in the larger city and with family support close by, they would be able to obtain more support. They did not obtain a good price for their property on the North Coast and were obliged to rent. Jason was then enrolled in a mainstream school where he had the benefit of a number of school aides. The school noted his inability to speak, making loud noises when frustrated, inability to follow regular class programmes, obstinate behaviour, a liking for singing, an intolerance for loud noise and occasional completion of tasks set at his level of development. At times he deliberately bent the fingers of teacher’s aides and his teachers when not wishing to comply with instructions. During the course in 2002, his violent behaviour greatly diminished after appropriate behaviours were reinforced.  
     
      
    13 In November 2001, both the respondent and her husband came under the care of Dr Lin, a general practitioner and each was treated for depression. The respondent continued seeing Dr Lin in March, June and July 2002. On 29 November 2002, the family moved to fresh rented premises at 6 Dunks Place, Kings Langley and on 24 December 2002, which was the respondent’s birthday, her father was diagnosed with a brain tumour and hospitalised. 
     
      
    14 In the meantime and for a number of years, there had been problems in the respondent’s marriage due her husband’s physical and verbal abuse, excessive use of alcohol and gambling, and on 5 January 2003, the respondent told him to leave the family home following an argument and domestic violence, and shortly thereafter she began seeing a domestic violence counsellor. 15 On 11 January 2003, her husband telephoned Lifeline threatening suicide, police were called and he received counselling from the Bungarribee Crisis Team at the Blacktown Hospital where he was confined for three days. Subsequently, the respondent’s husband visited the house regularly to see the children. At the beginning of February 2003, Jason was transferred from Kings Langley Primary School to Caddie’s Creek School, Glenwood because the teachers at his former school were unable to provide what he needed and the latter had a support unit for children with Autism. 
     
      
    16 About Easter 2003, the respondent’s husband returned to the family home to assist with the care of Jason although the marriage had not been reconciled, and then in May 2003, she learned that her stepfather had been indecently assaulting their daughter. The respondent had said that she loved her stepfather more than her own father and it was devastating for her to learn what he had done to her daughter. The matter was reported to police and subsequently an apprehended domestic violence order was obtained. She sought counselling for the daughter, but again was forced to wait a long time for an appointment. Her problem was compounded by the fact that her mother continued to live with her stepfather and as a result, the respondent felt a further sense of rejection and lack of support. According to her husband, it was from this event that the respondent deteriorated to the point where, as he said, she “became dead inside”. Then on 28 July, the daughter self-harmed.  
     
      
    17 Meanwhile, on 12 June 2003, the respondent’s father died and there were disputes with her stepmother in relation to his burial and his estate. About this time her grandmother was taken to hospital seriously ill, and not expected to live, although in fact she subsequently recovered. Then on 27 July 2003 shortly before Jason’s death, there was a heated and violent argument between the respondent and her husband, and in the week preceding Jason’s death, she and her husband had several discussions about Jason’s future concerning how he and they would cope with the onset of puberty.  
     
      
    18 She was at the time, receiving treatment for depression and was taking Deptogran 25 and a supplement named “30 plus” together with other combinations prescribed by a local massage therapist and was receiving vitamin B injections. It appears that during that time, her depression deepened, and in the month prior to Jason’s death, she had lost almost 10kgs in weight. She was also working 3 days (about 15 hours) a week and her employer had some months previously had occasion to speak to her about the quality of her work. 
     
      
    19 On 4 August 2003 after rising at 5:10am, the respondent helped her daughter to prepare for school. She discussed with her husband their continuing difficulties with Jason and the bleak future they had with him. At about 8:30am after her husband and daughter had left for work and school respectively, she got Jason’s clothes ready for school, took a shower and then attempted to dress Jason for school, but he would not cooperate and ran off to the rumpus room. The respondent followed him and there held his hand, placed her hand over his mouth and nose and held him until he ceased struggling, resulting in his death. She then picked him up and took him to the bed where she laid him down.  
     
      
    20 She telephoned her place of work and reported that she would not be in due to sickness, left money and bank account withdrawal slips and written authorities on the table so that her bank funds would be available for her husband and daughter and then went to the bathroom, took a razor and severely lacerated her wrists. When the bleeding stopped, she cut the wounds again to restore the flow of blood. When found shortly afterwards by her mother, she was near death and when paramedics attended, they were unable to register her blood pressure. She was taken to Blacktown Hospital and only survived because blood transfusions restored her blood level and blood pressure. She had full thickness transverse lacerations to her right wrist and three full thickness transverse laceration to her left wrist, exposing tendons.  
     
      
    21 After being found in the shower at her home, she was spoken to by police first attending the scene, and whilst obviously suffering the effects the attempt on her life, expressed her wish not to survive with the phrase, “I don’t want to get warm”.  
     
      
    22 She told Professor Greenberg, psychiatrist: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t know why it happened, whatever happened I had no control. My soul had left my body. I was just watching through my eyes. It wasn’t me. I knew it was me not having control over myself, it was like being on autopilot. I wish I had my boy back. I love him so much it’s not right I should be here. I should be with him. My children mean the world to me. I didn’t do it because I didn’t want Jason, I didn’t hate the trauma he caused. It wasn’t about Jason. I never wanted that morning to end my life. It’s never that I hate Jason or his disability. I loved him the way he was. It just happened. I never had the experience of loss of control, I never experienced that before, I snapped”. 
        
       
      
    23 She was interviewed twice by police later that day and made full and frank admissions, and pleaded guilty in the Local Court as soon as she was offered the charge of manslaughter. She has expressed remorse and contrition to the police, to all the psychiatrists and to Ms Powers of the Probation and Parole Service who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report, and his Honour was satisfied that her remorse and contrition were genuine. 
     
      
    24 Professor Greenberg saw the respondent on four occasions and had access to other reports. He expressed the view that at the time of Jason’s death, the respondent was labouring under such intensive and overwhelming feelings of depression that her actions were substantially impaired and she was deprived the capacity to understand the full significance of her actions and mentally control them. He considered that her mental abnormality arising from the underlying major depression substantially impaired her mental responsibility for the alleged act.  
     
      
    25 Dr Lin, the general practitioner who had been treating the respondent, confirmed that he treated her for ongoing depression which was getting worse despite medication whilst Dr Westmore, another psychiatrist who examined her on 13 August 2003, concluded that at the time of the offence she was suffering from a major depressive illness and that her mental condition deprived her of capacity to control her actions, and was also likely to have impaired her capacity to understand the wrongness of her actions. 
     
      
    26 Dr C L Wong, Consultant Psychiatrist, interviewed the respondent on 23 January 2004 on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. He also concluded at the time she was suffering major depression, an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental condition, caused by the array of traumatic life events impacting on her personality traits which rendered her particularly susceptible to these events. He considered that as a result of her highly moralistic perspective, what took place around the time of the alleged killing, in particular what happened to the daughter, caused her more emotional revulsion than they would otherwise, and concluded that for some time, she had entertained fleeting and rather disorganised thoughts of killing Jason and then herself, but had had adequate control and had no difficulty in readily banishing such thoughts, but because of her severe depression, the adversities which came one after another in quick succession loomed much larger and appeared much more intractable and overwhelming. He was not convinced that her ability to judge the wrongfulness of her actions at the time of the killing was substantially impaired, but rather that she knew it was wrong, but had no control over it at the time.  
     
      
    27 Dr Wilcox, General and Forensic Psychiatrist, who subsequently treated the respondent, also concluded that the respondent was suffering from major depression when she took her son’s life.  
     
      
    28 This was not merely a case of a mother killing her severely disabled son, but of a mother suffering from major depression occasioned not only by the need to care for her son and the devotion she gave to that task, but overwhelmed by a number of other stressors all impacting on her at about the same time and in circumstances where her husband (the child’s father) was unable to provide the degree of support and assistance which she needed resulting in her spontaneously snapping and almost immediately being so overcome with remorse and regret that she made a genuine attempt to take her own life, and very nearly succeeded. As the learned sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This offender was required to educate, feed, toilet, bathe, entertain and love Jason. She loved and cared for (her daughter) and did not neglect her despite the constant demands of raising an autistic child. She constantly lived with the fact that her son had lost his best chance of acquiring greater life skills because of the failure of authorities to provide appropriate intervention during his early formative years. She carried the burden for her husband and supported him through his mental breakdown and general inability to cope with life and Jason in particular. She did all this in an environment of physical and emotional abuse from her husband. She worked outside the family home to help support the family. She assisted others with handicapped children. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the offender lived through her grandmother’s illness, her father’s illness and subsequent death on 12 June 2003. She suffered considerable conflict with her stepmother both during her father’s illness and after his death. She suffered the anguish of losing her home in Ballina and being unable to afford to purchase a home in Sydney. Rather than gaining greater assistance from the authorities by coming to Sydney, she lost the small amount of respite care that she had managed to extract from the relevant government department in Ballina. She suffered the trauma of discovering that her stepfather, a man she loved more than her own father, was sexually abusing her daughter, causing her to self-harm and become promiscuous. She was told that she would have to wait a month for counselling for her daughter. She let her husband return to the family home only to find that his conduct during the social function in the week prior to Jason’s death confirmed her worst fears and left her feeling trapped in a relationship that she hated. She endured all of this while suffering a major depressive illness of her own”. 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour appears to have taken the view (ROS 25), acquiesced in by the Crown (T 39), that on the morning of 4 August, the respondent decided to take her own life but did not want to leave her son alive without her, and so killed him before killing herself (the planned suicide theory) rather than killing her son without any pre-meditation when her capacity was substantially impaired and then attempting to take her own life. The view accepted by his Honour appears to have come from statements made by the respondent months after Jason’s death to Ms Powers, who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report. It is inconsistent with what she told the police on the day of Jason’s death, what she told each of the psychiatrists shortly thereafter and what she has told her treating psychiatrist, Dr Wilcox. I am satisfied that it was not open to his Honour to accept the planned suicide theory and that he was in error in so doing.  
     
      
    30 In his Victim Impact Statement read to the District Court, the respondent’s husband referred to what a good mother she had been to Jason over the years, he asked for leniency for her and said that he could see no gain to the community or personal satisfaction in her being sent to prison. It would appear that his Honour took his attitude into account when sentencing the respondent, and in so far as he did so, he was in error, as the attitude of the victim: R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at [37], or in the case of homicide, the victim’s family: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76, is not relevant to the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion for the reasons explained in those cases. For the same reasons, the apparent change of attitude of the respondent’s husband is not a matter which this Court can take into account in considering the appeal: see also R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 102 at [79] to [86] and cases there cited. 
     
      
    31 Manslaughter, whatever form it takes, constitutes unlawful homicide. It is always a most serious offence as it involved the taking of another human life and it is the responsibility of the courts to protect and preserve human life and to punish those who unlawfully take it. All human life is to be protected including that of the disabled, the handicapped, the criminal, the derelict and the friendless.  
     
      
    32 In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 517, Gleeson CJ repeated what this Court had said in R v McDonald (12 December 1995) as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system.  
        
       
      
    33 Similarly in R v Troja (CCA – unreported – 6 July 1991) Kirby P observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The starting point is a clear statement that objectively the offence (i.e. manslaughter) is one of the most serious that our community knows….Homicide is properly regarded in any civilised community, including ours, as a most serious crime….So much is incontrovertible….But it should be stated at the beginning of these reasons. Otherwise, there is a risk that the Court may so concentrate on the predicament of the applicant, on her explanation of her offence and her subjective circumstances, as to forget the important part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and in punishing those who take it”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 When the basis of a finding of manslaughter is diminished responsibility (now substantial impairment), pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act what is nevertheless ordinarily involved, and what is involved in the present case, is a conclusion that the taking of human life was the consequence of a deliberate and voluntary act, performed with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifferent to human life. The abnormality of mind diminishes the offender’s responsibility for his or her act but it does not negate such responsibility. 35 A similar approach has been taken overseas. In R v Albury-Thompson (1998) 16 CRNZ 79, the appellant had been found guilty of the manslaughter of her autistic 17 year old daughter and had been sentenced to imprisonment for four years. On appeal by the offender, the New Zealand Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to one of 18 months saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Compassion and other matters of mitigation aside, the strongest remaining factor to which proper weight must be given is maintaining the value the community places on human life….However, while agreeing with the judge that the sentence had to contain a strong message of concern to protect the particular community value, the unusual nature of the case has brought us to the conclusion that that end could be achieved by a lesser term than four years”.  
        
       
      
    36 Counsel have only been able to find 2 comparatively similar cases in this State. In R v Li [2000] NSWSC 1088, Greg James J granted the offender a bond under s 9 of the Act for the manslaughter of her young child at a time when she was gravely affected by depression and in R v Cooper [2001] NSWSC 769, Simpson J granted a similar bond for the infanticide of the offender’s daughter aged seven months. It is not necessary to express any view on whether this Court considers the sentences in those cases were appropriate but they are, in my view, both distinguishable from the present.  
     
      
    37 In Li, the offender was suffering from endogenous depression, had at all times been a caring and devoted mother and killed her child whilst so severely depressed as to verge upon being insane. She did so because it was her intent to commit suicide and she did not want to leave the child behind when she herself died. As explained earlier in these Reasons, I am satisfied this was not the situation in the present case.  
     
      
    38 Cooper on the other hand, was a case of infanticide rather than manslaughter, which her Honour noted was a form of homicide having particular characteristics and a particular genesis which justified in an appropriate case, a different approach to sentencing. Nevertheless, her Honour did observe: 
     
      
       
        
        “The loss of human life is something to be treated with utmost gravity. Where a life lost is that of a baby, completely defenceless, and at the hand of her mother, from whom she could ordinarily expect nurture and care, the obligation on the courts to signify its respect for the sanctity of life and to punish who take it is so much greater”. 
        
       
      
    39 It is an aggravating feature in this case that the victim was the respondent’s child who was so dependent on her and from whom he was entitled to and expect nurture, support and care: R v Vaughan (1991) 56 A Crim R 355, R v Ditfort (CCA – 1 March 1992), although the circumstances in those cases were quite different. See also the passage just quoted from Cooper. The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years: Crimes Act 1900 s 24, although the circumstances which may constitute the crime of manslaughter vary considerably and consequently so do the appropriate sentences.40 In my opinion, his Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the courts’ responsibility to uphold the sanctity of human life and some of the important purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of the Act namely, denouncing the conduct of the offender, making the offender accountable for her actions and ensuring adequate punishment for the offence. It appears that his Honour allowed these factors to be outweighed by the strong subjective case presented on behalf of the respondent, and in so doing, fell into error. I am satisfied that notwithstanding her strong subjective case, her early plea, her contrition and remorse, this was a case where the objective seriousness of the offence required the imposition of a full time custodial, though not excessive, sentence, and the bond imposed was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    41 In considering whether in the particular circumstances of this case this Court should, in accordance with the principles set out in Allpass, above, intervene and re-sentence the respondent, it is necessary to have regard to three relevant factors, namely, the principle of double jeopardy, the Crown’s failure to press for a custodial sentence before the sentencing judge and the circumstances of the respondent as they exist at the time of the hearing of the appeal.  
     
      
    42 As to double jeopardy, there are two aspects of this principle in its application to Crown appeals; firstly, if the Court does intervene and re-sentence the respondent, it imposes a sentence at the lower or least end of the range it considers appropriate: R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92 at [54]; and secondly, in appropriate cases it will lead the Court not to intervene, notwithstanding error in the original sentence. The principle of double jeopardy was explained in a passage adopted by the High Court in Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 302-3 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The respondent of has faced the prospect of deprivation of…liberty by way of imprisonment and has been spared, subject to observance of the conditions of the bond. If the prosecution is allowed to raise the contention, she must again face the prospect of imprisonment. This is what the Federal Court meant in  
        R v Tait and Bailey 
        …by “double jeopardy”. 
        
       
      
    43 An issue closely related to double jeopardy, and often regarded as an application of it, is that it is only in exceptional cases that the court will uphold an appeal against a non-custodial sentence and sentence the offender to imprisonment, where the Crown has not pressed for a custodial sentence at first instance: Everett v The Queen, R v Allpass, R v Jermyn (1985) 2 NSWLR 194. On the other hand, the conduct of the Crown cannot fetter the discretion of the sentencer or of the appellate court: Malvaso v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 233, R v Duroux (CCA – unreported – 11 April 1991), R v Hughesman (CCA – unreported – 5 April 1995). As the Court said in Allpass at 565:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown is not debarred, on appeal, from taking a stance different from that taken at first instance, but this Court in the exercise of its discretion, is entitled to take account of the fact that, at first instance, the Crown acquiesced in the course which was taken by the sentencing judge. The weight to be given to such a consideration depends on the circumstances of the particular case, but it may be of considerable significance if the respondent was given a non-custodial sentence at first instance”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    44 In the present case, the Crown, both in Written Submissions and orally (at T 40), did not press for a custodial sentence but conceded that a non-custodial sentence may be appropriate. 45 Finally, it is relevant to examine the present circumstances of the respondent. Since she was sentenced on 2 June last, she has obtained custody of her daughter and an apprehended domestic violence order against her husband. She and her daughter have moved from the Sydney area to the North Coast where the daughter is in Year 9 at a local high school and attending weekly appointments with a Victims of Crime Counsellor. She has also made friends locally and is involved in dancing classes and touch football. 
     
      
    46 The respondent has friends in the area who are supportive and, if not sentenced to a custodial sentence, intends to seek employment in the area, hopefully using her experience as a trained bookkeeper and computer operator. She also has regular contact with her domestic violence counsellor and her psychiatrist. It appears she is making good progress in her rehabilitation and from her depression and other traumas of the last few years and, notwithstanding the promptness with which the Crown appeal was instituted, to impose a custodial sentence at this stage would be disruptive of her rehabilitation and of her daughter’s well being.  
     
      
    47 Accordingly, I am satisfied that notwithstanding the errors disclosed in the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, this Court should not now impose a custodial sentence. I have considered whether there are any other alternatives available which would, at least to a degree, express the Court’s denunciation of the respondent’s conduct and render her more accountable for her actions, but have concluded that there are not. The Pre-Sentence Report indicated that the respondent was not suitable for periodic detention, and in any event, we were informed from the Bar Table that it is not available for women in the North Coast area where the respondent now resides.  
     
      
    48 Imprisonment by way of home detention is not available in cases of manslaughter: s 76 of the Act, while suspended sentences are only available in respect of sentences for terms of not more than 2 years and they cannot be suspended for more than that period: s 12(1). As the original bond now stands, the respondent is subject to it for 5 years, and if she commits a breach of it, can be sentenced to full time imprisonment for up to 25 years, whereas if a suspended sentence were imposed she could only be subject to it for up to 2 years, and in the event of breach, could only be sentenced to imprisonment for up to 2 years. 
     
      
    49 For these reasons, notwithstanding the errors of the learned sentencing judge and the manifest inadequacy of the sentence, I am satisfied that the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should not interfere with the sentence imposed in the District Court and that the Crown appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    50 BARR J: The substance of the Crown appeal was that the sentence itself demonstrated error, that any sentence less than one of full-time custody was outside the range of discretion of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    51 Before coming to that submission, however, I should deal with two attacks on what were said to be his Honour’s findings of fact. The first attacked this passage from his Honour’s remarks on sentence -  
     
      
       
        
        The practical reality is that the care in terms of daily responsibility to feed, toilet, bathe, educate, entertain and love fell to his mother, this offender.  
        
       
      
    52 It was submitted that insofar as his Honour said that there was a daily responsibility to take the deceased to the toilet, his Honour fell into error. While that had been an onerous duty in preceding times, it was submitted, the evidence showed that the deceased had made progress. Reference was made to a statement of Ms Glenda Alekna, a teacher at the special school attended by the deceased. She said that during 2003 he had learned, among other things, the routine of going to the toilet when directed to. Counsel referred to a statement of Ms Linda Campton, a teacher’s aide, to the same effect. It was submitted that the evidence established that there had been a gradual improvement in the child’s abilities and an increase in confidence in his attainment of skills.  
     
      
    53 I would not read into the quoted portion of his Honour’s judgment any conclusion that the deceased was not making the progress contended for. His Honour said, and the fact was, that his toilet was the respondent’s sole daily responsibility. Furthermore, it was only a part of the overall responsibility of the respondent. The submission should be rejected.  
     
      
    54 The next submission attacked what was asserted to be his Honour’s finding that the respondent had decided to commit suicide and had mercifully killed the deceased before setting out to do so because she believed that he would have no quality of life without her.  
     
      
    55 That submission picked up a submission made by the Crown Prosecutor to the sentencing judge. These were the words used - 
     
      
       
        
        Was this an act of homicide with suicide to avoid consequences or was this an act of love whereby the offender sought to take her own life and saw no future for her son in the world that she was leaving behind? 
        
       
      
    56 In closing the case to the judge, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the tension between the need to protect the victims of crime and to give effect to an exceptionally strong subjective case. Counsel said this - 
     
      
       
        
        Within the task of resolving that tension it would seem to the Crown that there are two possibilities. 1. The offender has simply taken the life of this little boy because he was too much of a burden and then, realising the enormity of her act, has chosen to take her own life. That would be the more heinous approach or the more heinous view of the facts surrounding this death. The alternative is that the offender has reached that point where she has decided to take her own life but, being aware of, in her perception, in her mind, being aware of the difficulties to be faced by Jason, by Jason’s sister and by her husband, she took him with her or intended to take him with her but, fortuitously, at a point where her own life was almost lost, she was discovered and saved.  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown, I would acknowledge, is not in a position to establish beyond reasonable doubt the first of those alternatives. The evidence is perfectly consistent with the lesser of the two, as I call it, and I would have to acknowledge that on the evidence that is before the Court the Crown could not, in all conscience, argue that it is sufficient to justify the view that this offender killed her son and then sought to avoid the consequences of that act.  
        
       
      
    57 It seems to me that the two proffered solutions were not mutually exclusive. The respondent might have had both reasons for wanting to kill the deceased and she might have had both reasons for wanting to kill herself.  
     
      
    58 The police first interviewed the respondent at 4:25pm on the day that she killed the deceased and came so close to killing herself. She was in bed in hospital. This was part of an answer she gave to the investigating police officers -  
     
      
       
        
         
        A18 
         …Jason wouldn’t get up. It went through my mind how difficult it is with Jason. He got up, I got him out of bed, and he ran down the stairs. And I just thought, this is so difficult. It’s difficult on everybody. Me, Craig and  
        (her daughter). 
         Jason’s the one who’s only going to get more difficult so I held his hands and I covered his mouth.  
        
       
       
        
        Q 19  
        It’s O.K. 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        And um, he struggled and I couldn’t do it anymore. It’s been so hard. Then, when, he stopped struggling. I picked him up and I lay with him on his bed then I got a razor from the bathroom because I just wanted to be a good mum. Then I sat in the shower and I cut my wrists. And as the bleeding would stop I cut some more. 
         
        
       
      
    59 The interview did not last long, but at 7:55pm on the same evening a second interview began. During the course of it the respondent gave a number of explanations, including these -  
     
      
       
        
        A 261  
        And he got up and he wouldn’t let me dress him and he ran down stairs and he wouldn’t come back up and that’s when it just got overwhelming and I felt I can’t keep doing this anymore.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A 264  
        So I held his nose and his, covered his mouth 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A 266  
        With two hands. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A 292 … 
        Realised, realised I wasn’t this perfect mum anymore and I couldn’t live with that. 
          
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q 306 
         …Can you tell me why, why you suffocated Jason, why you chose to suffocate him? 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        Life is so difficult. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A 310  
        If I tried to end my life I couldn’t possibly leave Jason behind because it would be so hard for Craig ‘cause Jase and I, a tissue please? 
        
       
       
        
        Q 311  
        A tissue, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        Jase is like a mummy’s boy. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 328  
        Yes. When you first woke this morning did you have thoughts of ending Jason’s life when you first woke up? 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        No. 
          
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q 342  
        Can you tell us what happened when you were in the shower? 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        I had a razor and I cut my wrists ‘cause I, I knew that what, what I’d done was overwhelmingly wrong but I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q 343  
        So you cut your wrists because you knew what you had done was overwhelmingly wrong? 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        Yeah, well partly and I’ve just been feeling so depressed that --- 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q 357  
        O.K. Now, Daniela, we were talking about how you were feeling prior, when you went to the, to the bathroom was it your intention to slash your wrist? 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        Yes it was. I was, it was something I guess that I couldn’t live with. It wasn’t me. It wasn’t --- 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 358  
        So because of what you had done to, to Jason you wanted to take your own life, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A  
        Yeah, I guess so. 
          
        
       
      
    60 It appears that from the beginning, and not surprisingly in view of her mental state, that the respondent was giving more than one reason for acting as she had. That continued throughout her later interviews with psychiatrists and the Probation and Parole officer, Ms Powers.  
     
      
    61 In his remarks on sentence his Honour reproduced part of an explanation the respondent had given to Dr Greenberg, as follows - - 
     
      
       
        
        I don’t know why it happened, whatever happened I had no control. My soul had left my body. I was just watching through my eyes. It wasn’t me. I knew it was me not having control over myself, it was like being on autopilot. I wish I had my boy back. I love him so much. It’s not right I should be here. I should be with him. My children mean the world to me. I didn’t do it because I didn’t want Jason, I didn’t hate the trauma he caused. It wasn’t about Jason. I never wanted that morning to end my life. It’s never that I hated Jason or his disability. I loved him the way he was. It just happened. I never had the experience of loss of control, I never experienced that before, I just snapped. 
        
       
      
    62 His Honour commented extensively upon the evidence and report of Ms Powers, including her report that the respondent had told her that she knew she could not leave Jason behind, that he would not have coped without her and that he would not have understood where she was. His Honour referred to the submissions of the Crown Prosecutor and continued -  
     
      
       
        
        It is the opinion of the Court that the lives of the offender and her son were so intertwined in the mind of the offender, that a decision to end one was a decision to end both. The offender appears to have reached a point where she could see no hope for herself or Jason, and that the only solution was to end their lives.  
        
       
      
    63 His Honour summarised the several stressors bearing upon the respondent and continued -  
     
      
       
        
        There is no doubt that all of these significant stressors compounded to the point where she began to shut down emotionally. By the time of Jason’s death and her suicide attempt, the offender was acting on autopilot with little real appreciation of what she was doing, and no control over it in any event. Given her mental illness and these relentless and seemingly unending stressors, it is little wonder this offender was no longer able to cope on the morning of 4 August 2003. The offender having reached her nadir seemingly decided to end her own life and that of her “mummy’s boy”. She had had enough and could take no more.  
        
       
      
    64 In a long and detailed judgment his Honour nowhere referred to the choice he had been invited to make. I doubt whether his Honour concluded that, and only that, the respondent had tried to take her own life and had mercifully killed the deceased in anticipation in order to deliver him from a life without her. Even if he did, there was evidence to support that finding, rendering it proof from attack on appeal. The attack on his Honour’s conclusion should be rejected. 
     
      
    65 I come now to the substantial part of the Crown appeal. I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Dunford J and gratefully adopt his Honour’s summary of the facts, particularly those which explain the several stressors bearing upon the respondent when she killed the deceased. 
     
      
    66 So variable is the crime of manslaughter, both in its legal formulation and in the range of culpability that it contemplates, that the identification of the available range of sentence in any individual case is notoriously difficult. In R v Blacklidge Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995 unreported Gleeson CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said- 
     
      
       
        
        The crime of manslaughter comprehends all forms of punishable homicide other than murder (Crimes Act 1900, s18). For presently relevant purposes, the crime of murder is taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, causing death, was done with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life. Some forms of manslaughter, such as that with which we are presently concerned, involve conduct which would amount to murder, except for the presence of some recognised mitigating circumstance. Other forms of manslaughter, sometimes referred to as “involuntary”, do not involve an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference to human life. They may, for example, involve causing death by an unlawful and dangerous act. It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability. 
        
       
      
    67 Counsel drew the attention of his Honour and of this Court to sentences imposed in other cases which might to some degree be like this case. The cases of Albury-Thompson, Li and Cooper were canvassed. They are summarised in the judgment of Dunford J and there is no need for me to repeat the facts or the results.  
     
      
    68 I do not wish to be understood as stating that it is inappropriate for a Court at first instance or on appeal ever to look at sentences imposed in other cases for the purpose of ascertaining what an appropriate sentence might be or whether a sentence under challenge is inside or outside the proper range of sentencing discretion. There is a danger in doing so, however, because it might be suggested that the facts of the case under appeal and those of a case cited for comparison are so alike that the sentences, too, should have been alike. In R v Morgan (1997) 78 A Crim R 368, Hunt CJ at CL said this at 371 -  
     
      
       
        
        It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the  
        range 
         appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range. As Mason J said in  
        Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 612; 12 A Crim R 408 at 411: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “the reference to an appropriate sentence is apt to be misunderstood. Generally speaking, a sentence within a limited range of years is appropriate to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and to the character, antecedents and conditions of the offender. As the ascertainment and imposition of an appropriate sentence involve the exercise of judicial discretion based on an assessment of various factors it is not possible to say that a sentence of a particular duration is the only correct or appropriate penalty to the exclusion of any other penalty.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    69 The statement of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Morgan is of general application but is particularly pertinent to manslaughter sentences for the reasons explained by Gleeson CJ in Blacklidge. In R v Schelberger Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 June 1988, unreported Yeldham J said this in delivering the judgment of the Court- 
     
      
       
        
        We have been referred to a number of other cases in which this Court has expressed opinions upon the adequacy or otherwise of sentences fixed by trial judges in varying cases of manslaughter. Speaking for myself, I find little assistance from decisions in other cases. The crime of manslaughter is one which has so many facets and which, in its nature, is so wide and extensive that little, if any, assistance is so gained from a consideration of what, on other occasions and in other circumstances and on 
          
        another accused person, was a proper sentence to impose.  
        
       
      
    70 I do not find the cited cases of any assistance in determining the limits of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. There is no rule that the intentional killing of a child must always attract a custodial sentence. Each case must be judged on its peculiar facts.71 I find it almost impossible to comprehend the combined effect on the respondent of the waves of misfortune which had swept over her. For her, life was almost unbelievably cruel. This is how the sentencing judge put it -  
     
      
       
        
         
        This offender was required to educate, feel, toilet, bathe, entertain and love Jason. She loved and cared for (her daughter) and did not neglect her despite the constant demands of raising an autistic child. She constantly lived with the fact that her son had lost his best chance of acquiring later life skills because of the failure of authorities to provide appropriate intervention during his early formative years. She carried the burden for her husband and supported him through his mental breakdown and general inability to cope with his life and Jason in particular. She did all this in an environment of physical and emotional abuse from her husband. She worked outside the family home to help support the family. She assisted other with handicapped children. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the offender lived through her grandmother’s illness, her father’s illness and subsequent death on 12 June 2003. She suffered considerable conflict with her stepmother both during her father’s illness and after his death. She suffered the anguish of losing her home in Ballina and being unable to afford to purchase a home in Sydney. Rather than gaining assistance from the authorities by coming to Sydney, she lost the small amount of respite care that she had managed to extract from the relevant Government Department in Ballina. She suffered the trauma of discovering that her stepfather, a man she loved more than her own father, was sexually abusing her daughter, causing her to self-harm and become promiscuous. She was told that she would have to wait a month for counselling for her daughter. She let her husband return to the family home only to find that his conduct during a social function in the week prior to Jason’s death, confirmed her worst fears and left her feeling trapped in a relationship that she hated. She endured all this while suffering a major depressive illness of her own. 
        
       
      
    72 The three consulting psychiatrists and the treating psychiatrist agreed that when she killed the deceased the respondent was suffering from a mental illness. All agreed that her capacity to understand events or to judge whether her actions were right or wrong or to control herself were substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from that condition and that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant her liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. Dr Westmore would have allowed her the defence of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. Her mental processes were badly affected by all the factors bearing upon her, and that was something his Honour was bound to give effect to, particularly when considering whether to impose a sentence which strongly denounced the offence or which might deter others from offending. 
     
      
    73 The Crown was represented by a Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor who submitted that it would be appropriate for his Honour to consider sentencing alternatives less than of full-time custody. I think that the Crown Prosecutor was entitled in this extraordinary case to make that submission. I think that his Honour was correct in concluding that the circumstances of the offence were so exceptional as to justify the imposition of a non-custodial sentence. I think that his Honour was correct in concluding that it was within his discretion to deal with the respondent as he did.  
     
      
    74 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    75 HOEBEN J: I agree with Dunford J.

      2003/136 REGINA v KELLY LOUISE SCHUMACHER 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Kelly Louise Schumacher, was convicted by a jury of an offence of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs (Misuse and Trafficking) Act. The jury’s verdict was on 21 April 2004. The offence of which the offender was convicted is one that carries a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment and also carries, as an additional penalty, a fine but that is not a matter relevant to present considerations. 
     
      
    2 In addition, the offender has asked me to take into account one matter on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act when I sentence her for the offence of which she was convicted by the jury. The offence to be taken into account is one of driving a motor vehicle whilst her licence was suspended and occurred in July 2001. Clearly, there is a considerable disparity between the seriousness of the offence on the Form 1 and the matter for which she is to be sentenced. It seems to me that the matter on the Form 1 has no significance at all in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence under the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act and its only consequence may be that I am required to impose a period of disqualification upon the offender. But I will deal with that issue at the end of these sentencing remarks and after I have imposed sentence for the drug offence. 
     
      
    3 When the matter was before me for sentence on 4 June 2004 after the jury verdict, sentencing was adjourned for the purpose of obtaining pre-sentence reports, both for Ms Schumacher and her co-offender, a man by the name of Roberts, who at one stage was her de facto partner and is the father of her two children. On the last occasion that the matter came before me there was a pre-sentence report prepared for Ms Schumacher but for reasons being no fault of the offender the report was an unsatisfactory one upon which to come to a final conclusion as to what sentence should be imposed upon the offender. Put simply, through an administrative failure by some person in this Court, insufficient notice was given to the Probation and Parole Service of the requirement for a pre-sentence report. Thus, there was insufficient time available to that service to properly prepare a report of sufficient detail that could assist the Court. 
     
      
    4 Therefore, I took the step of standing the matter over on what used to be called a Griffith adjournment and is now under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to give both Ms Schumacher and the Probation and Parole Service a lengthy opportunity to establish a relationship, one with the other, and for Ms Schumacher to take what steps she thought was appropriate to deal with the underlying cause of her criminal conduct, being her addiction to prohibited drugs. It was a requirement of her bail that she report to the Probation and Parole Service and submit to directions of that service in relation to her drug addiction and its treatment. Arguably, she was in breach of those bail conditions because she failed, at least on two occasions, to carry out what was required of her in that regard. 
     
      
    5 I made it clear I think to Ms Schumacher on 4 June that by standing the matter over for a relatively lengthy period and giving her the opportunity to remain at large and under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, I was not to be taken in any way as indicating that Ms Schumacher could avoid a custodial sentence. I indicated to her, somewhat forcefully I think, that the best that she could hope for was that, if she undertook the conditions of the bail and if she genuinely sought assistance from the Probation and Parole Service and those persons to whom she was directed in relation to her drug treatment, it might influence me in fixing a non parole period and in relation to determination as to what type of custodial order should be made in respect of this serious offence. 
     
      
    6 Mr Roberts was also sentenced for the offence for which Ms Schumacher now stands before the Court because he was a co-accused and, as the jury held, a co-offender in relation to a course of criminal conduct in which they were jointly involved in obtaining and supplying amphetamines. In sentencing Mr Roberts I made my view clear that at least over the period with which I was concerned, that it was Ms Schumacher who was more seriously involved in the supply of amphetamines than Mr Roberts. I remain of that view. 
     
      
    7 Ms Schumacher was, over the relevant period (somewhat more than six months by reason of the telephone intercepts but I am sure over a much longer period than that) addicted to amphetamines. She really has never suggested otherwise and it would be pointless for her to do so in light of what is clear from the telephone conversations that were played to the jury. She became involved in amphetamine, as so many people in the community do, through associates, persons with whom she dealt with on a day to day basis as part of her peer group. These were the persons with whom she mixed on a social basis in the area in which she lived in the suburbs of Newcastle. 
     
      
    8 The Probation and Parole report that has now been produced to the Court as a consequence of the adjournment proceedings indicates that she “drifted into the drug culture based upon those persons with whom she was associating, both on an intimate level, such as her then partner and those with whom she mixed socially and in the course of her employment.” There is a suggestion in the report that she first became involved with serious drug taking in 1986 and thereafter became addicted to amphetamine in order to be able to cope with the day-to-day pressures of life. However, from 1996 for a period of about two years, she claims to have not used any illicit substance, mainly because she had become pregnant and gave birth to a son. However, for some reason, which is not revealed in the report, she recommenced using the drug after the birth of her second child. 
     
      
    9 Ms Schumacher, like Mr Roberts, came to the notice of the police not so much because of her wrongdoing but because of the offending of two other persons who were close associates of both Mr Roberts and Ms Schumacher; a man called Walsh and his partner, Ms Love. Richard Walsh is currently in custody remanded to appear before me shortly for the purpose of sentencing proceedings in relation to his involvement in the supply of amphetamine in the Newcastle area. It is, therefore, inappropriate that I say any more about Mr Walsh and his activities. 
     
      
    10 Ms Love was also involved in a very significant way in Mr Walsh’s involvement with the supply of drugs and she was his partner in that enterprise. The situation was that Ms Love distributed drugs obtained by Walsh to persons with whom Ms Love associated, including the offender, whereas Mr Walsh tended to supply drugs to members of a bikie group of which he, at that stage, was the Master at Arms. 
     
      
    11 The telephone calls indicate an intimate relationship between Ms Love and Ms Schumacher. They indicate also that by the time of the telephone calls Ms Schumacher’s relationship with Mr Walsh in respect of the obtaining and supply of drugs had fallen into some problems, mainly, it seems, because Ms Schumacher was unreliable in paying for drugs that she had received from Walsh. In effect, Walsh had vetoed the further supply of drugs to Ms Schumacher until a debt, that he believed was owed to him was paid. In order to force the offender to meet her obligations to him, Walsh had come by a ring that Ms Schumacher had inherited and which he was keeping by way of pledge until Ms Schumacher had been able to in some way pay off the debt that Walsh believed she owed. 
     
      
    12 That is the background to the period with which I am now concerned in sentencing Ms Schumacher. It explains why the telephone calls indicate that the offender was pursuing Ms Love to obtain the drug she needed, unbeknownst to Walsh and contrary to the veto he had imposed. Unfortunately Ms Love had difficulties in fulfilling her personal obligations to Ms Schumacher because of her relationship with Walsh and it is fairly clear that the offender was receiving only very limited supplies of drugs from Ms Love. 
     
      
    13 The phone calls also indicate that Mr Roberts was another source of amphetamine sometimes available to Ms Schumacher. Again, however, Mr Roberts relied upon obtaining supplies from Walsh in order to be able to fulfil the demands made upon him by Ms Schumacher. 
     
      
    14 I indicated on the last occasion, at the relevant time Ms Schumacher was a somewhat desperate young lady who was almost constantly concerned with where her next supply of drug was to come from, when it was to arrive, how much it was to be and what she could do with it when she receive it. 
     
      
    15 It is clear from the telephone calls – and it has never been denied – that Ms Schumacher was herself involved in the business of supply. There are conversations between her and Roberts that indicate that she was attempting at times to obtain drug of sufficient purity that she could cut it down with some other substance and distribute it to a number of persons who obtained their supplies of drugs from her. They were, at times, visiting her home for this purpose. It is clear that Mr Roberts is disapproving of this practice and he remonstrates with the offender about these persons being at her home. But, as I have indicated, Ms Schumacher is desperate for funds, firstly, to ensure her own drug supply from Walsh and secondly, to repay Walsh to free up, as it were, this impediment so that she could obtain drugs for her personal use and on-supply. 
     
      
    16 One only has to listen to the phone calls to hear that Mr Roberts is well and truly at the beck and call of Ms Schumacher. At times she is so desperate for drugs that she is personally abusive to him. She threatens him with revealing information to Walsh that would in some way jeopardise Mr Roberts’ relationship with him. She remonstrates with Roberts for his failure to fulfil what she believes are undertakings given by him to her and others, such as her sister, to supply them with drugs obtained by him from Walsh. 
     
      
    17 There is no doubt at all – and it has never been suggested otherwise – that Ms Schumacher, as was Mr Roberts, was significantly involved in the supply of drugs within the Newcastle area. I am not suggesting that they were involved, at least in the period with which I am concerned and during the course of the activity for which they are to be sentenced, in a commercial operation. In Mr Roberts’ case I was satisfied that Ms Schumacher was not the only person with whom Mr Roberts had an interest in supplying drugs. The person with whom Mr Roberts spoke on the telephone and with whom he, in my view, discussed supplying drugs was a drug supplier and was being recruited by Mr Roberts to supply drugs on his, that is Mr Roberts’, behalf. 
     
      
    18 I am prepared to sentence Ms Schumacher on the basis that there was no person who she was supplying who was also a drug supplier but rather that the persons to whom she supplied drugs were only users of any drug that she could obtain. 
     
      
    19 I am satisfied, for the purposes of sentencing Ms Schumacher for the offence for which she was convicted, that her involvement in the supply of drugs was, as I have already indicated, firstly, to obtain money that she could use to lower the debt to Walsh and secondly, simply so that she could obtain drugs for her own personal use. She was not at this stage involved in a commercial enterprise such as Walsh and Ms Love were. 
     
      
    20 However, as I have indicated, both in sentencing Mr Roberts and in remarks I made to Ms Schumacher when I adjourned the sentencing proceedings, the fact that a person is involved in the supply of drugs on a non-commercial basis in order to satisfy his or her own addiction to drugs is not a mitigating factor. It explains the offence. It puts it into a context but it does not in any way minimise the criminality and the seriousness of the course of conduct in which Ms Schumacher was involved. 
     
      
    21 In the case of Mr Roberts I was satisfied that there was no need for personal deterrence. I was satisfied that Mr Roberts had rehabilitated himself and, particularly as he was no longer under the influence of Walsh, that there was no real likelihood of further offending by him.  
     
      
    22 I am not able to come to the same degree of confidence about Miss Schumacher and that is principally because unfortunately she has not been able to show, during the course of the period in which she was on bail, such a commitment to reform as was shown by Mr Roberts and the clear indication in the report is that on occasions she has been using some sort of illegal substance during the period of the adjournment. 
     
      
    23 Ms Schumacher’s counsel has sensibly acknowledged that, in the light of the events that have occurred since the sentencing of his client was adjourned, whatever possible chance there might have been that Ms Schumacher could have avoided a period of full-time custody has disappeared. One reason for that result is that Ms Schumacher has been found to be unsuitable both for a community service order and for periodic detention. That observation is not to suggest that, even had the Probation Service not made those findings, she could have avoided a sentence of imprisonment. I indicated on the last occasion to her that it was unlikely in the extreme, regardless of what happened during the course of the remand period, that she would receive a non-custodial sentence. 
     
      
    24 The simple fact is the Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that persons who are significantly involved in the supply of illegal drugs within the community should receive a full time custodial sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances. It has also been made perfectly clear that the fact that a person is not involved in a commercial enterprise does not mean that the person is not significantly involved in the supply of drugs so that a full time custodial sentence can be avoided. 
     
      
    25 The reason for this sentencing policy is obvious. Firstly, the offence of which Ms Schumacher has been convicted is one that carries a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment. That maximum penalty indicates the seriousness with which Parliament and the community in general consider this type of conduct. Secondly such conduct is prevalent in the community and must be met with severe penalties simply for the purposes of deterring others from similar criminal behaviour. 
     
      
    26 In the offender’s case her criminal behaviour does not arise from an exceptional and isolated incident but derives from a course of criminal conduct over a not insignificant period of time. Ms Schumacher can be regarded as a person of no prior convictions but the appellate courts have indicated that in sentencing for offences of this nature less weight can be given to that factor than might otherwise be the case. Ms Schumacher has knowingly and voluntarily to a degree been involved in this course of criminal conduct over a period of time and therefore, in such circumstances, less weight can be given to her otherwise good character. 
     
      
    27 Further, general deterrence is such an important matter when dealing with offences of this nature that it almost invariably requires a full time custodial sentence to be imposed commensurate with the criminal conduct in which the person has been involved. 
     
      
    28 Ms Schumacher has two children aged six and seven. Those children are at the time in their lives where their relationship with their mother is an important part of their development. Clearly anything that will interfere with that relationship should be avoided if it is at all possible to do so. Fortunately, the offender’s mother is available to care for the children, although clearly it will be difficult for her to do so and she cannot offer the emotional and close relationship that a mother can to these young children. It is also unfortunate that the father of the children is also in custody. Mr Roberts has received a lengthy sentence and not simply for the offence for which Ms Schumacher is being sentenced but for other serious acts of criminality. 
     
      
    29 However, it has been clearly stated on more than one occasion that the impact of imprisonment upon other persons such as the children of the offender can have little weight in determining the sentence to be imposed upon the offender unless there are very exceptional circumstances. There are none in the present case and although, of course, I take into account that the offender is a mother with two young children I cannot let that fact lead me to take a course which is not otherwise appropriate to deal with her criminality and the other important aspects of sentencing for such an offence. 
     
      
    30 The question of parity arises between the offender and Mr Roberts. I sentenced Mr Roberts for the offence for which the offender stands to be sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of 13 months. That sentence, however, was to be served cumulatively upon two other sentences that were imposed for unrelated criminal activity. It seems to me, however, that it is still appropriate to have regard to the sentence that was imposed by me for the offence on Mr Roberts when determining what I should do with Ms Schumacher. 
     
      
    31 Mr O’Sullivan, who appears for the offender, urged me to impose upon his client no harsher sentence than that which I imposed on Mr Roberts. I have already indicated to some degree that Ms Schumacher was more involved in the supply of drugs over the period for which she is being sentenced than was Mr Roberts. However, there was in Mr Roberts’ case evidence of him attempting to recruit another person to supply drugs on his behalf. 
     
      
    32 It seems to me at the end of the day that they should be dealt with in more or less the same way, that is, at least so far as the head sentence is concerned. There are factors on either side of the equation which cancel themselves out overall and indicate that it would be appropriate to adopt the usual philosophy that persons who are convicted of the same offence based upon the same criminal conduct should receive the same penalty. 
     
      
    33 The question arises as to the non-parole period. Parity does not necessarily apply with the same force in determining a non-parole period because a finding of special circumstances is a decision based more upon the offender’s subjective circumstances than is the determination of the head sentence. There can be differences between the offenders in terms of their prospects of rehabilitation, for example, that may lead to a difference in the non-parole being set for each offender  
     
      
    34 The matter that concerns me in Ms Schumacher’s case is whether, in light of the material contained in the pre-sentence report, I should find that there are special circumstances. A head sentence of two years would normally carry a non-parole period of 18 months if the statutory relationship were applied. I found special circumstances in Mr Roberts’ case, one of the reasons being because I was accumulating sentences. Also, Mr Roberts’ case is somewhat different because there was a degree of rehabilitation and reform that had occurred. 
     
      
    35 On the other hand, it seems to me that, although Ms Schumacher has failed to take sufficient opportunity of the remand period, she has not been completely wiped, as it were, by the Probation and Parole Service. It seems to me to be in the public interest that Ms Schumacher has longer on parole under supervision by the Probation and Parole Service than would be occasioned by the application of the general ratio between head sentence and non-parole period. That is because clearly there are significant matters in Miss Schumacher’s personality and her social environment when she is out of custody that need to be addressed by professionals. Ms Schumacher has acknowledged that she is unable to cope at times and returns to drug usage without almost wishing to do so simply because it is a mechanism by which she can deal with the difficulties no doubt that attend her life struggling, as it seems to be, to bring up these two young children in some financial difficulty. 
     
      
    36 Ms Schumacher is not past the age or period of life where she is beyond reform. She will have a period in custody during which, hopefully, she will be forced to abstain from drugs, at least amphetamine. It may be that such enforced abstinence will assist her so that when she is released she may be more committed to gaining assistance from the Probation and Parole Service. It seems to me that notwithstanding her poor conduct on bail I should give her the benefit of a finding of special circumstances because of the need for a longer period of supervision. 
     
      
    37 In all the circumstances it seems to me that the appropriate head sentence and non-parole period is that which I imposed on Mr Roberts. In those circumstances, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, Ms Schumacher, you are convicted. You are sentenced to imprisonment for two years. The sentence is to date from today. There is to be a non- parole period of 13 months which is to date from today and to expire on 4 December 2005, the date upon which she is to be released to parole. 
     
      
    38 It is to be a condition of her parole that she place herself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and for the period required by that Service undertake such rehabilitation, counselling or other treatment as required by the Probation Service in respect of her involvement with drugs. 
     
      
    39 She is disqualified from holding a driver’s licence for a period of two years from today.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 14 June 2001, the appellant, represented by Mr. Gelbert of Counsel, pleaded guilty before Armitage DCJ on two charges under ss.232(6) and 1317FA(1) of the Corporations Law, as taken to be included in the Corporations Act by s.1401 of that Act, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) On or about 8 July 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, while an officer of Schoeller Australia Limited (""Schoeller"") knowingly and dishonestly and intending to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself and Catherine Parkes made improper use of his position as such an officer by causing Schoeller to pay the sum of $10,000 to Barrack Mortgage Managers Pty Limited.  
         
         
        (ii) On or about 20 August 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, while an officer of Schoeller Australia Limited (""Schoeller"") knowingly and dishonestly and intending to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself and Catherine Parkes made improper use of his position as such an officer by causing Schoeller to pay the sum of $145,980.85 to the State Bank of NSW.  
        
       
      
    2 The appellant also admitted to further offences and asked that they be taken into account, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        On or about 19 July 1996 at Sydney, while an officer of Schoeller Australia Limited (""Schoeller"") knowingly and dishonestly and intending to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself and Catherine Parkes made improper use of his position as such an officer by causing Schoeller to pay the sum of $13,000 to Barrack Mortgage Managers Pty Limited.  
         
         
        On or about 20 August 1996 at Sydney, while an officer of Schoeller Australia Limited (""Schoeller"") knowingly and dishonestly and intending to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself and Catherine Parkes made improper use of his position as such an officer by causing Schoeller to pay the sum of $16,665 to the State Bank of NSW Limited  
        
       
      
    3 Armitage DCJ then remanded the appellant for sentence to the District Court in Sydney on 3 August, and refused bail. 
     
      
    4 Proceedings on sentence commenced before Christie DCJ on 24 August 2001, the appellant still being represented by Mr. Gelbert. Documentary evidence was tendered and admitted without objection, including a Statement of Facts. Counsel addressed on penalty. The matter was then adjourned to 1 November 2001 at 2pm for sentence.  
     
      
    5 On 1 November 2001, Mr. Gelbert and his instructing solicitor sought and were granted leave to withdraw, in circumstances where the appellant wished to apply to withdraw his plea of guilty. The matter then adjourned; and after some further adjournments, Christie DCJ heard this application on 11 June 2002 and 19 July 2002.  
     
      
    6 On 5 September 2002, Christie DCJ gave judgment in which he dismissed the application to withdraw the plea of guilty; and on 16 October 2002, he passed sentence on the appellant.  
     
      
    7 At that time, the appellant was serving a sentence for other offences, the total head sentence being for five years from 25 May 2001, with an overall non-parole of three years expiring 24 May 2004. Christie DCJ sentenced the appellant on count 2 to twelve months imprisonment, to date from 24 May 2004 and expiring on 23 May 2005, and on count 1 to six months imprisonment to date from 24 May 2004 and expire on 23 November 2004. He fixed a single non-parole period of four years expiring on 23 May 2005.  
     
      
    8 On 13 September 2002, the appellant lodged a Notice of Intention to Appeal, which lapsed on 13 March 2003. On 1 April 2004, he filed a Notice of Appeal against conviction and sentence, and a Notice of Application for Extension of Time.  
     
      
       
       
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    9 The appellant seeks to rely on the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1 That His Honours Blanche and Armitage erred by not granting the Appellant an adjournment sufficient for a Corporations Law matter to be adequately defended.  
         
         
        2 That DCJ Christie erred by not allowing a plea reversal and not accepting the evidence of counsel and the solicitor for the Appellant acknowledging “ 
        there was no consciousness of guilt""  
        when the guilty plea was entered.  
         
         
        3 That His Honour erred by attempting to ascertain the strength of the defence when the matter before the court was that of a plea reversal. There was sufficient material to support a plea reversal. The material provided was not an attempt at a full defence.  
         
         
        4 That His Honour erred by judicially determining the guilt of the Appellant in the absence of a jury.  
         
         
        5 That His Honour erred by not establishing from the Appellant whether there were any inducements provided to enter his guilty plea.  
         
         
        6 That there was a miscarriage of justice when the Appellant was informed by counsel that there were no records at ASIC to assist his defence.  
         
         
        7 That His Honour erred by not establishing from the Appellant that all of the documents required were made available to the Appellant and that the decision to enter a guilty plea was made with the benefit of all of those documents.  
         
         
        8 That His Honour erred when he judicially considered evidence that was inadmissible under Section 18 of the Evidence Act.  
         
         
        9 That there was a miscarriage of justice when the Appellant was tried separately on different counts for the same trading period involving the same corporate entity.  
         
         
        10 That a miscarriage of justice occurred when the Crown tendered a Statement of Facts that it knew or ought to have known, contained substantial inaccuracies and inadmissible evidence.  
         
         
        11 That a miscarriage of justice occurred when the prosecution took over 5 years to mount it's (sic) case and continues to occur as the matter is now 8 years old.  
         
         
        12 That a miscarriage occurred with the learned trial judge permitted the Crown to access privileged correspondence.  
         
         
        13 The charges are legally unstainable.  
         
         
        14 Bail should have been granted to allow procedural fairness to the Appellant.  
         
         
        15 The delay in having this appeal considered and the period the Appellant has spent in maximum security occasioned by the delay now needs to be impacted upon the sentence.  
        
       
       
      STATEMENT OF FACTS 
      
    10 A convenient starting point for consideration of this matter is the Statement of Facts admitted into evidence without objection on 24 August 2001, but which the appellant contends contains substantial inaccuracies: 
     
      
       
        
        1. From December 1995 Damien Parkes (""the Prisoner"") was an officer and was in control of Schoeller Australia Limited (“Schoeller"").  
         
         
        2. Schoeller purported to operate as a merchant bank and raised unsecured funds from the public until 12 January 1997 when it was placed into administration. It was placed into liquidation on 27 August 1997.  
         
         
        3. In early 1996, the Prisoner told his estranged wife and the mother of their four children, Catherine Parkes, that he would find her alternative accommodation to the two bedroom unit that she and the children were residing in. He said to her that he  
        ""would try and get  
        a  
        house"".  
         
         
        4. She then saw an advertisement for a property at 355 Military Road, Vaucluse (the “property"") in the paper and had a conversation with the Prisoner about her desire to move into the property. He said that he would have a look at the property. After inspecting the property he told her  
        ""Yes I'll do it if I can"". 
         
         
        5. When he was inspecting the property the Prisoner told the Real Estate Agent "" 
        This is not for me. I've just got to make sure that it is comfortable for my wife and children."" 
         
         
        6. In late May 1996, the Prisoner approached a Schoeller employee and former solicitor, Kenneth Long (""Long""), and the following conversation took place:  
         
        The Prisoner: ""We are going to buy  
        a  
        property to accommodate the children of one of the shareholders of Schoeller, Dr Sung Cha. Dr Cha has significant funds in Schoeller. The purchase will be through  
        a  
        trust.""  
         
        Long: ""What do you want me to do?"" 
         
        The Prisoner: “Just do the conveyancing."" 
         
         
        7. On 30 May 1996, a trust was set up called the First Capital Trust. The trustee of this trust was Barrack Mortgage Managers Pty Limited (“Barrack"") and the sole director of that company, at that time, was Long. Long had been asked to set up Barrack as a shelf company by the Prisoner in November 1995. The primary beneficiaries of the trust was the Pan Pacific Bankers Trust. The Prisoner was the executive director of both trusts (""the executive director""). The executive director had all the same powers of the trustee to buy and sell property. 
         
         
        8. On 30 May 1996, contracts were exchanged for the property (“the first contract”). The purchase price was $460,000. The first contract was signed by the Prisoner. The name of the Purchaser on this contract was Pan Pacific BT Nominees P/L as trustee for the First Capital Trust. This contract was signed by the Prisoner as a director of Pan Pacific BT Nominees Pty Limited. 
         
         
        9. The first contract incorrectly showed Pan Pacific BT Nominees as the trustee of the First Capital Trust. That error was remedied by the creation of a second contract dated 5 July 1996 which had Barrack as the Purchaser. This contract replaced the first contract. 
         
         
        10. The deposit for the property was paid by way of a cheque for $23,000 dated 7 June 1996 (5% of the purchase price) drawn on the account of Barrack as trustee for the First Capital Trust. This cheque was signed by Long after the Prisoner had said to him,  
        “I need a $23,000 cheque to cover the five percent deposit on the property. Take it out of the First Capital Trust Account. I’ll transfer funds to cover the cheque.” 
         
         
        11. The cheque was presented on 14 June 1996 leaving the Barrack account overdrawn for $22,900. On 8 July 1996 and 19 July 1996 the Prisoner authorised the payment by Schoeller of $10,000 and $13,000 respectively to Barrack to cover this overdraft after requests made by Long. The Prisoner signed both cheques and authorised both cheque requisitions. 
         
         
        12. The $10,000 payment is the subject of the first count on the indictment. The $13,000 payment is the subject of the first charge on the Schedule. 
         
         
        13. On around 2 August 1996 the prisoner signed a letter without an addressee which stated: 
         
          
          ""RE BARRACK MORTGAGE MANAGERS PTY LIMITED AS TRUSTEE FOR THE FIRST CAPITAL TRUST  
           
          We refer to the above and confirm that Schoeller is holding funds on behalf of Dr Cha's interests which generate sufficient income on a monthly basis to cover the payments on the loan of $420,000 for the Vaucluse property on the assumption that the interest rate is 12% per annum. It is anticipated that the monthly interest repayments will be made directly from Schoeller.""  
          
         
         
        The letter was received by the Solicitors for Arkway Pty Ltd, the first mortgagee.  
         
         
        14. Long drafted this letter on the Prisoner's instructions for a lender or a lender's solicitor. When shown this letter during an examination held pursuant to s.19 of the Australian Securities Commission (""ASC"") Act on 8 December 1997 (""the December examination""), the Prisoner admitted that he signed it although he said that he could not recall it. He also admitted that there were no funds on deposit to generate that monthly income.  
         
         
        15. The settlement for the property occurred on 20 August 1996. On that day, the Prisoner authorised and signed a cheque from Schoeller payable to the State Bank of NSW for $145,980.85. This was used to purchase a bank cheque to pay the vendors of the property (""the Cohens"") as part of the settlement monies. In the s.19 examination the Prisoner admitted he signed the cheque requisition, he said  
        ""I presume I authorised it”  
        but states that he could not recall it.  
         
         
        16. Also on 20 August 1996, the Prisoner authorised and signed a cheque from Schoeller payable to the State Bank of NSW for $16,555. This was used to purchase a bank cheque to pay the stamp duty on the property. 
         
         
        17. The first of these two payments is the subject of the second count on the indictment and the second payment is the subject of the second charge on the Schedule.  
         
         
        18. Annexed hereto and marked ""A"" is a diagram which shows the companies and trusts associated with the Prisoner.  
         
         
        19. The Prisoner admitted in the s.19 examination that his wife and children lived in the property. He stated that it was originally an investment property  
        for  
        a  
        trust with an offshore beneficiary.  
        He admitted signing the first contract for the purchase but said  
        ""I was asked  
        to  
        sign it by the beneficiaries of the trust originally ... I think that's Cha … I can't remember"" 
        .  
         
         
        20. The Prisoner stated that he had inspected the property on one occasion prior to the purchase. The Prisoner stated that either Cha (later in the December examination he said it was Dr Cha) or another person called Chia rang and said that  
        ""he was interested in investing ...in the area. And I was familiar with the area, because I know that Mrs Parkes was also in the marketplace. He nominated the place, and I went and had  
        a  
        look  
        at  
        it.” 
         
         
        21. In August 1996, Mrs Parkes and her four children moved into the property. There was no rent paid by either Mrs Parkes or the Prisoner to Schoeller. During her examination under s.19 of the ASC Act on 3 July 1998, Mrs Parkes stated that her only understanding was that the Prisoner was buying the property for her and their four children. 
         
         
        22. In the December examination, the Prisoner explained how Mrs Parkes and his children came to reside in the property as follows:  
        “There was  
        a  
        problem that he had with his children at university and they didn't want to reside there. ... both Cha and Chia both have kids, both  
        at  
        university Q. .in Australia.  
        A.  
        ""Yes... the children didn't like the place”:  
        However in an earlier examination under s.19 of the ASC Act on 29 July 1997 (""the July examination”) the prisoner was asked about Mr Cha's family. He replied:  
         
        A. ""He was divorced. That’s all I know."" 
         
        Q. ""Does he have children?""  
         
        A. ""I don't know.""  
         
        Q. ""Don't know?""  
         
        A. ""No.""  
         
        Q. ""Don't know whether he has family or children residing in Australia?  
         
        A. ""No. I'm fairly sure he doesn't.  
         
         
        23. In the July examination the Prisoner has said that Chia had two children and it was he who was  
        ""buying property out here and he was going to have his kids educated here” 
        .  
         
         
        24. The Prisoner also attributed the reason for the purchase of the property to Chia in a note written to the liquidator in 1998 where he wrote: 
         
          
          “Cheq (sic) to Cohen on behalf of Chia. Chia was owed money from Pantec. We did a set off. Add the Cohen cheq (sic) to Pantec Australia debt. Journal entry December verifies this.” 
          
         
         
        25. This explanation can be contrasted to the explanation of the payment as stated on the cheque requisition relevant to the payment of $145,980.85. The cheque requisition indicated that the amount was to be put to the loan account of Barrack. 
         
         
        26. Parkes was a former director of Pantec Australia and continued to exercise financial control of that company. 
         
         
        27. In relation to the other three payments, the relevant cheque requisitions indicated that the payments of $10,000, $13,000, and $16,655 were to be put to the loan account of “AWC”. AWC is an abbreviation of Austwide Capital Pty Limited which is also another company controlled by the Prisoner. 
         
         
        28. All four cheque requisitions do not match the final accounting records which were delivered to the liquidator by the directors of Schoeller. Those accounts show that none of these payments were attributed as relating to either AWC or Barrack. Those accounts show that the payment of $145,980.85 is recorded as a loan to Pantec Australia Pty Ltd and the payments of $10,000, $13,000 and $16,655 were debited to a General Ledger account in the name of First Capital Trust. 
         
         
        29. There is no loan contract or agreement by any of the parties Pantec Australia, Austwide Capital or Barrack, to repay the funds advanced by Schoeller or interest on the funds advanced by Schoeller. None of these advances were reported to Schoeller’s directors or to Schoeller’s Credit Committee. Pantec Australia and Austwide Capital were deregistered on 11 June 1997 and 11 September 1998 respectively. Barrack was placed into liquidation on 30 March 1999. 
         
         
        30. The monies advanced by Schoeller in respect of the property have not been recovered by Schoeller. Schoeller was never paid a fee for its involvement in the purchase of the property. 
         
         
        31. None of the staff of Schoeller, nor Mrs Parkes, nor any of the Directors of Schoeller have ever met or spoken to, or seen any correspondence to or from Cha or Chia. Neither Cha nor Chia have made a claim in the liquidation of Schoeller.  
         
         
        32. The Prisoner maintains that neither he nor his family are beneficiaries of the First Capital Trust. Notwithstanding this, Mrs Parkes resided at the property from August 1996 until shortly before her death in November 1999. The Prisoner's four children continue to reside at the property. The Prisoner has resided at the property for periods of time between November 1999 and May 2001.  
         
         
        33. As at 1 July 1998, Schoeller had a deficiency of approximately $2.8 million of which investors were owed approximately $2.4 million.  
        
       
      
    11 The numbers of the paragraphs were added for ease of reference. The diagram referred to is attached at the end of this judgment.  
     
      
       
      SOME FACTUAL ISSUES 
      
    12 Without detailing all of the alleged inaccuracies suggested by the appellant, it appears that the substance of the challenges to the statement, and the substantial defence that would be raised by the appellant if withdrawal of his plea were permitted, would include the following matters:  
     
      
      1. The transactions in question were approved by the Credit Committee and the Board of Schoeller. 
       
      2. They did not involve dishonesty, intention to gain advantage, or improper use of the appellant’s position, inter alia because: 
       
        
        (a) they were for full consideration to Schoeller; 
         
        (b) they involved no improper advantage to the appellant or his wife. 
        
       
      3. As to (a), in respect of the three smaller payments, the loan to Barrack was protected by caveat, amounts were repaid by 24 October 1996 when the caveat was withdrawn, and Schoeller received a fee from the proceeds of the second mortgage from which the amounts were repaid. 
       
      4. As to (a) in respect of the larger payment, this was a loan to Pantec which dealt with Schoeller on commercial terms and had given security to Schoeller in respect of its loan account. 
       
      5. As to (b), the appellant and his wife obtained no interest in the property, and paid a commercial rent for their occupation of it. 
       
      6. The beneficiary of the transaction was Pan Pacific Bankers (HK) Trust, which was associated with a Mr. Cha or Mr. Chia; and it owned Schoeller with a paid up capital of $1 million. 
       
      
    13 Part of the complaint of the appellant is that, when he pleaded guilty, he was unaware of material that would have assisted his defence. Before reviewing what appears to me to be the most significant of this material, it is convenient to set out some additional facts concerning the Vaucluse property, which do not seem to be the subject of dispute.  
     
      
    14 It appears that Barrack was the trustee of First Capital Trust from 30 May 1996 until 4 May 1997, that Marine & Industrial Technology Pty. Limited (Marine) was trustee from 4 April 1997 to 16 September 1997, and that Barrack became trustee again on 16 September 1997. 
     
      
    15 The purchase of the Vaucluse property was funded by amounts provided by Schoeller, and also by a loan of $300,000.00 from Arkway Pty. Limited to Barrack, secured on first mortgage, arranged through Shakespeare Haney, Solicitors.  
     
      
    16 On or about 24 October 1996, Barrack borrowed $50,000.00 from Stanley Wilson, a client of Jasmina Rogers, secured by a second mortgage over the Vaucluse property, of which $46,623.00, part of the principal, was deposited in Schoeller’s bank account with the National Australia Bank. On or about 18 November 1996, Schoeller paid an instalment of $9,000.00 under this mortgage to Mrs. Rogers.  
     
      
    17 Schoeller was placed into administration on 12 January 1997.  
     
      
    18 On about 4 April 1997, Marine borrowed $305,000.00 from Norma Smithers and Kentwell & Taylor, secured by a first mortgage over the Vaucluse property, and $94,000.00 from Sydney and Lynette Helprin, secured by second mortgage over the Vaucluse property. These loans were arranged through Kremnizer & Co., Solicitors, and were used to pay out previous mortgages.  
     
      
    19 On 12 October 1999, the Vaucluse property was sold at auction. The proceeds were barely sufficient to pay out the mortgages, and there was no return to Schoeller. The appellant, and his wife and children, subsequently returned to live in the property by arrangement with the new owner.  
     
      
    20 Returning to the $145,980.85 applied towards purchase of the property, the records of Schoeller attributed this to the loan account of Pantec, increasing the amount due to Schoeller on that account from $199,023.63 to $345,004.48. The Pantec loan was never repaid, and Pantec was de-registered in June 1997.  
     
      
    21 I return to the documentary material that the appellant says he was unaware of when he pleaded guilty and which he says would assist his defence. The most significant of this material appears to be the following. 
     
      
    22 First, there are documents concerning the second mortgage advance of $50,000.00: however, they do no more than confirm that $46,623.00 was paid into Schoeller’s bank account on 24 October 1996.  
     
      
    23 Next, there are documents confirming the existence of persons named Cha and Chia.  
     
      
    24 Next, there are documents recording the $145,980.85 as a loan to Pantec, and the existence of security from Pantec (said to be contrary to the Statement of Facts).  
     
      
    25 Next, there are document showing that the ultimate beneficiary of the trust was Pan Pacific Bankers (HK) Trust, not the appellant or any of his family.  
     
      
    26 Next, there is a Schoeller document showing debits to First Capital Trust totalling $39,655.00 on 18 July 1996, 25 July 1996 and 20 August 1996, and a credit of $69,000.00 on 21 December 1996. However, this document does not show the receipt of $46,623.00 on 24 October 1996 or the payment of $9,000.00 on 18 November 1996. And there is a First Capital Trust document as at 4 March 1997 showing $40,000.00 from Schoeller repaid out of the second mortgage “Ex Rogers”, and a debit of $145,980.00 to Pantec, but not showing the payment of $9,000.00 on 18 November 1996.  
     
      
    27 There is a caveat over the Vaucluse property lodged on 9 September 1996 and withdrawn on 24 October 1996; suggesting that it may have been lodged to give security for the $40,000.00 and withdrawn when the second mortgage advance was received.  
     
      
    28 There is a Barrack document as at 30 June 1998 suggesting an expectation of rent at $400.00 per week in respect of the First Capital Trust.  
     
      
    29 There are documents suggesting some participation of the Credit Committee and of the Board of Schoeller, contrary to the Statement of Facts. 
     
      
    30 Finally, there are records of payments to mortgagees or their representatives, said by the appellant to be payments of rent paid direct to the mortgagees. These records start in March 1997 and finish in May 1998. 
     
      
       
      PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
      
    31 The grounds of appeal need also to be considered in the light of the procedural history of the matter, and it is appropriate to outline this.  
     
      
    32 The committal hearing occurred in February 2001, and at this the appellant was unrepresented. He was committed for trial on four charges. Although this hearing disclosed relevant material, the appellant says he was unable to satisfactorily investigate it because he was imprisoned on other charges on 25 May 2001.  
     
      
    33 On 30 March 2001, Mr. O’Connor, solicitor, appeared for the appellant before Blanch CJ, and the matter was adjourned to 6 April 2001 to fix a trial date. 
     
      
    34 On 6 April 2001, Mr. O’Connor appeared before Blanch CJ, and the trial was fixed for 12 June 2001.  
     
      
    35 Following his incarceration on 25 May 2001, the appellant applied for legal aid, and this was granted on 9 June 2001.  
     
      
    36 Meanwhile, on 1 June 2001, Mr. D’Arbon of Counsel appeared for the appellant before Christie DCJ, and sought four weeks’ adjournment. This was opposed by the Crown and refused. The trial date was confirmed for 12 June 2001.  
     
      
    37 The matter came before Armitage DCJ on 12 June 2001, and on that day Mr. Gelbert applied for an adjournment of two days. This was not opposed and the adjournment was granted. 
     
      
    38 On 14 June 2001 the appellant, still represented by Mr. Gelbert, pleaded guilty to two charges, and asked that two further offences be taken into account. On 15 June 2001, the appellant signed the following document, witnessed by Mr. Gelbert: 
     
      
       
        
        I Damien Parkes am presently charged with 4 counts pursuant to s.232(6) Corporations Act that while being an officer of Schoeller Australia Ltd I did with intent of gain/advantage make improper use of my position by causing Schoeller to pay $155,980.85 to Barrack Mortgage Managers and $29,665.00 to the State Bank of NSW.  
         
         
        I have had a lengthy conference with my barrister, Maurice Gelbert and legal clerk Michael O’Connor yesterday and have now decided to plead guilty to these matters today before Judge Armitage. 
         
         
        I provide these instructions with the knowledge that I am unable to defend these charges with any evidence capable of demonstrating that the house purchase was for anything other than a vehicle to provide accommodation for my estranged wife and 4 children.  
         
         
        I understand that these charges relate to the purchase of a property situate at 355 Military Rd Vaucluse by First Capital Trust and Barrack Mortgage Managers of which Ken Long was a director. 
         
         
        It is clear in the Statement of Facts that I was representing to Ken Long that [struck out]. 
         
         
        I understand that if there were some evidence that the house was being rented by my wife or paid for by my or her personal monies then no charges would be forthcoming. 
         
         
        I give these instructions on the basis that I am aware that I am pleading guilty at the first opportunity to a revised set of charges in that charges 1 + 3. I will plead to on the indictment and charges 2 + 4 will be put on a schedule to be taken into account by the sentencing judge. 
         
         
        I am aware that these charges will incur a full custodial sentence.  
         
         
        I am also aware that after pleading guilty today the matter will be adjourned for some time to enable preparation for sentence submissions. 
        
       
      
    39 Events leading up to the hearing by Christie DCJ of the application to withdraw the plea are set out above.  
     
      
    40 Before Christie DCJ, the appellant relied principally on the contentions that he did not plead guilty from any consciousness of guilt but by reason of a sense of hopelessness, because he could not locate documents that would establish his innocence.  
     
      
       
      DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE 
      
    41 In his reasons for refusing leave, Christie DCJ referred to and accepted the contents of affidavits provided by Mr. Gelbert and Mr. O’Connor. He assessed the appellant as an intelligent person, and also as being capable of saying anything that would appear to him to justify the stance he now took. He said he was not able to accept that the appellant did not understand what he was doing when he signed the written instructions. He said that a proposition put forward by the appellant that he withheld rent in respect of the mortgaged property and paid it to mortgagees was “off the top of his head on 11 June 2002”.  
     
      
    42 The primary judge said that there was no evidence that there was anything that could establish payment by the appellant or his wife for the purchase or occupation of the premises, or that anyone at Schoeller knew, much less approved, of the advances made for the purchase of the property. He said that the moneys advanced by Schoeller were not recovered. He held that the plea was a free and voluntary admission by the appellant of the essential elements of the offence.  
     
      
    43 The primary judge considered that there could be some dispute about some aspects of the facts, meaning the facts set out in the Statement of Facts referred to above, but none that would affect the validity of the plea for the factual basis of the elements of the offence.  
     
      
       
      ISSUES ON APPEAL 
      
    44 The grounds of appeal against conviction relate to the following general issues: 
     
      
      1. Refusal of adjournments (ground 1). 
       
      2. Other procedural matters (delay and matters going to preparation of appeal) (grounds 11 and 14). 
       
      3. Matters going to the integrity of the plea (grounds 2, 5, 6, 7 and 12). 
       
      4. Matters going to the existence of a real question to be tried (grounds 3, 4, 8 and 10). 
       
      
    45 The remaining grounds 9 and 15 relate to the matter of sentence.  
     
      
    46 The matters in 3 and 4 above are interrelated. The appellant said that his plea did not arise from recognition of guilt because of pressure, lack of preparation and a feeling of hopelessness; and the later discovery of documents both confirms the lack of preparation and pressure and the existence of a real question to be tried. 
     
      
    47 I will deal first with the procedural matters 1 and 2, then with other conviction matters under 3 and 4 above, and then with sentence. First however, I will consider the law applicable to the conviction appeal. 
     
      
       
      RELEVANT LAW 
      
    48 As stated by Studdert J in R v. ARG NSWCCA 2/8/83, “an application to withdraw a plea of guilty particularly where followed by conviction and sentence must be considered with caution”; and his Honour went on the cite the following statement by Kirby J in Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122: 
     
      
       
        
        For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: see  
        O'Neill  
        [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R 59;  
        Sagiv  
        (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81.  
        
       
      
    49 In the present case, the application to withdraw the plea was made before sentence, and possibly before conviction. It is not entirely clear whether the remanding of the appellant for sentence amounted to conviction: Maxwell v. The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501. But while more caution might be required where leave to withdraw a plea is sought after conviction and sentence, the principles that apply where the application is made before conviction and sentence are to similar effect: R v. Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320, R v. Vergara [1999] NSWCCA 352. In general, leave will be granted if the application for leave shows that the plea did not arise from genuine recognition of guilt (whether because of misunderstanding of the facts or of the elements of the charge, or because of pressure, or because of some other reason) and that there is a real question to be tried. 
     
      
    50 Where the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty is made before sentence, and an appeal is brought from refusal to grant that leave, the appeal court will intervene only if the judge who refused leave fell into error in the exercise of discretion in the manner described in House v. The King (1935) 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
       
      PROCEDURAL MATTERS 
      
    51 The appellant challenges the refusal of adjournments by Blanch CJ and Armitage DCJ. I would take this challenge as extending also to the refusal of an adjournment by Christie DCJ on 1 June 2001. 
     
      
    52 In my opinion, in circumstances where there was a committal hearing in February 2001 in which the Crown case was led, where the appellant had legal representation in March and April 2001, and where he did not apply for legal aid until about May or June 2001, it cannot be said that the refusal of adjournments were errors justifying appellate intervention. The appellant was incarcerated on 24 May 2001, and undoubtedly this hindered his preparation for trial, but no substantial justification is offered for his not preparing for trial in the period between the committal proceedings and 25 May 2001.  
     
      
    53 The delay that occurred between the offences and the conclusion of the hearing below is not a matter of material relevance to the present appeal. The delay between the imposition of sentence and the hearing of this appeal appears to a considerable extent to be due to a mistaken belief of the appellant as to how his appeal was to be progressed. I am prepared to grant necessary extensions of time to enable the appeal to be dealt with, but this delay is not a matter that in any way supports the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    54 The appellant was refused bail which he sought for the purpose of preparation of this appeal. This is not a matter which can of itself support the appeal, although the Court can take into account that the incarceration of the appellant, who was unrepresented, has restricted his ability to collate material that may have assisted him. However, that question only arises if the Court finds that the decision of Christie DCJ was vitiated by error, so that this Court has to reconsider the application to withdraw the plea. 
     
      
       
      OTHER CONVICTION GROUNDS 
      
    55 Some grounds can be disposed of briefly. Ground 3 fails: it is appropriate on an application for leave to withdraw a plea to consider whether there is a real issue to be tried, and this is what the primary judge did. Ground 4 fails: rejection of an application for leave to withdraw a plea did not involve a trial on indictment within s.80 of the Constitution. Ground 8 fails: the evidence of Mrs. Parkes was not admitted; nor was it inadmissible since s.18 of the Evidence Act does no more than limit the compellability of spouses to give evidence. Ground 12 fails: the appellant’s evidence in support of his application to withdraw his plea raised and dealt with his communications with his legal advisers, so that evidence as to those communications from his advisers was no longer excluded by privilege.  
     
      
    56 The remaining grounds are more substantial, and I will briefly outline the appellant’s submissions, which were long and extremely repetitious.  
     
      
    57 The appellant pointed to cross-examination of Mr. O’Connor before the primary judge, in which Mr. O’Connor admitted inter alia that on 6 April 2001, he was pretty “clueless” about the terms of the matter, had not issued subpoenas, did not have a copy of the s.19 examinations, and had not requested particulars of the four charges. The appellant submitted that he met his barrister Mr. Gelbert for the first time on the morning of 12 June 2001, had a two-hour conference with him on 13 June, when he was advised to plead guilty but asked Mr. Gelbert to see documents held by ASIC; and was told by him on 14 June that he had been to ASIC and they did not have any documents, and that he could not get the transcript of the committal proceedings. The appellant submitted that Mr. Gelbert’s evidence that he had a meeting with the appellant before 12 June, when he explained the elements of the offence, was incorrect, because Mr. Gelbert is recorded in the transcript of 12 June as saying he had met the appellant for the first time that morning.  
     
      
    58 The appellant referred to documents that he later obtained, and inaccuracies in the Statement of Facts, the general nature of which is referred to above.  
     
      
    59 The following alleged errors in the judgment of the primary judge were identified, in that, contrary to statements in the judge’s reasons: first, there was evidence of rent paid by the appellant and/or Mrs. Parkes; second, there was no justification for the primary judge’s adverse finding on the appellant’s credit; third, moneys were recovered; fourth, there was evidence that the directors and/or the credit committee knew and approved of the transactions; fifth, there were assertions and evidence as to who was or was not the beneficiary of the First Capital Trust; sixth, there was evidence that the sum of about $145,000.00 referred to in the second count was a loan to Pantec on commercial terms for which security was given; seventh, there were circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea; and eighth, the appellant was not advised by competent and experienced Counsel and was pressured to plead guilty. I will deal with these suggested errors in turn.  
     
      
    60 In considering whether there were such errors, it is useful to have regard to the relevant elements of the offence. There was no question that the appellant was an officer of Schoeller and that he caused Schoeller to pay the sums in question. The possible issues related to whether this use was improper, whether the appellant intended to gain an advantage for himself and/or Mrs. Parkes, and whether the appellant acted knowingly and dishonestly in this regard. In the present case, the use would be improper if not for the purposes of the company. The provision of accommodation for Mrs. Parkes and the children would be an advantage for himself and/or Mrs. Parkes, at least unless this was for full consideration. The actions would be knowing and dishonest if the use was not for the purposes of the company and if it was not intended that full consideration be given by the appellant and/or Mrs. Parkes, and if the appellant appreciated these things. 
     
      
    61 Dealing with the first and second criticisms of the primary judge’s judgment, evidence of rent paid by the appellant and/or Mrs. Parkes could be relevant to these issues, if they could help combat inferences that the transactions were not for the purposes of the company, were intended to be an advantage to the appellant and/or Mrs. Parkes, and that the appellant appreciated these things.  
     
      
    62 Evidence relevant to the actual payment of “rent” by the appellant and/or Mrs. Parkes consisted of documents indicating the following: 
     
      
      1. $1,300.00 paid to Kremnizer & Co., Solicitors on 7 March 1997. 
       
      2. $240.00 paid to Kentwell & Taylor on 24 September 1997. 
       
      3. $2,047.50 paid to Smithers on 24 September 1997. 
       
      4. $1,253.33 paid to S. & L. Helprin on 24 September 1997. 
       
      5. Promises dated 2 December 1997 of payments for Smithers of $2,502.50 on 2 December 1997 and 5 December 1997, and $2,957.50 by 12 December 1997. 
       
      6. Promises dated 23 April 1998 of payments for S. & L. Helprin of $1,410.00 on 23 April 1998, for Smithers of $2,502.50 on 24 April 1998 and 1 May 1998, and Kentwell & Taylor of $293.33 on 24 September 1998. 
       
      7. Actual payment of the first two of those payments. 
       
      8. Payments of $1,410.00 to S. & L. Helprin and $2,502.50 to Smithers by 22 May 1998. 
       
      
    63 The only other document concerning rent was a Barrack document as at 30 June 1998 suggesting an expectation of rent at $400.00 per week in respect of the First Capital Trust; but there was no evidence that this rent was actually paid.  
     
      
    64 There was no document suggesting any money was actually paid by the appellant or Mrs. Parkes as rent to the mortgagor of the property. There was no evidence that anything was paid by them prior to 7 March 1997, after Schoeller had been placed into administration on 12 January 1997 and after the appellant ceased to have any role in the management of Schoeller. The evidence available suggested no more than payments to mortgagees of amounts not related to any rent figure, but rather to meet amounts owing to mortgagees, and to avoid loss of possession to mortgagees.  
     
      
    65 In those circumstances, in my opinion there was no material error by the primary judge in saying that there was no evidence of payment of rent, or in the primary judge reaching the view that the evidence of the appellant that he withheld rent was “off the top of his head”. The reasonable inference was that the money that was paid was paid after the appellant lost his connection with Schoeller, simply to meet the requirements of mortgagees, and thus was in no real sense rent. The evidence so regarded could not materially combat inferences that the transactions were not for the purposes of the company, were intended to be an advantage to the appellant and/or Mrs. Parkes, and that the appellant appreciated these things. 
     
      
    66 Turning to the third suggested error, evidence that Schoeller’s money or some of it was recovered could not directly combat the relevant inferences, but could possibly lend indirect support to defences seeking to combat these inferences. In fact, there was evidence that $40,000.00, representing the amounts in the first count and the two offences in the schedule, was repaid on or about 24 October 1996 from the second mortgage on the property.  
     
      
    67 However, this could not help combat the relevant inferences, because the payment was not made out of funds of the appellant or Mrs. Parkes but out of a mortgage on the property itself, increasing the amount owing on the property and thereby reducing the chance that there would ultimately be an equity in the property out of which Schoeller could recover the amount of about $145,000.00 referred to in the second count. Furthermore, the same evidence shows a further $9,000.00 of Schoeller’s money being paid out in respect of this second mortgage on 18 November 1996.  
     
      
    68 Accordingly, while the statement of the primary judge that moneys were not recovered was not strictly correct, this error was not material. 
     
      
    69 Turning to the fourth matter, evidence that the transactions were known to members of the Credit Committee and/or the Board could help combat relevant inferences, but only if the knowledge extended to relevant aspects of the transaction, including its commercial reality and the role of the appellant and Mrs. Parkes in it. Bare reference in Credit Committee or Board documents to the execution of the second mortgage or the withdrawal of caveat would be of the slightest relevance. In my opinion, there was no material error by the primary judge in saying there was no evidence that the Credit Committee or directors knew and approved of the transactions. 
     
      
    70 As regards the fifth matter, there was evidence that the true purchaser was a trust in which the Parkes family was not named as a beneficiary; but the named beneficiary was only a further trust, so this evidence did not take the matter much further. The appellant alleged this trust was associated with the ultimate owners of Schoeller; but if in fact the beneficiary was an owner of Schoeller, this would not contribute to the propriety of the transaction. A company cannot properly divest itself of property for the benefit of shareholders. In any event, there was no material error by the primary judge in circumstances where there was no evidence as to what persons were the ultimate beneficiaries. 
     
      
    71 As regards the sixth matter, the fact that the sum of about $145,000.00 was documented as a loan to Pantec, which had given security, could help combat the relevant inferences, if the purpose of Schoeller was suggested to be a commercial transaction with Pantec, and Pantec was suggested to be the beneficial owner of the property. However, the security in question was a general security given earlier, with no significant evidence of its value, and apparently already securing a debt of about $200,000.00. The apparent payment of $6,623.00 to Schoeller out of the second mortgage is of minimal relevance. Further, there was no suggestion that Pantec was intended to be the beneficial owner of the property, and no substantial explanation of why Pantec would have made available $145,000.00 lent to it for the purposes of the trust which was the purchasing party, apart from vague suggestions of connections between Pantec and the trust. The confusing relationships between the various entities if anything tended to support the inferences against the appellant. In my opinion, no error is shown by the absence of reference to these matters by the primary judge.  
     
      
    72 Finally, as regards the seventh and eighth matters, no doubt the appellant would have wished to have the opportunity to have access to all company documents held by himself and the liquidator and others, and to have legal advisers examine minutely all these documents and advise as to whether anything in all these documents might possibly assist in his defence; and he did not have this opportunity. However, to a large extent this was his own fault. He had many documents in his own possession, which he did not investigate: the appellant has told us that he probably has copies of many Board minutes and the like, which he has not been able to access since he has been in prison. However, he took no steps to this end between his committal and 25 May 2001.  
     
      
    73 I accept that Mr. Gelbert was probably in error in his assertion that he had a conference with the appellant about a week before 12 June 2001, having regard to his statement to Armitage DCJ. But having regard to all the circumstances of this case, I do not think the evidence suggests that the appellant did not have an adequate appreciation of the facts and the elements of the offences with which he was charged, nor does it suggest pressure such as to deprive the plea of its character as expressing genuine recognition of guilt. In my opinion, there was no error by the primary judge in finding that the appellant was advised by competent and experienced Counsel, and was not pressured into making this plea.  
     
      
    74 In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that material error has been shown in the judgment of Christie DCJ such as to justify appellate intervention. 
     
      
       
      SENTENCE APPEAL 
      
    75 The appellant seeks to appeal against his sentence on grounds that relate to denial of benefit from totality in sentencing principles (ground 9), and to hardship because of delay in having the appeal considered (ground 15).  
     
      
    76 In my opinion, the primary judge plainly had regard to principles of totality and sentencing, and in the result arrived at a total sentence that could not possibly be considered excessive. 
     
      
    77 The delay in having the appeal considered does not of course suggest any error by the primary judge. In my opinion, there is nothing in the circumstances of this delay that could possibly justify the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    78 I note that additional evidence was sought to be relied on initially by the appellant, and that the Crown also tendered some additional evidence. Ultimately, in circumstances that appear from the transcript of the hearing on 13 August 2004, the appellant did not read his evidence; and there was no occasion for reading the Crown evidence. In circumstances where no error was shown by the primary judge, so that this Court did not itself enter into the question whether leave to withdraw the plea should be granted or what the appropriate sentence was, the additional evidence would not in any event have been material.  
     
      
    79 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence refused. 
       
      
    80 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    81 SMART AJ: I agree with Hodgson JA.

      Thursday 11 November 2004 
       
       
       
      70076/03 REGINA v ABDUL RAZZAK HAMOUI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 2] - Application to exclude evidence under s138 Evidence Act 1995.  
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On the morning of Thursday 28 June 2001 the body of Julie Haklane was found. The officer in charge of the investigation was Detective Senior Constable Garth Hazell. Detective Hazell attended a briefing by Detective Inspector Henderson and other senior officers at Granville. The briefing provided information relating to the disappearance of Julie Haklane the previous Monday, and the interview with her boyfriend, Abdul Razzak Hamoui, the next day. 
     
      
    2 The police determined that they would apply for a Search Warrant of Mr Hamoui's home and a Detention Warrant (under Pt10A Crimes Act 1900) to further interview Mr Hamoui. 
     
      
    3 At 8.00 pm Mr Hamoui was brought by police vehicle to the Fairfield Police Station. In accordance with the requirements of Pt10A, he was given into the custody of the Custody Manager, Senior Constable Mammone. An explanatory memorandum concerning his rights under Pt10A was provided. A Custody Management Record was compiled (Exhibit 2 on the Voir Dire).  
     
      
    4 Detective Hazell delegated to Detective Hinds the task of seeking a Detention Warrant from an after hours Magistrate. Detective Hinds had also been at the morning briefing of Inspector Henderson. He had, in addition, spoken to Inspector Henderson, Detective Sergeant Jacobs, and Detective Senior Constable Dorrough, who had each become involved in aspects of the investigation. 
     
      
    5 Between 8.45 pm and 9.01 pm Detective Hinds completed the application for the Detention Warrant and the affidavit in support. Mr Hamoui was invited by Detective Hazell to nominate a support person. The invitation was extended, not for reasons of ethnicity or language difficulties, but because Detective Hazell wished to interview Mr Hamoui in respect of a serious matter. Although Mr Hamoui spoke good English, Detective Hazell believed it appropriate that he should have a support person if he wished. Mr Hamoui nominated his sister, Dania. Dania came to the police station. The Warrant was not granted, however, until 10.42 pm. Questioning in fact began at 11.45 pm. It was clear earlier in the evening that the interview may go past midnight. Mr Hamoui's sister said that she could not be present after midnight, since she was required to work. Mr Hamoui was asked to nominate an alternative support person. He nominated his cousin, Fawaz Hamawi. Arrangements were made for Mr Hamawi to come to the police station. He was present throughout the interview. 
     
      
    6 At the conclusion of the interview Mr Hamoui was asked to consent to a forensic procedure. He was given an explanation. He consented to that procedure. He signed the requisite form. A person authorised under the Forensic Procedure Act 2000 took a buccal swab for DNA purposes. 
     
      
    7 Counsel for the accused asserted that the application by Detective Hinds to the Magistrate was false in three respects which were material. It was not suggested that the falsity had come to the notice of Mr Hamoui, or influenced the answers he provided during the course of the interview. Nor was it suggested that the alleged falsity had influenced Mr Hamoui's consent to the forensic procedure. The falsity, nonetheless, was said to enliven the discretion under s138(1) of the Evidence Act to exclude evidence obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law. 
     
      
       
      The affidavit in respect of the Detention Warrant. 
       
      
    8 The affidavit prepared by Detective Senior Constable Hinds was in the format required. It identified the offence leading to Mr Hamoui's arrest as ""murder"". The evidence for his arrest was stated in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""3. The evidence on which the detained person was arrested is as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        SUSPECT IN THE SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND JULIE HAKLANE. LAST KNOWN PERSON TO CONTACT VICTIM PRIOR TO HER DISAPPEARANCE ON THE 25/6/01. THE SUSPECT HAS PREVIOUSLY ABDUCTED THE DECEASED IN JANUARY, 2001 AT GUNPOINT AND ASSAULTED HER TO WHICH HE WAS CHARGED AND THE MATTER IS BEFORE THE COURTS."" 
        
       
      
    9 That description was said to be false. As a consequence of Ms Haklane amending her statement, and withdrawing her allegations, the charges of abduction and malicious wounding were withdrawn. The only charges before the Courts related to the firearm and the prohibited weapons found at the home of the accused. This was the first matter said to be false. 
     
      
    10 The second matter related to the proposed forensic procedure. The affidavit of Detective Hinds included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""6. The grounds on which I have formed the belief that the investigation period should be extended beyond 4 hours are as follows: 
         
         
        SERIOUSNESS OF OFFENCE, TO CONDUCT ERISP INTERVIEW WITH THE SUSPECT. CONDUCT FORENSIC PROCEDURE. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The detained person has co-operated in the investigation to date as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        HAS AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN ERISP INTERVIEW. HAS AGREED TO FORENSIC PROCEDURE."" 
        
       
      
    11 There was no question that at the conclusion of the interview Mr Hamoui was asked to provide his consent to a forensic procedure and did so. However it was said to be false to assert that he had given his consent before the interview at 8.44 pm, when first taken into custody. 
     
      
    12 The third matter concerned the support person. The application for the warrant included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""13.  
        DANIA HAMOUI, SUPPORT PERSON  
        of detained person, of  
        BONNYRIGG,  
        aged 19 years is present as a support person. 
        
       
       
        
        14. The following precautions have been taken in respect of the detained person because of his vulnerability: 
        
       
       
        
        DANIA HAMOUI CONTACTED AND WILL BE PRESENT DURING INTERVIEW."" 
        
       
      
    13 Complaint is made that, once it became apparent that Ms Dania Hamoui could not remain after midnight, the Magistrate should have been told of the new arrangements, and yet was not told. 
     
      
    14 The third aspect may be dismissed at once. Mr Hamoui nominated a replacement suitable to him. That person was present. The application was accurate at the time it was submitted. It could neither be said to be improper nor a breach of the law not to inform the Magistrate of the new arrangement. This aspect could not possibly give rise to an issue under s138. 
     
      
       
      The alleged falsity of paragraph 3. 
       
      
    15 Detective Hinds said that he assumed that he had been provided with the information in paragraph 3 by some other officer, presumably the person in charge of the investigation (Detective Hazell). 
     
      
    16 Detective Hazell said he did not see the application for the warrant before it was submitted. He certainly spoke to Detective Hinds. Three years on, he could not recall his conversation. He would not agree that paragraph 3, as expressed, was grossly misleading. It was ambiguous. He said it would have been better had the charges been specified. He also said that he certainly would not have provided Detective Hinds with information knowing it to be false (T89). 
     
      
    17 I accept that paragraph 3 of the application gives the impression that the abduction charge was before the Court. Since the charge had been withdrawn, that paragraph was misleading. However, there is, in my view, no basis for suggesting, or even suspecting, that either Detective Hinds (to the Magistrate) or Detective Hazell (to Detective Hinds) knowingly provided information that was false or misleading. It was an offence to prove an Authorised Justice with information that a person knows to be false or misleading in a material particular (s356K(1) Crimes Act). 
     
      
    18 Here, the facts surrounding the abduction were not straightforward (cf R v Hamoui [No 1] (unreported, 11 November 2004). The charges, including abduction, were on foot for almost four months before they were withdrawn and dismissed. Serious firearms offences remained before the Court. The complete picture, including the withdrawal, was serious. Had it been presented to the Magistrate, it is unlikely to have made a difference to the duty he was required to perform. 
     
      
    19 However that may be, I do not believe, as a matter of probability, that the misleading nature of paragraph 3 involved either impropriety on the part of the police or a breach of the law. 
     
      
       
      The alleged falsity of paragraphs 6 and 7. 
       
      
    20 There is no question that Mr Hamoui formally provided his authority to the forensic procedure after the interview, signing the requisite form. The only issue is whether he informally did so before Detective Hinds completed the application for the warrant, or that Detective Hinds believed that he had done so. 
     
      
    21 Detective Hinds was asked to provide the basis for his assertion in the application for the warrant that Mr Hamoui ""has agreed to forensic procedure"". He said this: (T77) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. ... What was your source of information for that? 
         
        A. Well, he agreed to be interviewed at the time and I was informed he agreed to the forensic procedure, he was co-operating at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who informed you of that? 
         
        A. I couldn't remember, it was three and a half years ago. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well clearly it was someone who was speaking to the accused? 
         
        A. Yes. Had to have been. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Matter of commonsense because if he has agreed? 
         
        A. Sometimes the custody manager asks them, sometimes the officer in charge."" 
        
       
      
    22 Detective Hinds agreed that it would be unusual for the custody manager, who had specific responsibilities under the legislation, to provide that information. More likely, therefore, it came from the officer in charge, Detective Hazell, although it should be noted that Detective Hinds did speak to a number of senior police. Detective Hazell could not recall having a conversation with the accused in which he raised the need for a forensic procedure before the interview. His first recollection of the accused having consented was after the interview (T71). He could not remember what he said to Detective Hinds when he gave him the task of seeking the Detention Warrant. 
     
      
    23 I accept that Detective Hazell did not knowingly convey to Detective Hinds false information. The application recited the need for a further ERISP interview and a forensic procedure. It was not challenged that Mr Hamoui had informally consented to the ERISP interview. In the context of a murder investigation, that would ordinarily have been enough to obtain the warrant. There was no apparent motive for falsely asserting that, in addition, Mr Hamoui had consented to the forensic procedure. It was necessary to obtain the Detention Warrant with despatch. Obviously it was important that the application should be accurate. However, inevitably there were opportunities for miscommunication. Mr Hamoui had been taken into custody on the Tuesday and interviewed by police. He had been co-operative. When again taken into custody on the Thursday evening, he had again been co-operative. It would only need Detective Hazell to mention in the same breath that it was intended to obtain a buccal swab and that Mr Hamoui was co-operating, for the impression to have been created that the accused had already consented. But whether or not it happened in that way, I believe, as a matter of probability, that either Mr Hamoui informally consented to a forensic procedure (and Detective Hazell has since forgotten) or, more likely, there was some miscommunication as a result of which Detective Hinds had the impression that Mr Hamoui had consented. Accordingly, I believe that there was no impropriety or breach of the law. Again, there is no occasion to undertake the weighing process contemplated by s138. 
     
      
    24 The ERISP on 26 June 2001 and the evidence obtained in consequence of that forensic procedure should be admitted.

      70076/03 REGINA v ABDUL RAZZAK HAMOUI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 1] - Admissibility of relationship evidence. 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On Monday 25 June 2001, Ms Julie Haklane was reported missing. She was a diabetic. She required injections of insulin at least twice a day. She had been expected home at 5.30 pm. When she did not arrive, her parents became concerned. They contacted the police. 
     
      
    2 The following Thursday (28 June 2001) the body of Ms Haklane (the deceased) was found in her motor vehicle. The vehicle was parked in Eton Street, Fairfield. She had been strangled. It appeared that she had died on the day that she disappeared (Monday 28 June 2001).  
     
      
    3 Mr Abdul Razzak Hamoui has been charged with the murder of Julie Haklane. He has pleaded not guilty. On 18 October 2004, a week before the jury was empanelled, the matter was listed to deal with a number of preliminary issues. Some issues had been resolved by agreement. However, agreement could not be reached in respect of four issues: 
     
      
    · First, a general objection was taken to the admissibility of evidence concerning the relationship between the accused and Julie Haklane which the Crown proposed to lead. 
     
      
    · Secondly, a specific objection was taken to evidence concerning an episode on 23 January 2001. It was said that, as a matter of discretion, the evidence should be excluded (ss135,137 Evidence Act 1995). 
     
      
    · Thirdly, the body having been discovered, the accused was taken to Fairfield Police Station. An application was made to a Magistrate for a Detention Warrant under Pt10A of the Crimes Act 1900. The warrant was issued. The accused was thereafter interviewed and a buccal swab taken to enable DNA testing. It is said on behalf of the accused that there was impropriety or illegality on the part of the police in obtaining the warrant. The evidence should be excluded under s138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, the Crown identified one aspect of the deceased's account of the episode of 23 January 2001 (the subject of the second objection) which was said to correspond to the circumstances in which her body was found on 28 June 2001, such that the Crown could rely upon the coincidence rule (s98 Evidence Act). The accused denied the applicability of that rule. 
     
      
    4 On the morning of 25 October 2004, shortly before the jury was empanelled, I gave rulings in respect of each of these issues, namely: 
     
      
    · First, that as a generality, the relationship evidence was relevant and admissible as an aspect of the Crown's circumstantial case. It should not be excluded under s135 or s137, subject to counsel for the accused having the right to object to particular phrases or passages in the statements which had been served. Having foreshadowed that ruling, counsel agreed upon the exclusion of particular matters (under s137). Other aspects may arise and can be dealt with before a witness gives evidence. 
     
      
    · Secondly, the incident of 23 January 2001 should not, as a matter of discretion, be excluded under s137 (or s135). The statement made by the deceased on 24 January 2001 and the amendments made by her to that statement three days later should be admitted. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, there was neither impropriety nor illegality in the obtaining of the Detention Warrant. There is no occasion, therefore, for the exclusion of this evidence under s138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, the Crown should not be entitled to rely upon the coincidence rule. The fact that the seat was back both at the time of the alleged abduction (on 23 January 2001) and at the time of the murder is nonetheless relevant and admissible. 
     
      
    5 I now provide, in this judgment, my reasons for the rulings in respect of the first and second issues, the relationship evidence. I will, in separate judgments, deal with the remaining issues. 
     
      
       
      The relationship evidence. 
       
      
    6 Mr Hamoui was born on 20 April 1974. In June 2001 he was therefore 27 years old. Ms Julie Haklane was 24 years old (born 8 August 1976). Mr Hamoui Is a Muslim. Ms Haklane was a Christian. Ms Haklane described the accused as her ""first love"". They began their relationship approximately five years before her death.  
     
      
    7 The relationship began well enough. However, after several years they began to argue and fight. Threats were made by Mr Hamoui against Ms Haklane, including threats to kill. They repeatedly broke up, and then started seeing each other again. The deceased's sister, Ms Naha Erdem witnessed episodes of physical and verbal abuse. She saw bruising to the arms and legs of Julie Haklane which her sister attributed to the accused. He grabbed her arms, punched her and kicked her. He continually telephoned her, sometimes late at night, often at hours inconvenient to family members. He was very possessive. In front of members of the family he said this: 
     
      
       
       ""If I can't have you, no-one else can fucking have you."" 
       
      
    8 On other occasions Mr Hamoui was heard to say: 
     
      
       
       ""If you get another boyfriend, I'm fucking going to kill you."" 
       
      
    9 The deceased's mother and sister will also give evidence of the turmoil in Julie Haklane's relationship with the accused in the days immediately before her death. On Saturday 23 June 2001, Julie Haklane saw her sister Naha Erdem at the home of a friend. Julie was crying. She had a red mark on the base of her neck where she said Abdul Hamoui had grabbed her. She said that Mr Hamoui had followed her. To escape she had driven in search of her sister.  
     
      
    10 Having heard this complaint, Ms Erdem resolved to find Mr Hamoui. She went searching for him in her vehicle. She found him sitting in his car. She told him to stop stalking Julie. He responded by saying that they were sleeping together. Ms Erdem insisted that Julie had a new boyfriend, Ray (Bayeh). She was sleeping with him. Once she returned to the house, she recounted the conversation to Julie. Julie confirmed that she was ""with Ray now and didn't want anything else to do with Abdul"". 
     
      
    11 Apart from such evidence, the Crown seeks to prove four particular episodes of violence which Julie Haklane reported to the police. 
     
      
       
      The assault of July 1999. 
       
      
    12 On 3 July 1999 Julie Haklane attended the Merrylands Police Station. She spoke to Constable Cochran. Constable Cochran took a statement which she recorded in her police notebook. The statement was signed by Julie Haklane. Ms Haklane said that the first three years of her relationship with Mr Hamoui had been happy. He had treated her ""like a princess"". There had been no violence. On 28 June 1999, however, he ""went missing"". When Ms Haklane located him, he was behaving strangely. She tried to speak to him. He did not want her in his house. She reminded him of certain money he owed her. He thereupon grabbed her by the jumper and dragged her out of the house. She responded by kicking the side of his car. He retaliated by kicking her, using both feet. He is a competitive kick boxer. Ultimately his brother, Omar, asked him to stop, which he did. Ms Haklane then went to the Merrylands Medical Centre where she saw Dr Laughlin. She thereafter attended the Merrylands Police Station. She had severe bruising to her right thigh. Her statement to Constable Cochran concluded with these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At this stage, I would just like Abdul spoken to by the police. I don't want any charges laid."" 
        
       
      
    13 Constable Cochran spoke to Mr Hamoui. He said that he had kicked Julie Haklane once because she had damaged ""a lens"" on his vehicle. 
     
      
       
      Assault 6 January 2001 
       
      
    14 At 3.20 am on Saturday 6 January 2001, Constables Hansford and Sweeney attended Ms Haklane's home. Ms Haklane recounted an incident which Constable Hansford recorded in her notebook, which Ms Haklane signed. She said that ""four weeks ago Abdul and I split up"". On the evening of 4 January 2001 she drove to his home to return his belongings. He wanted to speak to her. She, however, did not wish to speak to him. He reached into the cabin of the vehicle and took her car keys. The statement described what happened thereafter in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He said, 'Julie, are you seeing anyone?' I said, 'It's none of your business.' He said, 'Can I go through your phone to see if you've rang any guys?' I said, 'No, it's none of your business, please give me my keys back.' My mobile phone rang and it was my mum and I told her what was happening."" 
        
       
      
    15 Ms Haklane said that her father was ""on his way"". Mr Hamoui returned her keys. Later, according to Mr Hamoui, Mr Haklane came to his home. Mr Haklane produced a handgun. He threatened to shoot Mr Hamoui if he did not leave Julie alone. 
     
      
    16 On 6 January 2001, half an hour after midnight, Mr Hamoui rang Julie. He said he was sorry for what had happened. She told him she did not wish to speak, and hung up. He rang back a number of times. Ultimately he spoke to her. He said he simply wanted to know who had shot his car. He drove past her home to show her the damage. Ms Haklane recorded in her statement to the police that she saw a bullet hole through the windscreen. According to Ms Haklane, Mr Hamoui said this: (para 7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Your family wants to get dirty and use guns. I'm going to go and get a gun now and I'm going to make sure there is blood shed tonight."" 
        
       
      
    17 Ms Haklane then resolved to ring the police. Whilst the police were taking a statement from Ms Haklane on 6 January, Mr Hamoui telephoned her a number of times. The police spoke to him. He described to the police the threat by Julie's father to shoot him, the production of the handgun, and the bullet hole. However, he declined to attend the police station. 
     
      
       
      The abduction on 23 January 2001 
       
      
    18 On 23 January 2001, Julie Haklane made a further statement to the police. She signed each page. She said that she had formed a new relationship and, as a consequence, ""Abdul was very upset"". She nonetheless wished to remain friends with Abdul. She still ""cared for him"". From time to time he made excuses to see her. 
     
      
    19 On Tuesday 23 January 2001, Mr Hamoui asked Mr Haklane to drive him to Merrylands Police Station. He wished to report an assault. They then went to Parramatta. When her phone rang he snatched it from her saying: ""I'll bet that's him."" He ran off. Ms Haklane said that she then found a public phone. She repeatedly rang Mr Hamoui's mobile phone. When she was unable to speak to him, she returned home. It was about 7.30 pm. 
     
      
    20 Mr Hamoui ultimately returned her calls at 9.00 pm. At first he refused to return the mobile phone. He then agreed to do so, suggesting that she pick it up outside his home. 
     
      
    21 Ms Haklane then drove to Mr Hamoui's home. He got in her car. According to the account she gave the police, he was very aggressive. He directed her to drive to Cabramatta to pick up the phone from a friend's place. During the course of the journey, he asked her to park the car. When she did so, he produced a gun, which he pointed at her. He said that if she tried to run or scream he would shoot her. They remained parked for the next hour. He would not let her go. Indeed he got more and more angry. He kept the gun against her face and head, threatening her. 
     
      
    22 Ms Haklane complained of feeling faint. She needed insulin. She asked to go home. On her account Mr Hamoui refused to allow her to go home. Instead, he said that he would drive. He directed her to put the passenger's seat back as far as possible. He told her that if she lifted her head he would shoot her. He drove with the gun on his lap. 
     
      
    23 Eventually Mr Hamoui stopped the vehicle. Ms Haklane was crying. He then said this: (para 17) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This is all because I love you, I can't live without you. I'd rather kill you and me before I let another man have you."" 
        
       
      
    24 Mr Hamoui demonstrated the gun was loaded. He then pointed the gun under his chin and said: (para 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I'm sorry to put you through this. I'm sorry, I'm going to kill myself."" 
        
       
      
    25 Ms Haklane then grabbed the barrel of the gun. There was a struggle. The gun hit the passenger side windscreen, causing it to crack. Ultimately Ms Haklane said she started to scream. She said to Mr Hamoui these words: (para 19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I can't take this more, either kill me or kill yourself because I can't take this any more."" 
        
       
      
    26 She claimed to be nearly unconscious. Mr Hamoui told her to calm down. He said he would let her go. He asked that she forgive him. He added that he was going to kill himself. He then got out of the vehicle. Ms Haklane then drove straight home. It was about 3.30 am. Her 16 year old brother Anthony was waiting for her return. She told him what had happened. Anthony remembered her words as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""Abdul put the gun to my head and hit me."" 
       
      
    27 She then drove with Anthony to the Merrylands Police Station. She saw Constable Hume at about 3.40 am. She briefly described what had happened in words consistent with the account she later gave. She repeated that account to Senior Constable Azzopardi. She said, however, that she needed to return home, to take insulin, and to return her young brother. The police drove her home and waited for her. She then returned to the Merrylands Police Station about 15 minutes later. She was accompanied by two male friends, one of whom was Mr Allen Yousif, her then boyfriend. According to Mr Yousif, she said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Abdul kidnapped me with a gun, I've had enough. I am gonna report it, he will kill me otherwise."" 
        
       
      
    28 Detective Senior Constable Danyluk saw Ms Haklane at about 4.30 am. She pointed to a graze to the side of her neck and swelling to her forehead. Her injuries were photographed. Detective Danyluk also saw the crack in the window caused by the rifle barrel. He took a detailed statement which Ms Haklane then signed. 
     
      
    29 At 2.25 pm the same day (24.01.01) Mr Hamoui was arrested. His room was searched. A shortened .22 calibre rifle with a silencer was found. It was loaded with a bullet in the chamber and 12 live rounds in the magazine. Mr Hamoui was charged, relevantly, with the following offences: 
     
      
    · Detain for advantage and cause injury to victim.· Maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do so.· Possess unauthorised firearm and prohibited firearm. 
     
      
    30 On 26 January 2001, Julie Haklane telephoned Detective Danyluk. She said that she had seen a counsellor. She had discussed her problems with Mr Hamoui. She also said that she had spoken to Mr Hamoui. She wished to amend her statement in a number of respects. 
     
      
    31 On Saturday 27 January 2001, Ms Haklane again attended the Merrylands Police Station. She was given a copy of her statement. She made handwritten amendments to a number of paragraphs. In substance, she withdrew the allegation that Mr Hamoui had threatened her. Rather, he had threatened to end his own life by shooting himself. Her purpose in going to the police was to help him. 
     
      
    32 On 14 February 2001, Ms Haklane again went to the Merrylands Police Station. She was told that her amended statement had been sent to the solicitor for the DPP. The advice of the DPP was awaited. Mr Hamoui then entered the foyer of the police station. He spoke to Detective Danyluk. Detective Danyluk repeated what he had just said to Ms Haklane. Detective Danyluk described Mr Hamoui's reaction in these words: (S'ment R Danyluk 20.11.01, para 21) 
     
      
       
        
        ""21. Hamoui did not appear satisfied with this response and stated in the presence of Haklane that Haklane had been coerced into making her statement to police on the 24 January 2001. This was immediately denied by Haklane. They then both left the Police Station."" 
        
       
      
    33 On 3 April 2001, Ms Swain, the solicitor for the DPP, saw Julie Haklane. She made a contemporaneous note of her conference (Exhibit 4 on the Voir Dire). The notes included criticisms by Ms Haklane of Detective Senior Constable Danyluk. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I want charges which relate to me to be withdrawn. Bob [Detective Danyluk] told me he needed info to get help for Abdul. I kept telling him I didn't want to make a statement. I was out of it and half asleep. He should make people read the statement before people sign it."" 
         
        (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    34 Ms Haklane also said that she did not feel well. She repeated that she had not been threatened by Mr Hamoui. Rather, he had threatened to end his own life. The notes of Ms Swain included these words, recording the words of Ms Haklane: 
     
      
       
        
        ""We had broken up. I was seeing another guy Alan. Alan put the gun in his mouth (he was crazy). 
        
       
       On and off with Abdul."" 
       
        
       
      
    35 Ms Haklane described to Ms Swain her feelings towards Mr Hamoui (as at 3 April 2001) in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Things have settled down a lot. Now Abdul is dealing with the gun issue - when he was threatened. Now his pride and manhood are returning. He felt stripped of that when he saw Allan take his fiancee (me) away from him. 
         
        Got engaged on 14/2/01 - got me a new ring. 
         
        Plan to marry after court is all over."" 
        
       
      
    36 On 10 May 2001, the DPP withdrew the charges of detain for advantage and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. It persisted with the firearms charges. 
     
      
       
      The assault on 16 June 2001. 
       
      
    37 The final incident relied upon by the Crown occurred on or about 16 June 2001. Ms Haklane's best friend, Ms Diana Lichaa, was at Ms Haklane's home. Mr Ray Bayeh was also there. He had become Ms Haklane's boyfriend in about May 2001. Ms Haklane and Ray sat opposite the window ""kissing and cuddling on the lounge"". As they were doing so, Julie Haklane's mobile phone rang. She left the room momentarily to answer it. When she returned she appeared worried. She said: ""Abdul's outside stalking the house."" She asked her friend to drive her to the rear of a church, where Ray would pick her up. Julie Haklane and Ms Lichaa walked to Ms Lichaa's vehicle. As Ms Lichaa was reversing the vehicle, Julie asked her to stop, so that she could telephone Abdul. Whilst the car was stationary, Abdul opened the back door and got into the back seat. He sat immediately behind Julie Haklane. Ms Lichaa's account of what then happened was in these terms: (para 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... he said, 'Give me a lift home.' Julie just looked at me and said, 'Okay Diana, we'll give him a lift home.' He said, 'Where are you going?' Julie said, 'I'm going to go pick my sister up from the Albion.' Abdul then started saying 'Who was that guy that you were kissing in your house.' Julie said, 'There was no guy.' Then Abdul described what Ray was wearing and where we were all sitting in the lounge room ... Julie tried to tell him he was just a family friend. Abdul started calling her names like, 'Slut, you're going slutting around again, you whore.' As I was driving Abdul reached around across the centre console and hit Julie on the face. I think he used his right hand and it was closed, like a fist. Julie was trying to push him away and he scratched her on the right cheek. ... I was very scared and pulled the car over and grabbed Abdul's right arm ... "" 
        
       
      
    38 In the course of the struggle, the plastic centre console broke into a number of pieces. Abdul then got out of the vehicle. He took with him Julie Haklane's mobile phone. Ms Haklane removed a ring from one of her fingers, which she then threw from the car window. 
     
      
    39 The next day, Sunday 17 June 2001, Ms Haklane and Ms Lichaa went to the Merrylands Police Station. Ms Haklane described what had happened. The police officer made a note in his notebook. Ms Haklane said, however, that she did not want the complaint ""put on the computer"". 
     
      
       
      Text messages before disappearance. 
       
      
    40 According to the Crown, Julie Haklane was due home on Monday 25 June 2001 at about 5.30 pm, when she would take her insulin. Mr Hamoui was required to report to the Merrylands Police Station on the firearms charges. He did so at 5.10 pm. The Crown asserts that mobile phone records and other material suggest that Julie Haklane met the accused either shortly before, or shortly after, he reported for bail. She was later murdered. 
     
      
    41 Communications between the deceased and the accused in the days before her disappearance, and especially on the day of her disappearance, are obviously important. A number of text messages were sent by Julie Haklane to the mobile phone of the accused in the 24 hours before she was reported missing on Monday evening, 25 June 2001. The police interviewed Mr Hamoui in the early hours of Tuesday 26 June 2001. The interview was recorded on video. In the course of the interview the police asked Mr Hamoui to call up text messages that had been preserved on his mobile phone, received from Ms Haklane. Mr Hamoui did so. The messages in some cases were affectionate. They included the following message from Ms Haklane to the accused sent on 24 June 2001 at 2.13.46 am: (ERISP 26.06.01 Q86) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There are three things I need in this world, the sun, the moon and you, the sun for the light, the moon for the night and you forever to hold me tight. XXX""  
        
       
      
    42 A further message on her work mobile sent at 10.23.15 pm on Sunday 24 June 2001 (less than 24 hours before her disappearance) was as follows: (ERISP Q90/91) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Hey, Abs, I asked M angel to watch over you, but he came back sooner than expected, I asked why he smiled and said, 'an angel doesn't need to watch over another angel'."" 
        
       
      
    43 When interviewed by the police, Mr Hamoui described Ms Haklane as his girlfriend. He denied knowledge of Julie Haklane's other relationships, including with Mr Ray Bayeh. He believed Mr Bayeh was simply a friend. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on admissibility. 
       
      
    44 Mr Ierace SC, on behalf of the accused, objects to all of the proposed relationship evidence, and alternatively to evidence concerning the abduction on 23 January 2001. In support of the general objection, counsel drew attention to the statement of principle of Howie J in R v Toki (2000) 116 A Crim R 536 where his Honour said this: (at 540) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The evidence is admitted not simply because it describes the relationship of the parties, but because statements or acts of the parties occurring within the relationship are relevant to the issues before the jury."" 
        
       
      
    45 Evidence of the relationship must be relevant to the facts in issue. According to the accused, the Crown had not identified any specific question which the relationship evidence might reasonably and logically elucidate. Yet it was highly prejudicial. The jury may regard it as demonstrating a propensity on the part of the accused to resort to violence. 
     
      
    46 Alternatively, in the context of significant evidence concerning the relationship between Ms Haklane and the accused, as proposed by the Crown, the incident on 23 January should be excluded under s137 of the Evidence Act. It was, according to the appellant, unfairly prejudicial for a number of reasons.  
     
      
    47 First, the incident involved the same car as the car in which the body of the deceased was found five months later. The jury would find it difficult to put that aspect to one side. Yet, there would be no evidence that the deceased met her death in the car. The evidence to be presented by the Crown would be consistent with her having been murdered elsewhere and then placed in the car. There would be no direct evidence as to who was responsible for her murder, or even that it was the work of one perpetrator. 
     
      
    48 Secondly, one could not ignore what happened after Ms Haklane's initial complaint. She had then altered her statement within three days. She withdrew the allegations against Mr Hamoui. Instead, she made allegations of impropriety against the police in the taking of the statement. She cannot now be cross examined. It would be impossible for the jury to satisfactorily resolve these issues. If the issue were opened up, a number of witnesses would need to be called. Inevitably it would give rise to a ""trial within a trial"". It would be a distraction from the real issues. 
     
      
    49 The Crown responded that under the ordinary rules the evidence was admissible. It was highly probative. It could not be regarded as unfairly prejudicial. The Crown drew attention to R v Clark (2001) 123 A Crim R 506 where Heydon JA, after an extensive review of the authorities, identified the differing ways in which relationship evidence may be relevant. First, such evidence provided a realistic context within which the Crown case against the accused could be considered. Heydon JA said this: (at 575) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... to exclude all evidence of tension and violence but leave in only evidence of cordiality would be misleading. The evidence was relevant because it prevented the issues from being considered in a 'vacuum' ( 
        Wilson  
        (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 344, per Menzies J). It avoided the jury having 'quite an artificial picture':  
        Peake 
         (1996) 67 SASR 297 at 300, per Millhouse J (Williams J concurring). It enabled presentation of the case 'in an intelligible and real fashion':  
        Garner 
         (1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 120 at 123, per Sugerman J. The evidence was 'the key to an assessment of the relationship between the [accused] and the [victim] and, as such, constituted part of the essential background against which the ... [accused's] evidence ... necessarily fell to be evaluated':  
        B 
         at 60."" 
        
       
      
    50 Secondly, relationship evidence is ordinarily relevant to a determination of whether the accused had killed the deceased and done so with the appropriate intent. Heydon JA said this: (at 575) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... It was material to consider whether the past dealing and mutual attitudes of the parties were such as to create a reasonable doubt in the appellant's favour or whether they were such as to increase the probability that a killing resulted. 
        
       
       
        
        The relationship was capable of casting light on whether the appellant killed the deceased, and, if he killed the deceased, what his mental state was:  
        Hissey 
         (1973) 6 SASR 280 at 289. The existence of a bad relationship increased the chance of a relaxation of normal inhibitions against killing. It thereby offered a potential explanation for any criminal conduct by the appellant. It established 'an atmosphere which would render it less unlikely that the offence charged would have been committed in the circumstances which arose on the occasion of [the accused's drive with the victim], having regard to the past relationship of the principals':  
        Garner 
         at 129 per Maguire J."" 
        
       
      
    51 His Honour added: (at 575/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Even though the relationship evidence was not tendered as going directly to motive, an evaluation of the motive issue and an evaluation of the probabilities in relation to whether the appellant killed the deceased, after a sudden quarrel or otherwise, would be carried out less realistically if there were an exclusion of all evidence of the bad terms existing between the appellant and the deceased. Evidence of a hostile relationship would enable the jury to draw adverse inferences from the circumstantial evidence pointing to the appellant's guilt; evidence of a good relationship, foreshadowed by the appellant in his records of interview and actually given in the witness box, would cause them to hesitate in doing so."" 
        
       
      
    52 Thirdly, the evidence was also relevant because it could be predicted that the accused would rely upon evidence that his relationship with the deceased had been good (Garner (1963) 81 WN (Pt1) (NSW) 120, per Sugerman J at 123; Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 251). His Honour added: (at 576) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The evidence against the appellant was, apart from his confession to Mr Brown, entirely circumstantial: he made no direct admissions to the police and there was no direct witness of the crime 
        . Where a case is entirely circumstantial, it is common for relationship to be considered as one of the circumstances 
        ."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    53 According to the Crown, each of the purposes identified by Heydon JA had application to this case. There was some material which, arguably, should be excluded under s137. That material had been discussed by counsel. Excisions had been made. What remained, according to the Crown, could not be regarded as unfairly prejudicial. It should be admitted. 
     
      
       
      Evidence relevant and probative. 
       
      
    54 I accept the Crown's submissions. The evidence concerning the relationship between the accused and the deceased (including evidence relating to the incident on 23 January 2001) is relevant in each of the three ways identified by Heydon JA in Clark.  
     
      
    55 First, the evidence provides a realistic context within which the Jury may examine the material said to implicate the accused. In Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334, Menzies J said this: (at 344) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Any jury called upon to decide whether they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant killed his wife would require to know what was the relationship between the deceased and the accused. Were they an ordinary married couple with a good relationship despite differences and disagreements, or was their relationship one of enmity and distrust? It seems to me that nothing spoke more eloquently of the bitter relationship between them than that the wife, in the course of a quarrel, should charge her husband with the desire to kill her."" 
        
       
      
    56 In The Queen v Hissey (1973) 6 SASR 280, the Court (Bray CJ, Hogarth and Mitchell JJ) said this: (at 288/289) 
     
      
       
        
        ""We think that it was relevant and indeed important for the jury to know the general terms upon which the parties were living. If evidence of this nature were to be excluded as being technically inadmissible, then equally it would be technically inadmissible for evidence to be tendered to the jury which might be favourable to an accused person, for example of a man having lived with his wife on terms of affection and harmony over a long period of years; and we think that such evidence would clearly be relevant and indeed important. When evidence of this kind is admissible it is admissible not only to prove the intent of the accused, but also the fact of the crime:  
        R v Ball  
        [1911] AC 47, per Lord Atkinson at p68;  
        Wilson v The Queen 
         (1970) 123 CLR 334, per Barwick CJ at p339."" 
        
       
      
    57 Secondly, the concluding words in Hissey, in the passage above, emphasise the relevance of such evidence (especially in the context of a circumstantial case) to the issue of whether the accused committed the crime and did so with the appropriate intent. It is material from which inferences may logically and reasonably be drawn concerning those issues (Wilson v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 339; R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 102, per Dunford J, paras 21 and 22). It is evidence, to use McHugh J's words in Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 630, which ""tends to prove how or why the conduct, the subject of the charge, arose, or because it makes it more probable than not the conduct occurred at the time or place or in the way alleged."" 
     
      
    58 Thirdly, the evidence in the Crown case will include assertions by the accused, when interviewed, that he had a good relationship with the deceased. They were girlfriend and boyfriend and loved each other. It will include a series of text messages from the deceased to the mobile phone of the accused shortly before she died (supra paras 41, 42). The messages are affectionate. That material is part of the picture, and an important part. But the Crown is entitled, in my view, to complete the picture. The complete picture, on the Crown case, was of an obsessive relationship (on the part of both the accused and the deceased) in which, in various situations, the accused repeatedly displayed intense emotion concerning the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Discretion. 
       
      
    59 In the course of argument, matters were identified relevant to the discretion under s137 (and s135). Episodes in a relationship which are remote in time may have less weight (R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510, per Hunt CJ at CL at 521-522). There also needs to be some balance, so that the relationship evidence does not swamp the Crown case (R v Bradley (1989) 41 A Crim R 297 at 302). It is unnecessary that every argument between the deceased and the accused should be the subject of evidence. Statements by the accused may well be relevant to his state of mind and whether he intended to kill the deceased. Statements by the deceased, on the other hand, will only be relevant where her state of mind is a relevant issue (The Queen v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208, per Gleeson CJ). 
     
      
    60 Mindful of these limitations, the Crown said that it would limit the relationship evidence in the manner set out above. Evidence concerning prohibited weapons found by the police at Mr Hamoui's home on 24 January 2001 were not relevant to the episode the day before. There would be no reference to them. The rifle which was found (which was consistent with the description given by Ms Haklane) would be referred to as a ""rifle"", rather than as a ""sawn off rifle"". There will be no reference to the silencer which was fitted to that rifle. 
     
      
    61 In my view, as a generality, the relationship evidence has significant probative value. The statements by the deceased are, of course, hearsay, admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Ms Haklane is not available for cross examination. Nonetheless, again as a generality, such dangers as there may be of unfair prejudice (through resort to tendency reasoning) will be dealt with by an appropriate direction. In that context the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. 
     
      
       
      The episode of 23 January 2001. 
       
      
    62 The probative value of Ms Haklane's account of the supposed abduction on 23 January 2001 must be assessed in the light of her retraction of a number of the more significant allegations. The resolution of that issue is ultimately not dependant only upon Ms Haklane. She told her younger brother Anthony, shortly before she attended the police station, that ""Abdul put a gun to her head and hit her"". Once she arrived at the station, she gave an abbreviated account to Constable Hume, and then to Senior Constable Azzopardi. What she said, in substance, was the same as the more elaborate account in the statement taken by Detective Danyluk, which she signed. She repeated the same allegation that night to her boyfriend Allen Yousif. 
     
      
    63 It will be a matter for the jury to reach a view as to where the truth lies and why she provided differing accounts. She cannot, of course, be cross examined by the accused. The jury, nonetheless, will have her explanation (which is favourable to the accused) provided to the solicitor for the DPP, Ms Vivien Swain. 
     
      
    64 I regard the evidence as having significant probative value, whatever version represents the truth. The amended statement reveals the state of mind of the accused and the depth of his feelings for the deceased. On her amended version, he was about to take his own life because of his love for her and the presence in her life of someone else. Subject to s137, both statements should be admitted. It was said that Ms Haklane was sleep deprived and unwell. However, she had been given insulin not long before she saw Detective Danyluk. The statement is a coherent and logical account of the events which she claimed to be describing. Detective Danyluk said that she was given coffee. He said she was emotional but anxious to press ahead with the statement. She appeared able to do so. As a matter of probability (s142), I accept that account. 
     
      
    65 Should the evidence be excluded because the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (s137), or for any of the reasons set out in s135? If admitted, the jury would be told that Mr Hamoui had a gun. They would also be told that he was charged with a number of offences as a result of Ms Haklane's complaint. They would learn that once Ms Haklane had provided her amended statement, certain charges were withdrawn, although the firearms charges remained. It is relevant to unfair prejudice that the deceased did not meet her death by a firearm. She was strangled. 
     
      
    66 The fact that the episode will reveal criminal conduct does not automatically lead to its exclusion, as shown by Harriman v The Queen (supra), per McHugh J at 630. Here the jury will be warned against propensity reasoning. The fact that the deceased's car was involved in both the episode of 23 January 2001 and the circumstances of her death (on 25 June 2001), does not, in my view, create unfair prejudice. It is an aspect of each episode, just as a bedroom or a particular part of a house may be an aspect in another case. Both episodes were very different, one involving a rifle, and the other culminating in strangulation. The fact that the car was involved in both will not give the episode more weight than it deserves, nor is it likely to inflame the jury, nor divert them from their task (see McHugh J in Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at para 51). 
     
      
    67 The admission of evidence concerning the incident on 23 January 2001 will, no doubt, create the need for a number of witnesses who either saw Ms Haklane immediately after, or who dealt with her once she changed her mind. However, that is not unusual. It will simply become one of the issues in the trial. 
     
      
    68 In my view the probative value of the proposed evidence significantly outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. The evidence should be admitted.

     REGINA v Reggi Robert ROWLEY 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 NEWMAN AJ: Following the determination by a collegiate bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the jurisdictional questions arising from the appellant’s challenge to the sentences passed by his Honour Judge Milson in the Drug Court, it now falls to me to determine such part of the appellant’s challenge as falls within s 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
     
      
    2 In its judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal adopted the Crown’s submission that matters, which were the subject of a final sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Act, should be described as category one offences for the purpose of the appeal. It is those matters which I, sitting as a single judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5AF, have to determine.  
     
      
    3 Matters with which I am now dealing are dealt with by the Drug Court, pursuant to a scheme of sentencing set up by the Drug Court Act. In relation to these offences the appellant first came before his Honour Judge Milson pursuant to s 7 of the Drug Court Act. That section applies to the conviction and sentencing of a person who has pleaded guilty and has been assessed as suitable to enter a program under that Act. Applying that section, his Honour imposed an initial sentence and suspended execution of that sentence for the duration of the program. Section 11 of that Act provides for the termination of the offender’s program either because it has been successfully completed or because the Drug Court is satisfied there is no useful purpose to be served by the offender’s further participation in it. The Court then determines a final sentence in accordance with s 12 of the Act.  
     
      
    4 Pursuant to s7 of the Drug Court Act, the appellant appeared for sentence before his Honour Judge Milson in relation to two offences on indictment, three offences on a Form 1 and a summary offence of goods in custody.  
     
      
    5 When the matter was initially before his Honour on 29 October 2002 the appellant pleaded guilty to all matters on the indictment, asking that in relation to the second count on the indictment his Honour take into account three matters on the Form 1. Initially, as I have mentioned, his Honour also dealt on that occasion with a summary matter, namely, goods in custody of a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    6 I turn then to the matters on the indictment. The first count involved the commission of the crime of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to the provisions of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. That section stipulates a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment for the crime. 
     
      
    7 The second count on the indictment was one of break, enter and steal contrary to the provisions of s 112(1) of the Crimes Act. That section imposes a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    8 The matters on the Form 1 related to the second count on the indictment. They involved, firstly, the offence of possessing a prohibited drug contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and two matters of goods in custody contrary to the provisions of s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The matter of goods in custody which constituted the summary matter carried a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment or ten penalty units, or both, under s 527C(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    9 I turn then to the facts relating to the various matters on which sentences were passed. First, the count of aggravated break, enter and steal. 
     
      
    10 On the night of 23 June 1998 a female was at home, at her parent’s premises, with her boyfriend. They retired to bed at about 11pm on that evening. The next morning the boyfriend could not find his wallet or car keys. A Panasonic compact disc player belonging to the female, some items of jewellery and a Riccho camera, valued at $1,500 were missing. The garage window had been forced, resulting in damage to its window lock. Fingerprints matching those of the appellant were found on the garage window. No property was recovered and compensation in the sum of $1,500 was sought. 
     
      
    11 The second count on the indictment, involving the offence of break, enter and steal occurred at a house which was unoccupied between 13 and 20 August 2002. When the occupants returned they found a bathroom window had been forced and various items had been stolen. They included an electric router and planer, $600 cash and a number of pieces of gold jewellery. The stolen items had an estimated value of $6,000. Again, fingerprints were found by police which matched those of the appellant.  
     
      
    12 The facts relating to the three matters on the Form 1 were as follows. On 22 August 2002 the appellant was observed by police to be in an unregistered car. When the police approached the car they found an unused syringe lying on the passenger’s side of the vehicle. When the appellant was searched two bags of cannabis were found in his right hand pocket. The police also found a stolen mobile phone and a library card in the name of a female which had been in her wallet which was stolen on 30 July 2002.  
     
      
    13 The summary matter of goods in custody involved a stolen BMW roadster convertible which police found under a tarpaulin in premises at 41 Caloolah Avenue, Kingswood Park. The car had been reported stolen on 20 February 2002. At the time when the car was stolen its owner’s house had been broken into and the car keys were stolen along with other property. The car’s key ring, with the car keys, were found inside the appellant’s house.  
     
      
    14 In relation to these offences his Honour imposed the following initial sentences :- as to count 1, the crime of aggravated break, enter and steal, he imposed a term of imprisonment of 1 year and 6 months. He also made an order for compensation in the sum of $1,500.  
     
      
    15 In relation to count 2, the matter of break, enter and steal, having taken into account the three matters on the Form 1 to which I have referred, his Honour imposed the sentence of 1 year and 9 months. As to the summary matter of goods in custody his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 months. Then, pursuant to s 7(3) of the Drug Court Act, his Honour suspended these “initial sentences” for the duration of the appellant’s Drug Court Program.  
     
      
    16 The appellant remained on the Drug Court Program until 7 May 2003. It was terminated pursuant to s11 of the Drug Court Act on that date. The appellant was then taken into custody on 19 May 2003. 
     
      
    17 He then re-appeared before Judge Milson on 23 January 2003 who then imposed final sentences pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Court Act.  
     
      
    18 In relation to the count of aggravated break, enter and steal he imposed the self-same sentence as he had imposed initially. The sentence of 1 year and 6 months was to date from 19 May 2003 and expire on 18 November 2004, together with an order for compensation for $1,500.  
     
      
    19 Again he imposed a self-same sentence in relation to the count of break, enter and steal, having taken into account the three matters on the Form 1. This time the term of imprisonment of 1 year and 9 months was to date from 19 May 2003 and expire on 18 February 2005. In relation to the summary matter of goods in custody the term of imprisonment was set to date from 19 May 2003, expiring on 18 November of that year.  
     
      
    20 When imposing the initial sentences on 29 October 2002 his Honour stated that, having taken into account the facts to which I have referred, he also took into account the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty in relation to each of the offences. He took into account the fact that the charge of aggravated break, enter and steal was only recently charged prior to the matter coming before his Honour. The offence, of course, had taken place in June of 1998. His Honour rightly took into account the appellant’s long criminal history. His Honour stated that he did not take into account any of those “subjective features which may well exist that would suggest that something other than full-time imprisonment with usual parole and non parole is the appropriate penalty for these offences”. His Honour did so because the sentences he imposed were suspended and if the appellant had successfully completed the Drug Court Program, lesser sentences could have been imposed on final sentencing. 
     
      
    21 The first ground of appeal pressed was that his Honour failed to give adequate weight to the appellant’s pleas of guilty and contrition. It was argued that his Honour gave little weight to the plea and specifically, that he failed to quantify the utilitarian value. Reliance was placed upon what had fallen from Spigelman CJ in R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, particularly paragraphs 52 and 53 where the Chief Justice said :-  
     
      
       
        
        “The absence of any reference to actual consideration of the guilty plea in the course of sentencing should as a general rule in the light of the obligation of sentencing judges to give reasons for their decision, lead to an inference that the plea was not given weight. This conclusion is significantly influenced by the express statutory obligations.” and  
         
        “It may not have been entirely clear prior to this judgment that the absence of reference to consideration of a guilty plea in the sentencing process would generally be regarded on appeal as an indication that a relevant consideration had not been given weight. In the course of formulating this guideline, the Court has been asked to determine that such should be regarded as the case in the future. This is designed to overcome the problem that the evidence and submissions before this Court in these proceedings have identified, namely the extent to which practitioners do not accept that a guilty plea, particularly an early plea, is in fact taken into account by sentencing judges.  
         
        As part of the process of overcoming this perception, the Court should, in my opinion, adopt the approaches generally applicable to decisions on sentencing for State Offences delivered after a reasonable period allowed for the handing down of this judgment”  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    22 However Spigelman CJ explained the effect of the above passage in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at paragraphs 82 and 83. He said :-  
     
      
       
      82 In  
      Thompson & Houlton 
       this court encouraged sentencing judges to quantify the utilitarian value of the discount given for the plea, in order to serve the broader interests of the administration of criminal justice discussed in that case:  
       
       
      “Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so.” 
       (At [160] – see also at [113]) 
       
       
       
      83 His Honour’s failure to quantify the discount does not constitute an error. There is no reason to believe that his Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the plea. The sentences imposed are, in my opinion, entirely appropriate.  
       
      
    23 It was also put that his Honour gave little weight to the contrition and co-operation of the appellant. It was put that the implicit contrition expressed in his pleas of guilty did not appear to have been acknowledged by way of reduction in the sentence passed. As it was pointed out by Spigelman CJ in Simpson’s case the fact that the sentencing Judge did not quantify the amount of the discount he had given in relation to the plea of guilty does not constitute an error. His Honour stated plainly, when initially sentencing, that he had taken into account the appellant’s plea of guilty. In my view the sentence imposed of 1 year and 6 months is at the very bottom end of the range of sentencing options available to his Honour. In my view his Honour certainly had given the appellant a very substantial reduction from the sentence which he would otherwise have been entitled to pass in relation to this crime. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the appellant’s submission must fail. 
     
      
    24 It was also put that the learned sentencing Judge failed to give adequate consideration to the offender’s subjective circumstances. In determining the final sentence his Honour did advert to the offender’s subjective circumstances and the manner in which he had approached the program set by the Drug Court. However, in relation to the sentences passed by his Honour in relation to all the matters falling within Category 1, I repeat what I said in relation to the count aggravated break, enter and steal. The sentences imposed by his Honour are in my view at the very bottom of the range. In sentencing as he did, in my view his Honour must have taken fully into account any favourable subjective circumstances (and on my reading of the matter there seem to be very little) in determining an appropriate sentence. While his Honour did not reduce his initial sentence when finally sentencing the appellant I do not accept that he fell into error by so doing. As I have said, the initial sentences were at the bottom of the available range. While it was submitted that some reduction ought to have been made for the appellant’s participation in the rehabilitation program, the fact is that he failed to complete it. In other words, the appellant failed to grasp the opportunity presented to him. His default should not result in him receiving even greater leniency from the Court than that already given. In my opinion the appellant has failed to make out any of the grounds of appeal and accordingly his appeal must be dismissed.

     Judgment 
      
      
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The Court in an earlier judgment has dealt with the jurisdictional issues raised in this matter. As a result Newman AJ has, pursuant to s 5AF of the Court of Criminal Appeal Act 1912, determined the matters which have come before the Court pursuant to s 5AF of that Act. 
     
      
    2 It is now for the Court of Criminal Appeal sitting as a collegiate bench to determine the matter which it has determined comes before it pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That matter involves the applicant’s application to appeal against the part of his Honour Judge Milson’s sentence involving the crime of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to the provisions of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. That section of the Crimes Act stipulates a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment for the crime. In the event, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years and three months to date from 19 May 2003 and expire on 18 August 2005. That sentence involved concurrence with the sentence imposed for a similar crime in relation to the matters which fell within the concept of Category 1 crimes committed by the applicant.  
     
      
    3 The facts of the matter are in small compass. On 5 August 2002 at about 9.30 pm the victim of the crime retired to bed after checking that all the windows and doors of the subject premises were secured. On awakening the next day the victim found that the rear door had been opened and that property was missing. The missing property involved a Bank of Queensland access card, one black canvass bag containing a black leather wallet, a set of house and car keys with a lighter, a New South Wales driving licence, one pair of sunglasses, a Westpac Visa card and ready card, one Nokia telephone and $20 in cash. None of the saleable items were recovered and the victim claimed compensation in the sum of $3,063. It should also be noted that one of the bankcards which the applicant stole was used to obtain $1,000 which was the subject of the summary charge which was dealt with by his Honour at the same time as the offence with which this Court is dealing. As this Court found in its earlier judgment, the summary charge is not a matter which can be brought before this Court on appeal.  
     
      
    4 As was the case in the matter dealt with by Newman AJ pursuant to s 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act, it was contended on the applicant’s behalf that his Honour failed to give proper weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty. It was also contended that his Honour should have set a non-parole period rather than fixing a single term.  
     
      
    5 It is relevant to observe that his Honour, by ordering that the sentence for the matter now before the Court be served concurrently with the matter dealt with under Category 1, paid due regard to the principle of totality when sentencing.  
     
      
    6 In relation to the matters falling under Category 1 (as is explained in the earlier judgment) Newman AJ held that, for his Honour to impose any lesser sentence for the crimes committed by the applicant which fell within that category, would be to impose a penalty which was less than the minimum which should have been imposed. This matter, as did the matter dealt with by Newman AJ under s 5AF, involved similar considerations to those dealt with by this Court in R v Ebsworth [2002] NSWCCA 465 where Wood CJ at CL (with whom Bell and Dowd JJ agreed) said :-  
     
      
       
      “[15] In view of the various matters identified, and his Honour’s findings that the applicant had a genuine desire to rehabilitate himself, yet lacked “ 
      the personal resources to do so 
      ”, having “ 
      only recently 
        
      gained security 
        
      and stability in the form of a family 
      ”, the case was one where, in accordance with the principles considered in  
      R v Simpson 
       [2001] NSWCCA 534, it admittedly was open for a finding of special circumstances to be made. However, it was a matter within discretion. As was pointed out in  
      R v Bertoncello 
       NSWCCA 5 November 1997:  
      “Establishing facts which, in isolation or in aggregate, have the character of special circumstances, does not render mandatory the variation of the 
        
      statutory ratio.” 
        
       
      [16] That observation was made at a time when there was a line of authority, now qualified by more recent decisions, to the effect that it was the need for, or the desirability of, the offender being the subject of an extended period of conditional release upon supervision which was the trigger for such a finding. While a wider range of considerations may now be taken into account, it still remains the case that the sentence must be one which ensures that the time that the offender actually spends in prison reflects all of the circumstances of the offence, including its objective gravity and any need for deterrence: See  
      R v Simpson 
       at para 65.[17] In order for the Court to intervene it must be satisfied that a lesser sentence, in one or other of its components, was warranted in law or should have been imposed: s6 (3)  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
        
      and see  
      R v Simpson 
       at paras 79 to 80 and para 100, and  
      R v Cook 
       [2002] NSWCCA 140 at para 20.” 
       
      
    7 It was also contended on behalf of the applicant that his Honour failed to give due weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. As Newman AJ held in the s 5AF matters, the applicant’s subjective circumstances were of very little assistance to him in terms of mitigation. Again, having regard to the prisoner’s antecedents and the nature of the crime, this Court, like Newman AJ in his matters, is of the view that the sentence imposed by his Honour was in fact at the bottom of the range of appropriate sentences for this matter. In short this Court is not satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been imposed. Accordingly this Court should not intervene.  
     
      
    8 Because the matter is of some importance the Court believes that leave should be granted but the appeal refused. Accordingly the Court orders as follows :- 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner has pleaded guilty on arraignment to the murder of his wife, Nadejda Zassoukhina on 29 November 2002.  
     
      
    2 It appears that following the death of his first wife from cancer in 1987, the prisoner met and befriended the deceased, who was a young Russian woman in this country on a student visa. They went out socially a few times and had sexual intercourse once before the deceased moved in with the prisoner to his house at Mount Druitt on 8 August 2002. Subsequently, she told him that her visa was due to expire and she suggested they marry so that she could obtain permanent residency and ultimately become an Australian citizen, the suggestion being that they would live together as husband and wife for two years to satisfy the Immigration Department. That such was her intention is confirmed by statements contained in the Brief of Evidence made by the deceased to her friend, Min Yuan, to Lucy Ivacheff, the welfare officer at the Russian Ethnic Community Centre, and to Constable Allen on 24 October 2002 and by the prisoner to Chief Inspector Ross on 26 October 2002. 
     
      
    3 They were married on 23 September 2002 in the presence of the prisoner’s sister and brother-in-law, but his own children were not told of the marriage because he knew they would not approve. He was at the time 64 years old and the deceased was 22 years old. I note that the deceased complained to Ms Ivacheff about the prisoner on 10 and 16 September, prior to their wedding. 
     
      
    4 According to the prisoner (and the deceased is not here to tell her side of the story), after the wedding everything changed, sexual intercourse ceased and they occupied separate bedrooms. She became very demanding as to her domestic requirements, forced him to drive her to and from her place of employment and accused him of stealing her papers. He in turn accused her of stealing his mail and removing other items from his bedroom. She said she needed to be able show that she had the resources to finance her proposed university studies so the prisoner obtained $15,000 from one of his children which he believed was to be deposited in a joint account, but in fact the account was opened in her sole name at St George Bank on 30 September 2002. There was also a dispute over a sum of $1,400 which she claimed he had taken from her and she subsequently took his bank books and attempted to obtain money from his bank by forging his signature. She re-sold their wedding rings to the jeweller for vouchers worth $250. 
     
      
    5 She did not come home every night and when she did, she argued with the prisoner and kept him awake, accusing him of stealing her papers and other things. Ultimately he put a barrier, and subsequently a lock on his own bedroom door and kept food, drink and a bucket for urinating at night in his room to avoid being confronted by her.  
     
      
    6 The police were called to the premises on two separate occasions prior to the deceased’s death. On 24 October 2002 at about 11:20pm, they were called following a verbal argument over money. The deceased was happy to remain at the house that night.  
     
      
    7 Two days later (26 October), police were called again about midday. The prisoner complained that the deceased had broken a window of the premises. She agreed she had, but said it was because the prisoner had locked her out of her room, and so she had broken the window to gain access and she complained to Constable Dunn that he had assaulted her and purported to show the bruises, but Constable Dunn could see nothing. She said she was leaving and did so, but returned about an hour later when the police were again called and the prisoner complained that she would not give him any peace or let him sleep. She eventually left the premises on that occasion. 
     
      
    8 According to the version given to police in his recorded interview on 29 November 2002 following his arrest, the prisoner was at home by himself about 10:30pm when he went to bed to go to sleep. The deceased arrived home at about 12:37am and banged on the door to be let into the house. The prisoner got up, let her in and returned to his bedroom where he locked the door and went back to bed, after which the deceased spoke, yelled and kicked at his bedroom door for about 40 minutes. He then opened the door, shook her by the arms asking her to desist, whereupon she stepped into his bedroom and a scuffle followed during which the prisoner kneed the deceased in the stomach. They both fell to the bedroom floor, he again put his knee into her stomach and hit her on the head. It appears the deceased was screaming, and in order to stop that he put a cloth over her mouth and held it there. He got her shoe and hit her over the head with the heel of the shoe numerous times and shortly after he stopped he realised that she was dead. He had a drink of water, a cigarette and a shower. About 3am went to the home of his daughter and son-in-law, which was a granny flat in the backyard of his house, and told them what had happened. He then telephoned Mount Druitt Police Station and at their request, waited at the house until they arrived shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    9 The photos of the deceased taken at the scene and at post-mortem revealed multiple and extensive injuries to her head and body and the post-mortem examination showed severe bruising to the head and body, a broken nose, her fourth, fifth and twelfth ribs on the right side were broken, her bowel was bruised, there was a haemorrhage around the left kidney and a small amount of patchy subarachnoid haemorrhage to the brain. The cause of death was blunt trauma to the head and trunk, and asphyxia. An examination of the prisoner disclosed 8 lacerations to his right forearm and a fracture of the fifth finger on his right hand, and he complained of a painful right hand, thus indicating the violence of his attack.  
     
      
    10 It appears that the prisoner, as was his custom, had been drinking port wine prior to the fatal attack, and may have been slightly or moderately affected by alcohol, although urine analysis taken later did not disclose the presence of anything of significance. 11 At the committal proceedings, the possible defence of provocation was tested, but on arraignment, he pleaded guilty to murder and has since adhered to such plea.  
     
      
    12 The prisoner is now aged 66 and was born in Croatia. He last saw his father when he was aged 4 during World War II and he believes his father may have been killed during that conflict. His family left Croatia when he was very young and, after travelling through Italy after the War, they lived in a camp in Austria until 1949 when he was 11 years old and they came to Australia. He had two brothers and three sisters, the youngest died whilst they were in Austria, his eldest brother is now deceased and the three remaining siblings remain in Australia.  
     
      
    13 He was educated in Europe and in Australia and left school at the age of 15 ½. He worked all his life in manual employments, largely as a concreter, until he retired in 1996. He was married at the age of 26 to an Anglo-Australian woman who died in 1988 at the age of 48 from emphysema or cancer after a marriage of 25 years which produced three sons and two daughters. He gets on well with all his children and they are all supportive of him. There are also a large number of neighbours and other associates who have furnished character references.  
     
      
    14 The overall impression that one gets from all of this was that he has been a good husband, father and grandfather with strong family ties, has worked hard all his adult life, has raised his family to a situation where they are all settled and married, he nursed his first wife during her last distressing illness and has no prior history of violence or any other form of criminal conduct, apart apparently for some traffic matters.  
     
      
    15 All the family and character witnesses who have since learned of his second marriage say that after that, his attitude changed, he became withdrawn and distressed, and some of them were aware that he and the deceased were having arguments. The relationship was clearly unsuitable and dysfunctional and there does not seem to be any doubt that the motivation for the so called “marriage” was to assist the deceased with her application to remain in Australia, and it does not appear to have been a real marriage in any sense of the word. None of these matters however can excuse his responsibility for her death.  
     
      
    16 The whole incident is a tragedy from the point of view of the deceased and of her aged Russian parents who have lost their only child, and also a tragedy for the prisoner, who after a fruitful and comparatively happy life, finds himself in his present predicament, and for his family who now have to cope with a situation which they never anticipated. 
     
      
    17 The prisoner was examined by Dr Westmore, psychiatrist, who considered that he was suffering from depression with a moderate to severe adjustment disorder due mainly to the fact that he was facing the charge. He found no evidence of an antisocial personality disorder and considered the risks of him re-offending were low to negligible, but that his long term psychiatric prognosis should be considered cautiously, and he recommended ongoing psychiatric care. He suggested that on the night of the killing, the prisoner was overwhelmed by feelings of frustration and anger towards the deceased because of her alleged behaviour to him after they were married. 
     
      
    18 The offence having been committed prior to 1 February 2003, s 21A applies as amended by the 2002 amendment Act, but the amendments affected by that Act to s 44 do not apply. In relation to s 21A, the offence was a violent crime resulting in the loss of a human life; but there were a number of mitigating factors including that, although the partial defence of provocation was not raised, I am satisfied there was a degree of provocative conduct on the part of the victim. The offence was not planned or premeditated but was an angry response to the actions of the deceased.  
     
      
    19 The applicant has no previous convictions, is otherwise a person of good character and is unlikely to re-offend. He has shown remorse for the offence by his plea of guilty and also in his recorded interview with police and in his interviews with Dr Westmore. Not only is his plea of guilty in the present case evidence of remorse and contrition but he is also entitled to a significant discount for its utilitarian value. It was not a plea at committal, but was entered on arraignment on 5 March 2004 before the matter was set down for trial, and I consider that a discount of 20 percent is appropriate in respect of all elements of the plea including its utilitarian value. I am also satisfied that the prisoner’s age, his prior good character and unlikelihood of him re-offending constitute special circumstances justifying a variation in the ratio provided for by s 44. 
     
      
    20 The prisoner was arrested on 29 November 2002 and admitted to bail 5 days later. He was arraigned on 5 March 2003 when he pleaded guilty and bail was refused, and he has been in custody since that date. The sentence will accordingly be backdated 5 days prior to 5 March 2003, namely 28 February 2003. 
     
      
       
       
      
    21 JOHN KISELJEV, for the murder of Nadejda Zassoukhina, I sentence you to imprisonment for 16 years, such sentence to be deemed to have commenced on 28 February 2003 and I fix a non-parole period of 11 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 27 February 2014.

    3 BUDDIN J: Yesterday at the conclusion of the hearing of the matter the court pronounced the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Leave to appeal against sentence imposed in respect of count 2 granted. 
       
       
      2 Appeal allowed (in part). 
       
       
      3 Confirm the head sentence but quash the non-parole period imposed in the District Court and in lieu thereof impose a non-parole period of 18 months which will expire on 27 January 2005 at which date the applicant will be eligible for release on parole.  
       
      
    4 The court also indicated that it would publish its reasons today. What follows are my reasons for joining in the making of those orders. 
     
      
    5 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court where he pleaded guilty to an indictment which contained two counts. The first alleged that he stole a motor vehicle on 19 July 2002. The second alleged that on the same date he assaulted a police officer acting in the execution of his duty and thereby occasioned him actual bodily harm. The latter offence attracted a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment whilst the earlier offence attracted a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. That offence was deemed to be a larceny because the applicant was driving a stolen vehicle without the owner’s consent at the time of his arrest. In respect of the first count the applicant was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. That sentence was ordered to commence on 28 July 2002 which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested and went into custody. It is apparent that that sentence has now expired. In respect of the second count the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. That sentence was ordered to commence on 28 July 2003. The applicant is accordingly eligible for release on parole on 27 July 2005. The total effective sentence is thus one of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    6 A statement of facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. It is convenient to set out, with minor modifications, the relevant parts of that document. 
     
      
       
        
        On 19th July, 2002, Senior Constable Adam Evans, whilst on duty driving a police car along Sackville Street, Blacktown, observed the offender driving a motor vehicle. Evans knew the offender from previous arrests and knew the offender was a disqualified driver. Evans pursued the offender. The offender was driving [a vehicle which had been stolen three days earlier] without the consent of the owner. 
        
       
       
        
        During the pursuit, the offender turned left, the wrong way, into a one-way street. The front of the car driven by the offender collided with the side of a white van at the intersection. The driver of the van was stationary, waiting to turn left out of the intersection. Immediately upon impact, two passengers in the stolen vehicle alighted from the car and decamped. One of the passengers was in the front passenger seat. When he alighted, he left the passenger door wide open. 
        
       
       
        
        Senior Constable Evans was close behind the stolen vehicle driven by the offender. Evans also turned left and pulled the police car up, next to the stolen car. The police car was approximately 1 metre away from the stolen car. The front of the police car was adjacent to the open door of the stolen car. Senior Constable Evans saw the two passengers decamp. Evans looked at the offender whilst he was still seated in the police car. The offender looked at Evans. Evans got out of the police car and started running towards the back of the stolen car. He was intending to arrest the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        Senior Constable Evans had only gone a step or so when he heard someone yell out. He looked over his shoulder and saw the stolen vehicle reversing. Evans was hit by the open passenger door of the stolen vehicle driven by the offender. Evans was hit in the back of his legs. He felt the stolen car getting closer to him. He put one hand on the stolen car and the other on the police car and lifted himself up and over the boot of his car thereby avoiding being crushed between the two vehicles. The offender continued reversing the stolen vehicle out of the intersection and up the adjoining street. 
        
       
       
        
        Senior Constable Evans sought medical treatment from his family doctor the following day. He was examined and found to have suffered a strain to his left wrist, strain to his back and a strain to his neck. He also suffered pain in the back of his legs. 
        
       
       
        
        The police vehicle was damaged by the open front door of the offender’s car. The police car was damaged from the drivers door to the rear panel. 
        
       
      
    7 The applicant had originally been charged with using an offensive weapon, namely a motor vehicle, with intent to avoid lawful apprehension contrary to s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. That offence renders a person liable to a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment and is accordingly a more serious offence than the one to which the applicant ultimately pleaded guilty. The applicant pleaded guilty to the alternative charge when it was first offered, that is when he was arraigned on 17 November 2003. Until then it had been anticipated that the matter would proceed to trial. In those circumstances, the sentencing judge extended to the applicant a discount of 25% on account of the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was aged 43 at the time of these offences. He is one of eight children of Aboriginal descent. He had a tumultuous upbringing which was largely attributable to his father’s alcoholism. His father physically abused his mother and the children. The applicant left school at the age of 15 and worked intermittently in unskilled labouring jobs until he went onto sickness benefits in the mid 1980s. He has not worked since that time. He has had three significant relationships and has in all fathered four children. The applicant has had a very long history of serious abuse of both alcohol and illicit drugs. He has shown a marked reluctance in the past to address those problems. 
     
      
    9 When the applicant stood for sentencing he had accumulated a significant number of convictions dating back to 1978. Although his criminal history is by no means confined to such matters, he has a particularly lamentable record for offences involving the use of a motor vehicle. He has been convicted on more than a dozen occasions for drink driving offences not only this State but in Queensland and the Northern Territory as well. Furthermore he has been convicted on numerous occasions for driving whilst disqualified and is currently disqualified from driving until 2031. He also has a conviction for culpable driving and several convictions for illegal use of a vehicle and take and drive a conveyance. Furthermore he has twice been previously convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm as well as for a number of less serious forms of assault and resist arrest. The applicant has served a number of terms of imprisonment albeit that most have been of short duration. Alcohol has played a major part in the commission of many, if not all, of these offences. It was an aggravating feature of the present offences that they were committed whilst the applicant was on bail. That material was all relevant to an assessment of the applicant’s culpability for the present offences. 
     
      
    10 Nevertheless it is to the applicant’s credit that he has spent his time in custody productively. He has completed a methadone reduction program and is now reported to be free of any drugs for the first time in many years. When he first entered custody he was on a daily dose of 120 mlg of methadone but has gradually weaned himself off it altogether. It appears that he has gained some insights into his previous behaviour and has worked hard with the support of the prison psychologist and the prison chaplain towards achieving “his goal of being abstinent”. He is currently studying a Bible studies course by correspondence and has enthusiastically embraced the Christian faith. He has successfully completed a number of other courses as well. The applicant was employed in the maintenance section of the gaol at the time of sentence and was reported to be an excellent worker. The applicant retains the support of his family and the evidence revealed that he has employment available to him upon his release from gaol. 
     
      
    11 The sentencing judge had regard to that material in determining that this was a case in which a finding of “special circumstances” could be properly made. Her Honour concluded that a longer than usual period upon parole was warranted and that the applicant would require an extended period of time in order to successfully reintegrate into the community after having been for such a lengthy period of time dependent upon alcohol and drugs. Her Honour also had regard to the evidence concerning the applicant’s frontal lobe damage as a matter which supported a finding of “special circumstances”. I shall return to consider that matter further in due course. 
     
      
    12 The applicant contends that the sentence in respect of count 2 was manifestly excessive. A number of grounds of appeal were advanced which are, in effect, particulars of that principal contention. It was conceded that a number of them were of a technical nature which they plainly are. 
     
      
    13 The first ground of appeal asserts that the sentencing judge erred in assessing the objective criminality of the conduct which is the subject of count 2. It was submitted that her Honour erred in describing the offence as being ”at the upper end of the scale” for offences of this kind. 
     
      
    14 It was important, particularly given the way in which the matter unfolded, that the sentencing judge did not infringe the principles enunciated in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. However so long as the sentencing judge did not find that the motor vehicle was used with the intention of avoiding lawful apprehension, then the De Simoni principle was not infringed. The sentencing judge did not fall into error of that kind and it was not suggested that she had. Indeed the sentencing judge was rather more circumspect than the circumstances required because her Honour was of the view that it was inappropriate to take into account the use of the vehicle in causing the assault. However it is unnecessary to explore that matter any further. 
     
      
    15 It was submitted that the applicant’s conduct should not have been characterised as being at the upper end of the scale because it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that his conduct was intentional or deliberate. It was submitted that the evidence was only capable of supporting the view that it was reckless behaviour. In support of that submission, reliance was placed in part upon the report of Dr Jolly which concerned the applicant’s compromised ability to “reason things through with clarity.” As this submission was linked to the second ground of appeal it is convenient to return to this aspect of the matter when dealing with that ground.  
     
      
    16 It was also submitted, at least in the written submissions, that a finding that the applicant’s state of mind was intentional or deliberate was not open because to so find would infringe the De Simoni principle. The argument, in essence, was that a finding that the applicant had acted intentionally or deliberately would necessarily entail a conclusion that he was guilty of the more serious charge with which he was originally charged, namely using the motor vehicle with intent to avoid lawful apprehension. I do not accept the submission. It was quite possible for the sentencing judge to have found that there was an intention to commit the assault without taking the further step of concluding that there was also an intention in doing so to avoid lawful apprehension.  
     
      
    17 Accordingly, it was not in my view incumbent upon the sentencing judge to come to the view that the applicant’s actions were reckless as distinct from being intentional or deliberate in causing the assault upon Constable Evans. 
     
      
    18 But even if I am wrong in so concluding, and that the only view that was available upon the evidence was that the applicant’s conduct was indeed reckless, then that would still not incline me to the view that the sentencing judge’s characterisation of the applicant’s conduct was erroneous. The totality of the applicant’s conduct as disclosed in the Statement of Facts, together with the other matters to which I earlier referred, revealed criminality of a significant order. That being so, I am of the view that the objective gravity of the offence required the imposition of a substantial sentence. I would accordingly reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    19 The second ground of appeal asserts that the sentencing judge erred in assessing the significance of the substantial body of medical evidence that was placed before the sentencing judge. That material consisted of a report from Dr Jolly dated 5 August 2003 as well as a report from Ms Anita Duffy dated 17 September 1999. The latter report was clearly prepared in respect of earlier offences which the applicant had committed. There was no updated report from her which concerned the present offences. There was a report dated 12 March 1990 from Ms Jennifer Batchelor, a clinical neuropsychologist at Westmead Hospital, together with a short report dated 5 April 1990 from Dr Janine Stevenson, who was a staff psychiatrist at Westmead Hospital. There were also reports of assessments made concerning the applicant’s mental state at about the time of his arrest in July 2002. Unfortunately some of those reports, as the sentencing judge observed, suffered from two difficulties. First, the handwriting upon them was difficult to decipher and secondly, the right hand side of the pages of the reports had been cut off presumably whilst the documents were being photocopied. That clearly reduced the extent to which the sentencing judge could place any reliance upon them. 
     
      
    20 Insofar as there was any inconsistency between the various reports, the sentencing judge indicated a preference for the views expressed by Dr Jolly who had the decided advantage of having available to him all the other reports to which I have referred. Her Honour’s finding seemed to relate particularly to his conclusion that the applicant was not suffering from a psychiatric illness.  
     
      
    21 However Dr Jolly also considered the applicant’s overall mental functioning and its significance to the question of his criminal responsibility for his actions. He arrived at the following conclusions: 
     
      
       
        
        In a general sense, this man is not psychotic. I concluded this section of my report and emphasised ‘issue of panic’. I need to emphasise my opinion, at risk of labouring the point, that the combination of ‘anxiety’ and inability to reason things through with clarity, on account of frontal lobe damage, causes this man to react in ways which are understandable in that context even though the normal or ‘average’ person might be expected to process information in such a way as to become aware of the immediate circumstances of an incident. 
         
        … 
         
        Psycho-legally, the finding of frontal lobe dysfunction pre-existent, and application of those findings to the subject incident and setting, is important in that Mr Pickett’s decreased ability to reason calmly and process information as might a cerebrally intact person must be taken into consideration. Further, I emphasis his tendency to ‘panic’. 
        
       
      
    22 As I have said Dr Jolly had available to him various reports. It included Ms Batchelor’s neuropsychological assessment performed in 1990. Since Dr Jolly’s reference in his report to the applicant’s frontal lobe damage depended upon that assessment, it is convenient to set out the relevant parts of that assessment: 
     
      
       
        
        The results of the assessment revealed Michael to be demonstrating specific difficulties on measures of adaptive (frontal lobe) functioning. Thus, his ability to plan his responses, to switch from one train of thought to another, to inhibit inappropriate response tendencies (even when he knew these to be incorrect) and to reason and problem solve all appeared reduced relative to expected levels. In contrast, recent memory functions and intellectual status proved relatively intact. 
        
       
       
        
        The pattern of performances returned on testing was suggestive of a specific disturbance of those abilities mediated by the frontal lobes. Whilst this profile is frequently seen as a result of chronic alcohol abuse, it should be kept in mind that Michael has a long history of poorly controlled behaviour and it is possible that his childhood problems were themselves the result of an underlying pathology of the frontal lobes. Thus, although the assessment revealed evidence of a specific impairment of adaptive abilities it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding the etiology of these deficits 
        
       
      
    23 The submission was advanced that the sentencing judge did not give proper weight to this material particularly insofar as it bore upon the question of the applicant’s moral culpability. I would reject that submission in view of the fact that the sentencing judge not only specifically referred to this material but also included extensive passages from Dr Jolly’s report in the Remarks on Sentence, including the critical findings to which I earlier referred. Moreover, as I earlier observed, her Honour again made specific reference to this material as a matter which was relevant to a finding of “special circumstances”. I would accordingly reject this Ground of Appeal. 
     
      
    24 The next ground of appeal asserts that the sentencing judge’s “response to the fact that the applicant had not given evidence resulted in an error of approach and an inadequate assessment of contrition as a relevant factor”. 
     
      
    25 The applicant did not give evidence during the course of the sentence proceedings. The evidence touching upon this subject was accordingly in a short compass. The author of the pre-sentence report observed that the applicant “accepts responsibility for the commission of the offence and appeared remorseful for his actions”. Dr Jolly reported that the applicant told him that “I’ve got no malice towards officer Evans…he’s just a (a policeman) doing his job…I’m so grateful he didn’t get hurt”. The drug and alcohol counsellor at the gaol also indicated that the applicant had expressed remorse. 
     
      
    26 The sentencing judge observed that “on a reading of some of the medical reports, it may be possible to suggest that he has, on occasion, expressed regret and sorrow for his action. However, the offender remains resolutely silent before me. It is apparent, from the report of Dr Jolly, that the offender has in his presentation some rather conscious knowledge of the need to advocate his own position; and to present it in the best possible light.”  
     
      
    27 In R v Qutami [2001] 127 A Crim R 369 Smart AJ, with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreed, said that: 
     
      
       
        
        There is one further general observation. In this case reliance appears to have been placed on statements made by the prisoner to psychiatrists and the psychologist. While those statements are admissible in evidence, very considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon them when there is no evidence given by the prisoner. In many cases only very limited weight can be given to such statements. 
         
        There has been a noticeable and disturbing tendency of more recent years for prisoners on a sentence hearing not to give evidence and to rely on statements made to experts. Prisoners should realise that if this course is taken great caution will be exercised in respect of the weight, if any, given to those statements. (at 377) 
        
       
      
    28 In light of the limited evidence which was before the sentencing judge, this was a case in my view in which it was well open to the sentencing judge to conclude that little weight could be extended to the applicant for any element of contrition which went beyond that which was apparent in the pleas of guilty themselves, which as I have observed attracted a discount of 25%, a figure which is at the top of the range identified in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    29 The applicant acknowledges that the sentencing judge was entitled to treat those expressions of apparent remorse, which were not made on oath, with a degree of caution. The real complaint is focussed upon her Honour’s observation that “the offender remains resolutely silent before me”. It is submitted that those observations amounted to a “negative conclusion as to the applicant’s attitude”. Furthermore it was submitted that “the absence of sworn evidence was not to be regarded as a negative ‘step back’ factor”.  
     
      
    30 It may be observed at once that the sentencing judge’s remarks were rather unusual and somewhat ambiguous. Whilst it is incumbent upon an offender who is seeking a measure of leniency on account of an expression of remorse or contrition to adduce evidence in support of such a claim, there is clearly no obligation to do so. A failure to put forward such evidence simply deprives the offender of any such benefit. Although the expression used by the sentencing judge was perhaps unfortunate, I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge’s approach to this issue has been demonstrated to be in error. I would reject this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    31 It is next contended that the sentencing judge “failed to consider as a relevant factor that the amended indictment contained offences capable of being disposed of in the Local Court”. 
     
      
    32 In support of this ground, the applicant relies upon the decision of this court in R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297. However a failure by a sentencing judge to mention that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court cannot of itself constitute error. In R v Sivyer [2002] NSWCCA 410, Wood CJ at CL, in a passage which is particularly apposite to the present case, said; 
     
      
       
        
        It was submitted that, by failing to advert to this fact, or to the possibility that the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court under S 32 of the  
        Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
        , his Honour must have overlooked this consideration. However, as I pointed out in  
        Regina v Crombie 
         [1999] NSWCCA 297, there is no absolute principle of law that a sentencing judge must proceed upon the basis that the maximum sentence available in such a situation (here, imprisonment for three years) should be that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. The facts in  
        Crombie 
          
        are markedly different from those in the present case, where the applicant had multiple convictions for similar offences; had served several terms of imprisonment and has re-offended while on parole. The simple fact is that the applicant chose to plead not guilty in the Local Court, and the DPP had every right to elect to proceed upon indictment in view of the prior record. 
        
       
      
    33 There is no substance in this ground of appeal in my view particularly when proper regard is had to the objective circumstances of the offence and the applicant’s antecedent criminal behaviour. 
     
      
    34 The next ground asserts that the sentencing judge “gave inadequate weight to delay and the circumstance of the applicant having served 19 months of pre-sentence custody in maximum security”. 
     
      
    35 As I observed earlier it was anticipated that these matters (or at least the incident which ultimately gave rise to count 2) were to proceed to trial. Apparently the sentencing proceedings commenced before Judge Payne on 18 December 2003 but could not then be completed. For reasons that have not been made clear, the sentence hearing commenced afresh before the sentencing judge on 27 February 2004 and then proceeded to finality on that day. Counsel for the applicant informed the court that Judge Payne had expressed a view at some stage of the proceedings on 18 December 2003 as to the appropriate sentence. That was a sentence which was more lenient than the sentence which was imposed by the sentence judge. It is said that that circumstance had the consequence that “the delay in proceedings had an extra sting”.  
     
      
    36 It is clear that Judge Payne’s remarks formed no part of the proceedings before the sentencing judge and indeed were not brought to her Honour’s attention. Moreover the applicant properly concedes that Judge Payne’s comments could not, in any event, circumscribe the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. Apart from any other consideration, the material placed before the respective judges was quite clearly different. For example, the applicant gave evidence before Judge Payne but did not do so before the sentencing judge. In short, the comments made by Judge Payne can assume no relevance, in my view, to the disposition of this appeal. Nor in my view is there any basis for assuming that the sentencing judge erred in assessing the weight to be given to the factor of delay. Her Honour was aware of it and expressed the view, during the course of the proceedings, that it was regrettable. Nevertheless it was not of such an order as to attract any significant measure of leniency particularly as the applicant was able to demonstrate that he had used that time productively in order to show that there was for the first time some scope for optimism as to his prospects for rehabilitation. In those circumstances, I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    37 The applicant was granted leave to rely upon an additional ground of appeal. The complaint is directed at the following passage in the Remarks on Sentence in which her Honour said that “in respect of each of these offences there is an aggravating factor immediately to hand. Relevantly, in each case, the offender previously had been convicted of similar offences.” 
     
      
    38 The applicant relies upon this court’s decision in R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 in support of the submission that the sentencing judge fell into error in making those observations. That decision is of little assistance in the present context because it concerns the construction of a particular provision in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which was not in operation at the time these offences were committed.  
     
      
    39 This submission thus falls to be assessed in accordance with the pre-existing common law. In Veen v The Queen (No2) (1987-8) 164 CLR 465, a majority of the High Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell 
        . The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner's claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community's understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties. (at 477-8) 
         
          
        
       
      
    40 It was not, and could not have been, contended that the applicant’s antecedent criminal history was not relevant in the way in which the High Court indicated in Veen (No2). The language employed by the sentencing judge did not strictly conform to the principles enunciated by the High Court. However, I am not in the circumstances disposed to conclude that error has been established, particularly as at a later stage in the Remarks on Sentence her Honour observed that the fact that the applicant had an extremely lengthy criminal history meant that the principle of specific deterrence had a significant role to play in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    41 There is however one final matter to be considered. The sentencing judge observed that “it is appropriate, having regard to the special circumstances, to set a much longer period to the parole period than would ordinarily be the case. I will vary the ordinary ratio which is …seventy five/twenty five to fifty/fifty in order to provide for that need for longer term supervision.”  
     
      
    42 It is apparent that in structuring the individual sentences her Honour, as she said she would, set the non-parole period at 50% of the head sentence. However, because the second sentence was partially accumulated upon the first sentence, the overall non-parole period produced was in fact 60% of the overall effective sentence. In other words, the outcome which the sentencing judge intended was not given effect to in the actual orders which were made. In my view, it is appropriate for this court to intervene but only for the purpose of correcting that anomaly. This court has intervened in somewhat similar circumstances in cases such as R v Bolamutu [2002] NSWCCA 454; R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215 and R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86 and should do so in the present case as well.

     Judgment 
      
      
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences passed by his Honour Judge Milson in the Parramatta Drug Court on 23 June 2003. Certain of the sentences are described by the relevant legislation as final sentences and others may simply be described as sentences. 
     
      
    2 The provisions of both the Drug Court Act 1998 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 create questions relating to both jurisdiction and indeed the forum for the hearing of appeals from the Drug Court. We illustrate this conundrum as follows :- Sections 5AF and 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 enable a person convicted by the Drug Court, in relation to a final sentence determined by that court under s12 of the Drug Court Act, to appeal against such a sentence to a single Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Other sentences, which are the result of a conviction for an indictable offence, may be appealed to this Court under s (1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act, that is to a court constituted either by three or two Judges. Furthermore convictions involving matters which are usually dealt with summarily by the Local Court, but are dealt with by the Drug Court, may be appealed not to this Court but to the District Court. 
     
      
    3 In the present case the Crown has submitted that certain of the sentences imposed by the Drug Court should be heard by a single Judge of this Court, others by the Court constituted by two or three Judges and finally that certain of the sentences which would normally have been imposed by the Local Court are not the subject of a right of appeal to this Court, but to the District Court.  
     
      
    4 Thus, the first task of this Court is to determine which matters should be heard by a court constituted by two or three Judges, to determine which of the sentences should be determined by a single Judge of this Court and finally, which of the sentences (if any) do not fall within the jurisdiction of this Court.  
     
      
    5 As a matter of practicality, this Court constituted by three Judges heard full argument in respect of all matters. The initial purpose of this judgment is to determine which matters should be determined by a court constituted by the three Judges who heard all the argument, which matters should be determined by a Judge of this Court sitting alone (for which purpose the Chief Justice has nominated Newman AJ as that Judge) and finally which matters do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court. 
     
      
    6 The sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Milson involve some eleven offences (in addition three offences were taken into account by his Honour on a Form 1). The Crown submitted, in our view quite correctly, that the offences dealt with by his Honour fell into three categories.  
     
      
    7 The first category constituted those sentences which are described as “final sentences” within the meaning of s 12 the Drug Court Act 1998. Those sentences involved offences of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to the provisions of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and the offence of break, enter and steal contrary to the provisions of s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. These offences were contained on a single indictment and were the subject of what is described by the Drug Court Act as an initial sentence imposed by his Honour on 29 October 2002. His final sentences, pursuant to s 12, were imposed on 23 June 2003. It was in relation to those offences that three offences were taken into account under a Form 1. The offences taken into account were one offence of possessing a prohibited drug contrary to the provisions of s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and two counts of goods in custody contrary to the provisions of s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. We should add that in relation to the matters contained on the indictment, his Honour at that time was presented with a matter described as a summary matter, namely an offence contrary to s 527C(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 of goods in custody. 
     
      
    8 The second category of offences were offences committed prior to the applicant’s entering the Drug Court program (for the first category of offences which we have just mentioned) but for which the applicant was arrested and charged after the commencement of the program. These offences included another count of Aggravated, break enter and steal contrary to the provisions of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and a summary offence of obtaining money by deception, being less than or equal to $2,000 contrary to the provisions of s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    9 The third category of offences were offences described as being “on program” offences, being offences committed while the applicant was participating in the Drug Court program. These offences included two offences of driving while disqualified contrary to s 25A(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998, two offences of using an unregistered vehicle contrary to s 18(1) of the Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Act 1997 and two offences of using an uninsured motor vehicle contrary to the provisions of s 8(1)(a) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999. 
     
      
    10 The Crown submitted that in relation to the matters which would normally be heard on a trial on indictment which fell within category one, they being sentences which were final sentences pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Court Act, these sentences could only be heard by a single Judge of the Criminal Court.  
     
      
    11 As to the summary matter contained within category one, the Crown’s submission is that this Court has no jurisdiction as an appeal from a summary conviction can only lie to the District Court.  
     
      
    12 As to the matters which would be normally charged on indictment falling within category two the Crown’s submission is that, there being no final sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Act, the only avenue of appeal to this Court is an appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act to a court constituted by three or two Judges. As to the summary matter falling within category two, the Crown’s submission is that this Court has no jurisdiction, it being a matter which can only properly be heard on appeal to the District Court.  
     
      
    13 As to the whole of the offences contained within category three it is the Crown’s submission that all of these offences, being summary offences, are not subject to appeal to this Court but to the District Court.  
     
      
    14 As we have said, the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain appeals on sentence from the Drug Court is to be found in ss5(1)(c) and 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. These sections are in the following terms :-  
     
      
       
      “5 Right of appeal in criminal cases 
      
     
     
      
      (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court:  
       
       
        
        (c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      S5AF 
       
       
      “(1) Section 5AA applies to and in respect of a person convicted of an offence by the Drug Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Part 2 of the Drug Court Act 1998 (in relation only to a final sentence determined by the Court under section 12 of that Act) in the same way as it applies to a person referred to in section 5AA(1). 
       
       
      (2) For the purposes of this section, a reference in s 5AA to the Supreme Court is to be construed as including a reference to the Drug Court. 
       
       
      (3) The power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine an appeal under this section is to be exercised by such single judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.”  
       
      
    15 Section 12 of the Drug Court Act states :-  
     
      
       
      “12 Imposition of final sentence 
       
       
      (1) On terminating a drug offender’s program, The Drug Court must reconsider the drug offender’s initial sentence. 
       
       
      (2) In reconsidering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court must take into consideration :  
       
       
        
        (a) the nature of the drug offender’s participation in his or her program, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) any sanctions that have been imposed on the drug offender during the program, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) any time for which the drug offender has been held in custody in connection with an offence to which his or her program relates, including time during which the person has undergone imprisonment: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) under the sentence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) under the condition of the program arising under section 8A. 
          
         
        
       
       
      (3) After considering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court is to determine the drug offender’s final sentence: 
       
       
        
        (a) by making an order setting aside the initial sentence and taking such action under Part 2 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999 as it could have taken for the offence to which the initial sentence related, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) by making an order confirming the initial sentence. 
        
       
       
      (4) The final sentence determined for a drug offender in relation to an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed on the drug offender in relation to that offence. 
       
       
      (5) (Repealed)”  
       
      
    16 Questions involving the competency of appeals and the constitution of this Court in dealing with appeals from the Drug Court have arisen in two recent decisions of this Court. In R v El-Hamid [2000] NSWCCA 497 Dunford J construed s 5AF(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in such a way as to allow a person convicted of a summary offence before the Drug Court to seek leave to appeal to this Court, constituted by a single Judge. 
     
      
    17 In R v Ohar [2004] NSWCCA 83 this Court held that appeals flowing from final sentences passed pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Court Act are, by s 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act, to be heard by a single Judge of this Court. Accordingly, those matters which we described as being in Category 1 in the Crown submissions, are matters which should be determined by a single Judge. 
     
      
    18 We should add that as we have noted above one of the matters dealt with by his Honour in the Court below which fell within Category 1 was a summary offence. In R v Ohar James J, in delivering the principal judgement of this Court, effectively held that summary offences, if they are included within the sentencing order made pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Court Act, were appropriate matters to be heard by a Judge of this Court sitting alone. While for reasons we shall detail later this could lead to a somewhat curious result, we are of the view that this Court should follow the decision in Ohar. Accordingly, in our view those matters which we described as falling within Category 1 are matters which should be heard by a Judge alone. In other words Newman AJ shall determine those matters.  
     
      
    19 The matters which fall within Category 2 include one matter which would normally be charged on indictment and another which would normally be dealt with as a summary offence.  
     
      
    20 At to the matter which would normally be heard on indictment, namely, the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, this Court in Ohar determined, in our view correctly, that any right of appeal to this Court was not an appeal pursuant to s 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act but an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of that Act. It follows that we are of the view that it is for a Court constituted by either two or three judges that that appeal should go. However, the offence of obtaining money by deception, being less or equal to the sum of $2,000 contrary to the provisions of s178BA of the Crimes Act, is not a matter which normally would come to this Court pursuant to s 5(1)(c). Indeed an attempt to appeal in the ordinary course of events from the Local Court to this Court under that section would be treated by this Court as being an incompetent appeal.  
     
      
    21 It is this consideration which led the Court in R v Ohar to determine that any matters of a summary nature which were contained in a sentencing order of the Drug Court not made pursuant to s12 of the Drug Court Act are incompetent appeals to this Court. In essence what the Court held was that any right of appeal from summary matters determined by the Drug Court were appeals governed by s 5A of the Justices Act 1902. In other words such appeals are appeals which should be determined by the District Court. It was this concept which troubled Dunford J in El-Hamid and indeed continued to trouble him in Ohar. We sympathise with Dunford J’s concern that effectively an appeal from a District Court Judge to another District Court Judge was akin to “an appeal from Caesar to Caesar”. Sympathising as we do with Dunford J’s expressed concern in Ohar, we are of the view that the construction adopted by the Court in that case of ss 5AF and 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and the provisions of ss 8,12 and 24 of the Drug Court Act is a correct construction. 
     
      
    22 James J in his reasons in Ohar’s case held that because appeals pursuant to s 5(1)(c) are confined to appeals by persons convicted on indictment and that appeals pursuant to s 5AF are confined to appeals from final sentences imposed by judges of the Drug Court, sentences imposed by the Drug Court which do not fall within ss 5(1)(c) or 5AF are not appeals which can be bought to this Court. As we have indicated above the Court held in Ohar that those matters should be determined by the District Court pursuant to s 5A of the Justices Act. 
     
      
    23 In this case it was submitted, on behalf of the applicant, that because the provisions of s 15(3) of the Drug Court Act 1998 exclude the application of s 58 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 to sentences imposed by the Drug Court this provision gives the Drug Court a more extensive jurisdiction than the Local Court in that it can accumulate sentences outside a three year period. Accordingly it was put that it would be appropriate for those offences which may be described as summary offences to be heard by a single Judge of this Court pursuant to s 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    24 However in our view this argument must fail. It fails because the summary offences which fall within categories 2 and 3 of the matters before this Court are not :- a) final sentences made pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Court Act and b) are not sentences passed on a person convicted on an indictment pursuant to s 5(1)(c). This Court, being a creature of statute, can only deal with those matters which fall within the powers given to it by its enabling statute. Here as the summary matters contained in categories 2 and 3 do not fall within appeals which this Court can entertain pursuant to s5(1)(c) and 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, they are incompetent appeals to this Court. Accordingly we are of the view that the matter of obtaining money by deception contrary to the provisions of s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 in the second category of offences and all the matters contained in the third category of offences are not matters in which this Court can entertain an appeal. They should be brought in the District Court pursuant to s 5A of the Justices Act. This as we have stated above leads to a somewhat curious result. In the category 1 offences there was, as we have said, a matter which would normally be dealt with summarily. That was the offence of goods in custody contrary to s 527C(1c) of the Crimes Act 1900. On the face of it, it would seem that it should suffer the same fate as the summary matters contained in categories 2 and 3. However, as the matter was in fact the subject of the final sentence passed by his Honour below, it, unlike the summary matters contained in categories 2 and 3, falls within s12 of the Drug Court Act and thus within the purview of s 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Thus, we have the curious result where one summary matter may be the subject of an appeal to a single Judge pursuant to s 5AF because it is contained within an order made pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Court Act but other summary matters which do not fall within that section of the Drug Court Act can not be brought before this Court.  
     
      
    25 To summarise our findings. We find that all of the matters within category 1 are matters which may be heard and determined by a single judge of this Court pursuant to s 5AF. We find that the sentence imposed by Judge Milson in the offence within the second category, being a matter of aggravated break, enter and steal, contrary to the provisions of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, is a matter which can be entertained by the Court of Criminal Appeal constituted by two or three Judges. We find that the sentences relating to the summary offences of obtain money by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (the summary offence in the second category) and all the matters falling within the third category are matters which can not be entertained by this Court but by the District Court pursuant to s 5A of the Justices Act.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 14 November 2003 the offender, Phuoc Giau Nguyen, was found guilty at his trial of the murder of Khanh Thanh Nguyen, and of shooting at Tri Binh Tran with intent to murder him. Both offences were committed in the course of the same incident, which took place in the early hours of 2 February 2002 at the Pavillion Hotel in George Street, Sydney. On 21 May 2004 I received evidence and heard submissions on the question of sentence. 
     
      
    2 The facts can be stated shortly. In the early hours of Saturday, 2 February 2002 the deceased, Khanh Thanh Nguyen and his friend, Tri Binh Tran were together at the Pavillion Hotel. Also at the hotel were the offender and two of his associates. There is no evidence that the offender and the deceased were known to each other. There is evidence that Mr Tran knew the offender, but it is not clear how well or in what circumstances. Initially, all of them were in a bar and dance floor area on the second floor of the hotel. One of the offender’s associates flicked a cigarette butt at Mr Tran. This led to an argument between those two men, in which the other three became involved. It may be that this escalated into a violent exchange, but the evidence about that is far from clear. 
     
      
    3 A little later, the deceased and Mr Tran left that area and went to a gaming lounge on the first floor. Minutes later, the offender and his two associates also entered the gaming lounge, and the offender confronted the deceased and Mr Tran about what had occurred upstairs. The offender then drew a handgun from his clothing and shot the deceased twice, once in the stomach and once in the lower back. He then shot Mr Tran three times, wounding him in the right shoulder, left hip and left thigh. 
     
      
    4 The offender was restrained by his associates, and they fled from the gaming room and out of the hotel. The deceased, who was lying on the floor, mortally wounded, pulled a handgun from his clothing and handed it to a witness, asking him to “get him back” for him. The witness took the gun to the men’s toilet and deposited it behind a toilet bowl. It was later recovered by police, who found that its magazine was fully loaded. This, of course, was not the weapon used by the offender, which was never found. 
     
      
    5 The deceased died from his wounds later that morning. Mr Tran underwent hospital treatment for his injuries for about a week. 
     
      
    6 One cannot but wonder whether there is a background to this incident not disclosed by the evidence. However, I can sentence the offender only on the basis of the evidence which is before me, which establishes no more than that the shooting was the spontaneous product of a confrontation arising from the incident on the second floor of the hotel.  
     
      
    7 The offender was arrested on 20 March 2002 and declined to be interviewed. He did not give evidence at the trial or in the sentence proceedings. The central issue in the trial was whether he was the gunman.  
     
      
    8 He was twenty-four years old at the time of the offences and is now twenty-seven. He has a disturbing criminal record. Between 1995 and 1996 he was dealt with in a children’s court and a local court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, resisting arrest, some firearms offences and a variety of traffic offences. All these resulted in non- custodial orders. However, in 1998 he was sentenced in the District Court for four counts of robbery in company to terms of imprisonment aggregating seven years, with a minimum term of four-and-a-half years, to date from 4 April 1997.  
     
      
    9 The facts of those offences were extremely serious. The offender and a number of accomplices overpowered a man in his motor vehicle and drove him to a park, where they demanded money. The victim said that he had no money, but could borrow some from his mother-in-law or from a friend. He was then driven to his in-laws’ home, where the occupants were bound and covered with blankets, and money and jewellery were stolen. The original victim was assaulted on several occasions and menaced with a pistol by the offender’s accomplices, although not by the offender himself. The offender was released on parole at the expiration of his minimum term on 3 October 2001 and, accordingly, was on parole at the time of the present offences.  
     
      
    10 His background is sketched in a helpful report of a clinical psychologist, Mr Terry Smith. He has five siblings, and was born and raised in a small town in Vietnam. His father left the family when he was only three years old. His mother did not remarry and the family was very poor. After completing primary school in Vietnam, he migrated to this country with his mother and four of his siblings.  
     
      
    11 Here, he attended high school and obtained a reasonable grasp of the English language. However, he left school at the end of Year 9 because he was bored and wanted to work to support his mother. He felt that he had endured poverty for too long and wanted to enjoy a better life.  
     
      
    12 He had unskilled employment for a time but, unfortunately, he began to associate with unemployed youths who were using illicit drugs to cope with their unemployment. He began to use a variety of drugs himself, although drug abuse does not appear to have become a major problem for him. However, it was through this peer network that he became involved in criminal activity. 
     
      
    13 While he maintained his innocence of the present offences, he expressed to Mr Smith his compassion for the family of the deceased and for Mr Tran and his family. Mr Smith observed of him:  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Nguyen impresses as a young man of at least average intellectual ability with excellent interpersonal skills and more than adequate communication skills. The impression gained was of a confident and assertive man who obviously had the capacity for thoughtful consideration and insight. He did not impress as one who had a ‘chip on his shoulder’.  
        
       
      
    14 He formed a relationship with a girl when he was released on parole, and it seems that he continues to enjoy her support and that of his family. Mr Smith saw his prognosis as being “at a watershed”. He did not think that he required any treatment and considered that, if he were to be provided with any therapeutic assistance, “it would only be in the role of support”. He concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        …it is difficult to make comment on a young man’s adjustment over the medium to longer term when his life has been so strongly influenced by incarceration. The signs are there that he could live a positive life if he makes the right choices.  
        
       
      
    15 As I have said, the offender is to be sentenced on the basis that the offences were not premeditated. However, I am satisfied that he shot the deceased intending to kill him. His counsel did not argue the contrary. So much is apparent from the circumstances and from the fact that he was found guilty of shooting at Mr Tran with intent to murder him, which necessarily entails an intent to kill.  
     
      
    16 It is most disturbing that this young man was carrying a loaded pistol (as it is that the deceased himself was armed in the same way). However, he is not to be sentenced for his possession of that firearm. The use of a weapon is one of the aggravating factors to be found in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: see subs (2)(c). However, it is a factor of limited significance in a homicide, and it cannot be taken into account in aggravation of the offence of shooting with intent to murder because it is an element of that offence: see the concluding words of subs (2). What is significant, however, is that the shooting took place in a public place where other patrons of the hotel were put at risk: subs (2)(i). 
     
      
    17 That the offender was on parole is a serious aggravating factor long recognised in the authorities, and now spelled out in subs (2)(j). Counsel for the offender suggested that I might find, by way of mitigation, a measure of provocation arising from the incident on the second floor: subs(3)(c). However, that incident appears to have been relatively trivial, even if it did involve a violent exchange, and it affords no adequate explanation for his extremely violent conduct. It serves to underline the spontaneous nature of that conduct but does not otherwise mitigate its seriousness. 
     
      
    18 I take into account the offender’s difficult background and, in the light of the psychological report, I think that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. I have considered the question of special circumstances and there is certainly evidence justifying such a finding. However, the aggregate sentence I have in mind is such that any significant departure from the statutory norm would result in an effective non-parole period inadequate to reflect his criminality. Although the two charges arise out of one brief incident, I propose to pass partly cumulative sentences. For that reason only, I shall fix a non-parole period for the murder which is a little less than the normal proportion. The result will be an aggregate sentence which maintains the statutory proportion, but which provides a substantial period of parole eligibility to foster his rehabilitation.  
     
      
    19 Following his return to custody upon his arrest, the offender’s parole was revoked from 2 April 2002 and he has now served the balance of his parole, expiring on 3 April 2004. I shall date the first of the sentences which I propose from the day of his arrest, 20 March 2002. I have not made a quantifiable adjustment to the sentences I would otherwise have passed because two years of his pre-sentence custody is referable to his balance of parole, but I have taken that fact into account in arriving at the appropriate sentences. Although the sentences will be partly cumulative, I have determined the aggregate sentence with an eye to totality. The case is not affected by the 2002 amendments to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act altering the structure of sentences and introducing standard non-parole periods. 
     
      
    20 Phuoc Giau Nguyen, on the charge of shooting at Tri Binh Tran with intent to murder him you are sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years, to date from 20 March 2002. I decline to set a non-parole period in respect of that sentence because of the sentence I am about to pass for the other charge. For the murder of Khanh Thanh Nguyen you are sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years, with a non-parole period of 14 ½ years, to commence on 20 March 2004. The aggregate sentence, then, is imprisonment for 22 years, with a non-parole period of 16 ½ years, dating from 20 March 2002. You will be eligible for release on parole on 19 September 2018.

     REGINA v GUISEPPE MALTESE 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The appellant appeals against his conviction in the District Court of having between 30 May 1990 and 16 August 1990 conspired with Ahmed Dumia and other unknown persons to commit an armed robbery. The sole ground of appeal is that his conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    2 The appellant pleaded guilty to the offence on 3 November 1992 and on 1 December 1992 was sentenced by Judge Shadbolt to a term of 12 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. In passing sentence his Honour had regard to a further offence of possessing a loaded firearm which was intimately connected with the principal offence. The appellant completed his sentence on 10 December 1993. At the time of the alleged offence the appellant had just turned 19. His only prior conviction was for a driving offence which attracted a fine.  
     
      
    3 The appellant seeks to challenge his conviction notwithstanding the fact that he pleaded guilty to the offence. In those circumstances, it is necessary to have regard to the proceedings which took place before Judge Shadbolt. Unfortunately neither the transcript of the proceedings nor his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence are still available.  
     
      
    4 However the appellant has sworn an affidavit in these proceedings to which is annexed a copy of the Crown brief in the matter. The appellant also relies upon an affidavit sworn by counsel who appeared on his behalf before Judge Shadbolt. The Crown’s instructing solicitor has also sworn an affidavit to which is annexed a body of material. I will refer to some parts of that material in due course.  
     
      
    5 Of particular significance for present purposes is a signed record of interview between the appellant and a person who will be referred to as M5 for the purposes of these proceedings. In that interview which is dated 15 August 1990 the appellant made full admissions to the offences in question. He is also recorded as having admitted to police prior to the interview that he had planned to commit an armed robbery with Dumia on the Shell Service Station at East Roseville. His explanation as to how he had planned to commit the offence was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        I have been hangin (sic) around with Ahmed for a couple of months… I wanted some money to buy a car because I was sick of drivin (sic) mine. I knew that Ahmed had been caught doin(sic) armed robberies so I started talking to him about doin (sic) one, so I could get the money. I was lookin (sic) at doing the Shell, I had watched it a couple of times. I knew how to get away, down into the industrial area at the back…Well, I was just watchin (sic) the place, I knew they had a safe in the work shop…I thought that they had about thirty five grand in the safe. 
        
       
      
    6 During the interview the appellant was recorded as having been shown the transcript of an intercepted telephone conversation between himself and Dumia on 12 July 1990. He admitted that they had been discussing robbing the Shell Station in that conversation. He also admitted that he had obtained a revolver with which to commit the robbery. He also agreed that he had led police to where he had hidden it in bushland in East Roseville. The appellant was asked why he had hidden it there and he was recorded as replying “I was worried that if I had it at home, mum and dad might find it and then I would be in the shit. It’s a good spot nobody goes there.” He said that he and Dumia had been planning to do the robbery just before the service station closed on a Thursday or Friday evening. 
     
      
    7 In his affidavit the appellant swore that the record of interview was fabricated by the interviewing police officers. He said that he signed the interview because he was terrified. He said that he was desperate to get away from the station after having been struck in the head by M5’s partner. He said that he had been taken by police to bushland near Roseville Bridge where they had dug up a parcel which contained the firearm alleged to be owned by him. He swore in his affidavit that he had never previously seen the firearm and that he had not directed police to the place where it had been located. 
     
      
    8 The appellant went on to say that he had instructed lawyers to appear on his behalf at a contested committal hearing which occupied three days of hearing time in 1991. We have been provided by the Crown with the transcript of those proceedings and it is clear that the voluntariness of the record of interview was put in issue at the time. Moreover a file note made by a solicitor employed by the Director of Public Prosecutions indicates that counsel for the appellant had subsequently foreshadowed that the record of interview would be challenged at the trial.  
     
      
    9 The appellant said that he had changed his plea to one of guilty because “the judge and my legal representatives indicated I could not successfully defend the charge having signed a confession. The trial, on the advice of my lawyers, was by judge alone. The judge, after reading the record of interview, expressed a preliminary view”. The appellant swore that he was not guilty of the offence. He said that it was entered “in response to the situation I was then confronted with and how I might secure the best result, that is, the best sentence in the circumstances”.  
     
      
    10 The appellant gave evidence at the Police Integrity Commission in June 2002. The court has been provided with a transcript of his evidence. It is consistent with what he said in his affidavit although he provided greater detail in his evidence. He said, for example, that after he signed the record of interview he was told by one of the senior officers involved in the investigation that because he had co-operated, he would get bail. He was in fact released on bail after being charged. He said that after the judge expressed his view as to the significance of the signed confession, he had been advised by his barrister to change his plea because “he said we had no chance”. His barrister also advised him that “if you go in there and plead guilty he’ll give you a lenient sentence” which he understood to mean something other than a full-time custodial sentence. As I have said the appellant did not receive a full-time custodial sentence, and in the circumstances, it would appear that considerable leniency was extended to him.  
     
      
    11 Counsel who appeared at the trial supported the appellant’s version of events. In his affidavit he swore that: 
     
      
       
        
        I told Mr Maltese that upon his trial the jury would assess the evidence of the prosecution and defence. On the one hand there were three police detectives who would swear that the record of interview was properly conducted and that he was not threatened or forced to adopt it. I recall explaining to him that I might be able to break them all down in cross-examination so that they would admit that they were lying and that his version was correct. I cautioned him, however, that I had never seen police make such admissions. Alternatively, we may be able to weaken their testimony enough to create suspicion in the jury’s mind, and create a reasonable doubt. However, I was not confident that we could achieve that either. I explained to Mr Maltese that he did not have any witnesses to support his version of events, there were three experienced detectives with no pressing reason to lie given that the young man was not very articulate and, in my opinion, would not make a very good witness. I explained that the percentage chance of being acquitted was in the order of about one percent. 
        
       
       
        
        I then advised Mr Maltese of the probability of receiving a full-time custodial sentence of perhaps two to five years if he were to be found guilty by the jury. He was extremely concerned about serving a gaol sentence and asked what his options were. Whilst advising Mr Maltese with respect to his options I told him that if he were to plead guilty he had a good chance of avoiding a full-time custodial sentence. Mr Maltese instructed us to enter a plea of guilty on his behalf. I did so and recall that I was very restricted in what I was able to say to the Court.  
        
       
      
    12 Although, as I have said, the transcript of the proceedings before Judge Shadbolt is not available, the Crown has been able to retrieve some material from its files including notes made at the time by the instructing solicitor for the Crown. This material also provides corroboration for the appellant’s version of events. It would appear from that material that the appellant originally pleaded not guilty at his trial. M5 commenced giving evidence but his evidence was interrupted by legal argument. It is unnecessary to refer to the details of that argument. Suffice it to say that during the course of it, counsel for the appellant indicated that submissions would be made concerning pressure which had been placed upon the appellant in relation to the record of interview and what was said in it. Nevertheless counsel indicated that he would not be challenging the admissibility of the interview. That apparently prompted the trial judge to indicate that if the interview was not to be challenged, then the appellant may need to change his plea as the trial judge did not want to see the appellant deprived of the advantage of a discount for a plea of guilty. The appellant thereafter changed his plea to guilty. The impact of such an indication from the presiding judge must have been profound. See R v KCH (2001) 124 A Crim R 233 at 239. 
     
      
    13 More importantly, there is support for the appellant’s version of events in the evidence given by M5 at the Police Integrity Commission. He said that he had informed his superior officer that he had reservations, having spoken to the appellant, as to whether the appellant was involved in any of the armed robbery offences which police were then investigating. He said that he was told by his superior to “load him [the appellant] with a firearm”. As a result of that advice, he and another detective took the appellant to the Roseville Bridge area. They had with them a firearm which they had obtained from the police station. At the scene, they had dug up the firearm and had photographed the appellant in possession of it. M5 gave evidence that those parts of the interview, which attributed to the appellant admissions as to having possessed the firearm and to the appellant having admitted leading police to where it was located, were fabricated. He also said that the other detective had struck the appellant over the head with an old map and that the appellant had as a result signed the interview “under duress”. M5 was unable, given the passage of time, to recall whether or not the rest of the record of interview was fabricated in its entirety. He indicated, however, that there was information that appeared in it which was known to police at the time. He accepted that it was quite possible that the balance of the interview, or at least parts of it, were fabricated as well. As he said “it would stand to reason that that may well have just been done for him”. Although he said that he was no longer able to recall on a question by question basis what had taken place, he did say however that on the whole “most of it wouldn’t have” occurred. 
     
      
    14 He agreed that he had been challenged at the committal hearing about having fabricated the admissions which he alleged had been made by the appellant. He also agreed that he had been challenged about the assault. He said that he had lied when he had given evidence rejecting those accusations. He conceded that he was very surprised and relieved when the appellant pleaded guilty. Finally he agreed with the proposition that, to his knowledge, it was in the circumstances “an improper plea”. 
     
      
    15 For completeness the Crown has also provided the court with transcripts of the evidence given by two other detectives at the Police Integrity Commission. In short each denied any wrongdoing in relation to their involvement in this matter. 
     
      
    16 The Crown case against the appellant also consisted of the intercepted telephone conversation to which I earlier referred between the appellant and the man Dumia on 12 July 1990 and more particularly the admissions allegedly made by the appellant in respect of it. Its significance is obviously affected by the evidence of M5. The Crown had also sought to rely at trial upon several other intercepted conversations between the appellant and Dumia. Those conversations are not capable on their own of providing a sufficient basis upon which to sustain a conviction. 
     
      
    17 The appellant, as I have said, asserts that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The principles to be applied in a case such as the present are not in doubt. In R v Hura (2001) 121 A Crim R 472 Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson J and Carruthers AJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        There are exceptional cases in which this Court will set aside a conviction following a plea. The relevant authorities have recently been considered in this Court in  
        Toro-Martinez 
         (2000) 114 ACrimR 533. A number of circumstances have been identified when this Court will act, notwithstanding a plea of guilty:  
         
        
       
      
    · where the appellant ""did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered"": Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 ACrimR 231 at 233.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · where the plea was not ""a free and voluntary confession"": Chiron (at 220 D-E).  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · the ""plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt"": Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · where there was ""mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt"": Sagiv (1986) 22 ACrimR 73 at 80.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · where the ""plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty ... some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt"": Cincotta (Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60472 of 1995, 1 November 1995).  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · the ""plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt"": Maxwell at 511; 186-187.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · if ""the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt"": Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481. See also Ganderton (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60364 of 1998, 17 September 1998) and Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320.  
     
      
       
        
         
        Particularly pertinent for the present case is a frequently cited passage in the judgment of Badgery-Parker J in  
        Davies 
         where his Honour said:  
         
         
        ""If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction and to order a new trial."" (477-8) 
        
       
      
    18 It is common ground that the fresh evidence should be admitted as it satisfied the relevant tests for its reception. In view of the fresh evidence, and particularly the concessions made by M5 to which I have referred, this Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the appellant’s confession. Accordingly, it is clear that there is a real doubt about the appellant’s guilt.  
     
      
    19 In light of all the evidence I am also persuaded that the appellant’s plea was not entered “as a genuine recognition of guilt”. It is important to recall that this trial took place a number of years ago and the historical context in which it occurred should not be overlooked. In that respect it is helpful to refer to what this court said in R v O’Sullivan [2002] NSWCCA 98, a case which bears considerable resemblance to the present one. Sheller JA, with whom Grove and Simpson JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        The assessment the appellant and those acting for him made, that his evidence would not be accepted over the police evidence that his confession was voluntary, was a sound assessment. In the context of that time and in the absence of anything to undermine the credit of the police officers who apparently were regarded as exemplary officers, the appellant had no chance of avoiding conviction either in the Local Court or the District Court. This is a sad reflection on the way criminal justice was then administered. The plea of guilty was, I am satisfied, induced not by a consciousness of guilt but by a recognition that the confession although given under threat could not effectively be challenged and that conviction was inevitable. The only hope for the accused was to gain some advantage by having the sentence reduced, it was hoped, to a non-custodial sentence if the appellant pleaded guilty. (at para 45) 
        
       
       
      
    20 In all the circumstances I would propose that the appeal be allowed, that the conviction be quashed and a verdict of acquittal be entered. It is to be observed that the Crown very properly indicated that it did not oppose the making of those orders. 
     
      
    21 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    22 BELL J: I agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 10 July 2002, the appellant was jointly indicted with Kim Louise MacDonald (MacDonald) before her Honour Judge Morgan and a jury of 12 persons at Sydney District Court on the following charges to which they both pleaded not guilty: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : That they on 29 January 2001 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales did detain Mary Henderson with the intent to hold her for the advantage of Donald Tolmie and Kim MacDonald, namely, to steal her money. (s 90A  
        Crimes Act  
        1900) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : Further that they on 29 January 2001 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with Mary Henderson without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company with each other. (s 61J(1)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 
        : Further, that they on 29 January 2001 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales then being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a handgun, did rob Mary Henderson of $10, scratch lottery tickets and a black bumbag containing a quantity of money and personal papers, the property of Mary Henderson. (s 97(1)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900). 
        
       
      
    2 On 16 July 2002 the jury returned verdicts of guilty to Count 1 and not guilty to Counts 2 and 3 with respect to both accused. On 5 October 2002 her Honour sentenced the appellant on Count 1 to 12 months imprisonment to commence on 16 August 2001 and to expire on 15 August 2002 with a non-parole period of 9 months to commence on 16 August 2001 and to expire on 15 May 2002. By Notice of Intention to Appeal dated 26 May 2003, but apparently not filed until 21 April 2004, the appellant appealed to this Court against, inter alia, his conviction on Count 1. There is no appeal against his sentence in respect of that conviction as it had long since expired by the time the Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed. 
     
      
    3 The appellant's grounds of appeal are as follows: 
     
      
     (1) The verdict of guilty in relation to Count 1 is unreasonable and cannot be supported in terms of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in light of the not guilty verdicts in relation to Counts 2 and 3. 
     
      
     (2) The trial judge erred in not directing the jury as to the complainant's evidence that, in the event that they rejected the complainant's evidence as dishonest or unreliable in relation to one count, that that finding could impact their assessment of the credibility, with the other evidence, with respect to the other counts. 
     
      
       
      The case for the Crown 
       
      
    4 The Crown's case was that the offences, the subject of the three counts, occurred in the early hours of the morning of 29 January 2001. The complainant, Mary Henderson, had been drinking in the Bourbon & Beef Steak Bar in Kings Cross. After leaving the premises at about 2.00 am, she walked through Springfield Avenue to Orwell Street when she saw a female passenger in a white panel van waving to her. The passenger was MacDonald. The complainant recognised MacDonald by sight as a women she knew as a casual acquaintance around Kings Cross. The driver of the vehicle she recognised as the appellant.  
     
      
    5 The complainant asked whether the appellant and MacDonald would drop her off at a taxi rank nearby in Macleay Street. They agreed whereupon she go into the panel van and sat on MacDonald's lap. There was a lot of junk of the floor of the van and nowhere else for her to sit. Instead of dropping her off around the corner as she had requested, the appellant kept driving telling her in an aggressive manner that she had to wait. The appellant then drove down Macleay Street and into Bayswater Road and the complainant again asked to be let out of the vehicle which was eventually driven into a small laneway behind the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel.  
     
      
    6 At this point MacDonald produced a gun. A struggle ensued and the appellant beat the complainant about the head with the butt of the gun. The appellant then drove off, stopping at Sutherland Crescent, Darling Point whereupon MacDonald put her hand down the complainant's bra and removed therefrom a $10 note and a ""Scratch It"" ticket. At that point the appellant, at the request of MacDonald, sexually assaulted the complainant after which she was pushed out of the van which then left the scene. As she was pushed out of the panel van, she saw her bumbag lying on the floor of the vehicle. It contained the keys to her apartment, just over $100 cash and other personal belongings. One of the accused said ""Oh, there's the bumbag, there it is"". They then drove off with the bumbag still in the van. 
     
      
    7 The complainant cried out for help and was attended by local residents. The police and ambulance were called. The ambulance officer, Ms Solrai, stated that when she arrived at the scene the complainant was distressed, had blood over her face and in her hair. She had a small laceration to the left side of her head and a large lump on her left shoulder blade. She also had glue in her hair which the complainant said was not the case before she got into the panel van. 
     
      
    8 The complainant also gave evidence that on 21 February 2002 she saw the appellant and MacDonald by chance in Redfern. The appellant told her he was not the offender and that it must have been his brother. She noticed that one of his arms was in a sling and he said he could not have been the offender as he had a dislocated shoulder at the time. She also spoke to MacDonald who allegedly apologised for what had happened in January.  
     
      
       
      The appellant's case 
       
      
    9 Both the appellant and MacDonald gave evidence at the trial. The appellant said that he arrived in Kings Cross from the Central Coast on his way to his father-in-law's place in southern Sydney. He was with MacDonald who wished to make a diversion through Kings Cross for the purpose of purchasing drugs. They were not driving a panel van but a silver four door Commodore sedan belonging to MacDonald's father. It had the usual front and rear seats and was not filthy, dirty or full of junk as the complainant had suggested. 
     
      
    10 Whilst driving through Roslyn Street, Kings Cross, the appellant said that they were approached by the complainant who then got into the front seat of the car and sat on MacDonald's lap. Both the appellant and MacDonald said that the complainant got into the vehicle to sell drugs to MacDonald, which the complainant denied. MacDonald said the complainant asked the appellant to drive to Rushcutters Bay because she did not want to engage in a drug transaction in Kings Cross. Allegedly an argument development during the journey over a previous drug transaction a couple of weeks earlier. MacDonald claimed that she paid the complainant for the drugs but did not receive any. She said the vehicle stopped in Rushcutters Bay because she was fighting with the complainant. It was a physical fight with punches being traded between them.  
     
      
    11 At this point the appellant had driven the vehicle to New Beach Road, Rushcutters Bay. He became annoyed at the arguing between the claimant and MacDonald and stopped the car to remonstrate with them. He was then instructed to drive to a point near St Andrews Church (which was, in fact, intended as a reference to St Marks Church in Darling Point Road). As the fighting got worse the appellant stopped the vehicle, opened the passenger door and the complainant and MacDonald both fell out onto the street. MacDonald then returned to the car and the appellant asked the complainant if she wanted a lift but she declined. He then drove off leaving the complainant standing on the side of the road.  
     
      
    12 MacDonald agreed that she had spoken to the complainant in Redfern a few weeks later and that she had said she was sorry. The appellant denied ever speaking to the complainant in Redfern.  
     
      
    13 As will be discussed further below, the evidence of the appellant and MacDonald differed in several respects, including the exact point where the complainant got into the vehicle, where she got out and who asked that the vehicle be driven to Rushcutters Bay. 
     
      
       
      The summing up 
       
      
    14 It was common ground that the critical issue before the jury was its assessment of the complainant as an honest and reliable witness. In her summing up, her Honour (at 5) instructed the jury that whether they could safely act upon the evidence given by a witness depended upon two different but overlapping considerations, namely, the witness's honesty and accuracy. 
     
      
    15 Her Honour then informed the jury that they should ask themselves in respect of each witness whether he or she impressed as a person doing his or her best to tell the truth. She said (at 5): 
     
      
       
        
        ""If you conclude that a witness is a person not doing his or her best to tell the truth you might well conclude that his or her evidence generally is going to be of little assistance to you. If on the other hand you conclude that a witness was doing their best to tell the truth you should then pass on to the second matter which has to be considered, namely, the witness's accuracy and to determinate how accurate a witness is, it is necessary to have regard to a number of matters."" 
        
       
      
    16 After detailing the matters to which regard should be had such as how carefully the witness observed the particular thing about which he or she gave evidence, the fact that some things are of such a nature that the observer is likely to retain an accurate recollection of them whereas, at the other extreme, if they are trivial or unimportant it is unlikely that they would be remembered accurately, the consistency of the given account being an indication of reliability, her Honour said this (at 7): 
     
      
       
        
        ""In relation to accepting the evidence of a witness, you are not obliged to accept the whole of the evidence of any one witness. You may if you think fit accept part or reject part of that witness's evidence. The fact that you do not accept portion of a witness's evidence because you do not believe it, does not mean that you must reject the whole of that witness's evidence. It does not mean that you cannot or should not accept the remainder of that evidence if you think it is worthy of belief."" 
        
       
      
    17 Her Honour then reminded the jury that the accused were entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt in their minds. She reminded them that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the essential elements that made up the charges under consideration. In this respect, she said Count 1 was (at 11): 
     
      
       
        
        ""an allegation that Donald Tolmie and Kim MacDonald detained Mary Henderson for their advantage and that was to steal her money."" 
        
       
      
    18 At 15 the trial judge defined the elements of Count 1 in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The first count has two elements in it, that is, that the accused Mary Henderson, that is to keep or restrain her and secondly that by doing that the accused intended to hold her for their advantage and that was, the Crown alleges to steal Mary Henderson's money."" 
        
       
      
    19 The trial judge then (at 15-16) summarised the Crown's case in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The evidence was given by Ms Henderson that when she got into the car, she had asked for a lift and they had agreed to that, but when she wanted to get out at a particular point where she said she asked to be let out, that the accused Tolmie who was driving the car, put his foot down on the accelerator and drove around down Bayswater Road then into the back of the laneway which she said turned into the right down the back of the, what was then the Hyatt and again made another left turn down into a further back lane and that she was restrained from getting out, she made attempts to get out of the car and she was restrained until finally she was thrown out of the car. If you found she was being asked for money and attempts were being made to try and take money or find money, if you found that that happened as Miss Henderson has said, those elements would have been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown, that is that the accused detained her with the intention of holding her for their own advantage, and that was to take money."" 
        
       
      
    20 Her Honour then explained to the jury the elements of Counts 2 and 3. She instructed them (at 16-17) that the action of the appellant in placing his finger inside the complainant's vagina would amount to sexual intercourse at law and that if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that occurred, they would also need to be satisfied that the complainant did not consent to that act. She said that if the jury accepted that the alleged conduct took place, they would have little doubt about the fact that the complainant did not consent thereto.  
     
      
    21 As to Count 3, being the charge of armed robbery, her Honour instructed the jury (at 18-19) that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was armed with an offensive weapon and that he was so armed at the time the complainant was robbed. She emphasised on a further two occasions that the robbery must have taken place at the time the accused were armed with a gun. As to the evidence said (at 19): 
     
      
       
        
        ""You have heard the evidence given by Miss Henderson that she had a bum bag with her, that as she was being thrown out of the car she saw it, it was on the floor, she tried to grab it, she wanted the bag and it was taken and she never saw it again."" 
        
       
      
    22 I interpolate here that it was the complainant's evidence that the gun was produced originally by MacDonald and then, after a struggle, she was beaten about the head with it by the appellant when the panel van stopped in the lane behind the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel. However, it was also her evidence that she was robbed of the $10 note and the ""Scratch It"" ticket by MacDonald after the vehicle had been driven by the appellant to Sutherland Crescent, Darling Point, which is also where the alleged sexual assault took place: see T.14-15, 10.7.02. That is although the gun was produced in the lane behind the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel, there was no evidence relating to the gun at the location or time of the robbery at Darling Point. 
     
      
    23 Her Honour then summarised in more detail the evidence on each of the counts and in respect of Count 2 alleging sexual intercourse without consent, she reminded the jury (at [29)) that it had been submitted that when the complainant had spoken to the police officers in Darling Point, she had said nothing about being sexually assault notwithstanding that that assault had allegedly taken place just before she was pushed out of the vehicle. Her Honour continued in these terms (at 29-30): 
     
      
       
        
        ""You recall her evidence was that she could not say whether she had said anything to the police when she was taken to hospital. She said that she could not recall whether she told police first, or whether she told someone at the hospital. She said that she thought it would have been a female because of the difficulty at that stage of speaking to a man about what she said had happened. But she also said that at the time she did speak to the police at Darling Point she was extremely distressed, she was in shock and she really could not quite remember what she had told the police at that stage. She did make a statement about 12 hours after the police had first spoken to her, that was 3 o'clock in the morning … She was in hospital obviously for some time receiving treatment and after she left the hospital she went or was taken to Kings Cross Police Station where Detective Bell saw her at 3 o'clock in the afternoon … She made her statement and it would seem, because there has been no suggestion otherwise by counsel for the accused, that it was at that time she told the police about the sexual assault that had been committed upon her by the accused."" 
        
       
      
    24 The trial judge then referred to the submission of counsel that the delay of some 12 hours in the complainant's making of a complaint about being sexually assaulted was inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person as a consequence whereof the jury should regard her evidence that she was sexually assaulted as false. Her Honour reminded the jury that the delay in making a complaint may indicate fabrication but does not necessarily do so. 
     
      
    25 Critically, for present purposes, the trial judge then instructed the jury as follows (at 31-32): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Because at the heart of this trial, and for the Crown's witness, is Miss Henderson. You must accept beyond reasonable doubt what she has told you occurred and which gave rise to these charges being brought against each of the accused. If you have a reasonable doubt about her evidence relating to what she says occurred to her going to the charges themselves, obviously you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved its case. 
        
       
       
        
        Again I remind you that you can accept part and reject part of all witnesses' evidence but for the essential elements of this matter the Crown relies, and can only rely, on the evidence given by Miss Henderson. So you must look at her evidence very carefully and scrutinise it with care before you act upon it because you must be satisfied of its truth and reliability. And that is a matter which you would consider in that light."" 
        
       
      
    26 The trial judge then referred (at 32) to the lengthy cross-examination of the complainant by counsel for both accused and relevantly to the first count, that it was the case for the accused that the complainant was in Kings Cross for drug dealing, that she had actually approached the accused and got into the car willingly to go off to a drug deal some distance from Kings Cross. Such evidence, her Honour observed, was entirely at odds with the complainant's evidence, she having vehemently denied that anything of the nature suggested in the cross-examination had ever happened.  
     
      
    27 Having again reminded the jury that they were required to scrutinise the complainant's evidence carefully, the trial judge continued in these terms (at 36): 
     
      
       
        
        ""I do not intend to go into everything that was asked of or suggested to Miss Henderson by both counsel on behalf of their respective clients, but you know of course the main thrust of it is that Miss Henderson is lying about what happened for her own purposes and whether it was to hide what it is suggested she was doing that night. So it is a matter for you as I said entirely ladies and gentlemen, the evidence you accept and the evidence you reject in this trial."" 
        
       
      
    28 After referring in some detail to the evidence of the two accused, the trial judge then summarised the submissions of the Crown as well as counsel for each of the accused. The case made by the latter was that the jury would have grave doubts about the complainant's truthfulness. It was asserted that she was not an innocent person who was lured into a vehicle to be robbed but was a drug dealer involved in a deal that went wrong. It was submitted that the jury would not regard her as a witness of truth. 
     
      
    29 At the conclusion of her summing up the jury retired to consider their verdict. Counsel were invited by her Honour to indicate whether there were any matters of fact or law upon which any of them required further instructions to be given but each replied in the negative. That is particularly relevant to the second ground of appeal dealt with below at [55] in that the direction which it is alleged her Honour failed to give but should have given, was not sought by either counsel appearing for the accused. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules therefore precludes it. It is also to be noted that no complaint is made by the appellant with respect to any part of the summing up and, in particular, those portions which I have extracted in the preceding paragraphs. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 1 - The verdict of guilty in relation to Count 1 is unreasonable and cannot be supported in terms of s 6 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act  
      1912 in light of the not guilty verdicts in relation to Counts 2 and 3 
       
      
    30 The appellant submitted that it was clear that the jury rejected so much of the complainant's evidence as was relevant to Counts 2 and 3. In other words, they could not have accepted, at least completely, the account given by her as to what took place in the panel van when she was allegedly sexually assaulted and her money, lottery ticket and bumbag containing money was allegedly stolen. Accordingly, it was submitted that those findings were inherently inconsistent with the jury accepting beyond reasonable doubt the accuracy and reliability of the complainant's evidence that she was detained by the accused with intent to hold her for their advantage, to steal her money.  
     
      
    31 However, it needs to be remembered that the complainant's evidence was that she was driven against her will to the lane behind the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel where she was physically assaulted by the appellant with a gun after which the appellant then drove off. It was not until the appellant eventually stopped the vehicle at Sutherland Crescent Darling Point that, according to the complainant, MacDonald put her hand down her bra, pulled out the $10 note and ""Scratch It"" ticket. Furthermore, it was only after this occurred that MacDonald told the appellant to ""check her cunt and see if she's got any money down there"" whereupon, according to the complainant, the appellant put his hand down her pants and put his finger in her vagina. She was then pushed out of the van and her bumbag remained in the vehicle and the accused refused to return it to her. 
     
      
    32 It may well be that the jury acquitted on Count 3 on the basis that although the complainant was physically assaulted with the gun in the laneway behind the Hyatt, the gun was not in evidence when she was robbed of her money at Darling Point. As a consequence of this the jury may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as her Honour had instructed them, that the appellant was armed with an offensive weapon at the time of the robbery. In other words, there was no coincidence between the production of the gun and the robbery, each occurring at different times and in different locations. It is to be noted that for some inexplicable reason no charge was preferred against the appellant or MacDonald with respect to the assault in the laneway behind the Hyatt. Further, and equally inexplicably, Count 3 specifically alleged armed robbery and not robbery in company, which is also prohibited by s 97. 
     
      
    33 Accordingly, it may well be that the jury were not satisfied as the charge required that the appellant was armed with the handgun when the robbery took place at Darling Point in that, at that time, it played no part in the events which allegedly then occurred. If this be so, then the acquittal on Count 3 would not necessarily involve any rejection by the jury of the accuracy or honesty of the complainant's evidence. The point being made – that it was open to the jury to find that the gun played no role in the robbery – should not be confused with the proposition that a person in possession of an offensive weapon, but who is not brandishing the weapon, cannot thereby be guilty of an offence under s 97. Section 97 merely requires the possession of a weapon such that where the victim is aware that the accused is armed, the offence could, circumstances depending, be found proven. 
     
      
    34 The jury's acquittal on Count 2 is more problematic although, as I have pointed out in [22] above, there was a significant delay between the time of the sexual assault and the first complaint by the complainant to any person in authority. The evidence established that the complainant did not tell the police (or the ambulance officer) at the scene that she had been sexually assaulted. She did say that the worst of the physical incidents was being knocked about in the car with the gun which occurred in the laneway behind the Hyatt. She said that the reason she did not tell anyone about the sexual assault was that she was in shock and did not want to talk to a male about it although the evidence established that she was alone with the female ambulance officer (Ms Solrai) on the way to St Vincent's Hospital. 
     
      
    35 Accordingly, there was a basis upon which the jury may well have had a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the complainant's evidence with respect to this charge. But it does not follow that that doubt went so far as to justify the conclusion now pressed upon us by the appellant that the jury must have rejected her evidence as so unreliable and/or lacking any element of truth that their apparent acceptance of her evidence with respect to Count 1 was so infected as to be unreasonable or unsupportable. 
     
      
    36 As I have emphasised, no charge was preferred against the appellant with respect to his alleged physical assault upon the complainant with the handgun in the laneway behind the Hyatt. Accordingly, in one sense it was unnecessary for the jury to consider whether they accepted or rejected the complainant's evidence on that matter. However, in my opinion, it was open to the jury to convict the appellant on Count 1 simply upon the basis that they accepted her evidence that, after she had requested the appellant and MacDonald to let her out of the car when it was in Macleay Street, they refused and thereby detained her for what could only, sensibly and logically, be for their own advantage, namely, because they intended to steal her money.  
     
      
    37 As I have already observed, the jury may well have considered that the complainant's money was stolen but that Count 3 was not established, as the appellant was not armed with his handgun at the time the robbery took place. The trial judge had on a number of occasions directed the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was armed with an offensive weapon and that he and his co-accused robbed the complainant at that time. In other words, it is quite possible the jury were not satisfied of the coincidence of time which that direction required. However, they may still have accepted that her money was stolen and that would be sufficient for the purpose of the second element of Count 1. My point is that there is a logical explanation for the jury's acquittal of the appellant on Count 3 which does not necessarily involve their rejection of the reliability and accuracy of the complainant's evidence that her money was taken. 
     
      
    38 The appellant's submission to this Court was encapsulated by Adams J during argument by the following question to which counsel answered in the affirmative: 
     
      
       
        
        ""So does it amount to this, your case is that the only proposed stealing to which the advantage related was the bum bag or possibly what was concealed on her person. The jury disbelieved for whatever reason the complainant about those matters and it must follow then they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was the particularised advantage?"" 
        
       
      
    39 Counsel then summarised his argument in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The case as presented by the Crown relied upon the credibility of Ms Henderson. It also particularised the advantage that was sought in relation to the detaining as being the two counts on the indictment that the jury found the accused not guilty of. Therefore, the jury rejected the advantages that were particularised by the Crown and were the elements of the offence on the count that they convicted upon."" 
        
       
      
    40 It will thus be seen that the appellant's case depended on acceptance of the submission that the jury simply disbelieved the complainant that money, whether from her person or her bumbag, was stolen from her so that even if she was detained (which was not seriously disputed), it was not for the advantage particularised in the charge. However, for the reasons adverted to above, I do not consider that the jury's acquittal on Count 3 was necessarily or inevitably based upon their rejection of the complainant's credibility or reliability as a witness. 
     
      
    41 The appropriate test for determining whether a verdict is unreasonable or unsupportable within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, was authoritatively stated by the High Court in MFA v The Queen (2002) 77 ALJR 139 at 144 [25] and 155 [97]. In so doing the justices accepted that that test was as formulated by the majority of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 (and applied by that court in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 452): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, the court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 
        
       
      
    42 In MFA the High Court approved a number of principles enunciated in MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366-368 in respect of the application of the test in circumstances where the unreasonableness is said to lie in factually inconsistent verdicts of the jury. Thus, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ stated the following (at 145-146 [34]): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in  
          MacKenzie 
          . They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, ever juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence.  
          In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. 
           In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in  
          R v Kirkman 
          , and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed."" (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 Their Honours then went on (at 146 [35]) to reject as erroneous the proposition that where multiple offences are alleged involving the one complainant then verdicts of not guilty on some counts necessarily reflect a view that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable, and that an appellate court should consider the reasonableness of guilty verdicts on the basis that the complainant is a person of damaged credibility. Their Honours thus emphasised (at 146 [36]) that the test established by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is unreasonableness, not inconsistency. 
     
      
    44 McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in their joint judgment in MFA also referred to the principles in MacKenzie noting that the instant case was not one where ""logic and reasonableness"" necessarily dictated a common approach to the several verdicts concerned. At 154 [85] they continued in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In judging suggested inconsistency, this Court said in  
        MacKenzie 
         that 'if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted'. The Court cited with approval the remarks of King CJ in  
        R v Kirkman 
         to the effect that juries may not always act 'in accordance with strictly logical considerations' or even 'in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them'. Juries sometimes give effect to 'their innate sense of fairness and justice' as well as to their sense of proportion and compassion."" 
        
       
      
    45 Their Honours acknowledged (at 154 [86]) that cases do arise where different verdicts returned by a jury represent ""an affront to logic and common sense"" and suggest a compromise in the performance of the jury's duty. However, for the reasons to which I have referred, I do not consider that the jury's conviction of the appellant on Count 1 can be described this way. I have already explained why I consider that the jury's acquittal of the appellant on Count 3 was not necessarily related to any disbelief of the complainant's evidence. So far as Count 2 is concerned, the remarks of the Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ, which I have emphasised in [40] above, are clearly apposite to the present case. There was no objective evidence of digital penetration and that, coupled with the delay in complaint, may well have caused the jury to be cautious in finding the offence proven beyond reasonable doubt. As their Honours observed, such an approach does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. Something additional may well have been required by the jury but was absent. 
     
      
    46 Nevertheless, the appellant relied upon the following passage for the majority judgment in M (at 494): 
     
      
       
        
        ""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
        
       
      
    47 In my opinion, the evidence of the complainant did not lack credibility in the sense referred to in the above-cited passage. A careful reading of the transcript leads me to the conclusion that the complainant gave her evidence clearly and forcefully. When cross-examined by counsel for the appellant she said, and in fact volunteered, that after she was pushed out of the panel van her recollection was not that coherent (at T.15); that she was in shock (at T.17) particularly when the police and ambulance arrived (at T.89-90). She volunteered (at T.43) that  
     
      
       
        
        ""after the events in the laneway everything became very blurry because I was hit that many times up the head with the gun, I had, was sort of semi-conscious"" 
        
       
       
      and that she remembered being covered in blood and kicked out of the vehicle.  
       
      
    48 Again, (at T.48) she said that when spoken to by the police at Darling Point she was confused, having been hit over the head about 20 times with the butt of the gun and sexually abused. She said (at T.87) that she had suffered from concussion and that when the appellant drove off from the laneway behind the Hyatt, she was ""struggling"" and that ""it becomes a littler vaguer because I was hit quite a few times in the head"".  
     
      
    49 By the time the police arrived she was ""well and truly in shock"" (at T.90) and the ambulance officer, Ms Solrai, confirmed the fact that she was ""pretty distraught"". 
     
      
    50 It was the evidence of Detective Senior Constable Ahrens, who attended the scene at Darling Point, that at that time the complainant informed him that she had asked for a lift which was agreed to, that she had got into the vehicle, that they had driven towards Darlinghurst near the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel when the appellant turned into a nearby lane, stopped and produced a pistol. He then bashed the complainant several times with the butt of the pistol asking the complainant for money. She described the vehicle as a ""utility panel van which was light in colour"". The evidence of both D.S.C. Ahrens and Ms Solrai was that they observed a glue-like substance in her hair, which the latter said, smelt like wood glue. D.S.C. Ahrens also recorded in his notebook that the appellant had taken the complainant's black leather bumbag containing $70-$80 cash, makeup, a comb and her pension card. There is no reference in the notebook to a sexual assault or to the taking of the ""Scratch It"" card and money from her bra. 
     
      
    51 Further, a careful consideration of the complainant's cross-examination leads me to the conclusion that it was entirely consistent with her evidence in chief. Moreover neither counsel for the accused was able to make any inroads into her credibility.  
     
      
    52 On the other hand, the appellant gave evidence that he agreed that his memory was not good and that he was going to Kings Cross on the night in question to obtain drugs for himself and that MacDonald was going to get drugs for herself. Both denied there was any glue in their vehicle, asserting that it was not a panel van but a four door Holden Commodore sedan and that it was fairly clean inside. Neither of them could suggest any reason why the complainant could not have sat in the rear of the vehicle if it was as they described. Neither of them suggested to her that she should; they both stated that she jumped into the front of the vehicle and sat on MacDonald's lap. The appellant (at T.138) said that there would be no reason for glue to be in the vehicle and that there was no smell of glue. 
     
      
    53 There are also a number of inconsistencies in the stories of the appellant and MacDonald. For instance, it was suggested to the complainant in cross-examination by MacDonald's counsel that it was she who said after they got into the van that they should go to Rushcutters Bay, whereas the appellant said that it was MacDonald. Further, the version of the appellant and MacDonald as to what occurred was entirely at odds with that of the complainant. As the appellant submitted, the only agreed fact was that the complainant got into the appellant's vehicle voluntarily. That was consistent with both their versions. On the other hand, MacDonald admitted that she lied in her interview to the police (at T.198-9 and T.203) and maintained her lie of not having been at Kings Cross at all on 29 January until the trial. She only changed her story at the start of the trial. Furthermore, a reading of the appellant's cross-examination at T.46 [46] – T.147, T.158 reveals that it was unsatisfactory in a number of respects. Accordingly, in my opinion, a careful reading of the transcript would not cause me to experience a doubt with respect to the credibility of the complainant. 
     
      
    54 It may well be, as the Crown submits, that the jury acquitted on Counts 2 and 3 on the basis that the complainant was not, due to her injuries and the shock of the incident, a sufficiently reliable witness as to the events that occurred inside the van when it stopped at Rushcutters Bay or Darling Point so as to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt that the robbery and/or sexual assault occurred. As I have already indicated, there is in my opinion, a different explanation for those verdicts that does not lead to the conclusion that the jury must have disbelieved the complainant or lacked confidence in her reliability or truthfulness.  
     
      
    55 In any event, the jury must have found the complainant a credible witness as to the fact that she was taken to Darling Point against her will. The verdict on Count 1 must have involved the rejection by the jury of the evidence of the appellant and MacDonald that the complainant was a willing traveller in the vehicle. The inconsistencies in the evidence of the two accused with respect to where the complainant got into the car and where she was left and the difficulty of accepting that the appellant was driving a four door silver Commodore when it was common ground that the appellant, for no reason that the two accused could proffer, sat upon MacDonald's lap throughout the journey, indicates that it was at least open to the jury not to accept the evidence of the accused. There were other inherently unbelievable facts relating to how the complainant ended up with glue and bits of metal in her hair as well as the reason proffered by the accused as to why the drug deal was to take place away from Kings Cross, a well known location for drug dealing. As the Crown submitted, it would have been a simple matter for drugs and cash to be exchanged in the lane behind the Hyatt without attracting any unwanted attention.  
     
      
    56 Accordingly, in my opinion, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty on the first count. Further, in my view, the verdicts can be logically reconciled. Accordingly, the appellant has not satisfied me that the jury's verdict of guilty on Count 1 was either unreasonable or unsupportable as a consequence of the not guilty verdicts with respect to Counts 2 and 3. It follows that within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, there has been no miscarriage of justice in the jury's finding of guilty on the final count with the result that the appellant's challenge thereto should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 2 – Her Honour erred in not directing the jury as to the complainant's evidence that, in the event that they rejected evidence as dishonest or unreliable in relation to one count, that finding could impact their assessment of the credibility, with the other evidence, with respect to the other counts. 
       
      
    57 As I have observed, r 4 applies to this ground which is founded upon what is referred to as the Markuleski direction. In R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at 122, Spigelman CJ, with whom Carruthers A-J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""191 The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant's evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant's evidence with respect to other counts. 
        
       
       
        
        195 Nevertheless, the jury did not have its attention expressly directed to the proposition that reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant's evidence on any count, ought to be taken into account on the complainant's credibility generally."" 
        
       
      
    58 Earlier, the Chief Justice had said this (at 121 [186]): 
     
      
       
        
        ""186 In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant's evidence with respect to any count."" 
        
       
      
    59 However, although the Chief Justice considered (at 121 [187]) that such a direction should be given ""as a general rule"", he also made clear that its absence was not necessarily fatal. He continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Furthermore, as the joint judgment in  
        Crofts 
         affirmed, the 'general rule' does not apply 'where the peculiar facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest a need for a warning to restore a balance of fairness'."" 
        
       
      
    60 Wood CJ at CL at 134 [257] also suggested that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… there is merit, as a matter of common sense, in reminding the jury that the existence of a question mark in their minds concerning the credibility, or reliability of the evidence given by a complainant or central witness in relation to one count, may properly be taken into account, in conjunction with all the other circumstances of the case, when they consider the reliability or credibility of the evidence of the complainant or witness in relation to the other counts."" 
        
       
      
    61 However, his Honour made it clear (at 135 [263]) that, depending on the circumstances, it may not be necessary for such a direction to be given at all. His Honour referred to the danger of evermore directions and warnings to the repertoire of a trial judge and that, in effect, such a direction need only be given where it is necessary to ensure ""a balance of fairness"" (at 136 [265]).  
     
      
       
      Grove J, who dissented in the result, referred to what the Chief Justice had said in these terms (at 138): 
       
       
        
        ""279 Nevertheless he concluded that it is  
        desirable 
         to supplement the direction as to treating each count separately in a word against word case and that reference  
        ought 
         to be made to the effect on credibility if the jury found itself unable to accept the complainant's evidence on any one count. I recognise, as his Honour does, that the absence of such a direction would not necessarily be fatal but a final conclusion was: 'The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt that they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant's evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant's evidence with respect to other counts'.  
        
       
       
        
        280 It is self evident that a trial judge must make a decision whether to give such an indication before it is known whether the jury will discriminate in its verdicts upon separate counts. Whilst I consider that it would be prudent to give such a direction in some cases I am apprehensive that language incorporating the concept of cruciality will be interpreted as mandatory. For my part I would refrain from expression in any terms which might be so interpreted. There may be cases in which it could be necessary to assist a jury by way of an instruction such as is under discussion but in some way it may not. In my view it would suffice to commend the matter for consideration of trial judges."" 
        
       
      
    62 The appellant submits that the closest the trial judge came to giving such a direction was in the passage from her summing at p.32 which was a repetition of what her Honour said at page 7 of her summing up: see [15] above.  
     
      
    63 However, as the Crown submits, the trial judge made it clear to the jury that as the Crown relied only on the evidence of the complainant, it was required to scrutinise that evidence carefully before acting upon it as they had to be satisfied of its truth and reliability.  
     
      
    64 Although there was no direction of the kind to which the Chief Justice and Wood CJ at CL referred in Markuleski, nonetheless her Honour did remind the jury in some detail of the arguments of both defence counsel to the effect that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of the complainant in respect of any of the counts.  
     
      
    65 The Crown thus submits that the present case was one in which a Markuleski direction was not required. It submitted that the factors to be taken into account in relation to Counts 2 and 3 were different from those in relation to Count 1. In particular, the claimant had not been injured at the time she was first detained against her will so that the reliability of her evidence on Count 1 was not affected by reason of her subsequent injuries. There was, it was contented, other circumstantial evidence which supported Count 1 that was not relevant to Counts 2 and 3 such as the evidence of the two accused that she did get into the vehicle with them on the night, that she was left at Darling Point as well as the unchallenged evidence of her injuries, the evidence of the glue in her hair, her distress and her immediate complaint to the police about being detained. 
     
      
    66 Furthermore, as Adams J observed during the course of argument (at T.8 and 22), as there was no direction by the trial judge that the jury should consider each count independently, common sense would indicate that the jury if they disbelieved the complainant on one aspect of her evidence, would use that disbelief in assessing her credibility generally. 
     
      
    67 In my opinion, the requirement of fairness to the appellant did not, in the circumstances and particularly in light of the trial judge's otherwise unchallenged summing up, necessitate a direction of the nature of that contended for by the appellant in order to ensure a balance between fairness to the appellant on the one hand and to the prosecution on the other. In my view, leave pursuant to r 4 should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    68 In my opinion, the appellant has failed in his challenges to his conviction on Count 1. His appeal against conviction should therefore be dismissed. 
     
      
    69 HULME J: In this matter I have read the Reasons for Judgment of Tobias JA. I agree with the order proposed by his Honour, with his Honour’s reasons concerning ground 2 and with his Honour’s statements of principle in relation to ground 1. I wish however to record my own reasons for concluding that the jury’s verdicts of not guilty in respect of counts 2 and 3 do not render the Appellant’s conviction on count 1 unreasonable. 
     
      
    70 As Tobias JA has pointed out, there was a deal of evidence independent of Mary Henderson tending to indicate that something untoward and which may well have been along the lines of the first charge, occurred to her on the evening concerned. There was significant corroboration of much, although not all, of those parts of her evidence as were essential to the first charge.  
     
      
    71 So far as the second charge is concerned, her failure to complain at an early stage of the sexual interference which was an essential component of that charge may well have been sufficient to cause or contribute to the jury not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that element of the charge. 
     
      
    72 The same may be said of some elements in the third charge. The $10 and scratch lottery tickets referred to in that charge are not mentioned in the notebook of Detective Ahrens wherein Ms Henderson’s first account of events given on the night is recorded. 
     
      
    73 The third item alleged in the third count to have been stolen, a black bum bag, was mentioned in the Detective’s notes. However Ms Henderson’s evidence as to the taking of this was that as she was being pushed out of the car she saw the bum bag lying on the floor of the car, one of the offenders said something to the effect “there’s the bum bag” her eviction from the car continued and the car took off.  
     
      
    74 In the summing up the jury were directed that: 
     
      
       
        
        "" ‘robbed’ at law is committed where a person, without lawful excuse, takes and carries away property from the person of another, or in that person’s presence, or from under that person’s immediate and personal care and protection, against the will of the other person, either by force or putting that person in fear with the intention of permanently depriving the other of their property. So that at law, ladies and gentlemen, is what robbery means. You have heard the evidence given by Miss Henderson that she had a bum bag with her, that as she was being thrown out of the car she saw it, it was on the floor, she tried to grab it, she wanted the bag and it was taken and she never saw it again."" 
        
       
      
    75 Her Honour’s directions in respect of the third charge were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now the third charge brought by the Crown against the accused is the charge of armed robbery upon Miss Henderson, that is being armed with a hand gun, robbed her of her money in a bum bag containing some money and personal papers. What must be proved and proved beyond reasonable doubt, first of all the accused were armed with an offensive weapon and secondly that at that time they robbed Mary Henderson. 
        
       
       
        
        An offensive weapon at law ladies and gentlemen, a hand gun would amount to an offensive weapon and if you found that such was present it would certainly amount to being “armed with an offensive weapon” whoever was holding it again because of the joint criminal enterprise. And robbed, as I said, at the time that the accused were so armed as alleged by the Crown. If you find that beyond reasonable doubt the next matter you would consider was whether at the time that they were so armed, they robbed Mary Henderson and “robbed” at law is committed where a person, without lawful excuse, takes and carries away property from the person of another, or in that person’s presence, or from under that person’s immediate and personal care and protection, against the will of the other person, either by force or putting that person in fear with the intention of permanently depriving the other of their property. So that at law, ladies and gentlemen is what robbery means. You have heard the evidence given by Miss Henderson that she had a bum bag with her, that as she was being thrown out of the car she saw it, it was on the floor, she tried to grab it, she wanted the bag and it was taken and she never saw it again. Indeed she asked for it back when she said she saw the accused and Miss Macdonald in Redfern some three weeks later, but she has never seen it again and it contained her own personal possessions and some money and that has never been seen again."" 
        
       
      
    76 If one were to accept Miss Henderson’s evidence about the presence of the hand-gun earlier, there being no suggestion that it had been removed from the car in the meantime, I would myself have regarded the Appellant as still being armed with the hand-gun at the time he and his co-offender drove off. I would also have regarded the circumstances as described by Miss Henderson as fulfilling the requirement of “takes and carries away property from the person of another, or in that person’s presence” – terms used by the trial judge in the direction I have quoted.  
     
      
    77 However, given there is nothing to suggest that the hand-gun was in evidence at that stage and the taking was constituted simply by driving off in the car with the bum bag on the floor, I can well understand a layman taking a different view. The circumstances do not obviously fall within the ordinary understanding of an armed robbery. 
     
      
    78 Thus one can well understand a viewpoint that the driving away of the car with the bum bag on the floor after Miss Henderson was outside the car did not constitute the taking and carrying away of property from her person and that it was not at that time under Miss Henderson’s “immediate and personal care and protection” albeit the bag was still in her presence. 
     
      
    79 ADAMS J: I agree with Tobias JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: On 24 November 2003 the applicant was arraigned before Newman AJ on an indictment containing 2 counts: the first a charge of stealing from the person contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act, the second a charge that she had provided false information to police with the intention to hinder an investigation of a serious indictable offence contrary to s 315 of the Crimes Act. The applicant pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced by Newman AJ as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) In respect of the first count and taking into account an offence on a form 1 to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years 
         
         
        (ii) In respect of the second count a sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
        
       
      
    3 Both sentences commenced on 2 October 2002. The offence for the first count was, therefore, to be served totally concurrent with the sentence imposed on the second count. The non-parole period of 3 years commenced on 2 October 2002 and expires on 1 October 2005, the date upon which the applicant will be eligible to be release to parole. 
     
      
    4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed but in submissions sought to restrict the appeal to a consideration only of the sentence imposed for the second count. There are two grounds of appeal: the first contends that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective criminality of the offence in the second count and the second that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty and her expressions of remorse and contrition. 
     
      
    5 There was little dispute as to the factual basis on which the applicant was to be sentenced and the facts can be stated relatively briefly. At the time of the commission of the offences the applicant was living in a de facto relationship with a man named Andrew Frew. Also residing in the same housing complex was a man called Peter Laitinen, who I shall refer to as the deceased. On 2 October the deceased was walking in a laneway near his home when the applicant and Frew approached him. Frew began to abuse the deceased because he believed that the deceased had in some way indicated that he was attracted to the applicant. I should note that Frew suffered from a mental illness. 
     
      
    6 Frew approached the deceased who, either because Frew pushed him or because he tripped whilst trying to escape from him, fell heavily to the ground. Frew then commenced to kick and punch the deceased to his head and upper body area. As a result of this attack the deceased was lying severely injured and unconscious on the roadway when the applicant, who had been standing nearby and witnessed the attack, approached the deceased and took from him a mobile phone and a carton of milk. The applicant and Frew then walked towards their unit and on the way the applicant partially buried the mobile phone in a garden bed. She had taken it from the deceased intending to sell it. 
     
      
    7 Police and emergency services were summoned by neighbours and attended the scene where they found the deceased unconscious and having difficulty breathing. He was conveyed to hospital. 
     
      
    8 About an hour later, police attended the unit where the applicant and Frew resided. On answering the door and being told by police why they were there, the applicant said, “My boyfriend has been assaulted. Two guys beat him up around the corner just before you guys got here”. Frew at that time was seen by police lying on a mattress with what appeared to be fresh injuries to the back of his knuckles and a graze to his torso and right forearm. When asked by police how he obtained these injuries, Frew said that two people jumped him and bashed him. The applicant added her support to this account. Police then arrested Frew. The applicant insisted upon accompanying Frew to the police station where they both refused to answer questions put to them by police. The applicant was then charged with an offence of concealing a serious indictable offence. 
     
      
    9 Later that evening police executed a search warrant at the apartment while the applicant was present. She maintained to police the version that had earlier been given by Frew: that two unknown assailants had attacked him and she made a statement to this effect recorded on the video during the course of the search. She made this statement notwithstanding that the police had cautioned her. During the search the police found the mobile phone partially buried in the garden. 
     
      
    10 During the morning of the next day, 3 October, the deceased died without recovering consciousness. Shortly thereafter both the applicant and Frew were charged with the murder of the deceased. Frew subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter before Justice Newman and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the charge of murder. The Crown then chose not to proceed with the charge of murder against the applicant and she was thereupon arraigned on the charges for which she was sentenced. 
     
      
    11 When she appeared before Newman AJ the applicant asked him to take into account a matter on the Form 1 under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. That offence was a charge of affray alleged to have occurred on 16 August 2002. The applicant had been on bail for this charge when she committed the two offences for which she was sentenced. She was also on bail at the time for another offence for which she was convicted and sentenced after receiving the sentences that are the subject of this appeal. 
     
      
    12 The facts of that matter on the form 1 can also be stated briefly. Again both the applicant and Frew were involved. On 16 August 2002 an argument developed between persons at premises in Warrawong as to the repayment of a deposit of fifty dollars for the purchase of a dog. Two of the disputants left the premises without the money they sought and a short time later returned with the applicant and Frew. A further argument took place during which Frew threw a coffee cup in the direction of the victim resulting in him receiving lacerations and cuts to his face. During the course of this altercation, three windows of the premises were smashed before the applicant, Frew and the others left the area. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was at the time of sentence aged 42. Newman AJ described the applicant as having a “very significant criminal record” and found that there was nothing in her antecedents that would cause the Court to exercise any leniency in sentencing her. She had a criminal record dating back to 1979 and it included offences of dishonesty and violence both to persons and property. She has been sentenced to short periods of imprisonment, the last in December 2002 for offences of dishonesty. 
     
      
    14 Newman AJ had regard to a pre-sentence report and a report from a forensic psychologist, Ms Watson. His Honour found this material indicated that the applicant came from a deprived background and acknowledged that was to take into account the “privations of the applicant’s earlier life in the manner suggested by Wood CJ in both Fernando and Morgan”. His Honour had earlier in his remarks referred to R v Fernando (1990) 276 A Crim R 58 and had quoted from the judgment of Wood CJ in R v Morgan (2003) 57 NSWLR 533. His Honour found that there were special circumstances in determining the length of the non-parole period based upon the considerations discussed in these two decisions. 
     
      
    15 The first ground of appeal contends that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence contained in the second count in the indictment. Newman AJ stated that, when the objective facts are analysed, they revealed “very serious breaches of the criminal law”. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “As far as the charge of hindering investigation is concerned. The fact that she so wholeheartedly supported the bogus accounts of how Frew received his injuries is in my view a breach of the law at the top end of criminal culpability in relation to this offence. I say this particularly because the investigation was one involving unlawful homicide. The prisoner, because she had been present when the homicide took place, was well aware of its circumstances. Admittedly she was covering up her own involvement of the offence at the time but her actions in endeavouring to divert the police investigation into a very serious crime places her criminality under the relevant section at a very high level. 
         
         
        I do not regard her actions as being in any way less than those of the prisoner  
        Derbas 
         who was dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 5 March 2003; see  
        R v Derbas 
         [2003]) NSWCCA 44.” 
        
       
      
    16 Mr Hamill SC takes issue with both his Honour’s general assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence of hindering the investigation committed by the applicant and also his Honour’s specific comparison between the offence committed by the applicant and that committed by the offender in Derbas. He submits that the objective criminality of the offence in the second count could not have justified a sentence towards the maximum prescribed penalty, particularly having regard to the applicant’s plea and the subjective considerations identified in Fernando. 
     
      
    17 In particular Mr Hamill takes issue with his Honour’s reference to the investigation being “one involving unlawful homicide”. He points out that at the time of the applicant’s statements to police, the deceased, although seriously injured was in fact alive. Further, the police, both when they initially attended at the premises and later during the search, indicated to the applicant that they were investigating an assault. 
     
      
    18 Further, Mr Hamill argues that the police investigation in fact was not impeded or hindered by the applicant even though this might have been her intention. The police apparently never accepted the explanations given by Frew for his injuries because they arrested him at the unit on the first visit and, shortly after they arrived at the police station, the police charged him with an offence relating to his attack upon the deceased. The applicant was also charged with an offence at that time which was a further indication that the police did not accept her version of the events either. 
     
      
    19 Finally Mr Hamill argued that there was no parity in the objective seriousness between the offence committed by the applicant and those considered in Derbas when detailed consideration was given to the facts of that case. 
     
      
    20 It seems to me that, had the offence in the second count stood alone, there would be considerable merit in the submission made by Mr Hamill that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive to a very marked degree. For my part with respect, I find little, if any, assistance in the decision of Derbas and certainly I can see no parity between the culpability of the offender in that case and the applicant. Derbas involved the offender organising other persons to degrease a vehicle used in connection with the killing of two persons and the injury of another, in order to get rid of possible evidence linking the vehicle with the killings. There were also attempts made, at the offender’s instructions, to cause it to appear that the vehicle had been stolen prior to the killings. 
     
      
    21 Unlike Derbas, the offence the investigation of which was hindered by the applicant was not homicide. Simply the deceased was not dead at the time of the conversation by the applicant with police. This is not merely a technicality: the simple fact is that the serious indictable offence, although not particularised in the indictment, was an assault, albeit a serious one. The culpability involved in such an offence is not as grave as an offence of homicide or homicides as was the case in Derbas. 
     
      
    22 Further, although the applicant made the statement exculpating Frew on more than one occasion, her conduct was, in my opinion, far removed from that of Derbas in organising other persons to destroy evidence which had the effect, at least, of making the conviction of the shooter more difficult and less likely to succeed. Although both Derbas and the applicant were motivated by misguided loyalty to some other person, that fact in itself, while perhaps not mitigatory, does not indicate that their criminality was of a similar order. 
     
      
    23 With respect, I can see no basis for concluding that the objective seriousness of the offences committed by Derbas was comparable or that the same sentence was warranted. In my opinion the sentence for the offence in the second count is manifestly excessive as a result of his Honour’s erroneous assessment of her criminality as being “at a very high level”. In coming to that view I take into account both the fact that the applicant was on bail at the time she committed the offences that were before Newman AJ and that her criminal record could not afford her any leniency. 
     
      
    24 However, it must be remembered that his Honour was not sentencing the applicant only for the offence of hinder police. The applicant was also to be sentenced for the offence of stealing from a person, an offence that his Honour described as “an action of extraordinary callousness”. In addition Newman AJ was to take into account when sentencing for that offence a charge of affray on the Form 1. His Honour described that matter as a “very serious breach of s 83(C)(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    25 During the course of his remarks his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Consistent with what fell from the High Court in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610 I propose to impose the sentence I believe appropriate to both crimes. I accept the submission that I should deal with the crimes on a concurrent basis. In so doing, having considered the appropriate sentence for each crime, I have then taken into account considerations of totality. I have also taken into account the matter contained in the form 1. 
        
       
       
      The submission as to concurrency of sentences that his Honour accepted was that such an order was warranted because both crimes essentially arose out of the same event. 
       
      
    26 In seems that, in applying the principle from Pearce, Newman AJ must have thought that the total criminality before the court could be encompassed by the sentence to be imposed for the offence of hindering police, notwithstanding that his Honour had previously indicated his view of the seriousness of both the larceny offence and the matter taken into account on the form 1. Unless this were so, his Honour would have been in error in making the sentences for the two offences concurrent notwithstanding that they arose from the same set of facts. It may be that, had his Honour been correct in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the hindering offence, the gravity of that offence was such that it simply overwhelmed the offence on the first count. In that circumstance it would have been appropriate to impose concurrent sentences. 
     
      
    27 But in my respectful opinion his Honour misapprehended the objective seriousness of the offence on the second count and it could not encompass the criminality involved in the larceny from the person offence especially taking into account the matter on the form 1. In those circumstances it was not appropriate to impose concurrent sentences for the two offences notwithstanding that they arose from the same set of circumstances. Although his Honour sought to apply the principle laid down in Pierce, with respect, I believe that his Honour erred in coming to the view that the criminality for the offence in the second count in the indictment could encompass and reflect the criminality for the offence of stealing, especially taking into account the matter on the Form 1. 
     
      
    28 Both parties argued the matter in written submissions on the basis that the appeal related only to the sentence for the hinder police. However, it seems to me that the real issue to be determined is whether the total sentence imposed on the applicant, one of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, was excessive having regard to the criminality with which Justice Newman was concerned. If it was not, then all that is necessary is that the sentences be varied and restructured to arrive at the same result. It would be necessary for this Court to reduce the sentence for the hinder police so that it reflected the objective seriousness of that offence and then order that the sentence be served cumulative upon the sentence for the first count. However, the second ground of appeal attacks the overall sentence imposed by his Honour and should now be considered. 
     
      
    29 The second ground of appeal contends that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty and expressions of remorse. In respect of the plea of guilt his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Giving full weight to her unfortunate background, to which I shall shortly turn, I am of the view that her attitude to the tragic events of 2 October 2002 is not consistent with her being either remorseful or contrite. On the other hand, consistent with what fell from the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Queen v Thomson and Houlton 
         I will allow a discount [of] 15 percent for the utilitarian effect for the plea of guilty. 
        
       
      
    30 The first criticism of this passage is his Honour’s failure to explain why he chose a discount of 15 per cent for what were pleas of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. To understand the argument it is necessary to refer shortly to the history of the matter. I have earlier indicated that the applicant was initially charged with an offence of concealing a serious indictable offence. That is an offence contrary to s 316(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment. However, shortly after the deceased died on 3 October the applicant and Frew were both charged with his murder. The original charge did not proceed further. 
     
      
    31 The applicant and Frew were committed to the Supreme Court on the charge of murder and originally arraigned on that charge. The indictment, dated 6 February 2003, contained an alternative charge in respect of the applicant of aiding, abetting and assisting Frew to commit the murder. The applicant pleaded not guilty to both charges. The matter was stood over to 24 November 2003 for trial. About a week before the trial was to take place the Crown was given some information that led her to believe that the applicant might plead guilty to some offence or other. On the day of the trial, Frew indicated that he was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter. Frew was re-arraigned, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and that plea was accepted in full discharge of the indictment as it related to Frew. The Crown then presented a fresh indictment against the applicant containing the current charges and she pleaded guilty to both. The Crown had previously indicated that if she were prepared to plead guilty to both of the fresh charges, the Crown would not proceed on the original indictment. 
     
      
    32 In that situation it seems to me that the applicant was entitled to consideration of her pleas on the basis that they were made at the first available opportunity. There was no realistic basis upon which it might have been expected that she would offer a plea at some earlier point in time to any charge when the Crown was alleging that she was guilty of murder or at least being an accessory to that offence by Frew. Although the charge of concealing a serious indictable offence was outstanding, there was no likelihood that the Crown would accept a plea to that offence and it is unrealistic to have expected the applicant to offer to plead to it. 
     
      
    33 It is unnecessary for present purposes to examine the vexed question of the utilitarian value of pleas given on the day of the trial to lesser charges after a plea bargain has taken place between the Crown and the defence. It was held in R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 that, simply because a plea of guilty is given at the first reasonable opportunity, it does not follow that the utilitarian value of the plea must be 25 per cent. Trial judges have been urged to consider the discount for a plea of guilty on a realistic and discriminating basis: R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291. There is a discretion involved in determining the discount and an accused has no expectation for any particular discount to be applied in any given situation: R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286. 
     
      
    34 It seems to me that in re-sentencing the applicant and in the somewhat unusual and special circumstances of this case a discount of 25 per cent is appropriate notwithstanding that the plea came some 16 months after the applicant was initially charged. It should not be assumed that I would have allowed the appeal simply on the basis that his Honour determined in the exercise of his discretion that the appropriate discount was 15 per cent. 
     
      
    35 The second asserted error arising from the passage of the sentencing remarks quoted above is his Honour’s finding that the applicant was not remorseful or contrite. This assessment was based upon evidence given by the applicant before Newman AJ during which she described the incident, from which the charges arose, as “an accident”. It is unnecessary in the present case to determine whether his Honour’s assessment of the evidence of the applicant when compared with other statements indicative of her remorse was appropriate. It was a finding his Honour made but one which does not necessarily bind this Court on re-sentencing. If it were necessary to do so, I doubt that I would reach the same conclusion, although I do not have the advantage of seeing or hearing the applicant give evidence. It is unfortunate perhaps that no-one asked her to explain what she meant by her use of the term. But it is sufficient to dispose of the appeal by noting that, having regard to the discount that I believe should be given for the plea and the relative lack of significance that I attribute to the issue of remorse in the present case, it is unnecessary to reach a concluded view about the matter. 
     
      
    36 I am of the opinion for these reasons that the appeal should be allowed and that the applicant should be re-sentenced. I doubt that a sentence of 2 years was sufficient for the larceny offence and taking into account the affray. However, the sentence should not be increased on appeal. I treat that sentence as having been reduced from what would otherwise be appropriate by reason of the fact that the sentence for the second offence is to be served cumulatively upon it: see Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616. Having regard to the subjective matters that Newman AJ took into account and the new discount for the plea, a somewhat lesser overall sentence should be imposed taking into account the progress of the applicant during her period of custody awaiting the resolution of the appeal. As Newman AJ recognised there are special circumstances justifying a reduction in the overall non-parole period. There is also the factor that the sentence for the second count is to be served cumulative upon the first count. 
     
      
    37 I propose that the appeal be allowed in part and the sentence imposed for the second count be quashed. In lieu the applicant should be sentenced to 2 years 6 months to commence from 2 October 2004. There is to be a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 1 April 2005 the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    38 BUDDIN J: I agree with Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon the applicant in the Drug Court by Judge Orchiston on 29 April 2004. There is no complaint as to the length of the sentences imposed by her Honour. Rather, the complaint is that her Honour failed to backdate the sentences to take into account pre-sentence custody served by the applicant amounting to some four months and two days. 
     
      
    2 Unfortunately the matter is somewhat complicated as many of these Drug Court matters are, not the least because of the unusual appeal provisions that attend upon sentences in the Drug Court, depending upon the nature of the offences, and how they might have been dealt with had they not been determined in the Drug Court. 
     
      
    3 I have been greatly assisted in this matter to cut through the somewhat complicated mathematical exercise that has been required by both the submissions of Mr Dhanji, who appears for the applicant, and the Crown Prosecutor, who have eventually come to an agreement as to how the apparent error occurring in the sentencing by Judge Orchiston might be rectified. 
     
      
    4 Notwithstanding that the parties in effect are in agreement as to, firstly, the nature of the error that occurred, and how it might be rectified, I have myself been satisfied that the concessions are appropriate and I ought to determine the matter in the way I intend to do, and therefore can give what I feel are relatively short reasons. 
     
      
    5 The applicant first went into custody on 3 April 2003 for offences of break, enter and steal, goods in custody, stealing a motor vehicle and drive whilst disqualified. Those offences occurred between February and April 2003. The matter was first before Judge Milson in the Drug Court, and he determined upon a sentencing regime designed to no doubt assist the applicant in overcoming his addiction to drugs, which presumably brought him before the Court in relation to these offences. His Honour took a somewhat imaginative view as to how the sentences might be structured, but there was no complaint by the Crown as to the orders made.  
     
      
    6 The sentences imposed by Judge Milson were as follows: firstly, in relation to the offence of drive whilst disqualified, a sentence of two years; in relation to the offence of stealing a motor vehicle, a sentence of twelve months imprisonment; in relation to the offence of goods in custody, six months imprisonment; in relation to two offences of break, enter and steal, two years imprisonment; and in respect of a third offence of that kind, twelve months imprisonment. 
     
      
    7 Judge Milson indicated in determining those sentences that he had taken into account the period served by the applicant in custody for those offences. Judge Milson also indicated that, had he been minded to impose some other sentencing order than the one he had chosen, he would have made the sentence for the break, enter and steal offence committed on 1 April cumulative upon the sentences for the other offences. 
     
      
    8 His Honour imposed the sentences he did and ordered that they be suspended upon the applicant entering into the Drug Court program. Unfortunately, the applicant did not succeed on that program and very shortly after his release, that is on 15 August 2003, found himself returned to custody, having committed further offences whilst on the program. Those offences were as follows: an offence of stealing a motor vehicle, an offence of drive whilst disqualified, and an offence of larceny of some compact discs from the vehicle, the subject of the third charge. All of those offences were committed on 15 August 2003, the date upon which the applicant found himself back in custody. 
     
      
    9 On 28 April 2004 the applicant came before Judge Orchiston and she imposed sentences as follows, and these are sentences imposed in respect of the offences initially dealt with by Judge Milson: firstly, in respect of the drive whilst disqualified, twenty-two months, with a non-parole period of thirteen months, that sentence and non-parole period to commence from 15 August 2003; in respect of the steal motor vehicle offence, ten months fixed term, to date from 15 August 2003; the offence of goods in custody, five months by way of fixed term, that sentence to date from 15 August 2003; the break, enter and steal offence, twenty-two months with a non-parole period of thirteen months, again, the sentence to date from 15 August 2003; break, enter and steal, a sentence of ten months, with a non-parole period of six months, that sentence to date from 15 September 2004; and, finally, for the third offence of break, enter and steal, a sentence of twenty-two months, with a non-parole period of thirteen months, also to date from 15 August 2003. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was also sentenced in respect of the offences for which he found himself back in custody, those committed on 15 August 2003. Those sentences need not long trouble the Court because they were the subject of an appeal to the District Court in accordance with the provisions in the Drug Court Act. Those matters were dealt with in the District Court on 9 August 2004. 
     
      
    11 In respect of those offences the following sentences were imposed: in respect of the offence of drive whilst disqualified, a sentence of eighteen months, with a non-parole period of nine months, to date from 15 March 2005; the offence of steal a motor vehicle, nine months fixed term sentence to date from the same date, 15 March 2005; in respect of the larceny of the compact discs, a sentence of nine months by way of fixed term also to date from 15 March 2005. It should be apparent that the sentences imposed in the District Court were made cumulative upon the sentences imposed by Judge Orchiston. 
     
      
    12 When Judge Milson sentenced the applicant he purported to take into account the period served by the applicant prior to being dealt with by his Honour, being a period of four months and two days. It has been put to me by Mr Dhanji, who is most probably correct, that the sentence actually imposed by his Honour tend to suggest that, notwithstanding he had indicated that he had taken that period into account, he had not done so, because the sentences imposed were the maximum that could be imposed in the jurisdiction that was being exercised by Judge Milson being the jurisdiction of the Local Court. 
     
      
    13 The limit of that jurisdiction is to impose sentences of not more than two years for any one offence, or three years by way of accumulation. However, Judge Orchiston, acting upon the assumption that Judge Milson had taken into account the period in custody, imposed the sentences that I have already indicated. 
     
      
    14 The submission made on behalf of the applicant is that her Honour was led into error, presumably by taking his Honour Judge Milson’s statement at face value, and that, in effect, her sentences indicate that had she taken into account the period of four months and two days that the applicant had served in custody, the sentences imposed upon him exceeded the maximum penalties available for those offences. 
     
      
    15 The Crown accepts in effect the argument put forward by Mr Dhanji, and it seems to me it must be correct. The way her Honour ought to have dealt with the time served in the most simple way, and the most accepted way of showing to a defendant that the period has been taken into account, is to backdate the sentences to a period equivalent to that served in pre-sentence custody. A court is able to make that order notwithstanding that the applicant was not in fact in custody for that period, and it has been common practice in this Court and the District Court generally, to impose sentences commencing on a day on which the applicant was not actually in custody, but in order to make it plain that the Court has reduced the sentence by way of taking into account pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    16 It seems to me that I ought simply to backdate the sentences imposed by Judge Orchiston to a period four months and two days prior to the date of the sentence, and in that way to overcome the error that has been disclosed by the sentence her Honour actually imposed. 
     
      
    17 Therefore, the application for leave to appeal is granted. The sentences imposed by Judge Orchiston in respect of the offences of drive whilst disqualified, steal motor vehicle, goods in custody and two offences of break, enter and steal, which were ordered to commenced on 15 August 2003 are to commence on 13 April 2003. In respect of the offence of break, enter and steal, which was to commence on 15 August 2003, that sentence is to commence on 13 May 2004. The effect of those sentences is that the applicant is to be released to parole insofar as the sentences of Judge Orchiston are concerned on 12 November 2004. However, the applicant in fact is not eligible to be released on that date because of the sentences that were imposed upon him in the District Court. 
     
      
    18 Because I have varied the dates on which the sentences imposed by Judge Orchiston are to commence, and therefore have varied the date upon which the non-parole periods are to conclude, there will have to be some adjustment made to the sentences imposed in the District Court on appeal, in respect of the other matters dealt with by Judge Orchiston. I have power under section 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to vary those sentences, because I have varied the earlier sentences on which those later sentences relied. 
     
      
    19 Therefore, in respect of the offences in the District Court in respect of drive whilst disqualified, that sentence is varied so the non-parole period is to commence on 13 November 2004. The non-parole period in that case will expire on 12 August 2005. In respect of stealing a motor vehicle, the sentence of a fixed term of nine months is to commence from 13 November 2004 and therefore will expire on 12 August 2005. In respect of the larceny of the compact discs, the fixed term of nine months is to also commence on 13 November 2004 and to expire on 12 August 2005.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 SANTOW JA: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of being an accessory before the fact to an armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 ss 97(2), 346. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 25 years imprisonment. 3 On 10 December 2003 the applicant was sentenced by Knight DCJ to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months. The sentence commenced on 18 September 2003. The parole period had attached to it terms and conditions relating to supervision.  
     
      
    4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentence imposed failed to reflect the findings of the learned sentencing judge as to the objective criminality of the applicant. 
         
         
        2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to apply the principle of parity in the circumstances of this case. 
         
         
        3. There were exceptional circumstances applicable to the applicant and relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence which warranted the imposition of a lesser sentence. 
         
         
        4. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the applicant’s assistance to the authorities when determining an appropriate sentence.  
        
       
      
    5 The facts as found by his Honour were: 
     
      
       
        
         
        That in the afternoon of 12 June 2002 [the applicant was] at the home of Ashley Flynn, who was aged seventeen…Brian Hickson, aged fifteen and James Polkinghorn, aged eighteen…Cannabis was consumed and it was then suggested by Mr Flynn and Mr Polkinghorn that they commit a robbery at a pharmacy in Westmead. Mr Flynn told Mr Polkinghorn that he had a vehicle that he could use in the robbery, which in fact was a stolen Holden Commodore.  
         
         
        Mr Flynn and Mr Hickson then cut the sleeves off an old grey sloppy joe and put them on their heads and subsequently cut eye holes in the sleeves that they became makeshift balaclavas. As the offenders were moving to leave the premises Mr Flynn told Mr Polkinghorn that [the applicant was] going to accompany them saying “Kylie is going to be in the second vehicle, she’s going to wait a few streets away so we can dump the Holden and get into her car”. At that time Mr Hickson was in possession of a sawn off .22 calibre rifle and he had approximately two .22 calibre bullets. The four then left Mr Flynn’s home. 
        
       
       
        
        At that time [the applicant] knew that Mr Flynn, Mr Hickson and Mr Polkinghorn were going to commit an armed robbery with the sawn off rifle. [The applicant] went to [her] silver Hyundai XL motor vehicle and drove Mr Ashley Flynn from his home to Westmead. Mr Polkinghorn and Mr Hickson followed [the applicant’s] vehicle in the Holden Commodore. [The applicant] drove [her] vehicle past Dennis Green’s pharmacy at Westmead and parked in Austral Street, Westmead. Mr Polkinghorn parked the Holden Commodore behind [the applicant’s] vehicle, Mr Flynn then got out of [the applicant’s] vehicle and got into the Holden Commodore. Mr Polkinghorn, Mr Hickson and Mr Flynn then drove to a location outside Green’s pharmacy and [the applicant] remained at [her] location in order that [she] could assist the offenders after the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 2.30pm Mr Flynn and Mr Hickson, wearing the makeshift balaclavas entered the pharmacy and Mr Polkinghorn remained in the Holden Commodore. At that time the offenders Flynn and Hickson were armed with a shortened .22 calibre rifle and a claw hammer. At the time that they entered into the pharmacy there were three staff and one customer in the store. Mr Hickson pointed the gun at the pharmacist, Mr Dennis Green and Mr Ashley Flynn demanded that the till be opened. They then demanded that the safe be opened. Money was removed from the safe and from the till and the offenders fled from the chemist’s shop. Mr Hickson and Mr Flynn got back into the Holden Commodore which was then driven by Mr Polkinghorn from the scene. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Polkinghorn drove the vehicle along Hawkesbury Road and into Austral Avenue where [the applicant was] still waiting in [her] Hyundai XL. [She] then [drove her] vehicle from this street into Toohey Avenue and both vehicles then stopped. Messrs Polkinghorn, Hickson and Flynn then got out of the Commodore and got into [the applicant’s] vehicle and [she] then drove [herself] and the other three offenders back to Mr Ashley Flynn’s home… 
        
       
       
        
        At that home the proceeds from the pharmacy were split between the offenders, Messrs Hickson and Polkinghorn received approximately $330 each and Mr Flynn and [the applicant] received approximately $200 each. 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant was born on 21 April 1982. She had a criminal record including four convictions for common assault, and convictions for goods in custody (twelve counts) and furnishing false/misleading information to licensee (sixteen counts). The offences had all occurred from the age of 18 onwards, most within a very short period of time. The subject offence was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. 
     
      
    7 A psychological report by Ms Freeman dated 3 December 2003 revealed a normal happy childhood with the applicant leaving school after year 10 and commencing an apprenticeship as a baker, which she continued in for two years. At age 18 she commenced a relationship with a young man, to whom she became pregnant. When she was 8 months pregnant she discovered he had slept with someone else. Subsequently he was charged with rape. Shortly before the birth, the applicant’s brother disclosed he had had a homosexual relationship with the young man for some months and showed the applicant compromising photographs in relation thereto. The applicant gave birth to a daughter on 23 January 2002. 
     
      
    8 The applicant suffered post-natal depression. Her local doctor prescribed valium but she did not take the tablets. She began smoking heroin two weeks after the birth and became dependant thereon. She had been using cannabis regularly since she was 15 or 16. 9 Psychological testing revealed the applicant had a composite IQ score of 87, and low self esteem. She obtained significant scores on the Anxiety, Dysthymia, Drug Dependence and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder scales, and high scores on the Somatoform and Bipolar: Manic scales. She also obtained a significant score on major depression. It was reported she did not feel capable and confident to function independently and therefore created strong bonds with people she perceived as being able to lead and take care of her. 
     
      
    10 The applicant’s parents, particularly her mother, are supportive. The applicant is on a methadone program. The psychologist concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        Whilst in custody, Kylie has attended a few counselling sessions, and she requires ongoing counselling to deal with her depression, anxiety and symptoms of trauma. She is likely to gain most support from a strong therapeutic relationship. She should attend drug education, and if necessary, at the completion of her sentence, attend a short period of rehabilitation. In the community, she may require support from the Probation and Parole Service. 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour held that the offence was a very serious criminal offence indeed. It showed great criminality on the part of all the parties including the applicant. Each of the four offenders intended the crime and set out to carry it into effect. As his Honour observed, “The community is fed up to the back teeth with people committing these types of offences”.  
     
      
    12 His Honour took into account (though he kept in mind that the applicant was an accessory before the fact) the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 where a guideline sentence of four to five years was considered appropriate in circumstances all of which to a greater or lesser extent were present in the subject case. His Honour had regard to various aggravating and mitigating factors as required by s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    13 His Honour varied the statutory ratio pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 44, as he found the applicant was unlikely to re-offend provided she could be removed from illicit drug use and that she had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Grounds One and Three 
      
    14 In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 this Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        [86] Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said “objectively” to affect the “seriousness” of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of … mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected … 
          
        Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment.  
        
       
      
    15 The applicant submitted that though his Honour had taken into account her history as special circumstances for the purpose of setting the non-parole period he had not taken those matters into account on the question of criminality and culpability. 
     
      
    16 The applicant sought to establish, by a close analysis of the report of Ms Freeman, that the applicant had suffered from major depression following the birth of her child, which condition continued to the time of sentence and that this, and the circumstances leading up to it, clouded her judgment and caused her to depart from a substantially law abiding life. Applicant’s counsel conceded that the case had not been conducted in this way before the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
    17 It is well accepted that in some cases of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or disability, deterrence is a consideration to which less weight should be given. As Wood CJ at CL said in R v Henry [254]: 
     
      
       
        
        The reason for this approach lies in the circumstance that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice. 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour found that the applicant was suffering from a major depressive illness at the time of sentence. However there was no medical or psychological evidence before him that such illness clouded her judgment and was the reason for committing the offence or that there was a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act. Indeed the applicant told the court, the probation and parole officer who prepared the pre-sentence report and Ms Freeman that she committed the offence in order to finance her heroin addiction. In my opinion the necessary causal connection between mental illness and the commission of the offence was not established. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is rejected. 
     
      
      Ground Two – The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to apply the principle of parity in the circumstances of this case 
      
    19 In Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617 Brennan J held: 
     
      
       
        
        The sentencing of co-offenders always requires a comparison of their conduct and antecedents. The imposition of comparable sentences upon co-offenders whose respective conduct and antecedents warrant disparate sentences is unjust. Similarly the imposition of disparate sentences upon co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable is unjust. A justified sense of unfair treatment is produced in either case. 
        
       
      
    20 In Postiglione v R (1997) 145 ALR 408 at 412 Dawson and Gummow JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality. 
        
       
      
    21 In Postiglione at 429 Gummow J said: 
     
      
       
        
        The principle for which  
        Lowe 
         is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done. 
        
       
      
    22 In Regina v Steel NSWCCA 17 April 1997 this Court held that where there is a degree of disparity as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved. 
     
      
    23 His Honour concluded the applicant’s objective criminality was of a somewhat lesser degree than that of Messrs Flynn and Hickson and also somewhat less than that of Mr Polkinghorn. He reached this conclusion as the applicant did not actually go to the premises or participate in the robbery and she was not the ringleader but was lead into the offence. The applicant submitted that, when regard was had to the sentences imposed on the principal offenders, his Honour’s conclusion was not reflected in the sentence imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    24 Mr Flynn was aged 17 at the time of the offence. He entered the pharmacy armed with a hammer. He had a prior criminal record. He was sentenced at the same time for two other offences namely robbery, and assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon. Offences of steal a motor vehicle and break enter and steal were taken into account on a Form 1. He was a heroin user. He committed crime to support his drug habit. He had a significant chronic liver condition and an attention deficit disorder. The Judge who sentenced him found special circumstances and imposed a penalty of four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. This sentence effectively imposed six months imprisonment in addition to the sentences resulting from the other offences for which he was sentenced on this occasion. 
     
      
    25 Mr Hickson was aged 15 at the time of the offence. It was he who was armed with the rifle. He had no prior criminal record but offences of armed robbery, break enter and steal (2) and steal a motor vehicle were taken into account on a Form 1. The armed robbery involved the hold up of a young woman at a video store using a machete. He had an established heroin habit and was using cannabis on a daily basis. He was sentenced to four years and three months in a detention centre with a non-parole period of two years. The sentencing Judge found it was a significant factor that he was the youngest of the group and found special circumstances because of his youth whilst noting that his demeanour was more consistent with that of a thoroughly institutionalised adult. 
     
      
    26 Mr Polkinghorn was aged 18 at the time of the offence. He drove the stolen getaway car. He had a prior criminal record. He also pleaded guilty to other charges on the indictment namely robbery with a dangerous weapon, robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, malicious wounding and malicious wounding with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. As well various offences were taken into account on Form 1. These offences included a series of armed robberies. He was a regular user of cannabis and also used other drugs including heroin which he had commenced to use shortly before his arrest. The sentencing Judge took a starting point of seven years with a non-parole period of five years three months for the subject offence. He then applied a 60% discount for assisting police and a plea of guilty, and took into account his age and rehabilitation prospects and the principle of totality. He sentenced him for a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment for the subject offence. The total effective sentence for him was six years with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months. 
     
      
    27 His Honour concluded that he did “not think the sentence imposed on Mr Hickson really has much weight in relation to questions of parity in this Court because Mr Hickson was only 15 at the time that he committed this offence and the authorities are quite plain that where a juvenile is involved questions of parity are not really able to be dealt with, if the other offender is an adult.” His Honour referred to Mr Polkinghorn’s sentence without expressing any view as to its effect upon the application of parity principles. Mr Flynn had not been sentenced at that time. Essentially his Honour did not apply the principles of parity or proportionality when sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    28 In my opinion, his Honour erred in that regard. The sentence imposed on Mr Hickson had utility in respect of the determination of the sentence to be imposed on the applicant. The relevant principle was stated by this Court in R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432 at [14] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        There is no longer an inflexible rule that there is no utility in comparing the sentences imposed upon co-offenders who are separately dealt with: one in the Children’s Court and the other as an adult. 
        
       
       
        
        While it is true that there are different sentencing objectives and considerations applicable in the Children’s Court, which do limit the worth of any such comparison, it would have been appropriate for his Honour to have paid some regard to that sentence.  
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Tran  
      [2004] NSWCCA 6. The utility of such sentences is the greater in cases such as the present where all offenders were sentenced in the District Court in accordance with law. 
       
      
    29 There is a difficulty in comparing the sentences imposed upon Mr Flynn and Mr Polkinghorn with that of the applicant as the totality principle of sentencing was applied in those cases to ensure that the aggregate of the sentences appropriate for each offence was a just and appropriate measure of the criminality involved. 
     
      
    30 As McHugh J said in Postiglione at 422: 
     
      
       
        
        Parity between sentences imposed on co-offenders is an important sentencing goal. But a disparity between sentences will not give rise to a “justifiable sense of grievance” where the disparity can be explained on the basis of different antecedents and/or an application of the totality principle. 
        
       
      
    31 However when the sentences of the other offenders are compared with that of the applicant there is disclosed a lack of proportionality with the applicant’s sentence such as would give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on her part. The applicant’s sentence does not adequately reflect the lesser degree of objective criminality found by his Honour. Accordingly I would uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
      Ground Four: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the applicant’s assistance to the authorities when determining an appropriate sentence 
       
      
    32 The applicant gave no assistance to the authorities at any stage prior to the sentencing hearing. In the course of her cross-examination at the sentencing hearing she gave evidence as to Mr Flynn’s presence and involvement in the offence. At that stage Mr Flynn was maintaining a plea of not guilty though Mr Polkinghorn had assisted the authorities by supplying information as to Mr Flynn’s involvement. It was submitted the applicant’s evidence should be regarded as assistance to the authorities meriting a discount in sentence. 33 His Honour did not discount the sentence for assistance and made no reference to the issue in his judgment. His Honour made no error in this regard. The applicant was bound to answer questions on oath. The compliance with that obligation is not to be regarded as relevantly assisting law enforcement authorities for the purposes of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 23 see R v Calderoni [2000] NSWCCA 511 [8 and 9]. No discount was applicable. 
     
      
      Conclusion 
      
    34 In applying the principles of parity and proportionality I would reduce the sentence of imprisonment to 3 years. As observed by his Honour there were special circumstances which, in my opinion, justify a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months to which the conditions imposed by his Honour should apply. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Orders  
      
    35 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        (2) Appeal upheld. 
         
         
        (3) Sentence quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months, the sentence to commence on 18 September 2003.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) The applicant is eligible for release on parole on 17 December 2004. Such parole is recommended to be subject to the following terms and conditions: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. Supervision in accordance with the provisions of regulation 217 of the  
          Crimes (Administration of Sentence) Regulation 2001 
          . 
           
           
          2. Without in anyway limiting the supervision in condition 1 the offender is to place herself under the supervision and guidance of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service for the whole of the term of the parole period and she is to obey all directions of officers of that service, including any directions or instructions to undertake examinations, assessments, therapy, treatment, counselling or urine analysis and including any direction that she attend and complete a residential drug rehabilitation program, whilst she is under such supervision and guidance. 
          
         
        
       
      
    36 SMART AJ: I agree with Hislop J.

    3 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Moshey Youkhana, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of armed robbery, an offence under s97(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment. He was sentenced to imprisonment for six years and four months, with a non-parole period of four years, two months and two weeks, to date from 28 February 2004. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. The sentence was directed to commence at the expiration of a fifteen month sentence which he was serving at the time, and to which it will be necessary to refer when dealing with the application. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 Late in the morning of 29 September 2002, the applicant and a co-offender, Olani Mea, went to the Mandarin Club in Sydney. They spent about four hours drinking and gambling on the poker machines. They then went to the reception desk in the foyer and asked the receptionist if they could speak to the manager about employment as security guards. The receptionist called for the manager, Mr Gordon Wong, who came to the foyer.  
     
      
    5 Mea then produced a replica pistol, similar to a .32 calibre automatic, and the two offenders forced Mr Wong and the receptionist into an office adjacent to the foyer. There, Mr Wong was directed to remove the video tapes from a video recorder connected to the surveillance cameras throughout the club, and the applicant took possession of those. There were two safes in the office and Mr Wong was made to open them. The offenders noticed another door from the office leading to the cashier’s booth in the poker machine lounge. The manager was directed to call the cashier into the office and she also was detained. 
     
      
    6 The applicant withdrew a pair of gloves and a plastic bag from his trousers pocket, put the gloves on and placed money from the safes into the bag. He also produced a roll of duct tape from his pocket and the three victims were bound hand and foot. Mea searched Mr Wong and stole his mobile phone. During the incident each of the offenders held the replica pistol at different times and it was pointed at Mr Wong on several occasions. As the two offenders left the office, Mea threatened to kill Mr Wong’s “whole family” if anything happened to them. 
     
      
    7 The offenders made off with a little over $81,000, which was never recovered. The applicant was arrested on 7 November 2002 and, on legal advice, declined to be interviewed. Mea was arrested the same day. In due course, he also pleaded guilty and was dealt with at the same time as the applicant.  
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge described the robbery as having been carried out “with professionalism”, although he was not satisfied that it was planned before the offenders arrived at the club. He found a number of the aggravating factors set out in s21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and I shall refer to some of those in the course of these reasons. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    9 The applicant was thirty-two years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty-four. Prior to 2002 he had a minor criminal record, comprising some traffic offences, a drug offence and a conviction for receiving, none of which resulted in a custodial sentence. However, in 2002 he was charged with improperly interfering with a corpse, an offence under s81C(b) of the Crimes Act. He had allowed his cousin to use his business premises for the purpose of conducting a drug deal. He later attended the premises to find that his cousin had been shot dead. He placed the body in the boot of his car, cleaned blood from the scene, and abandoned the car at a location in Parramatta. 
     
      
    10 For this offence he was sentenced to the fifteen month term to which I earlier referred, which commenced on 28 November 2002 and expired on 27 February 2004. Hence the commencement date of the sentence the subject of this application, 28 February 2004. More importantly, he was on bail in respect of that offence at the time of the robbery: an aggravating feature which has long been recognised and which is now enshrined in s21A(2)(j). 
     
      
    11 The applicant was born and raised in Iraq. He was one of ten children and his family was poor, but it seems that his upbringing was satisfactory. He was conscripted into the Iraqi army and was wounded during the first Gulf war. He escaped to Turkey, and in 1992 he and two of his siblings arrived in Australia. Others of his family migrated to Canada or Turkey, and some remained in Iraq. Since arriving in Australia he had been in employment, and for a year prior to his arrest he conducted his own car detailing business. His co-offender, Mea, worked for him in that business. He is married and has two children.  
     
      
    12 From a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report, it appears that his involvement in the robbery had its genesis in a gambling problem which he had developed over the previous year. In addition, since his cousin’s death, for which he felt a measure of responsibility, he had been drinking and using stimulant drugs to excess. Nevertheless, given his satisfactory employment history and the fact that he retained strong family ties, his Honour considered that his prospects of rehabilitation were “at least reasonable” and thought him unlikely to re-offend in a serious way.  
     
      
       
      The sentence 
       
      
    13 His Honour had regard to the guideline judgment in respect of armed robbery offences in R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Taking into account the aggravating features of the offence, his starting point was imprisonment for eight years. This he reduced by twenty percent for the applicant’s plea of guilty, arriving at a term of six years, four months and three weeks. He then discounted that figure by three weeks to take account of a brief, discrete period of pre-sentence custody. The result was the head sentence of six years and four months which was passed. 
     
      
    14 As I have said, the whole of that sentence was accumulated upon the sentence of fifteen months which the applicant was then serving. His Honour did not find special circumstances. However, he then made an error in the applicant’s favour. Stating that the “statutory non-parole period is two-thirds of the head sentence”, he fixed the non-parole period to which I have referred: four years, two months and two weeks, expiring on 11 May 2008. The normal statutory proportion, of course, is three quarters, which would have produced a non-parole period of four years and nine months.  
     
      
    15 In the result, the applicant must remain in custody from the commencement of the pre-existing sentence, 28 November 2002 until he becomes eligible for parole on 11 May 2008, a period of almost five-and-a-half years. The balance of the sentence expires on 27 June 2010, a further period of almost two years and two months.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    16 It is the structure of the sentence which gives rise to the principal complaints in the present application. Mr Hamill, for the applicant, argued that his Honour failed to have regard to the effect of accumulation in arriving at both the head sentence and the non-parole period. Certainly, his Honour’s only reference to that matter was to record that he had considered making the sentence partly concurrent with the sentence the applicant was then serving but had concluded that there was “no justification for doing this”. 
     
      
    17 Mr Hamill argued that the head sentence failed to give effect to the principle of totality, in so far as it normally requires some moderation of a sentence which is to be accumulated upon an existing sentence. That principle, of course, is of long standing. Mr Hamill referred us to the restatement of it in Postiglione v The Queen (1996-7) 189 CLR 295 by McHugh J at 307-9 and Kirby J at 341. McHugh J (at 308) cited with approval the following passage in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R Gordon (1994) 71 ACrim R 459 at 466: 
     
      
       
        
        When a custodial sentence is to be imposed which will be cumulative upon, or which will overlap with, an existing custodial sentence, the judge must take into account that existing sentence so that the total period to be spent in custody adequately and fairly represents the totality of criminality involved in all of the offences to which that total period is attributable… 
        
       
      
    18 A statement of principle to the same effect is to be found in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Close (1993) 65 ACrim R 55 at 59: 
     
      
       
        
        Whenever sentences are accumulated, careful consideration must always be given to the principle of totality – as to whether the simple addition of two or more sentences which may individually be appropriate has nevertheless produced a total figure which is excessive having regard to the totality of the criminality involved…that principle is  
        not 
         restricted to sentences imposed for offences committed as part of a connected and roughly contemporaneous series of offences… 
        
       
      
    19 In my view, Mr Hamill’s submission is sound. Viewed against the guideline in Henry (supra), to be found in the judgment of Spigelman CJ at [162] - [165], the sentence in the present case is severe but, absent the accumulation, one which could not be said to be excessive in the light of the particularly serious circumstances of the offence, the applicant’s maturity and the fact that he was subject to conditional liberty at the time. However, the effect of the accumulation of that sentence upon the existing sentence is an aggregate term of seven years and seven months. Given his plea of guilty and the other favourable subjective circumstances, I consider that to be more than is called for by the totality of the criminality disclosed by the two offences.  
     
      
    20 As I have said, Mr Hamill also submitted that his Honour failed to have regard to the accumulation when considering special circumstances. It is well established that the fact that a sentence is to be accumulated upon an existing sentence can amount to a special circumstance warranting a departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period: Close (supra), per Hunt CJ at CL at 60. His Honour did not advert to this matter in his remarks, and appears to have confined his decision that there were no special circumstances to a consideration of the applicant’s subjective case. However, the practical difficulty with Mr Hamill’s argument is that, albeit mistakenly, his Honour did fix a non-parole period which is less than the statutory proportion. 
     
      
    21 That said, as I am satisfied that the head sentence was affected by error, this Court should set aside the sentence and determine the appropriate sentence afresh. I would accumulate that sentence upon the previous sentence but, for that reason and also in the light of the applicant’s subjective case, I would find special circumstances. 
     
      
    22 There were three other grounds of the application which, strictly speaking, it is unnecessary to decide. However, while two of them require no more than brief reference, the third should be considered because it raises a matter of some importance and, in any event, could bear on re-sentence. Nothing need be said about the first ground, which asserts that his Honour erred in the way in which he arrived at the discount for the applicant’s plea of guilty. The second ground relates to his Honour’s rejection of a statement of the applicant recorded in the psychiatrist’s report that “he apologised to the staff of the club at the time of the robbery”. It is sufficient to say that a statement to police by the club’s receptionist, Mr Bruno Battisti, records that the applicant said, “Sorry, mate” before he bound him with duct tape. 
     
      
    23 The third ground arises from his Honour’s finding, as an aggravating factor within the meaning of s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that there “clearly was some emotional harm to the three victims”. This must be a reference to the factor set out in s21A(2)(g): “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. It is necessary to examine what evidence his Honour had before him of the victims’ reaction to the robbery.  
     
      
    24 Before his Honour were statements by the manager, Mr Wong, and the receptionist, Mr Battisti. For reasons which are not apparent, there was not a statement from the cashier. The only reference to an emotional reaction by Mr Battisti was his saying that he “started to feel scared” when Mea handed the gun to the applicant, who pointed it at Mr Wong and threatened to shoot him in the knee cap. In his own statement, Mr Wong said: 
     
      
       
        
        During the incident, I was panicking and very concerned when I saw the Islander male with the pistol. At many times during the ordeal, the Islander male pointed the pistol directly at me and I was concerned that he might shoot me. I am still shaken and very nervous as a result of the incident. (The “Islander male” was Mea.)  
        
       
       
      Mr Wong made that statement on the day of the robbery and there is no evidence that his emotional state was enduring.  
       
      
    25 One can entirely understand Mr Wong’s reaction as he described it. No doubt, Mr Battisti’s statement that he “started to feel scared” at one stage of the robbery is an understatement. Armed robbery is necessarily a frightening experience for its victims. This is not a matter about which courts need evidence. In large part, it is why the offence is viewed so seriously and carries a very high maximum sentence. 
     
      
    26 However, before a judge could find “substantial emotional harm” within the meaning of s21A(2)(g), one would expect evidence specifically directed to that issue. Normally, that would be in the form of a victim impact statement. Whether that evidence established the aggravating factor would be a matter to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case. However, it would need to disclose an emotional response significantly more deleterious than that which any ordinary person would have when subjected to an armed robbery. There was no such evidence here. 
     
      
       
      Re-sentence 
       
      
    27 Taking into account all relevant matters except the plea of guilty, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for seven years. The plea of guilty is of considerable utilitarian value, having been entered in the Local Court. In recognition of it, I would reduce that sentence by twenty-five percent to five years and three months. I would direct that sentence to commence at the expiration of the fifteen month sentence imposed at Parramatta Local Court, that is, on 28 February 2004. Finding special circumstances, I would specify a non-parole period of three years and three months, expiring on 27 May 2007. 
     
      
    28 The pre-existing sentence of fifteen months commenced on 28 November 2002. Aggregating that sentence and the sentence which I propose, the applicant would face a total term of six and a half years imprisonment from that date and would be eligible for release on parole after serving four-and-a-half years.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    29 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence passed in the District Court is quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for five years and three months,  
        with a non-parole period of three years and three months, to date from 28 February 2004. He will be eligible for release on parole on 27 May 2007.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of the sentences imposed on the respondent by his Honour Judge Ellis in the District Court at Parramatta on 29 August 2003 on the ground that the respondent received reduced sentences because of his undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities, but subsequently failed to fulfil such undertaking. 
     
      
    2 On 29 August 2003, the respondent adhered to his guilty pleas entered before a magistrate to 12 counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. There were a further 12 counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and one count of attempted armed robbery taken into account on a Form 1. The maximum penalty for each of these offences is 20 years imprisonment: Crimes Act 1900 s 97. 
     
      
    3 The offences spanned a period of about seven weeks between 25 May 2002 and 12 July 2002. They involved the respondent with two co-offenders, Ratu Joji McPherson and Ratu Josese Naleba robbing a variety of small business establishments such as service stations, video and liquor stores and, on one occasion, a Woolworths store in North Strathfield. The modus operandi was for Waqa and McPherson to produce knives to threaten the store attendants whilst Naleba drove the car in which the three men made their escape after the armed robberies. In total some $12,190 cash and $820 worth of cigarettes was obtained as a result of the 12 matters on the indictment. The matters on the Form 1 accounted for the robbery of a further $3,107. All three offenders were arrested when Naleba’s vehicle, in which Waqa and McPherson were passengers, was stopped by police on 12 July 2002 shortly after the commission of the last of the robberies. 
     
      
    4 On 29 August 2003, the respondent was sentenced in respect to counts 1 and 3 to 11 to two years imprisonment to date from 12 July 2002 and in relation to count 2, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment to commence on 12 July 2003 with a non-parole period of two years and three months. 5 In relation to count 12, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, he was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and six months to date from 11 July 2004, and expire on 11 January 2010 with a non-parole period of two years and four months to expire on 11 November 2006. 
     
      
    6 This was an effective total sentence of imprisonment for seven years and six months from 12 July 2002 until 11 January 2010, and an effective non-parole period of four years and four months. The respondent will become eligible for release on parole on 11 November 2006. The co-offender, Ratu Joji McPherson was sentenced at the same time as the respondent, having also pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    7 During the course of sentencing proceedings, an Undertaking dated 22 August 2002 signed by the respondent was tendered (Exhibit 56). By it the respondent undertook to give evidence against Naleba in respect of the 22 robberies therein specified. The undertaking went on:  
     
      
       
        
        “And I further undertake to give active cooperation, including the giving of evidence truthfully and frankly in accordance with a statement to be prepared by the DPP that I understand will be based upon the various statements I have signed and recorded interviews I have participated in.” 
        
       
      
    8 Following sentencing, the respondent was incarcerated at Goulburn Correctional Centre and on 25 November 2003, Senior Constable Walsh obtained a further statement from him setting out the role that Naleba was alleged to have played in the robberies, namely as the driver. A copy of that statement was tendered in the proceedings before us as Exhibit A. Paragraph 4 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “All of these robberies that I committed were always in the same sort of way using the knives, threatening the staff and telling them to give us the money. It was always the three of us, Joe Naleba, Ratu McPherson and me. Sometimes Joe would tell us what job to do and other times we would just drive around until we saw one to do. We always split the money up between us. The knives were always kept under the seat of Joe’s white commodore which is the same car that we always used and the same car that we were arrested in. The only time we did not use his white commodore was when he hired the black supercharged statesman from Avis.” 
        
       
      
    9 In subsequent paragraphs, he set out in some detail each of the offences and implicated Naleba in each of them.  
     
      
    10 In his Remarks on Sentence, Ellis DCJ did not expressly refer to s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but at p 11 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court notes the offender’s undertaking marked Exhibit 56 to give evidence for the Crown if required. The Court notes the recruitment of family members to assist police in relation to identification of offenders on security photographs.” 
        
       
      
    11 And later at p 13 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to both offenders, I accept that pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest possible point in time and that each offender is entitled to a discount in the order of 25 per cent. I accept that each offender has independently demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition that is, independently of their pleas of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that without the pleas of guilty, the Crown would have had difficulty in proving a number of the robberies by reason of identification problems. I accept that both offenders have provided substantial assistance to the authorities and each offender is entitled to a significant reduction in the order of 20 per cent in relation to each offence by reason of their assistance.” 
        
       
      
    12 On 16 February 2004, committal proceedings in respect of Naleba commenced at Parramatta Local Court before Magistrate Dr Brown. When the respondent was called to the witness box, the brief of evidence was admitted as Exhibit 1 and this included the statement by Waqa dated 25 November 2003 and a number of transcripts of records of interview with him. His undertaking was tendered and admitted as Exhibit 2.  
     
      
    13 The respondent told the court: 
     
      
       
        
        “I made statement against Joe the other – before – I done it because I wanted to get some time off. And I want to say today that Joe had no part of this. I made false statements against Joe. They – we actually were taking the car off him we were using his car.” 
        
       
      
    14 The Magistrate adjourned the matter to enable him to get legal advice, but when the matter came back before the court on 21 July 2004 and the respondent was recalled, he indicated that he had not obtained legal advice and the proceedings continued.  
     
      
    15 He was shown his statement of 25 November 2003 and asked to read it. He said he could not remember what was set out in the statement, that he had pressure put on him to make it and parts of it were incorrect. The Magistrate then found him to be unfavourable, and granted leave for the prosecution to cross-examine him. 
     
      
    16 In cross-examination, he stated that the pressure he referred to came from “within”, that he wanted to get the matter over and that he was stressing out. He was taken laboriously through the statement and asked to comment on each paragraph. In respect of the majority of paragraphs, he stated he could not remember discussing the areas with the police who had interviewed him, and in many cases could not remember the incident referred to. 
     
      
    17 He also gave evidence that Naleba was not the driver, as set out in his statement except for the day when he was arrested, namely 21 July 2002. On this occasion, McPherson and Naleba were arrested at Naleba’s car when it was stopped by police shortly after the last robbery, at which time large amounts of cash, together with knives, balaclavas, gloves and other indicia of participation in the robberies were found. When the respondent was referred to the offences listed in his undertaking, he professed to have trouble recalling them and said that on many occasions he had been the driver, a claim that was completely contrary to his earlier statement. He also claimed that he borrowed Naleba’s car and that he had paid Naleba money after the robberies.  
     
      
    18 He said that he did not want to give evidence against Naleba because of concerns for his own and his family’s safety, and had only promised to give evidence against him to secure a lesser sentence. We were informed from the Bar Table that Naleba has since pleaded guilty to one charge of being an accessory before the fact and had been committed for sentence, and has requested that another matter be placed on a Form 1. Proceedings against him in respect of the other 22 robberies have apparently been dismissed. 
     
      
    19 In an affidavit filed in this Court, the applicant stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. I did not give the evidence because I am scared of what may happen to me if I did. I feel I would not be safe in gaol even if I was in protection. 
         
         
        3. I do not wish to go into protection. In protection…..I would not be able to work or to do any courses.” 
        
       
      
    20 Section 23(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        A Court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to the offence concerned or any other offence. 
        
       
      
    21 Sub-s (2) sets out the matters which the Court must consider in deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty whilst sub-s (3) provides that such lesser penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  
     
      
    22 Section 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, so far as material, is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person failed wholly or partly to fulfil that undertaking. 
         
         
        2. On an appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit. 
        
       
      
    23 The application of s 5DA and its interaction with s 23 have been the subject of a number of cases most of which were recently reviewed in R v El Sayed [2003] NSWCCA 232, 57 NSWLR 659. As explained in those cases, the reasons why the sentence is reduced in the first place are two-fold: namely, the utilitarian value of the assistance in that it aids in the detection and punishment of offenders and secondly, because the giving of such assistance renders the serving of the offender’s sentence of imprisonment more onerous and more uncomfortable, normally involving the opprobrium and disfavour of, and the risk of physical harm from, fellow prisoners, and necessitating the sentence being served on protection.  
     
      
    24 If the assistance, and in particular the evidence, is not forthcoming, the discount has been obtained on an expectation which has not been fulfilled and the basis for the reduced sentence is removed. It is in these circumstances that s 5DA allows the sentence to be varied to that which would have been imposed, subject always to the Court’s discretion not to intervene where circumstances justify such a course e.g. R v Bagnall and Russell (CCA – 10 June 1994). 
     
      
    25 One can understand why the respondent has become reluctant to give evidence against his co-offender because he had since realised the probable consequences of doing so, but his sentence having been reduced on the basis of an expectation which has not been fulfilled, such sentence should now be increased by the amount of the reduction.  
     
      
    26 Although s 23 permits the imposition of a lesser penalty in regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted or undertaken to assist the authority, s 5DA only authorities this Court to review the sentence where there has been breach of an undertaking to provide future assistance. In other words, where a discount has been allowed for the provision of past assistance, and an undertaking to provide future assistance and there is subsequently a breach of the undertaking to provide future assistance, this Court can adjust the sentence on account of the breach of that undertaking, but cannot interfere with that part of the reduction that has been allowed on account of the past assistance.  
     
      
    27 It is therefore desirable that where there has been both past assistance and an undertaking to provide future assistance, the amount of the reduction referable of the undertaking to provide future assistance should be separately specified, so that this Court can be aware of the extent of such reduction in an appeal under s 5DA. That was not done in the present case.  
     
      
    28 It has therefore been submitted that some allowance should be made for his past assistance in naming the co-offender and because, as a result of his original undertaking, the Crown was able to place the respondent’s statement before the court so that it constituted evidence of the facts therein asserted. A similar submission was made in El Sayed and the Court took the view that some credit should be allowed for his prior willingness to assist although this was very limited, but the fact that he had given the information meant that pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act, his information was put before the jury, and the co-offender had in fact been convicted on 3 of the 4 counts on which he was charged, although the court could not speculate whether this was due to the respondent’s evidence. It therefore increased the respondent’s sentence, but not to the full amount of what it would have been if the discount for assistance had not been allowed in the first place. 
     
      
    29 I do not however, regard El Sayed as authority for the proposition that wherever following the refusal of an offender to honour his undertaking to give evidence, and his statement is in effect placed before the court pursuant to s 38, the Court on an appeal under s 5DA must make some allowance for the making of the statement. Each case must depend on its own facts.  
     
      
    30 As Ireland J (with whom other members of the Court agreed) observed in R v Hocking [2000] NSWCCA 339 at [37], although there is an element of discount related to past assistance in the naming of a co-offender, such assistance is valueless when there is a failure to give the evidence as promised.  
     
      
    31 In R v Burton (CCA – 6 August 1997), whilst acknowledging that there was a moderate element of past co-operation, the undertaking was one of future co-operation to give evidence. That had not been done and the Court increased the sentence by the full amount of the reduction. 
     
      
    32 On the other hand, in R v R [2000] NSWCCA 163, which was not an appeal under s 5DA, but a severity appeal where the issue was whether sufficient allowance had been made for past assistance, Hulme J (with whom Dowd J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the naming of a co-offender or co-offenders, particularly when the names or identity of those persons are not otherwise known to the authorities, cannot but be described as assistance to law enforcement authorities in the detection or investigation of offences.” 
        
       
      
    33 In the present case, his Honour in the passage quoted above from p 11 of his Remarks on Sentence referred to the fact that the respondent had provided substantial assistance and was entitled to a reduction in the order of 20 per cent by reason of his assistance, but the earlier reference at p 9 to the undertaking makes it clear that the reduction was substantially in relation to the offer of further assistance, rather than for the giving of past assistance.  
     
      
    34 Whereas in El Sayed, the offender’s statement against his co-offender was placed before the jury at the co-offender’s trial, in the present case this all occurred at committal and the respondent also swore that such statement was false and only made it to get time off his own sentence. In these circumstances, there would (in practical terms) be no point in the Crown calling him as a witness at the trial. The police knew, or at least had a very good idea, who the other offender was as all three been arrested together in incriminating circumstances, so there was little value in naming Naleba unless the undertaking to give evidence against him was honoured. 35 Accordingly, notwithstanding the apparent ambiguity in his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence, I would regard the 20 per cent reduction as almost wholly referrable to the undertaking of future assistance by giving evidence, and would increase the sentences to approximately what they would have been if the 20 per cent reduction had not been allowed. 
     
      
    36 This leads to another difficulty in that although his Honour specified the amount of the discount, he did not nominate notional sentences and then apply the discount, but after purporting to apply the discount, imposed sentences rounded it off to whole years or fractions of years. It is therefore difficult to see what the sentences would have been if no allowance had been made for the offer of assistance. There were in fact 2 discounts specified totalling 45 per cent (25 per cent for the pleas of guilty and 20 per cent for the assistance).  
     
      
    37 It follows that to have arrived at the total sentences of 7 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months, his Honour must have started off with overall sentences of approximately, but not exactly, 13 years 7 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 10 ½ months reduced by 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty to 10 years 2 ½ months with a non-parole period of almost 5 years 11 months, and then further reduced by another 20 per cent to 7 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years 4 months. 38 In these circumstances, I would increase the overall sentences imposed in the District Court to approximately what they would have been if the further discount of 20 per cent had not been allowed, but giving the respondent the benefit of the odd months and fractions of months as a minimal allowance for his minimal past assistance. 
     
      
    39 Because of the partial accumulation of sentences, I consider this is most fairly done by looking primarily at the overall sentence, although in order to comply with the principles set out in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, some regard must also be had to the individual sentences. All offences were committed prior to 1 February 2003 and so s 44 as it existed prior to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 applies.  
     
      
    40 I would uphold the appeal, set aside the sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge and re-sentence the respondent as follows: 
     
      
       
      On counts 1, and 3 to 11 inclusive – concurrent sentences of imprisonment for fixed terms of 2 years and 6 months from 12 July 2002 to 11 January 2005. 
       
       
      On count 2 – sentence of imprisonment for 4 years from 12 July 2003 to 11 July 2007 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months from 12 July 2003 to 11 April 2006. 
       
       
      On count 12 (and taking into account the matters on Form 1) – imprisonment for 8 years from 12 July 2004 to 11 July 2012 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months from 12 July 2004 to 11 January 2008.  
       
       
      The overall sentences therefore amount to 10 years with non-parole periods totalling 5 years 6 months. The earliest date on which the respondent will be eligible for release on parole will be 11 January 2008.

    JUDGMENTEvents of 2 May 20031 On 2 November 2004 the accused Ross Gillett was called for trial. An indictment containing 3 counts was presented. Each of those counts alleged that the accused had driven his motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to other persons, whereby his vehicle was involved in an impact, as a result of which a named person was killed. The 3 counts each related to the death of a different member of the Howie family: Cameron Douglas Howie, Shannon Anne Howie and Michaela Howie. 2 At about 4.45pm on 2 May 2003 the accused was driving a new Toyota Avalon sedan in a northerly direction along Condamine Street at Manly Vale. The weather was fine, the road was dry and it was still daylight. Condamine Street is a major road and traffic was moderate to heavy. As the accused approached the corner of Condamine Street and Campbell Parade, traffic lights facing him changed from green to amber. The car in front of his was driven by Dr Currie who slowed her vehicle intending to stop at the traffic lights. The accused’s car ran into Dr Currie’s car with such force that her car spun and was pushed into the middle of the intersection.3 The accused did not stop after this collision. He continued along Condamine Street towards the intersection of Kentwell Road. The traffic in front of him had banked up, a common occurrence because of the traffic lights at the intersection of Condamine Street and Kentwell Road. The car immediately in front of the accused’s was a green Mitsubishi Lancer driven by Cameron Howie with his wife Shannon Howie in the front passenger seat and their young daughter, Michaela Howie in a child’s car seat in the back. The accused’s car ran into the back of the Howies’ car forcing it not only forwards but also to the right, across the median strip and into the path of oncoming traffic. One of the oncoming vehicles was a 4-wheel drive Nissan Patrol driven by Mr Michael Fuller. He was travelling at about 60 kph, that being the speed limit. There was nothing he could do to avoid colliding with the Howies’ car. The force of the impact between Mr Fuller’s 4-wheel drive and the much lighter Mitsubishi sedan was enormous. The smaller car was destroyed, killing all 3 members of the Howie family. 4 So far I have described the accused’s car’s collision with 2 vehicles, Dr Currie’s at the corner of Campbell Parade and the Howies’ car a short distance down Condamine Street. Despite those 2 collisions, still the accused did not stop. He continued along in a northerly direction until he collided with yet another car, this a Toyota Corolla driven by Mr Peter Wiebe. The accused’s car, having pushed the Howies’ car out of the way, had continued on until it collided with the rear of Mr Wiebe’s car. Finally the accused’s vehicle came to a stop. Events of 3 August 19935 It is common ground that the circumstances of these collisions bear a striking similarity with something that happened 10 years earlier.6 On 3 August 1993, at about 7.40am Bettina Hogerzeil was driving to work in her Toyota Corolla. She was in the median strip lane, she said in Pittwater Rd, but it was more likely Condamine Street. There was a yellow Suzuki Sierra in the kerbside lane in front of her. She saw a white Magna, which was being driven by the accused, crash into the Suzuki and run it off the road. 7 Mr Dennis Kannard was the driver of the yellow Suzuki. He remembers that as he approached Kentwell Rd the traffic was slowing down for the traffic lights. Suddenly he was bumped “pretty hard” from behind. Mr Kannard had to accelerate to get away as his car was being pushed from behind. Mr Kannard managed to pull up on the left hand side of the road and got out of his car. He saw the car that had run into his car continue on and hit the last car in the line of traffic stopped at the red lights, that being the car driven by Ms Hogerzeil. 8 After seeing the collision between the white Magna and the yellow Suzuki, Ms Hogerzeil had continued along the road, remaining in the median strip lane. She then stopped at a set of traffic lights, probably at Kentwell Road, and in her rear view mirror she saw the Magna heading towards the rear of her car. She realised that the Magna was not going to stop and was on course to hit her car, which it did. She saw the accused before the collision - his head was down on the steering wheel. This collision forced her car forward into the rear of the car in front of her. 9 Senior Constable Paul Breden attended the scene of the accident and issued 2 infringement notices against Ross Gillett.The 3 Ways the Crown Presents its Case10 The accused’s case is that shortly before the collisions on 2 May 2003, which have led to the charges he now faces, he suffered a fit or seizure which meant that his actions were involuntary, and so the real issue in this case is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was acting voluntarily at a relevant time. In order to determine this issue 3 particular questions have to be answered because the Crown has put its case in 3 ways.11 The Crown’s primary position is that the accused suffered no fit or seizure or other similar medical event at any time during the course of his driving that afternoon. If I were to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that was the case then I would find that the accused was driving voluntarily and therefore, in the circumstances of this case, find the accused guilty on each of the 3 counts.12 However, in the event that I was not satisfied that the accused had not had a fit or seizure the Crown nevertheless says that I would still find that the accused was driving voluntarily. If I were to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the accused suffered a complex partial seizure or other episode which affected his consciousness, the Crown nevertheless says that given the accused’s awareness of what he was doing and ability to control his motor vehicle, I should still find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was driving voluntarily that afternoon.13 The Crown has a third way of putting its case. I would consider this alternative in the event that I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was driving voluntarily in the time immediately preceding the collision with the Howies’ car. The third alternative I must consider is whether, at a time shortly before the collision, when the accused was driving voluntarily, he nevertheless was driving dangerously because of the risk that he would suffer a fit or seizure such that he was unable to control his car. If that is so, then the Crown must also prove that the accused did not believe on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive that afternoon. The Crown will therefore have proved its case on this issue if it proves that the accused was driving dangerously because of the risk that he would suffer a seizure and either the accused did not believe that it was safe for him to drive or there were no reasonable grounds for him to have that belief. 14 When I refer to the accused’s belief as to whether it was safe for him to drive, I am using the word “safe” as an antonym to the concept of dangerousness as it appears in the offences on the indictment. That means that the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe on reasonable grounds that his driving subjected another person or persons to some risk, over and above that associated with the driving of a motor vehicle, including driving by people who may, on occasions, drive with less than due care and attention. The risk I am speaking of here is not some fanciful risk, but so serious a risk as to be in reality, and not merely as a matter of speculation, potentially dangerous to other people on or near the road.15 At the risk of repetition I will summarise therefore the 3 questions at the heart of the voluntariness issue: 
     
     Am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had no form of fit or seizure which would affect his level of consciousness. If I make that finding beyond reasonable doubt I need not go further. However if I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that matter I will therefore consider the second issue at the heart of this case.  
     
     
     Even if the accused may have suffered a fit or seizure, am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was nevertheless driving voluntarily? If I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was driving voluntarily immediately before colliding with the Howie’s car then I need not go further. If however if I am not so satisfied I will consider the third issue at the heart of this case.  
     
     
     Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that at a time the accused was acting voluntarily he drove dangerously to other persons and he did not believe on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive or to continue driving. 
    2 Forms of Not Guilty Verdict16 If I were to find the accused not guilty there may be an issue as to what form that verdict should take – either simply “not guilty” or “not guilty on the grounds of mental illness”. The Crown suggested at the beginning of the trial that a verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness may be open. I note that the question as to whether epilepsy is a “disease of the mind” seems to have been ignored during the evidence and no submissions were made at the end of the evidence concerning the possibility of verdicts of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. Nevertheless, because both the Crown and Mr Barber have raised the possibility of that outcome, I must do certain things.17 Section 37 Mental Health Act provides that, if a jury were hearing this matter, I would have to tell the jury certain things. Section 133 Criminal Procedure Act requires that I include in this judgment the principles of law I have applied and that I take into account any warning to be given to a jury. I am not at all convinced that that section requires me to tell myself, as the tribunal of fact, things I already know. I doubt that the matters required under section 37 Mental Health Act are “principles of law” and I am certain that they are not “warnings”. But just in case I am required to note the matters referred to under section 37 Mental Health Act, I will set them out now.18 If my verdicts were ""not guilty on the grounds of mental illness"" I must order that the accused be detained in custody. Once there he comes under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. That tribunal is composed of a lawyer, a psychiatrist, and another suitably qualified person.19 That tribunal has as one of its functions the job of supervising the treatment and custody of people who are found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. It could recommend his release from custody if it was satisfied that the safety of the accused or that of any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release.20 If there is such a recommendation, then the Minister for Health must notify the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. If the Attorney-General makes no objection to a recommendation for release then an order for the accused's release can be made. The Minister for Police and Emergency Services is informed of the date of any such release. 21 Thus, if I were to find the accused not guilty on the grounds of mental illness the accused would not be released immediately. Instead he would be kept in custody until the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied that his safety or the safety of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release.22 If release is ordered, then it may be on conditions - things he must do or things he must not do. On breach of a condition, or where the mental condition of the accused has deteriorated so that he may be a serious danger to others a further order may be made for his apprehension, care and detention. 23 I will return to the issue as to what form of not guilty verdict is appropriate only if the Crown has failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.General Principles24 What I will do now is to set out some more preliminary matters before returning to the resolution of the issues in dispute.Rely on Evidence in Court25 I will determine all relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case of course is made up of what has been said by the witnesses and the exhibits which have been tendered. 26 During the trial, it may have become apparent that I have some familiarity with the relevant area. I have, however, put my local knowledge to one side and relied instead on the plans, photographs and video to inform me as to the geography of the roadway. I have not travelled along any of the relevant roads since the trial began.No Sympathy27 If I were hearing this case with a jury I would instruct them that they are to ignore feelings of sympathy in deciding whether or not the accused is guilty of the 3 charges he faces. Judges are not immune to feelings of sympathy. There were many poignant moments in this trial. I have recognised them, recognised their effect upon me and then put those feelings to one side. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to my judgment free from prejudice and sympathy. 28 It is undeniable that a terrible thing happened on 2 May 2003, and there may be a tendency to think that “someone must pay”. Such thoughts have also been put aside.29 Also irrelevant are any concerns I might generally feel regarding those epileptics who drive motor vehicles. The decision I have reached in this case is based on the law and the facts presented in this case. I have ignored any thoughts as to the consequences of my decision for road users who are epileptics and road users who are not.Onus of Proof30 The most important and fundamental principle of law which I will apply concerns the onus and standard of proof. Because this is a criminal trial, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly upon the Crown. The accused starts from the position that he is presumed innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty. 31 What the Crown must prove and prove beyond reasonable doubt are the ingredients or essentials facts contained in the charges arising from the indictment. I will indicate what the ingredients or essential facts arising from the charges on the indictment are in a little while. Right to Silence32 I heard evidence that the accused exercised his right to silence when he declined to be interviewed, although when he went to the police station with his solicitor he did comply with his obligations as a driver who had been involved in a motor vehicle collision.33 No adverse inference can be drawn against the accused from the fact that he declined to be interviewed. I will not use that fact against him in any way at all.Character34 Mr Barber relied on what he said what was evidence of the accused’s good character, including his driving record which Mr Barber said was evidence that he was generally a careful driver. There is much to be said in favour of the accused’s character. For example he was awarded the Order of Australia, and performed voluntary work with the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard.35 In his final submission Mr Barber said that the evidence established that the accused was highly regarded by his peers, and that he held a senior and responsible position in the Navy.36 Of course good character can be taken into account in 2 ways. I should firstly consider its effect upon the likelihood that the offender committed these offences. I should also take into account that people of good character are, generally speaking, less likely to lie than people of bad character and so the evidence of the accused’s good character makes the accused’s evidence, and what he said before, more likely to be true.37 However the evidence as to the accused’s character was not all one way. He could not be said to have an unblemished traffic record. I have seen many worse driving records, but I have also seen many better.38 As far as the credibility of the accused is concerned the Crown relied on a number of lies, and significant lies, told by the accused in relation to his medical condition. 39 Exhibit J contains the application for licence renewal filled in by the accused on 29h July 2000. The form contains a number of questions which the applicant answered by ticking either “no” or “yes”. By that means the accused answered “no” to the following 3 questions: 
     
     “have you ever had any type of epilepsy”,  
     
     
     “have you ever had attacks of giddiness, blackouts, fainting, or other sudden periods of unconsciousness”  
     
     
     and perhaps less importantly “do you have any medical or mental disabilities which may affect your driving”.  
    This is in spite of the accused declaring, by way of his signature,  “that the information provided in this application is complete, true and correct in every detail”. 40 The lies on the 2000 licence renewal are entirely consistent with the similar form filled in by the accused in 1995. There again he denied ever having any type of epilepsy and attacks of giddiness, blackouts etc. Thus the accused told repeated lies, and significant lies, about his condition when renewing his driver’s licence. 41 Similar lies can be seen in Exhibit G which shows what the accused told his employer. And even the accused’s work with the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard, on which he relies as evidence of his good character, led to the revelation of more lies told by the accused concerning his medical condition, this time as part of his application for, and renewal of, his boat licence.42 As far as the accused’s character is concerned those falsehoods suggest that he is prepared to tell lies, and tell them repeatedly in order to advance his own interests. He wanted to drive, he wanted to work, and he wanted to perform work with the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard and he was prepared to tell repeated lies to avoid any investigation which may have led to him being unable to do those things. It is of note that one of the most easily accepted pieces of evidence given by the accused was when agreed that:  
     
      
      “at any time you perceive there’s an advantage, you will lie for your advantage?” 
      
    43 Because of the repeated lies told by the accused, when taken together with the other aspects of the accused’s evidence I will discuss, I do not propose to take into account what Mr Barber said is evidence of the accused’s good character as making it more likely that the accused is telling the truth in court.More on the Credibility of the Accused44 I carefully watched the accused in the witness box. I carefully listened to his evidence. There were many things I saw and heard which caused me to doubt that I could accept the accused’s credibility when he gave evidence on important matters. I will give some examples. 45 In describing the history of his epilepsy, the accused said that when he was young, in his late teens, he would occasionally feel dizzy, mainly at night. He went to a doctor’s rooms at Warringah Mall where he discussed these dizzy spells with the doctor and was prescribed medication. Mr Barber then asked the accused about Exhibit G and in particular a medical examination conducted in 1990. The accused denied severe dizzy spells during that examination. Mr Barber asked him why he answered the question that way and the accused said that was because he had not had a daytime fit since 1986, nor had he had any dizzy spells at that time. However there was evidence to suggest that the accused has always had nocturnal fits and, as I have just noted, the accused described one of the symptoms of those fits as being dizzy. When asked a question about that, he at first answered “I want to answer the question but I just don’t know how to answer it” before finally agreeing that he would describe them as “dizzy spells”. 46 I am satisfied that the accused knew precisely how he should answer that question but was reluctant to do so because it would reveal him to have lied during the 1990 examination, that is that he deliberately said something which was untrue. 47 The next example concerns what was said to be the one occasion that a doctor raised with the accused the question of whether he should reveal his epilepsy to the RTA. The accused’s evidence was that Dr Worthington: 
     
      
       
      “said to me ‘do you drive’. And I said ‘yes I do’, and then he said something like ‘have you considered telling the RTA’ and I said ‘I don’t drive all that much’.”  
      
    48 This alerted my attention because I recalled the way Mr Barber opened this case to me. In that opening he said of the accused: 
     
      
      “he’s been driving enormous distances in his employment with the Navy, all over the state”.  
      
    49 When asked about this apparent contradiction, the accused attempted to suggest that he had understood the original question as simply asking whether or not he drove to work - as he usually got the ferry he felt that he did not drive all that much. However, consistent with the way Mr Barber had opened the case to me, it became apparent that once he got to work the accused would do what anyone would accept was a significant amount of driving, visiting Navy establishments at Nowra, Canberra and Williamstown. The accused’s attempt to explain away the obvious contradiction between not driving “all that much”, and “driving enormous distances” was very unimpressive indeed. 50 The accused is clearly an intelligent man. He has been involved in public relations for some time and he gave evidence that he had written about 12 books. He is therefore familiar with words and their meaning. Despite this there were many many occasions when the accused would fail to answer a direct question put to him by the Crown Prosecutor in cross examination. I am satisfied that this was not because he did not understand the question, but because he did not want to answer it. 51 An example of the accused, deliberately in my view, failing to answer a question concerns that fact that he had to be pressed as to whether when he went to see Dr Beran after an incident in 1986 (when he collapsed in front of a number of senior officers), he was concerned that he had suffered an epileptic fit. What should have been a simple matter for the accused to answer either “yes” or “no” took a number of questions before the accused would finally address the question and provide an answer. This is but one of many examples.52 The accused’s attitude towards the obligation to tell the truth in court can be seen in other answers he gave in cross examination, for example suggesting that it was only now that “he looked back” on things that he realised that he was lying when he denied his epilepsy. The accused had difficulty admitting what was obvious, that is that he told repeated lies to those people, and he knew they were lies at the time he told them.Elements53 As I mentioned before, some of the elements which the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt are not in dispute. I will deal with them before returning to those matters which are in dispute.54 Before I can find the accused guilty on the charges he faces I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the following 4 elements: 
     
     The accused was the driver of the Toyota Avalon sedan registration ZZZ-059. 
     
     
     That vehicle was involved in an impact with the Mitsubishi Lancer in which the Howies were travelling. 
     
     
     As a result of that impact the particular person named in each of the 3 charges was killed. 
     
     
     At the time of the impact the vehicle was being driven in a manner which was dangerous to other persons. 
    55 Two of those elements, the first and fourth require the Crown to prove that the accused was driving. He could not be said to be driving if he was acting involuntarily so I will pass over for the moment the issue as to whether the accused was driving his motor vehicle and return to it in due course.56 There is no dispute that the accused’s car was involved in an impact with the green Mitsubishi Lancer driven by Cameron Howie. There was evidence of that from various sources. Some people saw the collision and the investigations carried out by police afterwards confirmed their observations. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt therefore that for each of the 3 charges the Crown has proved that the accused’s vehicle was involved in an impact with Mr Howie’s vehicle.57 I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that as a result of this impact Cameron Howie, Shannon Howie and a Michaela Howie were killed. Again there is unchallenged evidence which establishes that as a result of the impact between the accused’s car and Mr Howie’s, the green Mitsubishi Lancer was propelled into oncoming traffic. Mr Fuller could do nothing to prevent his vehicle colliding with the green Mitsubishi. It is not relevant whether it was the initial impact with the accused’s car or, as is much more likely, the later impact with Mr Fuller’s 4-wheel drive which caused the deaths of each of Cameron, Shannon and Michaela Howie. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s car was involved in an impact which caused the deaths of each of those 3 people.58 Assuming that the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was acting voluntarily and was thus “driving” his car (an issue I will discuss very shortly), the accused was driving dangerously if the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that there has been some serious breach of the proper conduct of a vehicle — so serious as to be in reality, and not merely as a matter of speculation, potentially dangerous to another person or to other persons. 59 The nature of the driving on which the Crown relies depends on which of the three ways it presents its case is being considered. For the first two ways it relies on the speed the accused drove down Condamine Street after colliding with Dr Currie’s car and the failure by him to stop or slow down in sufficient time such that he would not collide with the rear of the Howies’ car. I do not understand the accused to challenge this aspect of the Crown case. The evidence clearly establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the car was being driven dangerously at the time of the impact with the car driven by Mr Howie.60 As far as the third way the Crown presents its case is concerned the Crown says on this issue that the accused’s driving was dangerous to other persons because there was a real and substantial risk, in other words a significant risk, that the accused would injure or kill someone as a result of him suffering a fit whilst driving and therefore being unable to exercise proper control over his motor vehicle. I will return to this issue in the event that it is necessary – that is if the Crown has not proved its case on one of the first two ways it presented its case.The First and Second Ways the Crown Presents its Case61 I will now focus on the first two ways the Crown presents its case. The Crown needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was acting voluntarily immediately before his car collided with the Howies’. (In relation to the third way the crown presents its case the Crown still must prove that the accused acted voluntarily, but this need not be immediately before the collision with the Howies’ car – as I have just said, I will deal with this matter, if necessary, later in this judgment). 62 As part of the elements I have referred to above, the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s actions were voluntary. If it does then it follows that the accused was “driving” his car. 63 Underpinning the criminal law is a basic notion. It was expressed by Toohey J in The Queen v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30 this way:  
     
      
      “a person is responsible only for conscious, voluntary and deliberate acts or omissions”.  
      
    64 Various terms have been used to describe the concept of voluntariness, as it is known to the law. Often used is the concept of “free will”, see for example Kitto J in Vallance v The Queen (1961) 108 CLR 56 at 64. In Falconer at 39, Mason CJ, Brennan and McHugh JJ explain: 
     
      
      “the notion of ‘will’ imports a consciousness in the actor of the nature of the act and a choice to do an act of that nature”.  
      
    65 I find this explanation to be a helpful one. A voluntary action is one: 
     
     which is consciously chosen  
     
     
     with an awareness of what the person was doing  
    66 The law does not punish people for actions over which they have no control. An example of this is sleepwalking. If a person, whilst sleep walking, went into someone’s home and took something from it then even though that could amount to the offence of breaking, entering and stealing, if the person had no control over his or her actions then that person is not guilty of a crime. Sleep walkers might be thought to have no control over what they are doing, that is their actions are not voluntary. An extreme example of this is to be found in the Canadian decision of R v Parks [1992] 2 SCR 871 where a man who, whilst asleep, drove a car and killed 2 people by stabbing them, was acquitted of murder by a jury.67 If I accidentally put my hand on a hot surface and as a reflex action pull it away quickly hitting someone who is standing nearby then it could not be said that I have hit that person voluntarily because I never really chose to move my arm, it being an automatic reaction to me touching the hot surface. 68 A similar conclusion would be reached in the case of a person who has lost control of his or her movements through cerebral palsy.69 One way of looking at the question of whether the accused’s actions were voluntary is to ask myself whether they were the product of his will. That is another way of expressing the concept of voluntariness: were the accused’s actions the product of his will? An action done by a person who is conscious of what the action is, and who consciously chooses to do that action, is something which is the product of his or her will and thus done voluntarily.70 It is important to distinguish between voluntariness on the one hand and intent or desire on the other. As Mason CJ Brennan and McHugh JJ said in Falconer : 
     
      
      “the requirement for willed act imports no intention or desire to affect a result by the doing of the act, but merely a choice, consciously made to do an act of the kind done”.  
      
    71 When the voluntariness issue is related to the accused’s driving, the result is that I have to examine whether the accused: 
     
     made a conscious choice as to how he would drive  
     
     
     at a time he was aware of what he was doing. 
    72 The Crown case is that the authorities establish the following: if a person is able to control a motor vehicle so that he or she can steer it along a road avoiding obstacles on the way, then that conduct, by definition, must be voluntary conduct. The Crown relies on English cases such as Broome v Perkins (1987) 85 Cr.App.R 321.  The result in that case has been described as “harsh”. Whether it is harsh or not does not really matter, the more important question being whether it is consistent with the law of New South Wales which binds me, and the answer to that question in turn depends on what the judges of the Queen’s Bench meant by a passage relied on by the Crown at page 332. It seems, from the result in Broome v Perkins, that the English judges were of the view that if the mind of an accused reacts to external stimuli and then directs the body’s movement, that person must be acting voluntarily.73 The test applied in Broome v Perkins, relied on by the Crown, would perhaps even describe as voluntary conduct the actions of person who, in the example I gave earlier, moved his or her hand quickly after touching something hot – in such a case the mind is reacting to external stimuli and directing appropriate movement. 74 However I do not consider that the Crown submissions, based as they are on English cases, represent the law in New South Wales. As I have indicated, the High Court in Falconer speaks of a consciousness of the nature of the act and a choice to do an act of that nature. The Crown Prosecutor’s submission, and the decision in Broome v Perkins fail to distinguish between choices and automatic reactions. It is accepted in law and in medicine that a person’s mind can direct the movement of that person’s limbs such as to avoid obstacles when that person is acting automatically, that is without consciously choosing what to do. I am satisfied that automatic reactions in response to stimuli are not sufficient to demonstrate a conscious choice. An automatic response to stimuli therefore does not demonstrate voluntary behaviour. 75 Of course there are two competing submissions put to me. The Crown says that the accused’s conduct immediately before the fatal collision was voluntary and the accused says his conduct was not. It is not a matter of which submission I prefer, the Crown bearing the onus of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.The Evidence Concerning the Voluntariness Issue.76 Quite early in the piece, the accused suggested the possibility of fit or blackout as a cause of the collision. In particular, at 5.04 pm he spoke to an ambulance officer who was treating him at the crash site, Alexander Law. The accused, who appeared to be alert and showing good logic at the time suggested to the officer that he may have blacked out. Later on, whilst the accused was being transported to Royal North Shore Hospital, he again raised this possibility with Mr Law.77 On 7 May 2003 when the accused went to Manly police station he declined to be interviewed but he again suggested that he blacked out.78 Whilst the fact that the accused raised the possibility of him having blacked out fairly soon after the collision tends to point in favour of his credibility on this issue, I have to take into account other aspects of the evidence which tend to suggest to the contrary. Here in particular I refer of course to the lies told by the accused to his employer, to Waterways and, even more relevantly, to the Roads and Traffic Authority when applying for his drivers licence to be extended.79 That evidence reveals a preparedness on the part of the accused to tell lies to his advantage, even over very important matters. This effects the weight I should give to his early suggestions that he suffered a blackout or seizure. A further reason why I should place less weight on them is that there are some contradictions in what he told various people such as the triage nurse at Royal North Shore Hospital, the ambulance officer Mr Law, Dr Hing and Dr Lau. 80 Whilst I will certainly take into account the early suggestion by the accused of the possibility of blackout I will, in the circumstances of this case, pay more attention to the external observations made by others in determining whether the accused suffered a seizure. Much of that evidence is also relevant to the issue whether the accused was driving voluntarily even if he suffered a seizure.81 I will now examine the evidence on this issue. That evidence relates to a number of interrelated questions: 
     
     Stephen Riley’s description of the accused’s driving on 2 May 2003. 
     
     
     Did the accused signal with his right hand blinker immediately before reaching Campbell Parade. 
     
     
     Did he brake before hitting Dr Currie’s vehicle? 
     
     
     Did he steer his car around obstacles and in such a way that it remained in the correct lane. 
     
     
     Did the accused’s vehicle accelerate away after colliding with Dr Currie’s vehicle?  
     
     
     Did he brake before hitting the Howies’ car? 
     
     
     What did the accused do immediately after his vehicle stopped after colliding with Mr Wiebe’s vehicle? 
     
     
     What the accused said to the ambulance officer at the scene. 
     
     
     His behaviour as observed by Senior Constable Gillard. 
     
     
     Other observations of the accused at the scene. 
     
     
     Observations of the accused at hospital. 
     
     
     What accused said to police on 7 May 2003. 
    82 The evidence relating to those questions is conveniently discussed under a number of headings, but I will emphasise that I have not formed my conclusions on the various matters I am about to discuss by examining only the evidence directly relevant to the issue identified under that heading. In this case there is an interrelationship between the evidence under the various headings – a matter I have borne firmly in mind.The State of the Accused at Campbell Parade83 On 2 May 2003, Mr Riley saw the accused’s car while they were still on the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation. He described the accused darting in and out of traffic although that turned out to be simply a movement by the accused’s car from the middle lane to the left lane and then back again. Clearly the accused was in control of his motor vehicle at that stage (no suggestion has been made to the contrary). 84 Mr Riley also said that it appeared that the white Toyota was in a hurry, although as Mr Barber pointed out the accused’s car was not too much in front of Mr Riley’s when they got down to the Campbell Parade intersection. 85 Even accepting that Mr Riley’s evidence is completely accurate as to his observations of the accused’s driving whilst on the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation they do not assist me when it comes to the state of the accused as he approached Campbell Parade. 86 At that intersection, there was a car in between Mr Riley and the accused. Mr Riley saw the accused’s right indicator come on, the accused turn his head to the right as if to see if anything was there and then the accused changed lanes, colliding with Dr Currie’s car as he did so. She was apparently stopping at the same time as the accused changed lanes and he ran into the left hand side of the rear of Dr Currie’s car. If accepted, this evidence could suggest that the accused was conscious of what he was doing and able to control his motor vehicle immediately before it collided with Dr Currie’s car, although there is of course another competing suggestion - that the accused performed these actions automatically whilst undergoing a complex partial seizure. 87 I can see no reason to doubt the reliability of Mr Riley’s evidence (which is of course not to reverse the onus of proof). If it was contrary to other reliable evidence then it may be that I would reject the observations of Mr Riley I have just described as being mistaken. 88 Apart from Mr Riley, evidence was given by a number of witnesses from different vantage points. Most of the witnesses were also travelling north in Condamine Street. But there were also other witnesses nearby: one was travelling south in Condamine Street, one was in Campbell Parade facing east; two were in Campbell Parade facing west; and some more were in Miller’s Reserve. 89 In reviewing the evidence on this matter I have been very careful to take into account that the action of Dr Currie’s car spinning around would have caused the sound of tyres screeching on the roadway. It is thus very important when examining the evidence of those who heard tyre-screeching sounds to consider whether they were heard before or after the collision with Dr Currie’s car. To make it perfectly clear, screeches which were heard after the collision could not safely be used as an indication that the accused braked before the collision. Screeches heard by those who heard no collision may also be the sound of Dr Currie’s car spinning. 90 I must also take into account the evidence of Mr Anderson, a Consulting Engineer, who gave evidence before me as to the results of experiments he conducted on a Toyota Avalon fitted with anti-lock brakes and another car not fitted with anti-lock brakes. The results of his experiments were that at no time did the ABS equipped vehicle produce any tyre smoke under heavy braking, although there were some sounds of tyre screeching on the roadway. No noticeable tyre marks were left by any of his braking manoeuvres in the ABS equipped vehicle. 91 Mr Anderson’s evidence is particularly important in assessing the reliability of the evidence of those witnesses who said they saw tyre smoke coming from the accused’s vehicle. His experiments would tend to suggest that such observations were wrong. Those witnesses who heard tyre screeches which they attributed to the Avalon may, in the light of his experiments, have been accurate, although it would seem that prolonged tyre screeching sounds are unlikely to have been generated by the Avalon at any stage.92 With those considerations in mind, there is evidence which points to the conclusion that the accused applied the brakes of his car before colliding with Dr Currie’s. 
     
     Mr Lever heard the screech of brakes before the collision with Dr Currie’s car (he also said he saw smoke).  
     
     
     Mr Lengel heard a screech of tyres before the bang at Campbell Parade. 
     
     
     Mr Wilkinson heard a screech and saw the white car skid for half a metre, (he was another witness to say that he saw smoke coming from its tyres before the collision).  
     
     
     Ms Thasler heard a screech and smelt a rubber smell before hearing the sound of a collision. 
     
     
     Mr Riley saw the brake lights of the Toyota come on before the collision. 
    93 Some witnesses said that they heard a screech after the collision which, as I have indicated is consistent with Dr Currie’s car being spun around, and in the absence of evidence that they also heard screeches before the collision with Dr Currie’s car, tends to suggest the absence of hard braking by the accused before that collision.94 Other witnesses, for example Mr Johnson, saw and heard no collision at all so their evidence does not assist as it is impossible to tell whether they heard the sound of the accused’s car braking before the collision (if that is indeed what he did) or the sound of Dr Currie’s car spinning after the collision. It is not surprising that the sound of the collision at Campbell Parade was not heard by some witnesses, particularly those in Miller’s Reserve. The collision appears to have been relatively minor.95 In the light of the evidence of Mr Anderson, and the contradictory evidence from the eye witnesses, there is some doubt as to whether the accused applied the brakes of the Avalon before the collision with Dr Curries’ car. However there was reasonably consistent evidence from the witnesses, the weight of which was in no way affected by Mr Anderson’s experiments, as to what happened after the collision – in particular, the way the accused’s car moved after the collision with Dr Currie’s car. 96 That evidence establishes that the accused manoeuvred his car around Dr Currie’s. That evidence came from Dr Currie herself, Mr Moore, Mr Badge, Ms Sloan and Mr Wilkinson. Indeed Mr Moore described what the accused did as “a brilliant piece of driving”. 97 Finally as regards the accused’s use of the accelerator after the collision with Dr Currie’s car, the almost universal evidence from those who saw the accused’s car proceed down Condamine Street was that it was: accelerating; zooming; speeding up. Did the Accused Brake Before Colliding with the Howies’ Car?98 On the next question, namely whether the accused applied the brakes immediately before his car collided with the Howies’ car, there was again substantial evidence pointing both ways. This is not surprising.  
     
     Some witnesses had a better view than others.  
     
     
     Some witnesses relied on what they heard whilst other witnesses relied on what they saw.  
     
     
     One witness, Dr Currie, did not tell police something she later said in Court.  
     
     
     Some witnesses gave evidence of seeing and hearing things which Mr Anderson’s evidence suggests is at least unlikely. 
     
     
     And finally, the evidence of the lack of skid marks on the surface of Condamine Street is of little assistance one way or the other. 
    99 Given that state of the evidence no satisfactory conclusion can be drawn as to whether the accused did or did not apply the brakes immediately before his collision with the Howies’ car. I accept that evidence which establishes that the accused did not apply the brakes tends to support the conclusion that he was not acting voluntarily immediately before his car collided with the Howies’. There are other, possible inferences, for example that he was looking behind him to see what had happened at Campbell Parade or whether anyone was following him, but the absence of braking before colliding with the Howies’ car is more easily explained by a seizure than by other mechanisms.100 If the accused was not having a seizure he could not have failed to be aware of the banked up traffic in front of him after he went through the Campbell Pde intersection. He was not going to be able to escape by continuing down Condamine Street as his flight would come to an end within a few hundred metres. Whilst an interest in what was happening at the intersection behind him may explain a glance, or even something longer, in the mirror, it does not explain the observed behaviour of the accused’s car which was to zoom down towards stationary traffic blocking all north bound lanes just a short distance away.Observations Made of the Accused After the Collision101 A number of people gave evidence as to the appearance and behaviour of the accused after the collision. Many of those observations suggest that the accused was dazed or bewildered. It seems that Daryl Johnson, an off duty fire brigade officer, was the first person to see the accused after the collision. Mr Johnson asked the accused if he was alright but received no reply although he did see the accused getting out of his car. Mr Wiebe was probably the second person to see him. Mr Weibe said that the accused looked a little bit dazed when he first got out of his car. Some witnesses, for example Phillip Ashworth, Patrick Lever and Michael Fuller, suggest the accused acted as though he was uninterested in what was going on,.102 One of the first police officers to arrive at the collision scene was Senior Constable Brett Gillard. When he first arrived there he could not find the driver of the Toyota Avalon. He then performed various aspects of his duty as a police officer such as organising traffic diversions. Some time after he first arrived he saw the accused standing at the driver’s door of the Toyota. He seemed to be about to get into the car. Senior Constable Gillard ran across the roadway and spoke to the accused. The following conversation then took place: 
     
      
       
      “Is this your car?”- “Yes.” 
       
      “You were involved in an accident.”- “No.” 
       
      “You had an accident up at the top of the street (pointing in the direction of Campbell Parade) and…” - “No.” 
       
      “You had this accident here, look at your car.” 
      
    103 Constable Gillard’s evidence was that at this point the accused looked at his car and then looked puzzled, he made no further comment, and appeared disoriented. He had a blank look on his face and appeared to be in shock.104 Another person who was on the scene early was Sean Wilkinson. I will quote some important aspects of his evidence: 
     
      
       
      “Q. When you spoke to the person who you identified as driving the white car did you make any observations of him? 
       
       
      A. Yeah he seemed to be in shock to me. I said to him “What have you done” you know and all that sort of thing and he just said to me “Oh what, what, what have I done” and he seemed to be in shock.” 
      
    105 Mr Wilkinson said that it appeared that the driver of the white car, who was of course the accused, didn’t know what he had done.106 And then to confirm that that was his opinion, Mr Barber suggested: 
     
      
      “Q. That from the tone of his voice it appeared to you that he didn’t know what had happened? 
       
       
      A. Yes. Yep” 
      
    107 There is other evidence which suggests, at least after a short time, the accused was aware of his surroundings. For example, at a time that Mr Wiebe estimated was about 8 to 10 minutes after the collision, the accused asked to borrow Mr Wiebe’s mobile phone so that he could ring his wife. When Constable Preston asked the accused whether he was the driver of the white car the accused did not answer at first, but when the question was repeated louder he said “yes”. The accused was also able to produce his licence from his wallet when Constable Preston demanded it. 108 The evidence of the ambulance officer who treated the accused, Mr Law, deserves particular mention for three reasons: 
     
     First, he was the only witness whose sole focus was on the condition of the accused.  
     
     
     Secondly, he was trained to assess the accused’s condition, and  
     
     
     Thirdly he made notes, either soon after making his observations or as he made them.  
    109 Mr Law noted that the accused was polite, alert and had no trouble conversing. He displayed good logic in responding to Mr Law’s questions. Mr Law said he looked at motor neuron responses in regard to strength of limbs, pupil reaction and recollection of personal details. He found no motor or sensory deficit and the accused had a good recollection of his personal details. His Glasgow Coma Scale Score was at the top of the range indicating a full level of consciousness. 110 Once the accused got to Royal North Shore Hospital he was seen by doctors and nurses who were also concerned with the condition of the accused, who were trained, and who made notes. Again there is nothing to suggest that at that time the accused was less than fully conscious and aware.111 The Crown relies heavily on these observations by Mr Law and hospital staff as part of its case that the accused was driving voluntarily when his car collided with the Howies’ a relatively short time earlier. It is however important to remember that these observations were made after many of the other observations to which I have referred and the unanimous medical evidence is that they are not at all inconsistent with the accused having suffered a complex partial seizure shortly beforehand.112 The evidence as to the behaviour of the accused as observed by those at the scene, before he was examined by Mr Law, is certainly suggestive of at least confusion on the part of the accused. Such confusion could be explained by him having had a fit. But that is not the only explanation I have to examine. A person in the accused’s position could well have difficulty appreciating what had happened, and comprehending that he had caused the carnage on Condamine Street, even if that person had not had any form of fit. What happened to the accused was violent, traumatic, and sudden. He was involved in three separate collisions. Both airbags in his car had deployed. The crash involving the Mitsubishi and Mr Fuller’s 4WD was even on the opposite side of the road to that on which he was travelling, and so the accused’s question “what what have I done?” has to be seen in that context. The Condition of the Avalon113 Also of possible relevance to this issue is the circumstance that when the Avalon is examined by Constable Cummings it is apparent that someone has turned off the ignition, removed the key, applied the parking brake, and placed the transmission in neutral. The evidence tends to suggest that the person who did these things was the accused and that he did this immediately after the collisions.114 I will explain why this is so. The only person seen to be in the driver’s seat of the white Avalon was the accused and he was not seen to re-enter that seat at any time after he got out. He was seen to sit on the rear seat and to remove items from the car, but there was no evidence that he returned to the driver’s seat and sat there, something he would have had to do to apply the parking brake which was operated by a foot pedal, not a lever between the front seats as is perhaps more common.115 Thus the evidence establishes that immediately after the collision the accused was dazed and confused, but sufficiently aware of his surroundings to place his car in neutral apply the parking brake, turn off the ignition and turn off the key before getting out. 116 No doubt someone who had just been involved in 3 separate motor vehicle collisions causing the vehicles 2 airbags to deploy would, in those circumstances be dazed, bewildered, and disoriented for a short time. Despite that this accused has been able to put his car in neutral, engage the parking brake, turn off the ignition, and remove the key very shortly after the collision and, within a relatively short time after that, made a rational request to Mr Wiebe, responded rationally to Constable Preston, and appeared alert, logical and fully conscious to a trained ambulance officer. 117 These matters need, however to be evaluated in the light of the medical evidence as to what happens to a person when suffering a complex partial seizure. I will discuss this in more detail shortly, but for the moment it should be noted that the Doctors: 
     
     place emphasis on the observations of the accused made by people such as Constable Gillard and Sean Wilkinson which suggest that he had no idea that his car had been involved in a collision, and 
     
     
     explain the movement of the ignition key, parking brake and gear lever as automatic behaviour which can be carried out by a person suffering a complex partial seizure. 
    The Conclusions to be Drawn118 The Crown called evidence from Dr Somerville and the accused called evidence from Dr Beran. There was no significant difference between the conclusions reached by those doctors. They are both eminently qualified neurologists. They both formed the opinion that the accused had suffered a complex partial seizure shortly before the collision between the accused’s car and that driven by Cameron Howie. Although those opinions were, at least initially, formed on the basis of statements they had read rather than the evidence that was given before me, it does not appear that there is any material difference between the facts the doctors have assumed and the evidence as it was given in Court.119 Dr Somerville, with whom Dr Beran agreed on this point, paid particular attention to the observations made of the accused immediately after the collision had occurred. I have already set out some of that evidence. That evidence reveals that the accused was unaware of what had happened. Whilst a person who had not suffered a complex partial seizure might be dazed by a violent series of collisions, Dr Somerville said that the difference between the way accused appeared and the way a merely dazed person would appear is that the latter would be aware that he had, for example, just been involved in a crash. The evidence as to how the accused appeared, however, suggested the contrary in this case. Senior Constable Gillard’s evidence suggested that the accused was not even aware that his car had been damaged until it was pointed out to him. Mr Wilkinson gave evidence that the accused asked him “what have I done” in a tone that suggested he was unaware of what had occurred.120 Although there is evidence to suggest that within a short period of time the accused was able to respond rationally to questions from, for example Alex Law, that is easily explained by the conclusion that the seizure had passed by the time Mr Law examined the accused.121 Dr Somerville was asked about the circumstance that the accused appears to have turned off his ignition, removed the key, applied the parking brake and placed the transmission in neutral before leaving his car. He considered this was capable of being regarded as automatic behaviour – the sort of thing that a person can do whilst suffering a complex partial seizure.122 In the present case, where the unanimous expert opinion is that the accused suffered a complex partial seizure, the Crown submission is that I would reject the expert opinions because they were based on what the accused told the doctors. The Crown says that because the accused would lie whenever it suits him I should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the doctors are wrong. The Crown relies on a particular answer given by Dr Somerville in evidence in chief: 
     
      
      Q. I am just asking you about what the accused said that his condition was. Is that based solely on the accused, what he told you? 
       
       
      A. Yes. 
      
    The Crown, presumably inadvertently, ignored the immediate clarification which took place after that evidence was given which resulted in Dr Somerville saying: 
     
      
      “I formed my opinion based on what he told me and on reading descriptions of the way he was driving”.  
      
    The Crown made no reference to other evidence of Dr Somerville such as this: 
     
      
       
      Q. If the, what the accused told you of how he felt prior to the intersection, I think he said to you of Campbell Parade, was different to what he told you, would your opinion be different? 
       
       
      A. I don’t think it would, because the way he felt before, it was only one of the many factors that led to the opinion that I formed. 
      
    123 In these circumstances the Crown submission that I am entitled to ignore Dr Somerville’s opinion because it is based “solely” on what the accused told him cannot be accepted. Having carefully considered the Crown’s submissions I can see no reason at all why I should reject Dr Somerville’s opinion. To put matters more precisely, and to emphasise that the Crown bears the onus of proof – in the light of all the evidence, including that to which the Crown made no reference in his final submissions, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dr Somerville’s opinion was wrong. 124 I mentioned before one of the possible explanations for the accused accelerating away from the Campbell Parade intersection after a minor traffic collision, even though the road ahead of him was blocked by traffic built up at the Kentwell Road lights. Such behaviour could be explained by a desire on the part of the accused to leave the scene of a traffic accident - to get away and escape the consequences of what he had done. However this does not seem a terribly likely explanation to me: the accused was in no particular danger of losing his licence through such things as an accumulation of points; the collision was minor; the number plate was memorable; the road ahead was blocked. The evidence of the accused’s good character is relevant here. That evidence suggests that the accused is not the sort of person who would drive like a maniac to avoid the consequences of a minor traffic accident – even one for which he was to blame. 125 There is a much more likely explanation which is related to what happens when a person suffers a complex partial seizure. Dr Somerville’s evidence was that such episodes can be associated with a straightening or stiffening of the limbs. If the accused’s foot was on the accelerator when his limbs straightened during a seizure then his car would speed off down the hill. This is exactly what was observed to have happened after the collision at Campbell Parade. Further Mr Moore described the appearance of the accused behind the wheel as having his arms stretched out in front of him, which is also consistent with the accused experiencing a stiffening of his limbs during a complex partial seizure126 A complex partial seizure does not mean that the accused loses complete control of his body. A person in a complex partial seizure is still able to perform automatic actions. Thus although there are some features of the way the accused’s car travelled that day which tend to suggest that the accused was not suffering a complex partial seizure (such as manoeuvring around Dr Currie’s car) they are not inconsistent with that occurring. It has to be firmly borne in mind that the expert called by the Crown indicated that he was maximally convinced that the accused had suffered a complex partial seizure. He was of this opinion even if the accused had braked before colliding with the Howies’ car. In those circumstances I can not be satisified beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not suffer a complex partial seizure.The 1993 Collision was also due to a Complex Partial Seizure127 One of the matters Dr Somerville took into account in coming to his conclusion regarding the 2003 collision concerned the 1993 collision. His evidence was that people with epilepsy tend to have stereotypical types of seizures and the startling similarity between the circumstances of the 1993 and 2003 collisions was a factor which he took into account.128 There is an element of circularity in using the circumstances of one collision to decide whether the other collision was due to a complex partial seizure but notwithstanding this logical difficulty I can understand how Dr Somerville came to his conclusion. I accept his conclusion regarding the 1993 collision as well as the 2003 collision.129 I am satisfied that the accused had a complex partial seizure immediately before the 1993 collision. This explains his lack of memory of what occurred between Warringah Mall and further down Condamine Street. The Crown has not proved that the Accused did not Suffer a Seizure130 It is significant that the expert evidence is unanimous. Both doctors called agreed with each other in concluding that the 2003 collision resulted from the accused suffering a complex partial seizure. I got the impression that Dr Beran was less convinced about the accused suffering a complex partial seizure before the earlier 1993 collision than Dr Somerville was but nevertheless they both agreed that that was the most likely explanation for the earlier collision as well.131 It is not simply a matter of me accepting the unanimous opinion of 2 experts without examining for myself the evidence on which those conclusions are based and the explanation for the opinions they have reached. I accept the expert opinions expressed by the doctors as being based on facts which I accept and which seem to me to be justified in the light of those facts and the phenomenon of complex partial seizures, as I understand them.Can a Person Suffering a Complex Partial Seizure Act Voluntarily?132 What I have said so far disposes of the first way the Crown presents its case. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved to me that the accused did not have a complex partial seizure. That brings me to the second way the Crown presents its case which was that even if he did have such a seizure, he nevertheless drove voluntarily. This is not an easy question to determine because the issues involved verge on the philosophical.133 Some cases on which the Crown relied suggested that what the law means as involuntary behaviour is behaviour where the accused loses complete control of his body and where there is no ability left in the mind to control, for example, the person’s limbs. However having looked at the authorities I am satisfied that the proper way to determine this issue is to ask myself the questions that I have earlier outlined, namely, whether the accused made a conscious choice as to how he would drive at a time he was aware of what he was doing.134 The way the Crown asked me to decide this matter would mean that a person who was sleep walking would nevertheless be acting voluntarily in that their eyes took in what was around them and their brain controlled their limbs such as to avoid obstacles. Dr Beran expressed the difference well when he talked about the difference between seeing and perceiving. A sleep walking mind may see obstacles and instruct the body to move around them but that does not mean that the person is perceiving what they are doing in the sense that they are conscious of where they are and make a choice as to what they do.The Doctors’ Views as to Voluntariness During a Seizure135 Although it is reasonably clear that people with epilepsy can carry out quite complex activity during a seizure, such as driving through intersections with traffic lights, avoiding collisions as they go, that does not necessarily mean that the person is acting voluntarily. Dr Somerville’s view was that those movements may be carried out automatically. Dr Somerville agreed with a proposition put to him by Mr Barber in cross examination that during a complex partial seizure: 
     
      
      “the person can’t wilfully make any choices, or willingly do an action other than an automatic action, which the brain causes to happen as a result of information it is receiving” 
      
    136 I will quote two further questions and answers from Dr Somerville’s evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. … in a complex partial seizure stimuli or information may be going into the brain via the eye without the driver necessarily being aware or conscious of what that stimulation is? 
       
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And simply acting automatically? 
       
       
      A. Yes” 
      
    137 In relation to driving with a seizure Dr Somerville said:  
     
      
      “I think all you can say is that his brain was – his brain was taking in enough information and processing it sufficiently to be able to get the car along the road.”  
      
    The Crown suggests that this necessarily means the accused was acting voluntarily. But as I have earlier indicated I think there is a clear distinction between a brain which reacts to stimuli automatically and a brain which is conscious and able to choose. 138 Dr Beran’s evidence was similar. He said that those who suffer a complex partial seizure are not conscious in the normal sense of the word but are only capable of acting automatically. When asked to describe someone in that state he said: 
     
      
      “basically they do not know what they’re doing and can give no recollection of what they’re doing and don’t have control over it”.  
      
    139 He explained later on that: 
     
      
      “to function at a conscious level there had to be perception and decision making. To react does not require conscious decision making”. 
      
    The Accused was not Acting Voluntarily During the Seizure140 After considering the evidence on this issue, both medical and eyewitness, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was acting voluntarily at the moment his car ran into the back of the Howies’ car. I am satisfied he was then suffering a complex partial seizure and that any movement of his body in response to external stimuli was not the result of a conscious choice, but was merely automatic behaviour of the kind an unconscious mind is capable of performing.The Third Way The Crown Puts Its Case141 When looking at the third way the Crown puts its case the live issues are whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that:  
     
     At a time when the accused was driving voluntarily he was driving dangerously. 
     
     
     This time was close enough in time to the collision as to make the driving at that time, in a practical sense, the cause of the impact and the deaths of the Howies. 
     
     
     The accused did not believe on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive (again using the word safe as a shorthand antonym for the concept of dangerousness in the 3 counts the accused faces). 
    142 I will look at these issues in a different order to that which I have just announced, beginning with the time issue.Temporal Proximity143 Although a glance at the charges may suggest that the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was driving dangerously at the time of the impact, that does not mean the precise second when the cars collided. If it did mean that, then because the accused was acting involuntarily whilst in a seizure, then he could not have been driving dangerously at the time of the impact and the Crown could never succeed in a case like this, or the more common case in a case where a driver falls asleep at the wheel.144 The driving I must look at in order to determine whether it was dangerous or not is the accused’s driving at a time which is close enough to the time of his car colliding with that driven by Mr Howie so that it can be said that at the time of the impact the accused was driving in a manner which was dangerous to another person or persons. 145 Although a person who is acting involuntarily can not be said to be “driving” his car, I must look at how the accused drove before he had a seizure that day and ask myself whether that was driving in a manner which is dangerous to another person or persons, as long as the driving before the seizure was, in a practical sense, the cause of the impact and the deaths of the Howies.146 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on the accused’s journey towards Manly Vale on 2 May 2003, he was driving voluntarily until he had a seizure – this coming upon him suddenly as he approached Campbell Parade. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in a real and practical sense it was his voluntary driving before the seizure started which caused the later fatal impact with the Howies’ car. Had it not been for the voluntary act of driving towards Manly Vale on 2 May 2003, his car would not have collided with the Howies’ car, causing their deaths.Was the Accused Driving Dangerously as he Approached Manly Vale?147 The question as to whether the accused was driving dangerously when he was voluntarily driving shortly before he had his seizure is an objective test. It does not matter, when considering this test, whether the accused believed that it was dangerous for him to drive or not. At this stage, his subjective thoughts as to such things as the likelihood that he would suffer a fit whilst driving are irrelevant. 148 As Barwick CJ said in McBride v The Queen (1965) 115 CLR 44 at 50: 
     
      
      “…it is the potentiality in fact of danger to the public in the manner of driving, whether realized by the accused or not, which makes it dangerous to the public within the meaning of the section”. 
      
    149 The issue I have to decide is whether, when he was voluntarily driving along Condamine Street towards Manly Vale, as a result of his condition, the mere fact of him driving in that condition constituted driving in a manner dangerous to another person or persons, because driving in that condition subjected another person or persons to some real, significant and substantial risk of injury or death over and above that ordinarily associated with the driving of a motor vehicle, including driving by persons who may, on occasions, drive with less than due care and attention. 150 As to whether the accused’s driving was dangerous in that sense, it is the case for both the Crown and the accused that there was an increased risk of the accused having a motor vehicle collision because of the risk that he would suffer a seizure. The case for the accused even attempted to, as I understand it, provide me with a statistical probability of the accused suffering a seizure whilst driving but I am not going to approach this question in any mathematical way. Of course I take into account that, generally speaking, the longer a person goes without a daytime seizure, the lower the risk of that person suffering such a seizure during any given period in the future. 151 Mr Barber attempted to persuade me that because the accused would probably have been allowed to renew his licence even if he told the truth about his epilepsy, then his driving cannot have been dangerous. I reject that submission for a number of reasons. 152 Dr Beran gave evidence that had he assessed the accused shortly before the collisions on 2 May 2003 he would have allowed him to drive. This however does not mean that the accused is not driving dangerously in the sense that I have outlined earlier, based on the authorities which bind me. Although Dr Beran’s opinion is clearly evidence tending to suggest the conclusion that the accused was not driving dangerously, there are, I gather, value judgments made by doctors in Dr Beran’s position which balance the rights of those with epilepsy against the risks they present. This is not the same as the test I must apply. Dr Beran’s opinion is relevant to that test but far from determinative. 153 The second reason for rejecting the conclusion that the accused could not have been driving dangerously because Dr Beran would have recommended that he be given a licence is that is that the figures on which the guidelines used by Dr Beran and others are based, are, as Dr Somerville recognised, pretty rubbery. Arbitrary figures have been taken as to such things as the number of hours which the person spends behind the wheel in a day (45 minutes was chosen) and the risk that there will be a collision if the person suffers a fit whilst driving (the figure chosen was 50%). One of the reasons the criminal law does not operate on standards of mathematics is because it does not engage in the attribution of arbitrary values to chances, such as may be appropriate for the development of standards applied by medical practitioners and licensing authorities. (I note in passing that a figure of 45 mins per day behind the wheel may not be terrible relevant to a person who, in the words of Mr Barber when opening this case, drove “enormous distances in his employment with the navy”, or, working the other way to a person who usually took the ferry to work).154 A third reason for at least questioning the conclusion that the accused could not have been driving dangerously because Dr Beran would have recommended that he be given a licence, is that Dr Beran’s opinion may not have been unanimous. Dr Worthington appears to have been of the opposite view – at least as at 30 August 2001. Despite being told by the accused that his driving was “minimal” Dr Worthington said that it was of “some concern” that the accused had failed to tell the RTA about his seizure disorder.155 Even if the accused would have been granted a licence to drive if he had told the truth to the RTA, that does not determine the issue. The test for dangerousness is not whether the accused would have been licensed to drive if he told the truth, but, I repeat, whether at the relevant time, as a result of his condition, the mere fact of him driving in that condition constituted driving in a manner dangerous to another person or persons because driving in that condition subjected them to a real, substantial and significant risk of injury or death over and above that ordinarily associated with the driving of a motor vehicle, including driving by persons who may, on occasions, drive with less than due care and attention. 156 The question as to whether the accused would have been granted a licence to drive if he had told the truth may, and I need not decide this now, be relevant on sentence. It does not determine the question of guilt.Comment on the Standards Applied by the Doctors157 It is apparent that the standards used by Dr Beran and others are an attempt to balance the interests of those suffering medical conditions which may affect that person’s ability to drive and the interests of other road users who may be injured or killed if that medical condition leads to a collision on the roads. 158 Minds may differ as to whether the standard that has been chosen, a 1% increase in the risk of collisions per year is appropriate. Much would depend on the way the risk is expressed. For example if, the 1% figure is used to calculate the chance that a 20 year old will have a collision caused by a seizure in his or her lifetime, I expect that most people would say that the 1% figure was too risky. But if that same figure of 1% is used to compare the lifetime risks of collision for drivers who do suffer the medical conditions referred to in the standards and those who don’t, I expect that most people would say that the 1% figure is about right.159 It is no part of my function, nor would it be the function of any jury hearing this matter, to engage in such judgments. The test of dangerousness is set out in the authorities which bind me and the appropriateness of the standards used by the RTA and the doctors who gave evidence in this case is irrelevant to that test. The comment I have just made is intended to emphasise the fact that I have considered the issue of dangerousness without considering myself bound by those standards. The Increased Risk of a Collision160 Dr Somerville gave evidence that: 
     
      
      “everybody with epilepsy who drives is at increased risk of having a seizure while they’re driving”  
      
    and  
     
      
      “everybody who has a seizure is at risk of having another seizure, and if they drive a car there’s a risk that that seizure is going to happen while they’re driving”. 
      
    161 That expression of opinion by Dr Somerville was accepted without question by both the Crown and Mr Barber on behalf of the accused. Dr Beran’s evidence was not to the contrary.162 That part of Dr Somerville’s evidence concerns those with epilepsy and those who had suffered seizures generally, but there is also evidence on this issue of particular application to the accused.163 The accused has epilepsy. Before 2 May 2003, even while regularly taking medication, the accused had had seizures, both nocturnal and daytime. The unchallenged evidence is therefore that there was a risk that he would have another seizure whilst driving, should he continue to drive. 164 From his teenage years (or according to Exhibit U from the age of 10), the accused has suffered from nocturnal seizures which have not been eliminated by any form of medication. He continued to suffer from nocturnal seizures up until 2 May 2003. He was taking his medication regularly but the nocturnal seizures still occurred. The accused also has had a number of daytime seizures. His first appears to have been in a lift in North Sydney in 1970. He had one in 1986 whilst in uniform, 3 in early 1987 (exhibit T), one in 1991 (exhibit 1) and one in 1993 which led to a significant motor vehicle collision involving 4 cars. Thus in a period of about 7 years there is evidence of 6 daytime seizures. Dr Worthington’s “concern” expressed in 2001 at the accused’s failure to tell the RTA about his seizure disorder seems, in the light of subsequent events, to have been entirely justified. On the other hand there is no evidence of any daytime seizure between 1993 and 2003 although the nocturnal seizures continued. 165 I am not entirely sure that I have before me evidence of all of the daytime seizures suffered by the accused. After all, as the Crown points out, the accused may well have lied about the number of daytime seizures he suffered. Further some of the earlier seizures appear to have been “in the morning on waking” (see exhibit Q) - whether they are more accurately described as nocturnal or daytime I don’t know because neither of the Doctors was asked. Nevertheless I will proceed on the basis that the accused’s history of daytime seizures is accurately set out above - a number of such seizures up to 1993, but none between 1993 and 2003.166 Of relevance also to the risk of a collision following a seizure whilst driving is the fact that, as the accused told Dr Somerville, he would have no warning of an approaching attack. It may be one thing in terms of objective dangerousness for a person to be driving where there is a risk of seizure which would be preceded by a significant period in which the person can tell that a seizure is about to develop, and a case such as the present where the attacks come without much, if any, warning.Daytime Seizures After 2 May 2003167 In the light of what I am about to now say it is important to remember that the issue I am presently considering is whether the accused’s driving was objectively dangerous. His knowledge or otherwise of the level of risk that he presented to other road users is, at this stage, irrelevant. 168 There are 2 matters to which I have not yet referred which I have taken into account in assessing the objective dangerousness of the accused’s driving on 2 May 2003. The 2 matters are related.169 The first matter is that the evidence suggests that the accused was developing sleep apnoea leading up to 2 May 2003, and suffering from sleep apnoea that day. Dr Beran was asked: 
     
      
      Q. Is it possible that at the time prior to the accident that Mr Gillett was suffering from sleep apnoea if he was diagnosed later last year with that complaint? 
       
       
      A. Most definitely. But it was not diagnosed prior to it. 
      
    170 The second matter to which I have yet to refer, clearly related to the first, is that the accused continued to have daytime seizures after the 2 May 2003 (that evidence is to be found in Dr Beran’s report exhibit 1).171 The reason these events are related is that as Dr Beran said in oral evidence:  
     
      
      “sleep deprivation is a well accepted provocateur for seizures”  
      
    and in his written report,  
     
      
      “sleep apnoea… is also known as a trigger for exacerbating epilepsy”. 
      
    172 Dr Beran’s evidence was: 
     
      
      Q. Is it your view that his sleep deprivation that he may have been experiencing at that time from sleep apnoea, could have triggered the change from nocturnal seizures to a daytime seizure? 
       
       
      A. Yes. 
      
    173 Despite extensive tests, sleep apnoea is the only thing which Dr Beran has found which would have caused the accused to have a number of daytime seizures after 10 years of only nocturnal seizures. The accused has now been treated for sleep apnoea and has not had a seizure for over a year. I am therefore satisfied that, unbeknownst to him, the accused had sleep apnoea on 2 May 2003, and that this is what caused him to have the daytime seizure on 2 May 2003 and the ones which followed after the collision.174 It is important to emphasise that I am here considering objective dangerousness. There is no evidence that the accused knew that he was developing sleep apnoea. It was not diagnosed until the accused underwent sleep studies as ordered by Dr Beran in the months after 2 May 2003, the results being finally confirmed by the repeat study performed on 6 August 2003. Whether the accused believed that it was dangerous for him to drive on 2 May 2003 must be assessed in the light of what he knew as at that date, not in the light of what subsequent investigations have revealed.175 But I can see no reason that I should not take into account events after 2 May 2003 in deciding whether, assessed objectively, the driving of the accused on that day was dangerous. To use an analogy, if after one collision the same vehicle is involved in a series of further collisions, and later investigations reveal that the vehicle has faulty brakes, the events after the first collision can be considered in determining whether it was being driven dangerously at the time of the first collision.176 In his final submissions, Mr Barber accepted the relevance, and indeed importance, of the accused’s undiagnosed sleep apnoea and the daytime seizures after 2 May 2003.177 Thus in assessing the objective dangerousness of the accused’s driving of 2 May 2003 I will take into account the 2 related circumstances I have just identified. They demonstrate the invalidity of an assessment of dangerousness based only on the accused’s history up to 2 May 2003. The absence of evidence of daytime seizures for 10 years might suggest a low risk of further daytime seizures. But that risk is far from low when the accused’s sleep apnoea is taken into account. The high risk that he would suffer a daytime seizure because of that condition is borne out by the fact that he had further daytime seizures after 2 May 2003.178 It is to be noted that Dr Beran’s calculations as to the level of risk of the accused suffering a daytime seizure, on which Mr Barber heavily relied, do not take these circumstances into account. This is another reason that Dr Beran’s conclusions were much less helpful than they might otherwise have been.179 Another matter of relevance to the level of increased risk to other road users posed by the accused’s driving on 2 May 2003 is Dr Somerville’s evidence concerning the 1993 collisions. Dr Somerville said, in relation to that incident that: 
     
      
      “Epileptic seizures within a given patient tend to be stereotyped from one attack to the next”.  
      
    180 To summarise this part of my judgment, in deciding whether the accused was driving dangerously on 2 May 2003 because of the risk that he would suffer a seizure I take into account in particular: 
     
     Dr Somerville’s uncontradicted evidence that because he was suffering from epilepsy there was an increased risk of him suffering a seizure whilst driving.  
     
     
     Whilst taking medication the accused suffered nocturnal seizures up until 2 May 2003. 
     
     
     The accused suffered at least 6 daytime seizures even whilst taking his medication albeit that the last of these was 10 years before 2 May 2003. 
     
     
     He would get little or no warning of an approaching attack. 
     
     
     The medical evidence is clear as to the decreasing chance of a daytime seizure occurring as time passed without one. 
     
     
     The daytime seizure in 1993 led to a significant motor vehicle collision and that seizures within a particular patient tend to be stereotyped from one attack to the next. 
     
     
     On 2 May 2003 the accused had undiagnosed sleep apnoea. 
     
     
      After 2 May 2003 the accused had further daytime seizures. 
    181 After considering the evidence on this issue carefully I am therefore satisfied that because of the accused’s epilepsy, and more precisely because of the risk that he would suffer a seizure whilst driving, his driving in that condition shortly before he had a seizure on 2 May 2003 made that driving a real danger to other people. The fact that the accused was driving whilst there was that risk of seizure, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, subjected other people to a real, substantial and significant risk of injury or death over and above that ordinarily associated with the driving of a motor vehicle, including driving by persons who may, on occasions drive with less than due care and attention. As I have I hope made clear, I am satisfied that the risk, that is the risk of injury or death to other people, was far from speculative or fanciful. 182 The Crown has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that shortly before he suffered a seizure the accused was driving in a manner dangerous to other persons and for all three charges that particular element is thus satisfied.Did the Accused Believe that it not Dangerous for him to Drive?183 We now come to the next issue under this third way that the Crown presents its case, which is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe on reasonable grounds that his driving subjected another person or persons to a real, substantial and significant risk over and above that associated with the driving of a motor vehicle including driving by people who may, on occasions, drive with less than due care and attention. The risk I am speaking of here is again not some fanciful risk, but so serious a risk as to be in reality, and not merely as a matter of speculation, potentially dangerous to other people on or near the road. 184 It is enough if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not have that belief. If it does so then the question as to the reasonableness of that belief does not arise.185 At the risk of over-repetition, when considering what the accused actually believed I must ignore anything which the accused did not know. On 2 May 2003 he did not know he was suffering from sleep apnoea. He thus did not know of the increased risk of him suffering a daytime seizure as a result of his sleep apnoea.The Accused’s Attitude to his Driving.186 The accused gave evidence that he thought it was safe for him to drive in the time leading up to May 2003. Just what the accused meant by the word “safe” was not explored by Mr Barber so the accused’s answer has that limitation in assessing whether the accused’s belief as to safety was the same as the test I have to apply.187 A further problem with the accused’s evidence is that he is, as I have explained, a man whose credibility I find difficult to accept when it comes to important issues in this case.188 Part of the reason the accused said that he thought it was safe for him to drive in 2003 was that he did not believe, although he now accepts, that the 1993 collision was caused by him having a seizure. I do not accept that. The accused described the incident this way. He said the last thing he remembered was driving past Warringah Mall with the next thing he remembered being getting out of the car after the accident had occurred. He said that until this trial started he believed the collision was caused by him bending over to change a cassette and thus taking his eyes off the road. 189 I reject the accused’s evidence that the conclusion that his 1993 collision was due to him suffering a seizure only became apparent to him after this trial started. Whilst his explanation that he was changing a cassette may account for a collision it would not explain his loss of memory. Although Dr Beran suggested that often in motor vehicle collisions people lose consciousness and therefore suffer a loss of memory, the accused did not suggest that he had formed the view that his loss of memory occurred that way. In any case there is no evidence of the accused losing consciousness as a result of the collision, and in fact the evidence of the accused’s behaviour immediately after the last of the collisions suggests to the contrary.190 It must be remembered that the accused suffered a loss of memory as a result of the seizure in 1986 (the matter which prompted him to go off to see Dr Beran in the first place). We also know that he was having daytime seizures early in 1987 and a seizure in 1991. I am satisfied therefore that the accused could not have genuinely believed that his collision in 1993 was unrelated to his epilepsy.191 The accused was asked in cross examination about a statement which exhibit 1 suggests was made to Dr Beran concerning the accused’s history of daytime seizures. Dr Beran’s report says that the accused and his wife were adamant that he had suffered no daytime seizures since 1991. When the accused was asked about this statement in cross examination he said that it was possible that when he had told Dr Beran this he meant 1993 instead of 1991. When pressed, the accused realised that this could not be the case if what he had said about when he first thought that the 1993 crash was the result of a seizure was true, but at no time, despite being given the opportunity, did he satisfactorily explain how he could have meant 1993 when he apparently said 1991. This is significant because it tends to suggest that when the accused saw Dr Beran early in 2004 he, that is the accused, was of the view that the 1993 collision was caused by a seizure. Only if that were the case could the accused have given the evidence he did before me as to the possibility of confusion between 1991 and 1993.192 Thus I conclude, and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused knew at the time of the 1993 collision or very soon afterwards, that he had had a seizure and that this had led to a collision involving 4 cars. 193 That finding is significant because after the 1993 incident the accused renewed his licence. Almost exactly 2 years later, on the 14 August 1995 the accused filled in his licence renewal form and denied that he had epilepsy. When asked by Mr Barber why he had said no to the appropriate question, he said that he “felt that the drugs were controlling me perfectly”. However he had not changed his medication between 1993 and 1995 and being aware, as I have found, that the 1993 collision resulted from him having a seizure, the lie told to the RTA on the 14 August 1995 cannot be justified in the way the accused attempted to. Even if, contrary to my finding, the accused did not attribute the 1993 collision to a seizure he still knew of seizures in 1986, and 1987. 194 The accused at no stage believed that compliance with his medication meant that he would not have a seizure. He said that Tegretol which he was put on after seeing Dr Beran following the incident in 1986 reduced the chance of him having a seizure “a hell of a lot”, but in light of his history of daytime seizures after taking the medication, he could not have “felt that the drugs were controlling me perfectly” as he said in evidence in an attempt to justify his lie to the RTA in 1995.195 In Jiminez v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 572 at 583, it is suggested that the inference that a person believed that it was safe to drive might be drawn from the very fact of his driving. It is true that in an appropriate case the very fact that an accused drove could suggest his belief as to the lack of dangerousness of that conduct. After all one of the persons put at risk by this accused’s driving was the accused himself. However in the circumstances of this case, it is not possible to draw the conclusion that the accused believed it was not dangerous for him to drive from the fact that he continued to drive for reasons I will now explain. 196 Exhibit T was a letter which Dr Beran wrote to the accused’s general practitioner in early 1987. It refers to 3 daytime seizures occurring a short time earlier. Although in Court Dr Beran expressed the opinion that he would have hoped that he would have told the accused not to drive, there was no evidence that he had. Nevertheless when the accused saw Dr Beran in early 1987 he knew, because he told the Doctor, that he had three daytime seizures shortly before. Did the accused stop driving, recognising that 3 daytime seizures presented a risk of catastrophe if he had a seizure whilst driving? Well there was no evidence that he stopped driving, and positive evidence that he did not. The positive evidence to which I refer is to be found in the accused’s traffic record tendered by the Crown at the request of Mr Barber. It reveals that the accused was charged by way of traffic infringement notice for negligent driving on 1 May 1987.197 That the accused was driving on 1 May 1987, after having 3 day time seizures earlier that year, (and the earlier daytime seizure in 1986 which got him going to Dr Beran in the first place), speaks eloquently of the accused’s attitude towards the risks he was prepared to take. It means that the inference that the accused could not have believed it was dangerous for him to drive at the relevant time, because he would not have risked his own safety, cannot be drawn. When the accused’s driving history is compared to his seizure history, that submission is not open.Lies to the RTA198 The best evidence of the accused’s belief on 2 May 2003 is to be found in the lies he told to the RTA when renewing his licence. 199 Exhibit J, which contains licence renewal applications made by the accused in 1995 and 2000 indicates that the accused could not have believed that it was safe for him to drive, (again using the word safe in the sense I earlier indicated). If he had had that belief he would have answered “yes” to the question “have you had any type of epilepsy”. 200 I appreciate that the state of mind of the accused on 29 July 2000 when he last applied for his licence to be renewed is not necessarily the same as the state of mind of the accused on 2 May 2003. I have therefore carefully considered the evidence of the accused’s repeated denials of epilepsy to both the Roads and Traffic Authority and his employer as well as the accused’s medical history. I am satisfied that there was no significant difference between the state of the accused’s mind on 29 July 2000 when he last lied to the RTA in order to renew his licence and 2 May 2003. 201 I have considered whether there are other explanations for the lies to the RTA, such as them suggesting merely that the accused was afraid that his licence would be unfairly taken away if he told the truth. Although the lies told to the RTA are direct evidence of a fear that he would not have his licence renewed if he told the truth, when considered in conjunction with his knowledge of his medical history they are also indirect, but nevertheless powerful, evidence as to the accused’s knowledge that there was a real risk of him suffering a seizure whilst driving. Notwithstanding the accused’s occasional denials of daytime seizures, the accused had had such seizures in the past. He was aware that he continued to have nocturnal seizures. I am satisfied he knew that there was a real risk he would suffer another daytime seizure and, given that he continued to drive, this could well be whilst he was driving. That explains why he lied to the RTA.202 The accused was not afraid of his licence being unfairly taken away if he told the truth – he was afraid that if he disclosed that he suffered from epilepsy, any subsequent investigation by the RTA, undertaken by them before deciding whether or not to renew his licence, would reveal his true medical state. The accused knew that this would have gone beyond the simple fact of his epilepsy. He knew that the investigations would have revealed the history of his seizures, their frequency, their effects upon him, the fact that they came upon him without warning, the fact that medication had not prevented them, and probably more as well.203 The accused did not lie to the RTA because he was afraid of his licence being unfairly taken away. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he lied because he knew that telling the truth would have led to the disclosure of the real risk that he would suffer a seizure while driving. The accused knew about that risk but he wanted to keep it a secret from the RTA. 204 The accused at times suggested that he lied because of social stigma faced by epileptics. That may explain his lies to the Navy, but it does not explain his lies to the RTA. He lied to the RTA because he was afraid that if he told them the truth his licence would be taken away, and properly so. His lies to the RTA were connected with his lies to the Navy because if he lost his licence he would have to explain to his employer why he could not drive any more. But it is precisely that connection which demonstrates yet again that the lies to the RTA were told because the accused feared that the truth would lead to investigations which in turn would have revealed that he should not be licensed to drive.205 The fact that the accused’s seizures would come upon him without warning was, as I have indicated, relevant to the objective test of dangerousness. It is also relevant to whether the accused believed that it was not dangerous for him to drive. The accused was aware that when he suffered a daytime seizure it came upon him unannounced. The accused knew therefore that if he suffered a seizure whilst driving he could do little if anything to avoid the consequence that the car he was driving would continue out of effective control whilst the seizure ran its course. 206 Of course the absence of any evidence that the accused had a daytime seizure for 10 years, and was taking his medication, which was of an appropriate dose, tends to suggest a belief on the part of the accused that it was not dangerous for him to drive. However that evidence has to be looked at in the light of the accused’s repeated lies to the RTA. That is the best evidence of what the accused believed as to the risks he posed as a driver who suffered from epilepsy. Whilst the significant period of time which has elapsed since his last daytime seizure in 1993 is something I have certainly taken into account in assessing the accused’s belief in 2003, in the light of the accused’s lies when renewing his driver’s licence, repeated lies which he told to avoid an investigation into his safety as a driver, I am satisfied that the accused did not believe that his driving was not dangerous.207 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe that it was safe for him to drive. I am satisfied that immediately before suffering a seizure on 2 May 2003 the accused knew that he represented a danger to other road users. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that he presented such a risk, that it was not some fanciful risk but so serious a risk as to be in reality, and not merely as a matter of speculation, dangerous to other people on or near the road.208 In these circumstances it does not matter whether the accused’s belief was reasonable or not.209 The result is that, as far as the third way the Crown has presented its case is concerned, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the elements of the 3 offences faced by the accused. Verdict210 I find the accused Guilty on each of the three counts.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Hidden J. Having considered the contents of that judgment I have to say, with all due respect, that I am unable to concur in the orders that his Honour proposes. 
     
      
    2 In explaining my own views of this admittedly sad and difficult matter I take as my point of departure the contents of paragraph 15 of his Honour’s judgment. I respectfully agree with the entirety of what is there said by his Honour.  
     
      
    3 That being so, it seems to me that the correct approach is to deal with the following sequence of questions: 
     
      
       
      [1] Is there now placed before this Court any evidence that can be regarded properly as fresh evidence? 
       
       
      [2] If so, then does a proper consideration of that fresh evidence, correctly and precisely defined, justify a conclusion that a miscarriage of justice will result should this Court not now intervene and re-sentence? 
       
       
      [3] If so, then is there evidence of matters occurring between the date of the original sentencing and the hearing of the present application, the assessment of which occurrences according to correct principles correctly applied, justifies the conclusion that a more lenient sentence than that passed at first instance is warranted in law. 
       
      
    4 As to question 1, I would answer: yes. 
     
      
    5 As to question 2, and for the purpose of correctly identifying the fresh evidence, I would regard the fresh evidence as being such evidence as establishes:  
     
      
       
      1) that the applicant, when she stood for sentence, was in fact pregnant; 
       
       
      2) that it is expected that she will come to term on or about 12 December next; 
       
       
      3) that, should her baby be born while she is serving a sentence of full-time custody, she would be accepted upon post-natal discharge from hospital into the Mothers and Children’s Programme that is provided by the Department of Corrective Services; and that the relevant incidents of that Programme are as described by Hidden J in paragraphs 17 and 29 of his Honour’s judgment. 
       
      
    6 Further as to question 2, and for the purpose of assessing whether that fresh evidence requires in the interests of justice that this Court intervene and re-sentence, I would exclude completely that further fresh evidence of which Hidden J points out, correctly as I respectfully think, that it would be available for this Court’s consideration only in the event of a properly justified conclusion that there should be any re-sentencing at all. 
     
      
    7 Taking that approach, I am unpersuaded that the relevant fresh evidence establishes that a more lenient sentence is warranted in law. The relevant evidence now before this Court, - and the relevant evidence, therefore, that would have been putatively before the primary sentencing Judge, - does not seem to me to establish either the complete absence of appropriate post-natal facilities within the corrective services establishment; or the provision of obviously inadequate or inappropriate such facilities. That being so, I am unpersuaded that had the primary sentencing Judge taken into account the relevant fresh evidence, then he must have passed a more lenient sentence in the sense that it would have been an error of law for his Honour not to have done so. 
     
      
    8 I would answer, therefore, in the negative to my question [2]. 
     
      
    9 On that approach my question [3] does not arise. Were it to arise, I would answer it, too, in the negative. As Hidden J points out, “the evidence about the current situation of the children is rather spare”. There is, so far as I can see, no evidence, and particularly no properly qualified expert evidence, about the children, and about their welfare should the applicant serve 12 months of full-time custody. I regard the provision of such evidence as a minimum requirement if there is to be a reduction in the applicant’s sentence, otherwise justified, on account of hardship to the children. 
     
      
    10 I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    11 HIDDEN J: After a trial in the District Court, the applicant, Tina Maree Moss, was found guilty of supplying the prohibited drug, methyl amphetamine, an offence under s25 (1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which carries a maximum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment. She was sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen months, comprising a non-parole period of twelve months and a balance of term of four months, to date from the day on which sentence was passed, 23 April 2004. She seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    12 Given the view I have formed about the application, it is unnecessary to recite the facts of the offence or the subjective material in any detail. It is sufficient to say that on 12 February 2003 at Umina Beach the applicant was found by police to be in possession of a resealable plastic bag, containing 5.7g of methyl amphetamine, in circumstances from which it was apparent that she intended to sell it. At the trial the Crown had relied upon the deeming provision to be found in s29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The drug was found to be of a purity of 21.5 percent and was estimated to have a street value of about $1,200. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was thirty-one years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty-three. She had a criminal record consisting mainly of offences of dishonesty and traffic offences, which had been dealt with by non-custodial orders, but also including a conviction in 1995 of supplying a prohibited drug, for which she was ordered to perform community service. She had a sad background which it is unnecessary to examine, except to observe that she had had a number of abusive relationships with men, had endured the death of a three-year-old son of a brain tumour, had herself suffered a brain injury in an accident and had herself become addicted to methyl amphetamine.  
     
      
    14 Of importance for present purposes is that she had three children, now aged eight, seven and five, from one of her relationships. At the time of sentence she was separated from the father of those children, to whom I shall refer only as Wayne, and had become involved with a man called Brett. She had maintained the care of those three children, although they also spent time with Wayne, who was looking after them on the day she was sentenced. Wayne had formed a relationship with another young woman. 
     
      
    15 In this Court, counsel for the applicant relied upon three matters in the remarks on sentence of the trial judge to mount an argument that the sentencing process had miscarried. While I do not consider any of those arguments to be particularly persuasive, I find it unnecessary to resolve them. The sentence which his Honour passed is undoubtedly lenient and, even if any of the points raised by counsel did have merit, it could not lead to the conclusion that a lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    16 However, the other basis of the application, relying upon fresh evidence, is of substance. There is evidence before us that, unbeknown to the applicant, she was pregnant at the time sentence was passed. The father of the child is her latest partner, Brett. There was evidence at the time of sentence that he is a possessive and violent man, who is also a user of amphetamines, and it is likely that this is yet another relationship which will not endure. 
     
      
    17 The effect of the fresh evidence is that the applicant’s pregnancy was discovered as a result of a blood test undertaken after she had been sentenced. The child is due on 12 December 2004. She is now in the Nepean Hospital because she has the condition known as placenta previa, and she must remain in hospital until the baby is delivered by caesarean section. Thereafter, she would be accepted into the Department of Corrective Services Mothers and Children’s Program and would be housed with her baby at a special facility, Jacaranda Cottages, at Emu Plains Correctional Centre for the rest of the custodial component of her sentence. While there is no evidence before us about the conditions at that facility, there is no reason to doubt that they are satisfactory. 
     
      
    18 It is not in dispute that this evidence is “fresh”, in the sense that it relates to a state of affairs which existed but was not known at the time of sentence. However, the applicant must also show that it is “of such significance that the sentencing judge may have regarded it as having a real bearing upon his decision”: R v Goodwin (1990) 51 ACrim R 328, per Hunt CJ at CL at 330. The Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted that it does not have that significance and that, accordingly, we should not receive the evidence. He relied upon the decision of a two judge bench, comprising Dunford J and Carruthers AJ, in R v O’Dea [2002] NSWCCA 91, in which the leading judgment was given by Dunford J. It is necessary to examine what his Honour there said in the light of two earlier decisions of this Court, to which he referred. 
     
      
    19 In R v Ihm & Ors (CCA unreported 9 November 1993) the Court reduced the minimum term of one of the applicants in the light of fresh evidence of her pregnancy, existing but unknown at the time of sentence. Mathews J, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Allen J agreed, noted the Crown prosecutor’s acknowledgment that, if the sentencing judge had been aware of that applicant’s pregnancy, “he would have treated it as a significant mitigating feature in her case”: see the penultimate paragraph of her Honour’s judgment. As I understand it, at the time that case was decided there was no program within the prison system for mothers of newborn children such as that available to the present applicant.  
     
      
    20 R v Clarke [2000] NSWCCA 160 was also a decision of a two judge bench, comprising Hulme J and Carruthers AJ. That applicant was pregnant at the time she was sentenced, but that fact was revealed to the sentencing judge and expressly taken into account by him. The leading judgment was delivered by Carruthers AJ, who (at [22]) rejected a submission that the sentence failed to afford sufficient weight to the applicant’s subjective case generally, including her pregnancy. It seems that by this time the Mothers and Children’s Program was in place. At [24], Carruthers J noted that “the provisions for mothers having children with them while in custody are now much more favourable than existed at the time of the judgement of this Court in Ihm” and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        The fact that the child will be with his mother for some time in custody is naturally a matter which attracts sympathy, however, this Court is bound to apply the relevant principles of law to the case before it. Applying the relevant principles of law I am quite unable to conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the sentencing process. 
        
       
      
    21 This brings me, then, to O’Dea. That was another case in which the applicant relied upon fresh evidence of her pregnancy. By the time the appeal was heard the baby had been born and was being cared for by that applicant, apparently in conditions similar to those available to the present applicant. 
     
      
    22 Dunford J concluded that evidence of the applicant’s pregnancy would not have affected the sentence if it had been known to the sentencing judge. His Honour referred to Ihm and Clarke, noting the marked improvement in the position of the mother of a newborn child in custody by the time the latter case was decided. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        It was submitted that imprisonment during pregnancy and giving birth whilst in custody must bear more heavily upon the Applicant than in the case of another prisoner, and that it would have been proper for her Honour to make some allowance if she had been aware of the pregnancy. However, there is no evidence that there is any greater burden on a female prisoner who is pregnant than there is on any other prisoner, or on any other woman who is pregnant in the community, and I therefore am not satisfied that the fact of pregnancy at the time of sentencing is a matter that would or could have affected the sentence if it had been known to her Honour at the time. 
        
       
      
    23 That passage could be read as a statement that, given the facilities that are now provided to the mothers of newborn children within the prison system, the prospect of childbirth whilst in custody can never be relevant to sentence. I very much doubt that that is what Dunford J sought to convey, and it is most unlikely that a two judge bench would have been prepared to enunciate a sweeping principle of such significance. Although expressed in general terms, I do not understand his Honour to have been doing any more than making an observation apt to dispose of the case at hand. In the same way, I do not understand Carruthers AJ to have been intending to express a general principle in the passage of his judgment in Clarke which I have quoted above.  
     
      
    24 Childbirth is a momentous event in any woman’s life and the fact that it is to take place in custody cannot be ignored, however successful the Corrective Services authorities might be in easing its burden. This is not to say that it must invariably lead to a more lenient sentence. Whether, and to what extent, it bears upon the sentencing process must fall to be determined according to the evidence in the individual case. 
     
      
    25 In my view, this applicant’s pregnancy could properly have been regarded by the sentencing judge as a matter of significance. Particularly is this so because she has other young children and, while no doubt they are able to visit her, she cannot share with them the day-by-day experience of her developing relationship with her newborn. The fresh evidence should be allowed and this Court should determine for itself the appropriate sentence, having regard to all of the material which is now before us. 
     
      
    26 There is further new evidence which, counsel for the applicant acknowledged, would be admissible only in the event of re-sentence. After the applicant was sentenced her three other young children remained in the care of their father, Wayne. He instituted Family Law proceedings to secure their residence with him, with supervised access by the applicant. More importantly, however, he has since been arrested for drug and firearms charges and is in custody. The children are now in the care of his current partner, who is only twenty-three years old.  
     
      
    27 It must be said that the evidence about the current situation of the children is rather spare. It is to be found only in an affidavit by the applicant’s solicitor, recording a conversation he had with the solicitor acting for Wayne in the family law proceedings. The affidavit of the applicant dealing with her pregnancy was sworn before this development and there was no further affidavit by her before us. That may well be because the conversation between the solicitors to which I have referred occurred only days before the hearing of the application in this Court. Nevertheless, I am prepared to infer that the position of the children is less than satisfactory and is a source of anxiety for her.  
     
      
    28 Moreover, I consider this to be an exceptional case in which the hardship to the children arising from their separation from their mother should be taken into account. The familiar authorities dealing with the relevance of such hardship to sentence were referred to by Dunford J in O’Dea at [20]. However, at [21] his Honour referred to two decisions of this Court in which hardship to very young children was taken into account: R v Niga (CCA unreported 13 April 1994) and R v Tiki (CCA unreported 24 August 1994). Although the circumstances in Tiki were markedly different from the present case, there is some parallel between it and Niga.  
     
      
    29 From the evidence before us about the Mothers and C`hildren’s program, it is possible that arrangements could be made for the younger two of her children to reside with her at Jacaranda Cottages on a full-time basis and for the oldest of the three to reside with her there occasionally. However, there is nothing to suggest that any such arrangements have been contemplated at this stage. They would need to be the subject of an application by the applicant, which would have to be investigated and then considered by a series of senior departmental officers before any decision could be made. No doubt, competing interests would have to be considered and the evidence does not disclose how long this process might take. The applicant could also apply for a “local leave permit” under s26(1)(l) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act, enabling her “to serve her sentence with her child or children in an appropriate environment”. Again, the evidence before us does not disclose how such an application is dealt with or how long it might take. In my view, the availability of such administrative arrangements should not dissuade this Court from re-sentencing the applicant.  
     
      
    30 I must say that I have decided that the Court should intervene only after careful consideration, and not without considerable hesitation. It may be in the applicant’s interests to spend the remainder of her non-parole period with her baby at Jacaranda Cottages, which might enable her to care for the child in a more stable environment than that available to her if she were at liberty. As I have said, while the present position of her other three children is a matter of concern, the evidence about it is far from satisfactory. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the Court should act quickly to deal with the situation in which the applicant is now placed, and the adjustment which I would propose to her existing sentence is relatively modest. It would entitle her to release a few weeks after the birth of her baby, affording her the benefit of a short time at Jacaranda Cottages before she returns to the community. 
     
      
    31 I would not disturb the head sentence passed by the trial judge but, finding special circumstances in the new evidence before us, I would reduce the non-parole period. I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would confirm the sentence of sixteen months, dating from 23 April 2004, but I would quash the non-parole period of twelve months and specify a non-parole period of eight months. I would direct that the applicant be released on 22 December 2004 and be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole service for the balance of the sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by Christie DCJ on 31 July 2003 at the Sydney District Court. 
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty to two charges, one of importing not less than the trafficable quantity of 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“MDMA” or “ecstasy”) contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), and the other of using an Australian passport issued to another person for the purpose of travel contrary to s 9A of the Passports Act 1938 (Cth). As will appear, the sentencing judge found that the applicant would have sold some part of the ecstasy. In those circumstances, the maximum penalty for the s 233B offence was a fine not exceeding 5000 penalty units or 25 years imprisonment, or both: s 235 Customs Act 1901 (Cth). 
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced to 5 years and 9 months imprisonment from 21 September 2002 to 20 June 2008 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months from 21 September 2002 to 20 June 2006 in respect of the s 233B offence.  
     
      
    4 The applicant’s sentence was determined in unusual circumstances. It was first imposed on 1 April 2003 then “revised” on 31 July 2003 in circumstances I recount below. 
     
      
      Background 
       
      
    5 On 22 August 2002 the applicant and a Mr Moustapha booked tickets on a Qantas flight to Paris departing the next day. The applicant paid $5,050 in cash for both tickets. 
     
      
    6 The two men flew out of Sydney on 23 August 2002. Their original return date was extended twice. While they were overseas three money orders in the amount of $6,000, $6,600 and $4,600 respectively were sent to the applicant from Australia. The sentencing judge found that all the money orders came from funds provided by the applicant. 
     
      
    7 The two men returned to Sydney on 21 September 2002. They were searched by Customs Officers. The search of the applicant revealed that he had three packages containing tablets taped to his legs with brown coloured packaging tape. The search of Moustapha revealed that he, too, had three packages containing tablets strapped to his body, one in the groin area and two on the lower part of his legs.  
     
      
    8 The packages carried by both the applicant and Moustapha concealed a number of pink and blue coloured tablets within opaque, white coloured plastic bags bound with brown coloured packaging tape. Indicative field tests undertaken by the Australian Customs Service (“ACS”) indicated the presence of ecstasy. 
     
      
    9 The gross weight of the contents of the packages was 684.2 grams. Australian Forensic Drug Laboratories results indicated that the estimated total weight of pure ecstasy found on the applicant was 169.9 grams. The total weight of pure ecstasy found on Moustapha was 169.8 grams. 
     
      
    10 Australian Federal Police estimated that the 684.2 grams (gross weight) of the contents of the packages was the equivalent of about 3,000 tablets of ecstasy. They estimated that the street value of such tablets at about the time the applicant was sentenced was AUD$150,000 or AUD$50.00 per tablet. 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s first sentence 
       
      
    11 On 1 April 2003 the applicant appeared for sentence before Christie DCJ having pleaded guilty to the charges to which I have earlier referred. 
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge found the offences occurred in the following circumstances. He inferred that when the two offenders travelled overseas their original intention was to holiday together and that the idea of importing the ecstasy tablets occurred to them during the trip when they visited Amsterdam. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant and Moustapha “entered in fairly quick fashion the drug world of Amsterdam” and … that “he and his co-offender were having … a ‘spree’ in Amsterdam”.  
     
      
    14 He found that the offenders became aware in Amsterdam that they could purchase ecstasy tablets for about $2 a tablet and that it was the “attraction” between the cost of the tablets in Amsterdam and their cost in Australia (“somewhat closer to $50”) which led the offenders to purchase about 6,000 tablets. They used some of the money which had been sent to the applicant in the three money orders to purchase the drugs. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge found both the applicant and Moustapha were principals and not couriers, that they were importing the ecstasy tablets for their own use or joint use but that there was an inescapable inference that some of the tablets would have been sold upon the market at least to finance, in part, the moneys the applicant had outlaid. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge concluded that while the applicant’s role was that of a principal and that there was financial gain to be made, “to a very large degree, this importation was intended to supply [the applicant] and his co-offender with a source of this drug for his own use”. 
     
      
    17 His Honour accepted that the applicant was “not a commercial drug dealer in the sense that he is not a person who set about making a very large profit, quick easy money in respect of this type of importation.” However, while accepting that the purchase of the tablets was “not a planned commercial activity”, the sentencing judge also found it was “undeniable” that there was “a commercial and semi-trafficable element in the purchase of such a large number of tablets”. 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge accepted that the passport offence was a very serious one, although it paled “into insignificance in terms of likely penalty” in comparison with the principal offence. 
     
      
    19 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had co-operated with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of the offence and had also pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. While he accepted that the plea demonstrated contrition and remorse, he did not regard it as being afforded as much weight as it might otherwise, having regard to the fact the applicant had been “caught cold the tablets strapped to the inside of his thighs”. 
     
      
    20 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had been in protective custody for a significant period of time since his arrest. This was because of an assault upon him by a number of men in which he was wounded. He had sought and obtained protective custody since that assault. The material before the sentencing judge indicated that it was the applicant’s then intention to remain in protective custody. The sentencing judge accepted, “at least to some extent”, the Crown’s submission that following his sentence the applicant would not always be held in a metropolitan prison and was the type of prisoner likely to find his way into minimum security institutions so that he envisaged that the requirement for protection would disappear. His Honour referred to the more onerous nature of a sentence served in protection, observing that “prisoners in protection are virtually confined to their cells for something of the order of twenty two hours of each and every day.” I note, parenthetically, that at that stage the decisions in R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97 at [179] ff; R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 at [31] ff; R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299; (2003) 58 NSWLR 581 at [19] ff casting doubt upon the universality if the proposition that time served in protective custody is not invariably more onerous had not been delivered, however in R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253 at [20] Howie J (with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed) made it clear that such a circumstance does not always require a sentencing judge to find special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. 
     
      
    21 Having referred to comparative sentences and taking into account the applicant’s early plea, his co-operation with authorities and the fact he had served some time in protective custody, the sentencing judge thought a head sentence of seven years was appropriate. He then considered subjective factors. 
     
      
    22 Of the subjective matters to which the sentencing judge referred, it is important to note that he accepted that the “particular offence” (I assume his Honour was referring to the importation charge) was “completely out of character with the prisoner”. He took the view that it was unlikely the applicant would commit “an offence of this nature or any other in the future”. Because of this, the sentencing judge said he would “deal with the matter as leniently as the circumstances permit”. 
     
      
    23 He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having looked at all of the subjective circumstances… 
        I have with some reservation convinced myself that that head sentence should be reduced to six years 
         but having done that I do not believe there is anything else I can do for the prisoner unless I passed a sentence that would not reflect the gravity of the particular offence.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    24 The sentencing judge then sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for six years to date from 21 September 2002 (the date the applicant was arrested at Sydney Airport) with a non-parole period of four years. In respect of the passport offence, the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years which was the maximum available to be served concurrently with the first sentence. 
     
      
       
      Resentencing the applicant 
       
      
    25 The statement of facts presented to the sentencing judge on 1 April 2003 by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (the “Commonwealth DPP”) alleged that the amount of pure ecstasy the subject of the charge against the applicant was 339.7 grams. That was the total net amount of pure ecstasy contained in the tablets the two offenders had imported. The Crown relied upon the total weight of the pure ecstasy on the basis the two offenders had been involved in a joint criminal enterprise to import the tablets. The applicant’s legal representatives did not contest that proposition. 
     
      
    26 After the applicant had been sentenced on 1 April 2003, the Commonwealth DPP applied to have the matter relisted before the sentencing judge. This was because the Commonwealth DPP had formed the view that the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) did not allow for the application of the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise. When the matter was relisted the Commonwealth DPP submitted that the applicant should be resentenced on the basis that he had imported only the quantity of pure ecstasy in the tablets strapped to his body, namely 169.9 grams. Although the papers do not identify the jurisdictional basis of the Commonwealth DPP’s application, it would appear to have been based upon s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) which permits a court which has imposed a penalty which is contrary to law to reopen the proceedings and impose the appropriate penalty: see Erceg v District Court of New South Wales [2003] NSWCA 379. 
     
      
    27 Christie DCJ accepted the Commonwealth DPP’s submission that he should resentence the applicant for importing the lesser amount of ecstasy. He reviewed the remarks he had made in sentencing the applicant for the first time. In considering how he might revise the sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I considered it at some length because I am concerned and I was concerned a little time after I passed sentence upon Mr Salcedo, that he received the benefit of a – quite frankly – a significantly lighter sentence than some members of the community might think appropriate. But that is water under the bridge – I am more firmly of that view now than I ever was – but it is water under the bridge. I did say at that time that having done what I did, I do not believe there is anything else I can do for the prisoner unless I passed a sentence that would not reflect the gravity of the particular offence. 
        
       
       
        
        So I ask myself if he was sentenced on that basis whether there is any room to interfere with Mr Salcedo’s sentence, bearing in mind that I hold the view that the sentence he received could be considered in some sections of the community, as over lenient in any event. I have convinced myself again, with some significant reservation, that it is possible that Mr Salcedo might justifiably entertain a genuine sense of grievance if in fact his sentence was not at least marginally ameliorated by reason of the fact that he had been sentenced on the basis of a joint importation with Mr Moustapha, at least having regard to the quantity that he brought here.  
        I feel that I, in ameliorating a sentence – and I shall only do it quite marginally – but in ameliorating his sentence, I am fast approaching a stage where the sentence may not sufficiently reflect the objective criminality that the offence disclosed 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, the previous sentence was 6 years from 21 September 2002 to 20 September 2008, with a non-parole period of 4 years from 21 September 2002 to 20 September 2006. A parole period of 2 years from 21 September 2006 to 20 September 2008. So that if I am to adjust it for half of the quantity imported, … I feel that there would be some justification for moderately adjusting the sentence, having regard to the fact that the volume imported is a relevant factor. Not the only factor of course, but it is a factor. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the Crown having abandoned that principle of common purpose as I say, in terms of this sentencing procedure for very good reason and indeed one of my brother judges so decided some time ago and nobody contests that that is the correct approach, I propose to reduce the prisoner Salcedo’s sentence by 3 months.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    28 He then resentenced the applicant to 5 years and 9 months imprisonment from 21 September 2002 to 20 June 2008. He reduced his non-parole period by 3 months to 3 years and 9 months from 21 September 2002 to 20 June 2006. His parole period remained at 2 years. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on Moustapha’s sentence 
       
      
    29 Moustapha also pleaded guilty to two charges, one of importing not less than the trafficable quantity of 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), namely 169.8 grams (Customs Act 1901 (Cth), s 233B), and the other of importing Tier 1 goods, namely anabolic steroids without approval (Customs Act, s 233BAA(4)). 
     
      
    30 Moustapha was sentenced on the same day the sentencing judge resentenced the applicant. The sentencing judge “notionally included” his remarks on the applicant’s sentence in his sentencing remarks in relation to Moustapha. 
     
      
    31 The sentencing judge noted that Moustapha entered a plea of guilty to both charges at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    32 The sentencing judge noted that the principal issue debated before him was parity between the co-offenders.  
     
      
    33 He concluded that he should proceed to sentence Moustapha on the same basis as the applicant insofar as he considered that the men had only decided to bring back the ecstasy after they arrived in Amsterdam. He also accepted that Moustapha, like the applicant, was a principal and not a courier. However, in sentencing Moustapha the sentencing judge concluded that he had been in error in concluding in connection with the applicant’s sentence that “to a very large degree, this importation was intended to supply [the applicant] and [Moustapha] with a source of this drug for his own use”. That was because, having read some of the remarks made by Moustapha in his record of interview, his Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [T]he real motivation for this importation, or the significant portion of the motivation was a quick turnover of money and the consequent profits used to alleviate what Mr Moustapha perceived to be his pressing indebtedness.” 
        
       
      
    34 Having made what he frankly acknowledged was an error in favour of the applicant, his Honour concluded that he should perpetuate it in favour of Moustapha “because it would be quite improper of me to take a different view now in sentencing Mr Moustapha.”  
     
      
    35 His Honour repeated what he had said at the time of sentencing the applicant, namely that he proposed to deal with the matter “as leniently as the circumstances permit, but consistent with one’s duty to the community, that this type of offence must in all circumstances be discouraged and penalties passed that are commensurate with the gravity of the crime”. He observed that “[t]he objective seriousness of this crime could not be overstated”. 
     
      
    36 In dealing with Moustapha’s subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge noted that he was entitled to significant consideration by way of the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, by reason of the fact that it was made at the earliest opportunity and reflected a “genuine feeling of contrition and remorse”.  
     
      
    37 His Honour then turned to consider whether Moustapha was entitled to any amelioration of the sentence that had been passed upon the applicant by reason of two matters. The first was the contents of Ex H which referred to some assistance Moustapha had afforded authorities. The sentencing judge concluded that that exhibit entitled Moustapha to “some marginal consideration”. The second matter was that it was the applicant’s money, not Moustapha’s, which had financed the enterprise. 
     
      
    38 The sentencing judge concluded that in terms of the criminality exhibited in relation to the offences, any differentiation between the applicant and Moustapha was “pretty marginal”. He accepted that neither man was a commercial drug runner and that neither entered upon the enterprises in relation to which he was sentencing Moustapha on a regular basis or moved in “the drug milieu”. 
     
      
    39 He accepted, in relation to Moustapha, that the offence was completely out of character. He concluded that Moustapha’s subjective circumstances were “marginally more compelling” than the applicant’s. That was partly because of some material concerning Moustapha’s wife. He took into account the matters to which s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required the Court to have regard when passing sentence which, in his view, “marginally favour [Moustapha] when compared with [the applicant]” as did the contents of Ex H. 
     
      
    40 The sentencing judge referred to the constraints under which, in his view, he was operating. They were the parity principle as well as the fact that he had already had to adjust the applicant’s sentence to a level where it may not sufficiently reflect the objective criminality of the offence.  
     
      
    41 He concluded that he had to make the same adjustment in favour of Moustapha as he had made in favour of the applicant as well as a further marginal adjustment having regard to the matters peculiar to Moustapha to which I have already referred. Having referred to those matters, however, his Honour was of the view that he could not make any further adjustment without passing a sentence that would not reflect the gravity of the particular offence and its objective criminality. Indeed, his Honour expressed the view that the sentence he was about to pass on Moustapha probably fell short of the latter requirement but having sentenced the applicant on that basis, he did not believe there was any other course he could adopt. 
     
      
    42 He sentenced Moustapha to five years and three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months in respect of the first matter and a fixed term of imprisonment of three months in respect of the second. The fixed term was concurrent with the first sentence. It dated from 21 September 2002 and had already been served by the date the sentence was imposed. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    43 The grounds of appeal upon which the applicant relies are that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the sentencing judge erred in imposing a greater sentence on him as compared to his co-accused, Moustapha, thus giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance; 
       
       
      (b) the sentencing judge erred when resentencing the applicant, overlooked or gave insufficient weight to time served and to be served in protective custody. 
       
       
      The applicant’s submissions 
       
      
    44 The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in giving Moustapha a sentence which was less than the applicant’s and that the discrepancy between the two sentences had given rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. The applicant submitted that the reasons the sentencing judge gave in reducing Moustapha’s sentence were insufficient to identify a necessary distinction between the two offenders when the factors favouring the applicant were considered. In particular the applicant drew attention to the issue of protective custody and noted that when the sentencing judge resentenced the applicant he made no reference to that factor. 
     
      
    45 While the applicant acknowledged that the sentencing judge had been entitled to take into account Moustapha’s subjective circumstances as well as Ex H, he submitted that those factors did not relevantly distinguish the two offenders when appropriate weight was given to the issue of protective custody.  
     
      
    46 The applicant submitted that the sentence for the co-offenders ought to have been the same when considering the parity principle. 
     
      
       
      The Crown’s submissions 
       
      
    47 The Crown submitted that the applicant had not demonstrated that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the fact that the applicant expected to serve his sentence in protective custody or did not give it appropriate weight. They drew attention to the line of authority demonstrating that it can no longer be assumed that a prisoner who will serve his sentence in protective custody will find prison life more difficult or onerous than other prisoners in the general prison population or that the prisoner will be deprived of amenities or opportunities for self-improvement courses and education: see Howie J’s remarks in R v Mostyn, above at [179] ff. 
     
      
    48 The Crown contended that mere disparity between sentences imposed on co-offenders was not of itself a ground for the intervention of an appellate court, referring to Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 and R v Postiglione [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295. It submitted that in order for an appellate court to interfere with a sentence on the basis of the parity principle, the difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive so as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance. It argued that the latter factor would only be engaged if an ordinary reasonable member of the community would consider that the differences in the sentences resulted in an injustice, referring to Steer v The Queen [2000] FCA 462; (2000) 171 ALR 463. 
     
      
    49 The Crown submitted that the applicant had not established that the difference between the sentences imposed on him and his co-offender was manifestly excessive or that the differences between their sentences would engender a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    50 The Crown challenged the applicant’s contention that his expectation that he would serve his sentence in protective custody in effect cancelled out the discount on sentence received by Moustapha for his assistance on the basis that that submission sought to ascribe to sentencing a process of mathematical precision, an approach which had often been condemned: see Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ. 
     
      
    51 The Crown also submitted that the parity principle had to give way, in appropriate circumstances, to the requirement that the administration of justice should be served by a sentence reflecting the objective criminality of the offence. It drew attention to R v Chen & Others [2002] NSWCCA 174; (2002) 130 A Crim R 300 at [289] where Heydon JA, Sully and Levine JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A further principle in [the parity] context of course is the entitlement in the Court of Criminal Appeal to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence in order to avoid disparity engendering a justifiable sense of grievance, that entitlement being a discretionary one. The exercise of that discretion may be affected by a view being formed that a stage has been reached at which the inadequacy of the lower sentence is so grave that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one, and a reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence to remove that disparity becomes an affront to the proper administration of justice:  
        Regina v Diamond 
         (NSW CCA, unreported, 18 February 1993 per Hunt CJ at CL at 5-6, with whom James J agreed, Smart J – as he then was – dissenting).” 
        
       
      
    52 The Crown did not accept that the sentencing judge erred in the manner for which the applicant contended. Further, it submitted that the sentence his Honour imposed was such that the Court would not conclude that another, less severe sentence, was warranted in law. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge made a number of findings which were unduly favourable to the applicant. These included the fact that he sentenced the applicant on the basis that he was of prior good character where as, in fact, the applicant’s criminal history was not insubstantial and could, the Crown submitted, be seen as indicating a “continuing attitude of disobedience of the law” deserving of a severe penalty: cf Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1998) 164 CLR 465 at 477; R v McDonald (1998) 28 MVR 432. 
     
      
    53 The Crown also submitted that another highly favourable finding the sentencing judge had made which, indeed, he had subsequently come to doubt (if not regret), was his conclusion during his remarks on the first sentence on 1 April 2003 that the importation was intended to supply the co-offenders with drugs for their own use.  
     
      
    54 The Crown submitted that even if the applicant was able to demonstrate a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of manifest disparity this Court should not intervene to vary the sentence on the basis that such intervention would constitute an affront to the proper administration of justice. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    55 Although the circumstances in which the applicant came to be sentenced proceeded in the two stages I have outlined, the present application, in my view, must be considered on the basis that the sentence finally imposed upon the applicant related to his plea of guilty to importing not less than 169.9 grams of ecstasy. At times the application appeared to proceed as if it were a review of the sentencing judge’s resentencing exercise. That, in my view, was an erroneous approach. The true question is whether, in all the circumstances, the final sentence was excessive.  
     
      
    56 That being said, it is necessary to have regard to the remarks the sentencing judge made on the occasion of the applicant’s first sentence because they formed part of the explanation for the final sentence. All that happened when the applicant was resentenced was that the sentencing judge considered the effect, if any, which he should give to the fact that the Crown conceded that the amount of ecstasy which should be the subject of the charge was 169.9 grams as opposed to 339.7 grams. 
     
      
    57 In Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [64] Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said, in referring to the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin, that the difficulty of detecting the offence and the great social consequences that follow from its commission meant that deterrence was to be given chief weight in the sentencing task and “that stern punishment will be warranted in almost every case.” Their Honours also referred to the quantity of drug involved, the offender's knowledge about what was being imported, the offender's role in the importation and the reward which the offender hoped to gain from participation, as matters properly to be taken into account in determining a sentence in such cases. Later (at [70]) their Honours said that “selection of weight of narcotic as the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing a sentence represents a departure from fundamental principle”. This Court, too, has made it plain that penalties are not proportionate to quantity, although quantity is clearly of significance in assessing the objective criminality of the offence: R v Schofield [2003] NSWCCA 3 at [43] per Hulme J. 
     
      
    58 While it was significant that the applicant was a principal, characterising the offender as such cannot be permitted to obscure the assessment of what the applicant did: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 279 [19] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ.  
     
      
    59 What Wong v R and R v Olbrich make plain is that the task of the sentencing judge is to take into account all the objective circumstances of the offence in characterising its criminality as well as such subjective circumstances as appear appropriate. The first part of the exercise is reinforced by s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which required the sentencing judge to take into account “the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence” and the requirement that the sentencing judge “impose a sentence … that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”: s 16A(2)(k), s 16A(1).  
     
      
    60 The sentencing judge recognised in his 1 April 2003 remarks on sentence the need to impose a sentence which would operate as a general deterrent to the community from being involved in crimes of this nature. As he later recognised he probably had not achieved that result, indeed he acknowledged he may have imposed a sentence which did not reflect the objective criminality of the s 233B offence and might be one which members of the community would think was “significantly lighter than … appropriate.” 
     
      
    61 These matters, in my opinion, provide important context to the application of the parity principle. 
     
      
    62 The parity principle reflects the proposition that consistency of punishment is of fundamental importance in the administration of justice: Lowe v R, above, at 610 per Mason J (as he then was). As it turns upon the perception that discrepancies in sentence may give rise to a “justifiable sense of grievance” or “give the appearance that justice has not been done” (Lowe v R, above, at 610 per Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson J agreed)), the principle is not attracted on appeal unless it can be demonstrated that there is a manifestly excessive or marked disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders. Mere disparity is not sufficient to attract appellate review: Lowe v R, above, at 610 per Gibbs CJ, at 611 per Mason J, at 624 per Dawson J (with whom Wilson J also agreed). Thus it should be accepted, as the Crown submitted, that mere disparity is not sufficient to attract the parity principle.  
     
      
    63 The question whether the difference between the applicant’s sentence and Moustapha’s sentence could be said to constitute a “marked” as opposed to a “mere” disparity was not the subject of debate on appeal – however it may be disposed of, in my view, by the fact that the sentencing judge himself accepted that the difference between the two offenders was “marginal” and it was to the subjective matters relating to Moustapha to which he referred when reducing his sentence. It might be accepted, therefore, that the case falls into the category of a “mere” as opposed to a “marked” disparity. 
     
      
    64 In such circumstances the parity principle is not offended and the applicant’s first ground of appeal must fail. 
     
      
    65 I should add that even if I were of the view that there was an unacceptable disparity between the applicant’s sentence and his co-offenders the case would be one where a reduction of the sentence to remove that disparity would, having regard to the leniency extended to the applicant, be an affront to the proper administration of justice: R v Chen & Others, above. 
     
      
    66 The applicant’s second ground of appeal revolved around his complaint that the sentencing judge had overlooked or given insufficient weight to the fact that the applicant had served part of his sentence in protective custody and would serve his sentence in those circumstances.  
     
      
    67 In my view this ground of appeal misunderstands the exercise the sentencing judge undertook when he resentenced the applicant. He had already taken into consideration on the occasion of the first sentence the applicant’s submission concerning the time he had served and may in the future serve in protective custody. When he resentenced the applicant on 31 July 2003 he did not, and was not in my view required to, revisit every aspect of the original sentence. The only matter to which he had to attend was to impose a sentence which accorded with law as the Commonwealth DPP had advanced and sentence the applicant on the basis that the charge against him involved 169.9 grams of ecstasy rather than 339.7 grams. 
     
      
    68 Thus, his Honour only addressed the question of ameliorating the applicant’s sentence by reference to the significance the weight of the ecstasy should be given having regard to the overall criminality of the offence. 
     
      
    69 There is no basis in my view for the applicant’s submission that his Honour failed to have regard to the protective custody issue. He took that issue into account in determining the first sentence. He referred to the remarks he had made at the time of the first sentence when he resentenced the applicant. It was unnecessary for him to reiterate the remarks he made on the occasion of the first sentence. 
     
      
    70 It might be noted, in this respect, that in his first remarks on sentence the sentencing judge attributed no particular significance to the overall weight of the ecstasy upon which the Crown relied although, clearly, it was a matter to which he had some regard. However, as Wong v R, above, emphasises, his Honour had regard, in particular, to the fact that the applicant was a principal and that there was some element of commercial gain. It goes without saying that the applicant was in no doubt about what was being imported. 
     
      
    71 In such circumstances the sentencing judge was required to give chief weight to the deterrent factor of the sentence he was imposing: Wong v R, above, (at [64]). 
     
      
    72 For reasons which, quite frankly, do not emerge from the sentencing judge’s remarks on the occasion of the first sentence, the sentencing judge took the view that he should deal with the matter leniently. I would agree with his remarks. The applicant was given the benefit of that leniency when the first sentencing exercise was undertaken – a benefit he retained on the imposition of the final sentence. It is clear that, having reviewed his remarks of April 2003, the sentencing judge struggled on the second occasion to reduce the sentence in any respect.  
     
      
    73 In my opinion the applicant has failed to make out his grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    74 I would grant the application for leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the substantive appeal. 
     
      
    75 LEVINE J: I agree with McColl JA. 
     
      
    76 HIDDEN J: I agree with McColl JA.

    3 HOWIE J: This is an appeal by the Crown brought pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The appeal relates to rulings made by his Honour Judge Puckeridge in the District Court in respect of evidence the Crown seeks to adduce in a trial listed for hearing before his Honour. The respondent has been indicted on 18 charges of what might be referred to as child sexual assault offences alleged to have been committed against the male complainant between January 1995 and December 1996. The complainant was at the relevant time between the ages of 12 and 14 years. The evidence, the subject of the appeal, is said by the Crown to be tendency evidence admissible under s 97(1) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    4 The Crown case is that the respondent engaged in homosexual intercourse and other indecent behaviour with the complainant whom he met in the early part of 1995. The complainant’s account is that he was introduced to the respondent through a mutual friend who was at the time about two years older than the complainant. The respondent was at that time in his late twenties. The mutual friend is the witness whose evidence is at the heart of the present appeal and to whom I shall refer as DE. The complainant alleges that the respondent engaged in anal intercourse with him on numerous occasions and these and other sexual acts between the two occurred in circumstances where the respondent had on occasions shown the complainant pornographic videos and had administered to him some type of drug. 
     
      
       
      Chronology 
      
    5 The respondent was first charged with offences arising from the complainant’s allegations in December 2003. 
     
      
    6 On 7 January 2004 DE made a statement to police about events he said took place when he was in year 9 at school. That statement contained a broad allegation that over a period of 18 months the respondent had “forced me to have anal sex with him and he gave me drugs”. DE was then aged 14 or 15 years. The statement also alleged that the witness was in the presence of both the respondent and the complainant when the respondent asked the complainant to expose his penis because the respondent wanted the witness to see that the complainant had no pubic hair. DE stated that the complainant had complied with this request. The statement also referred to an incident when DE and the complainant were in the respondent’s motor vehicle. The respondent asked the complainant to give him a kiss. The complainant lent forward and the respondent kissed him on the lips. 
     
      
    7 This statement was not part of the police brief served upon the respondent in March 2004. The respondent’s solicitors had, however, become aware of the allegations made by DE and wrote to the Director’s office noting that the statement had not been served. The statement was served on the respondent on 15 March 2004. The solicitors for the respondent thereafter wrote to the Director’s office indicating that they required the complainant and DE to be called at committal proceedings for cross-examination. The Solicitor for Public Prosecutions replied indicating that it would oppose that application. The respondent did not pursue the matter in the Local Court and no witnesses were examined in the committal proceedings. The respondent was committed for trial on 25 May 2004. 
     
      
    8 The respondent was arraigned in the District Court on the committal charges on 4 June 2004 and the matter listed for a trial on 2 August 2004. The Crown thereafter notified the respondent’s legal representatives that it intended to substantially change the charges upon which the respondent was to stand trial, including adding counts for which the respondent had not been committed for trial. These changes resulted in a successful application for the trial date to be vacated. 
     
      
    9 On 5 August 2004 a notice, purportedly under s 99 of the Evidence Act, was served upon the respondent in respect of the statement of DE made on 7 January 2004. The respondent contended before this Court, although not before Judge Puckeridge, that the notice failed to accord with clause 6 of the Evidence Act Regulations in that it failed to set out in detail the substance of the evidence of DE to be relied upon as tendency evidence. 
     
      
    10 The next day, 6 August 2004, a new trial date was fixed for 15 November 2004. 
     
      
    11 On 15 November 2004, the trial date, the matter came before the Chief Judge of the District Court. On that day the respondent was served with a further statement made by DE on 15 November 2004. No notice was given by the Crown that it intended to rely upon the material in that statement as tendency evidence. Notwithstanding the late service of this statement on the defence, the respondent did not seek an adjournment of the trial and it was fixed for hearing before Judge Puckeridge on 16 November. 
     
      
    12 On that date his Honour, in advance of the empanelling of a jury, heard argument as to the admissibility of the evidence of DE as tendency evidence. Although defence counsel raised the issue of the failure of the Crown to give notice of its intention to rely upon the evidence in the later statement as tendency evidence, his Honour did not determine whether to allow the evidence under s 100(1) of the Evidence Act. Rather Judge Puckeridge determined that the evidence should not be admitted as tendency evidence on the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. See s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    13 The Crown lodged an appeal to this Court under s 5F(3A) against that ruling. The matter came before this Court on 17 November 2004. The Court indicated that the appeal would be heard on 18 November and, that being the case, the respondent did not oppose a stay being granted of the trial before Judge Puckeridge to allow the appeal to be determined. 
     
      
    14 On 18 November 2004 this Court, differently constituted, struck out the Crown appeal without determining the matter on its merits. During the hearing of the appeal Senior Counsel for the respondent raised the fact that he had objected to the evidence on the basis that notice had not been given under s 99 of the Evidence Act and yet the trial judge had not determined under s 100(1) of the Evidence Act whether to allow the Crown to rely upon the evidence notwithstanding that failure to give notice. In that regard the Court was referred in passing to the decision of this Court in AN (2000) 117 A Crim R 176. It also became apparent to the Court during the hearing that there may have been some basis for the admissibility of, at least part of, the evidence of DE other than as tendency evidence and yet the trial judge had not been called upon to determine that question. As a result of these outstanding issues, the Crown conceded that it was inexpedient for the Court to determine the Crown appeal at that time and consented to the Court striking out the appeal. 
     
      
    15 The matter next came before Judge Puckeridge on 22 November 2004. On that occasion his Honour determined not to accede to an application by the Crown under s 100(1) to dispense with the notice requirement in respect of the evidence of DE set out in the statement of 15 November 2004. His Honour also refused in advance of the trial to consider whether any of the evidence might be admissible other than as tendency evidence. As a consequence of these determinations, his Honour refused to stay the trial. He stood the matter over until 11.30am the next day, 23 November 2004. 
     
      
    16 On 22 November the Crown filed another notice of appeal under s 5F(3A) and immediately sought a stay from this Court pending the determination of that appeal. This Court granted the stay on the basis that the appeal would be heard the next day, 24 November. On that date, after hearing full argument on the matter, the Court reserved its decision but continued the stay of the trial. 
     
      
       
      Statutory provisions 
      
    17 In the light of this background it is now appropriate to set out the statutory provisions relevant to the issues before the Court. 
     
      
    18 Section 5F(3A) states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. 
         
        
       
      
    19 Section 97(1) of the Evidence Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        97 The tendency rule 
          
         
        (1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if:  
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or  
           
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         
         
        (2) Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if:  
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or  
           
          (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.  
          
         
        
       
      
    20 Section 99 of the Evidence Act states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        99 Requirements for notices 
          
         
        Notices given under section 97 or 98 are to be given in accordance with any regulations or rules of court made for the purposes of this section. 
        
       
       
      Clause 6 of the  
      Evidence Act Regulations 2000 
       relevantly provides: 
       
        
         
        (1) This clause is made for the purpose of section 99 of the Act. 
         
        (2) A notice given under section 97(1) of the Act (relating to the tendency rule) must state: 
         
          
          (a) the substance of the evidence of the kind referred to in that subsection that the party giving the notice intends to adduce, and 
           
          (b) if that evidence consists of, or includes, evidence of the conduct of a person, particulars of: 
           
            
            (i) the date, time, place and circumstances at or in which the conduct occurred, and 
             
            (ii) the name of each person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the conduct, or 
             
            (iii) in a civil proceeding — the address of each person so named, so far as they are known to the notifying party. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    21 Section 100 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        100 Court may dispense with notice requirements 
          
         
        (1) The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the tendency rule is not to apply to particular tendency evidence despite the party’s failure to give notice under section 97. 
         
          
         
        (2)………  
         
         
        (3) The application may be made either before or after the time by which the party would, apart from this section, be required to give, or to have given, the notice.  
         
         
        (4)……….  
         
         
        (5) The direction:  
         
          
          (a) is subject to such conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit, and  
           
          (b) may be given either at or before the hearing.  
          
         
         
        (6) Without limiting the court’s power to impose conditions under this section, those conditions may include one or more of the following:  
         
          
          (a) a condition that the party give notice of its intention to adduce the evidence to a specified party, or to each other party other than a specified party,  
           
          (b) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified tendency evidence, or all tendency evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified tendency evidence,  
           
          (c) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified coincidence evidence, or all coincidence evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified coincidence evidence. 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 Section 101(2) of the Evidence Act states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 
         
         
        (1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.  
         
         
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.  
         
         
        (3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.  
         
         
        (4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.  
         
        
       
      
    23 Section 192 of the Evidence Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 
          
         
        (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.  
         
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
         
          
          (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and  
           
          (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and  
           
          (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and  
           
          (d) the nature of the proceeding, and  
           
          (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.  
          
         
        
       
       
      Preliminary objection to the Court’s jurisdiction 
      
    24 The Crown’s Notice of Appeal sets out the following as the judgments or orders against which it appeals: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The evidence of [DE] in a statement of 7 January 2004 and a further statement of 15 November 2004 was inadmissible as tendency evidence 
         
         
        2. The trial not be adjourned pending the filing of an appeal pursuant to section 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
         
         
        3. The refusal to dispense with notice under s 97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act. 
         
         
        4. The refusal to rule on the evidence of [DE] on bases other than tendency. 
         
         
        5. The refusal to rule on whether the notice of tendency evidence notified to the respondent’s lawyers on behalf of the appellant complied with regulation 6 of the evidence Regulation 2000. 
        
       
      
    25 The Crown does not pursue its appeal against orders 2 and 4 above and no argument was placed before the Court in respect of order 5. 
     
      
    26 It is apparent from the chronology above that the most recent ruling of his Honour was that of 21 November 2004 to refuse to dispense with the notice requirement of s 97(1) of the Evidence Act. Of course logically and legally this ruling should have been a step anterior to his Honour determining that the evidence was inadmissible under s 101 of the Evidence Act; a ruling that his Honour made on 16 November 2004. If the Crown could not show that His Honour’s ruling under s 100(1) was erroneous such that it attracted the intervention of this Court, it would be fruitless for this Court to go on to deal with the earlier ruling of his Honour that the evidence was inadmissible by reason of s 101 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    27 Mr Sutherland SC, who appears with Mr Driels on behalf of the respondent, raised a preliminary argument as to this Court’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal against the ruling made on 21 November 2004. It was submitted that the ruling refusing to dispense with the failure to give notice pursuant to s 100(1) of the Evidence Act, was not a “decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence” for the purposes of s 5F(3A). Mr Sutherland argued that his Honour’s ruling was akin to a decision to refuse leave to the Crown to rely upon the evidence and, in accordance with the decision of this Court in R v Milakovic [2004] NSWCCA 199, such a ruling did not fall within the terms of s 5F(3A). 
     
      
    28 Milakovic was an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5F(3A) in respect of a refusal by a trial judge to grant leave to the Crown under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine a Crown witness, Mr Bajic, on the basis that the witness was unfavourable to the Crown. By the time the appeal came on for hearing before this Court the trial judge had aborted the trial and discharged the jury because of the disruption to the trial caused by the appeal brought by the Crown. In dismissing the appeal, Grove J, with whom Dowd J agreed, after setting out the terms of s 5F(3A) stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [9]…………….The question is whether a refusal of leave to cross examine pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act is ""a decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence"". It is common ground that there is no authority construing the scope of that expression as it appears in that provision. The Crown argument proceeded on the basis that the refusal of leave to cross examine Mr Bajic deprived the Crown of the ability to present to the jury the content of his prior statement. It was capable of evidencing the truth of what was contained:  
        Adam v The Queen 
         2001 207 CLR 96 @ par 39(f). This contention merges the concept of a ruling with its potential consequences. The ruling related to an aspect of the conduct of the prosecution case, it was not a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. The circumstance that the Crown could identify the evidence that it wished to adduce did not alter the nature of the ruling. 
         
        
       
      
    29 Sperling J, while indicating his broad agreement with the reasons of Grove J for dismissing the Crown appeal, pointed out the context in which s 38 appears in the Evidence Act. After referring to the relevant chapter headings of the Act, his Honour stated:  
     
      
       
        
         
        [29] A decision giving leave pursuant to s38 to cross-examine the party's own witness is not a decision as to whether certain evidence is admissible. It is, as the heading of Ch 2 suggests, a decision relating to the adducing of evidence, in contrast with the admissibility of evidence to which Ch 3 relates. More particularly, as the heading of Div 4 of Pt 2.1 of Ch 2 suggests, it is a decision concerning the way in which a witness may be questioned. 
         
          
         
        [30] A decision to grant leave pursuant to s38 may result in certain evidence being adduced which would otherwise not be adduced. That, however, does not make the decision whether to grant leave a decision or ruling on the admissibility of the evidence.  
         
        
       
      
    30 The application under s 100(1) was dealt with before Judge Puckeridge on the basis that it was an application by the Crown for leave to adduce the evidence despite the failure of the Crown to give reasonable notice under s 97(1). In truth it was not a case of leave being sought or granted. The power given to the court under s 100(1) is to “direct that the tendency rule is not to apply to particular tendency evidence”. The tendency rule in effect states, and I summarise the provisions of s 97 set out above, that certain evidence is not admissible to prove a particular fact where one of two circumstances exist; either (a) where reasonable notice has not been given by the party seeking to rely upon the evidence to prove that fact or (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not have significant probative value. A direction under s 100(1), that the tendency rule not apply, is in effect a ruling that the evidence is admissible notwithstanding that the Crown failed to comply with s 97(1)(a). Similarly a refusal to give that direction is in effect a ruling that the evidence is inadmissible because the tendency rule applies to it. 
     
      
    31 It seems to me that the situation is not analogous to that considered by the Court in Milakovic. The ruling under s 100(1) is a “decision or a ruling on the admissibility of evidence” in both a technical and a practical sense. A ruling in favour of the Crown meant that the evidence was admissible not withstanding s 97(1). It was not, as in Milakovic, a ruling “related to an aspect of the conduct of the prosecution case” to use the words of Grove J. I note in passing that s 100 is contained in Chapter 3 of the Act, that Chapter being entitled “Admissibility of Evidence”. 
     
      
    32 In any event it seems that the legislature had in mind that the Crown could appeal against a determination in respect of the admissibility of evidence that was not a ruling on admissibility. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine the scope of the matters that might fall within the scope of s 5F(3A) but it seems clear to me that the legislature wished to avoid the section being restricted to rulings on the admissibility of evidence strictly defined. In my view a determination under s 100(1) not to dispense with the notice provisions in relation to tendency evidence is at least a “decision…on the admissibility of evidence” and thus within the scope of s 5F(3A). 
     
      
    33 I, therefore, reject the argument that s 5F(3A) does not apply to the determination made by Judge Puckeridge not to dispense with the notice requirement under s 97(1). 
     
      
       
      The determination under s 100(1) 
      
    34 As I have already indicated, Judge Puckeridge dealt with the application under s 100(1) on the basis that the Crown was seeking leave to rely upon the evidence in the absence of notice. His Honour may be forgiven for that view because there was some looseness of expression in this Court on 18 November 2004, a Court of which I was a member, when the matter was discussed with counsel in a somewhat informal manner. Believing that it was a case of leave being granted or refused, Judge Puckeridge purported to apply s 192 of the Evidence Act when determining whether leave should be granted. Although the Crown was not seeking leave under s 100(1), it was seeking a direction that the tendency rule not apply. Section 192 applies not only to cases where leave is required but also to provisions where the court may give “any leave, permission or direction”. Therefore, s 192 did apply and his Honour was required to give consideration to those matters specified in s 192(2) when determining the application before him. 
     
      
    35 However, the two most important considerations in determining the outcome of that application in the present case was, firstly, the probative value of the evidence and, secondly, any prejudice caused to the respondent by the failure of the Crown to give reasonable notice in accordance with s 97(1)(a). It should be noted that the application under s 100(1) is concerned only with a determination as to whether the tendency rule should apply to the evidence and not whether the evidence is otherwise admissible. If the Crown were successful in that application, it would not necessarily follow that the Crown would be permitted to adduce the evidence: s 101 would still have to be considered. There is a two-step approach to admitting tendency evidence at the behest of the Crown in criminal proceedings. A successful application under s 100(1) only completes the first step; the admissibility of the evidence under s 97(1). 
     
      
    36 In the present case Judge Puckeridge had already in his judgment of 16 November 2004 determined that evidence in accordance with the statement of 15 November was to be rejected under s 101(2). But his Honour was being required in considering the application under s 100(1) to place himself in the position he would have been in before making the determination that the evidence was inadmissible by reason of s 101. This might appear to be a highly legalistic exercise but it was the result of defence counsel not pressing his objection to the failure of the Crown to give notice when the matter was first argued before his Honour. Because defence counsel had taken the point before this Court when the matter was for hearing on the first Crown appeal, and having insisted that the objection had not been waived but was to be resolved by his Honour, Judge Puckeridge was obliged to deal with that application on a principled approach notwithstanding the ultimate view he had formed about the admissibility of the evidence. 
     
      
    37 Of course, if it were the case that his Honour’s initial determination as to the admissibility of the evidence could not be impugned, it might be an exercise in futility for this Court to entertain an appeal by the Crown against his Honour’s refusal to make the determination under s 100(1). But unfortunately I am of the opinion that his Honour’s earlier judgement as to the inadmissibility of the evidence on an application of s 101(2) cannot be supported notwithstanding that it was in effect the exercise of a discretion and one with which this Court would not lightly interfere. 
     
      
    38 It is necessary, therefore, that this Court review his Honour’s reasons for refusing to dispense with the notice requirement for the evidence contained in the statement of DE of 15 November 2004. I should make it clear that this Court understands the pressure in which his Honour was called upon to decide what were not simple questions thrown up by the application and that his Honour was forced to deliver an ex tempore judgement under pressure of immediate review by this Court. I also acknowledge that unfortunately trial judges rarely get the assistance provided to this Court by written submissions and argument in an atmosphere less pressured by the exigencies of the District Court in which trial judges endeavour to bring on a criminal trial of serious criminal charges as expeditiously as possible while doing fairness to the parties involved. 
     
      
    39 His Honour appears to have accepted that some at least of the evidence was sufficiently probative to pass the test of admissibility under s 97(1). His Honour said during the course of his judgment of 22 November on the application under s 100(1): 
     
      
       
        
         
        I accept, as I stated in my ruling of 16 November 2004 that the evidence sought to be adduced is of importance in relation to what leave is sought in respect of” 
        
       
       
      I understand by this that his Honour found that the evidence was sufficiently probative for the purpose of s 97(1)(b). I presume the reference to the evidence being “of importance” is a reference to the test of “significant probative value” applied in  
      R v Lockyer 
       (1996) 89 A Crim R 457. But even if it were, as Mr Sutherland suggested, an acknowledgment of the importance of the evidence to the Crown case for the purposes of s 192, it amounts in effect to an acceptance that the evidence was, disregarding the notice requirement, admissible under s 97(1). 
       
      
    40 With respect that is not an unsurprising finding. On its face the evidence is clearly of significant probative value in proving the Crown case against the respondent: the difficulty comes in determining whether it should be excluded under s 101(2). 
     
      
    41 But if it be the case that his Honour accepted that the evidence had sufficient probative value under s 97(1)(b), the real issue to be resolved under the application pursuant to s 100(1) was whether reliance upon the evidence would be prejudicial to the accused; not in the sense of unfairly prejudicial under s 101, but in the more general sense that the respondent would not be in a position to meet the evidence because of the failure to give reasonable notice. In that regard it should be noted that defence counsel did not seek an adjournment when served with the statement on 15 February although he had the opportunity to make that application. 
     
      
       
      The ruling of 22 November cannot stand 
      
    42 Clearly in determining whether to grant the application his Honour had to consider the practical difficulties for the respondent meeting the evidence of DE caused by the failure of the Crown to give reasonable notice of its intention to rely upon it. This required his Honour, as best as he was able, to investigate the need of the respondent to pursue lines of inquiry that might show DE to have been at least an unreliable witness. His Honour clearly turned his mind to the issue of prejudice to the respondent caused by the failure to give notice but his reasons touch only briefly upon that issue and, with respect, do not address at all how that prejudice might be addressed other than by refusing the application. 
     
      
    43 Further, his Honour apparently took into account what appears to me to have been an irrelevant consideration: the prejudice to the respondent caused by the fact that DE was attempting to recall events 8 or 9 years earlier. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The allegations as referred to by [DE] relate to events in 1995 and 1996. The length of time that has elapsed of itself would bring about unfairness so far as the accused is concerned. 
        
       
      
    44 While I would readily accept that the respondent is prejudiced in his ability to defend himself because of the delay that has occurred since the events about which DE would give evidence, that is not a prejudice caused by the failure of the Crown to give reasonable notice of its intention to rely upon his evidence and was not a matter that could be considered on the application. The earliest the Crown could have given notice was shortly after January 2004 when DE made his first statement. Any prejudice resulting from the fact that DE was to give evidence about matters occurring many years earlier was to be addressed by directions and warnings to a jury and not by rejection of the evidence if it were otherwise relevant and admissible. It was not, therefore, a matter that could be taken into account when determining an application under s 100(1). 
     
      
    45 But from his reasons it seems clear that Judge Puckeridge determined the application against the Crown principally on the basis of applying s 137 of the Evidence Act, his Honour having determined that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by unfair prejudice to the respondent that would be occasioned by its admission. His Honour seems to have been persuaded from his understanding of a passage in Odgers Uniform Evidence Act in the annotations to s 195 that “the discretion to grant leave overlaps the Court’s general discretion to exclude evidence under s 135 and in criminal cases under s 137”. Whatever might be the validity of the proposition in general, I believe that it misled his Honour when dealing with the application in two ways: firstly, it caused his Honour to misunderstand the issue that was before him, and, secondly, it introduced a consideration of s 137 into his Honour’s reasoning when dealing with an application concerning tendency evidence. 
     
      
    46 It seems to me with respect that his Honour became distracted by a consideration of s 137 and erred in rejecting the application on the basis that the evidence would in any event be rejected under that section. As I have indicated, his Honour was concerned with an application for a direction that the tendency rule not apply to the evidence and in the circumstances of this particular case his principal concern was whether the failure to give notice had prejudiced the respondent and whether that prejudice could be addressed if the direction sought were given. I doubt that s 137 has any work to do where s 101(2) applies. I find it difficult to imagine a case where tendency evidence would be admitted notwithstanding s 101(2) but might be rejected under s 137. 
     
      
    47 In any event his Honour simply concludes that the evidence would be rejected under s 137 without explaining what was unfairly prejudicial about the evidence and why the prejudice was such that it mandated the rejection of the evidence rather than simply the giving of directions or warnings to the jury. With respect, adequate reasons for the rejection of evidence will hardly be found in a simple statement that s 137 applies or in a bare finding that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial effect of the evidence. The reasons for judgment must make clear what the unfair prejudice is and why it is of such a kind that the evidence must be rejected despite its probative value. 
     
      
       
      The ruling of 16 November cannot stand 
      
    48 I accept that it might appear to be unduly technical, or even unfair to his Honour, to consider the reasons given on 22 November in isolation and without bearing in mind the reasons given by his Honour for rejecting the evidence on 16 November. It might have been the case that this Court would refuse to intervene in respect of the ruling to dispense with the requirement for notice under s 97(1) if it were apparent that his Honour had properly exercised his discretion in rejecting the evidence when making the earlier ruling on the admissibility of the tendency evidence. It would also be an exercise in futility for this Court to allow the Crown appeal in respect of the later ruling if the Court were able to come to the view that no court properly exercising its discretion under s 101(2) would admit the evidence. However, I am satisfied that his Honour erred in the purported exercise of his discretion to reject the evidence under s 101(2) and I am not persuaded that the evidence was of such little probative value that it must be outweighed by its prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    49 The Crown case is in effect that the respondent engaged in a sexual relationship with the complainant over the period stated in the charges in the indictment. It is alleged that during the course of that relationship the respondent performed fellatio upon the complainant and had anal intercourse with him on a number of occasions. It is also alleged that on at least one occasion the respondent insert his fingers into the complainant’s anus and on another occasion a dildo. The complainant alleges that the respondent incited him to perform similar activity upon the respondent. On at least two occasions the complainant alleges that the respondent gave him some type of drug; once a substance that the respondent called “amyl nitrate” and on another occasion a yellow tablet that the respondent said was “an E”. The complainant also alleges that the respondent showed him pornographic videos on occasions. 
     
      
    50 The Crown submits that there are a number of striking similarities between the conduct alleged by the complainant and that alleged by DE in his statements. There is no evidence to suggest that the complainant and DE had the opportunity of concocting their versions of events together. According to the statement of DE he had not seen the complainant for a period of about 10 years before he made his statement. He also states that he was unaware of whether the respondent was having a sexual relationship with the complainant at the relevant time. 
     
      
    51 The Crown argues that the probative value of the evidence of DE transcends the mere fact that the respondent was having a sexual relationship with another young man at about the time he was in a sexual relationship with the complainant. The Crown relies upon what it says are a number of similarities between the accounts given by the complainant and DE in the way the respondent acted toward them and that this similarity in conduct shows that the respondent had a tendency to act in a particular way to young boys at the time the complainant alleges that he was sexually assaulted by him. It is unnecessary to set out in detail the allegations made by DE that are similar to those made by the complainant, but in my view, when considered as a whole, there is sufficient similarity between the accounts of DE and the complainant for the evidence of DE to satisfy the test of admissibility under s 97(2)(b). 
     
      
    52 Clearly the simple fact, if it were the fact, that the respondent was indecently assaulting DE or engaging in homosexual intercourse with him would not be admissible as proof that he was engaged in similar conduct with the complainant. As Hidden J observed in R v Milton [2004] NSWCCA 195: 
     
      
       
        
         
        31……………..True it is that evidence that the appellant had sexual contact with two boys in their early teens would not, of itself, be sufficient. However, that is not the only common thread in their evidence. What emerges from the testimony of each of them is an attempt by the appellant to foster a relationship with them conducive to sexual contact despite their youth and immaturity. This arises not just from his employing each of them. It is to be found in his encouraging them to drink and use drugs in a manner entirely inappropriate for boys of their age, and in his efforts, by word and deed, to loosen their natural sexual inhibitions. It is also to be noted that, on the account of both complainants, he was prepared to impose his will upon them in the teeth of their resistance. 
         
        
       
      
    53 Milton was a case where there was a joint trial of the allegations made by two different complainants. It was argued on appeal that the evidence of one complainant would not have been admissible as tendency evidence in a trial involving the other complainant and, therefore, there should have been separate trials. This Court rejected the argument holding that the evidence of the conduct of the appellant to each of the complainants was sufficiently similar and sufficiently connected that it was open to the trial judge to admit the evidence of one on the trial involving the other. In reaching that conclusion Hidden J reviewed the common law authorities concerning the admissibility of propensity evidence of the kind before the Court and there is no need for this Court to examine those authorities again in order to determine the present appeal. 
     
      
    54 It was submitted to this Court that the evidence in the present case is not as probative as that in Milton. But it seems to me to be arguably more probative in the present case. In Milton the Crown case was that the relationship between the appellant and one of the complainants took place immediately after the conclusion of the relationship between the appellant and the other complainant. In the present case the Crown alleges that the sexual relationship between the complainant and the respondent was taking place at about the same time as that between the respondent and DE. On the Crown case there were not only similarities between the two relationships but they were to a degree interrelated or at least overlapping. DE, who at the time was in a sexual relationship with the respondent, had introduced the complainant to the respondent. 
     
      
    55 Judge Puckeridge appears to have appreciated that, at least generally speaking, the evidence of DE was significantly probative of the allegations made by the complainant but held that the evidence should be rejected under s 101(2). However, his Honour’s reasons for coming to that view cannot withstand scrutiny. His Honour approached the matter by taking each of the allegations made by DE separately and determining whether that particular allegation had any probative value and, if it did, whether the probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. With respect that was not a proper approach in a case where the Crown was relying upon the cumulative effect of the allegations made by DE. 
     
      
    56 Further, his Honour appears to have taken into account a number of irrelevant considerations in determining to exclude the evidence. For example, his Honour took had regard to the fact that DE was alleging criminal acts by the respondent for which the respondent had never been charged or stood trial. His Honour thought that this was “a particularly significant matter”. Although the fact that DE was alleging serious criminal acts committed by the respondent was a relevant matter in assessing the prejudice arising from the evidence, the fact that the respondent had never been charged with them, or stood trial in respect of them, was irrelevant. His Honour went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In the circumstances of this case, particularly as the accused has not been charged with any offence against [DE] the Court must bear in mind that there is a real risk that a jury might use the evidence of [DE] as positive proof of the accused’s guilt on the twenty-three on which he is indicted. 
        
       
      
    57 With respect, I do not understand the import of this passage of his Honour's reasoning and it seems to me that it reveals possible confusion in his Honour’s mind about the significance of tendency evidence. The simple fact is that tendency evidence is placed before the jury as evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused. The jury are asked to reason that, because the accused acted in a particular way on some other occasion or occasions, he or she must have acted in the same way on another occasion. In the present case, the Crown wishes to adduce the evidence in order to argue that because the respondent acted in a particular way towards DE, he must have acted in the same way towards the complainant. The jury is entitled to use tendency evidence as “positive proof” of the accused’s guilt where it is admitted after a consideration of s 101(2). But the use to be made of the evidence has nothing to do with whether the accused has been charged with any offence arising from the conduct that is the subject of the evidence. 
     
      
    58 Finally, his Honour in his judgment on the admissibility of the evidence failed, in my opinion, to give adequate reasons for his determination that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. It is, with respect, not enough to repeat, as some kind of mantra, words taken from s 101(2) without explaining how it is that the evidence is so prejudicial that it ought to be rejected in the exercise of discretion once it is accepted that the evidence is admissible under s 97(1). I am quite unable from an examination of the whole of his Honour’s reasons to find that any proper evaluation of the evidence based upon the weighing of its probative value as against its prejudicial effect took place. 
     
      
    59 I am of the opinion, therefore, that the Crown’s appeal should succeed in respect of the determination by his Honour under s 100(1) not to dispense with the notice requirement. During the course of the hearing the Court raised with the parities possible orders that the Court might make if it were minded to allow the appeal. The Crown indicated that it would say nothing in opposition to an order dispensing with notice on condition that the trial be adjourned and that the Crown pay the costs of the adjournment including the respondent’s costs of the proceedings before Judge Puckeridge. Counsel for the respondent also indicated that he did not want to be heard in respect of such an order being made if the Court determined, contrary to his submissions, to allow the appeal. 
     
      
    60 I do not believe that the Court should indicate how the discretion arising under s 101(2) should be exercised if, and when, the matters comes back before the District Court for hearing as to the admissibility of the evidence of DE. Of course on that occasion the material before the trial judge might be different to that which was before Judge Puckeridge, particularly if DE is called to give evidence on a Basha inquiry and is cross-examined on behalf of the respondent. Further, the nature of the discretion under s 101(2) is such that reasonable minds might differ on how it should be exercised in any particular case: Milton at [33]. It could not be said that it is not open for a trial judge to exercise the discretion under s 101(2) to reject the evidence, provided of course that the discretion is exercised in a principled way and adequate reasons are given. 
     
      
    61 Judge Puckeridge for reasons that he did not disclose refused to consider the admissibility of parts of DE’s statement on a basis other than as tendency evidence. Of course such a decision was within his Honour’s discretion but I have difficulty in understanding why such a ruling should be postponed until after the trial commences. Part of the evidence that DE would give is clearly admissible as proving the relationship between the complainant and the respondent, if that is a matter in issue at the trial. Mr Sutherland candidly informed the Court that he would have difficulty arguing the contrary. I do not understand how any evidence that might be given by the complainant or any other witness in the Crown case could affect the admissibility of that part of the evidence. For example, the failure of the complainant to give evidence of those facts could not deprive the evidence of its probative value or otherwise lead to the rejection of the evidence. Even if the complainant were to deny that any such incident occurred, it would not follow that DE could not give evidence of those events in accordance with his statement. On the material that is available to this Court, I cannot see any basis upon which that evidence might be rejected in the exercise of discretion and I do not see how that situation could change during the hearing of evidence in the Crown case. 
     
      
    62 Before concluding this judgment, I cannot avoid censuring the Crown for the conduct of this prosecution, not just in the District Court but also in proceedings in the Local Court prior to committal. Had it been the case that the Crown needed leave to bring this appeal, for my part it would have been hard pressed to convince the Court that leave should be granted. This is another instance of this Court being called upon to intervene at the behest of the Crown at the eleventh hour with a trial about to commence or underway in circumstances where the Crown has to a very large part been the author of the problem that it seeks to redress. It is unfair to the trial judge, the accused and other litigants before this Court that the Crown should appeal against a ruling in circumstances of urgency because of its own failure to properly prepare the matter for trial well before the hearing date. I do not understand how this matter was allowed to reach the stage where a ruling on such potentially significant evidence in a trial of such serious charges had to be made on the day listed for the commencement of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    63 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1 The appeal against the judgment of Judge Puckeridge declining to direct that the tendency rule not apply to the evidence of DE be allowed and the judgment be set aside.  
         
         
        2. The Court directs that pursuant to s 100(1) the tendency rule not apply to the evidence contained in the statement of DE dated 15 November 2004 notwithstanding the failure of the Crown to give notice under s 97(1) on the following conditions: 
         
         
          
          (a) the trial of charges against the respondent presently listed before Judge Puckeridge be adjourned to a date to be fixed by the District Court; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the Crown pay the costs of the proceedings before Judge Puckeridge relating to the trial and the costs of the adjournment. 
          
         
         
        3. The Crown appeal is otherwise dismissed.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Michael Davison Tillman, was arraigned before me on 25 October 2004 for the murder of Christopher Joseph Millen at Cremorne on 26 June 2003. On arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter, which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. This was in accordance with discussions which had taken place over some weeks between the prisoner’s lawyers and the Crown, and I regard it as a plea in effect entered when the alternative charge of manslaughter was first offered.  
     
      
    2 An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered which was supplemented by evidence from the prisoner and others. Such evidence was all consistent with the Agreed Statement of Facts.  
     
      
    3 The deceased, Christopher Joseph Millen was 31 years old. The post mortem examination revealed that he was 101 kg and 1.97 metres tall. The prisoner, Michael Davison Tillman was born on 16 October 1971, and accordingly was also 31 years old at the time of the incident. The deceased and the prisoner were well known to each other, and in the past had been friends. Their acquaintance was through the playing at competition level of snooker and similar games. Other friends and acquaintances with similar interests included John Merrigan, Shawn Budd, Jason Scott and Dean Nichols. This group had known each other for several years. 
     
      
    4 The prisoner and the deceased had formerly been very close friends, but following the break-up of the deceased’s relationship with Ms Justine Coulter in September 1992, their friendship waned due to the deceased accusing the prisoner of having a romantic interest in Ms Coulter, which was not in fact the case. As a result, there were arguments between them and ultimately in about February 2003, the prisoner told the deceased that he could no longer be his friend; but although he agreed to give him another chance, he in fact sought to avoid him as much as possible. 5 On the afternoon of Saturday, 21 June 2003, the prisoner and Shawn Budd attended a football match. They then went to the Metropole Hotel at Cremorne, arriving at that hotel at about 8:30pm. The deceased arrived separately at the hotel approximately one hour later at 9:30pm. 
     
      
    6 Shortly after the deceased arrived at the hotel he, the prisoner, Budd and others went to the upstairs part of the hotel where they played pool, drank alcohol and generally socialised for a number of hours. 7 During the evening at one stage, the prisoner and the deceased got into an argument during which the prisoner accused the deceased of being an “imbecile” but he subsequently apologised, although the deceased appears to have been reluctant to accept such apology, and continued to be argumentative and hostile. Both had been drinking; the prisoner estimates that by that time he probably had about 8-10 schooners of full strength beer. He described himself as “not fall over drunk but...intoxicated…half way to being drunk”. In view of his drinking history, which I shall refer to in more detail later, that may be a fair appraisal of his condition. It appears that the deceased had also been drinking although it is not clear to what extent, but on his admission to hospital, he was described as “intoxicated”. 
     
      
    8 Later, probably at about 20 to 4 in the morning, there was another incident between the prisoner and the deceased, when the deceased said to the prisoner: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will kill you if you don’t drop off Justine. I’m 6 foot 4, 100 kilos and I will snap your 75 kilo body in half.” 
        
       
       
      The prisoner replied: 
       
       
        
        “You are being paranoid. It’s one thing to have a few bad days, but you have had a bad year with me. We just can’t be friends anymore.” 
        
       
      
    9 The deceased then swore at the prisoner and head-butted him twice to the forehead over the right eye, so the prisoner got up from his chair and moved away. He then returned and said to the deceased: 
     
      
       
        
        “Don’t worry about the head butts because I know that you will. I’m going now. We will talk when we’re sober.” 
        
       
      
    10 The prisoner then went to leave the hotel and walked quickly towards the door but at the top of the stairs, he heard the deceased behind him say “No, let’s go outside”. The deceased followed the prisoner down the stairs and suggested they go around the corner from the main road to “talk”. When they got around the corner, the prisoner asked “What’s wrong, mate?” whereupon the deceased threw 3 punches at the prisoner, 2 of which connected, knocking him to the ground. The deceased then jumped on top of him with his forearm on the prisoner’s throat, and then moved his hands to the prisoner’s throat and attempted to strangle him.  
     
      
    11 At this stage, the prisoner just “clicked”, to use his word, and gouged at the deceased’s left eye with his right hand, and a struggle ensued on the ground. Ultimately, the prisoner got to his feet whilst the deceased was still on the ground, and kicked the deceased 3 times to the head. He then left the scene leaving the deceased lying on the footpath. A woman passing in a taxi saw the end of the attack and called an ambulance through 000. 
     
      
    12 Ambulance Officers attended the scene and observed that the deceased was suffering from multiple contusions to the occipital regions and to the scalp. There was a laceration to the left eye and he was unable to locate the eyeball because of the amount of blood and disrupted tissue in and around the eye socket. An intensive care ambulance was requested and the deceased was taken to the Royal North Shore Hospital. 
     
      
    13 At the hospital, the deceased was examined by Dr Glen Fernando, Ophthalmology Registrar. He found that the patient was intoxicated and drowsy. The patient’s Glasgow Coma Score was 14 out of 15. Apart from a small laceration to the left neck only the eyes were injured. Dr Fernando found that on the left side of the face, the patient had sustained avulsion of his upper and lower eyelids and canaliculi. There was fat prolapse in front of the globe, as well as torn Inferior Rectus, Inferior Oblique and Levator Palpebrae Superioris muscles. There was no injury to the globe itself. Another practitioner repaired the eyelids, canaliculi and the Inferior Rectus muscles. 
     
      
    14 On the right side, the deceased had sustained an undisplaced lateral orbital wall fracture and a ruptured globe. The rupture was 9mm in length. There was associated haemorrhage. This injury was repaired by Dr Fernando under supervision. At post-operative review, the deceased’s right visual acuity was 6/60, pin holing to 6/36. Intraocular blood persisted. There were reduced ocular movements in all directions. 
     
      
    15 At about 11:55pm on Tuesday, 24 June 2003, the deceased was being escorted to the toilet when he fell. A doctor was called and found him to be alert and orientated. He gave the doctor an account of having previously fainted when he got up to go to the toilet. The deceased complained of shortness of breath and central chest tightness. 
     
      
    16 The deceased fell again on another escorted toilet visit on Wednesday, 25 June 2003 at about 9:40am. At about 10am, he lost consciousness and CPR was performed. An urgent echocardiograph was performed. This showed a grossly dilated and severely hypokinetic right ventricle. At 10:25am he was taken to surgery for an urgent Pulmonary Arteriotomy, which revealed a massive pulmonary embolus (an obstruction by a blood clot that had formed at another location in the circulatory system) detached and lodged in the artery leading from the heart to the lung. 
     
      
    17 Following this surgery, the deceased was maintained on life support. At 8:30pm on 25 June 2003, he underwent exploratory surgery for bleeding in the sternum and around the heart. On the morning of Thursday, 26 June 2003 there was bleeding into the left orbit. A CT scan revealed cerebral oedema and significant swelling post fossa consistent with a severe hypoxic brain injury. His condition deteriorated, and after discussions between family members and treating neurosurgeons, it was decided to withdraw life support. Life was pronounced extinct at 7:20pm on Thursday, 26 June 2003. 
     
      
    18 Dr Paul Botterill, Forensic Pathologist, performed a post mortem examination on 27 June 2003 and concluded that the direct cause of death was Hypoxic Encephalopathy whilst antecedent causes were Pulmonary Thromboembolism and Blunt Force Head Injury.  
     
      
    19 Reports pertaining to the deceased were analysed by Professor Colin Chesterman of the Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Hospital. He opined that on the balance of probabilities the development of deep vein thrombosis and resulting pulmonary embolus were consequent on the combination of trauma, surgery, anaesthetic and immobility. 
     
      
    20 After leaving the scene, the prisoner telephoned his friends when they were leaving the hotel and arranged for them to pick him up in a taxi they had hired, and after going to his friends’ house where he showered and changed his shirt, he and some friends went to the Casino where he spent the day whilst two of his friends, John Merrigan and Dean Nichols, later went to the Royal North Shore Hospital where they spoke briefly with Christopher Millen. 
     
      
    21 The prisoner stayed that night at Jason Scott’s home on the Northern Beaches, and the following day drove to Melbourne where he remained, getting reports on his victim’s condition until he heard on the Thursday evening that he had died. After that he made contact with lawyers in Sydney and on Tuesday, 1 July 2003 in company with his lawyers, he surrendered to police at North Sydney Police Station and was charged.  
     
      
    22 I am satisfied that for some months, the deceased had been difficult in his dealings with the prisoner, and the prisoner had been trying to avoid him to the point of telling him that they could no longer be friends. On the evening of 25 June 2003, the deceased had again taunted and accused the prisoner who ultimately decided to leave the hotel to avoid any further confrontation or unpleasantness. The deceased however followed him out of the hotel, challenged him and started the fight by throwing the first punches. The parties struggled on the ground and at one stage, the prisoner thought the deceased was trying to strangle him so he gouged the deceased’s eye.  
     
      
    23 Up to this stage, I would regard the deceased as the aggressor. The prisoner then got the better of the deceased and got to his feet and whilst the deceased was still lying on the ground defenceless, the prisoner, probably not thinking clearly in his intoxicated state (which is no excuse), kicked him at least 3 times to the head in a vicious cowardly attack, occasioning the injuries which ultimately led to his death. Whilst in hospital before he lost consciousness, the deceased told his brother: 
     
      
       
        
        “I brought this on myself. I was standing up. I started it. I told him we should take it outside.” 
        
       
      
    24 There was no specific agreement as to whether the plea to manslaughter was tendered and accepted on the basis of unlawful and dangerous act, provocation or excessive self defence; but I consider that ultimately it does not matter as there are no graduated scales of criminality in the offence of manslaughter: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381; and it is more important to focus on the circumstances of the particular case. This is not a worst case of manslaughter, but it is nonetheless serious, involving as it does the felonious taking of another human life.  
     
      
    25 The prisoner was born on 16 October 1971, and so was aged 31 at the time of the offence and is now 33. He is the younger of two children and was raised in Sydney. His parents separated about 10 years ago when his father, who was an alcoholic and a gambler left home. Prior to that, he had been violent to his wife and to a lesser degree, to the prisoner, who has had very little contact with him since. He remains close to his mother with whom he was living prior to his arrest.  
     
      
    26 He was bright academically in primary school and won a scholarship to Sydney Boys High School, but in his teenage years, as he became more interested and proficient in snooker and similar games, he lost interest in his studies and although he completed Year 12 and sat for his Higher School Certificate, he did not matriculate. Since then, he has earned his living essentially as a professional ball player although he has had other forms of employment from time to time. At the time of his offence, he was in the process of taking stock of his life, and beginning to look for long-term goals outside ball games and in more regular employment. I have no doubt he has a future in this regard and Mr Craig Duffy, who gave evidence, and who has known him for some years, has offered him a position on his release. He is planning to study a Securities Industries course whilst in custody and whilst on remand has been doing preliminary reading relevant to such course. 
     
      
    27 I have read the reports of Dr Roberts and Mr Taylor. Apart from an altercation with a taxi driver in Melbourne in respect of which he was fined without a conviction being recorded, he has no criminal convictions and apart from his occasional use of prohibited drugs and a habit of drinking to excess about once a week, has been an honest, upright law abiding citizen, and I note the large number of character references tendered and witnesses called on his behalf. Provided he addresses his drinking which I believe he will, I am satisfied that he is unlikely to commit any further criminal offences. He has accepted responsibility for the death of the deceased and expressed his remorse. I am satisfied that he is genuine and sincere in this regard.  
     
      
    28 As the offence was committed after 1 February 2003, the 2002 amendments to s 21A and to Division 1 of Part 4 (ss 44-54D) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 apply, but there is no standard non-parole period set for manslaughter.  
     
      
    29 By reference to s 21A, I note as aggravating features that the offence involved actual violence and the damage caused by the offence was substantial (death), and as mitigating factors that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, there was provocative conduct on the part of the victim, the prisoner has no previous convictions and is otherwise of good character, he is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. He returned from Melbourne and surrendered himself to police reasonably promptly after learning of the deceased’s death, he has pleaded guilty virtually at the first opportunity when it was indicated that a plea to manslaughter would be accepted, and has shown genuine remorse and accepted responsibility. 
     
      
    30 I have also had regard to the Victim Impact Statement from the deceased’s mother and the Court extends its sympathy to her and the rest of the deceased’s family.  
     
      
    31 I have been referred to a number of cases said to be similar to the present in varying degrees, and I have had regard to them and also to the statistics from the Judicial Commission, but each case must depend on its own facts. The prisoner has been in custody since 26 August 2003 and the sentence will date from that day. I am satisfied that his prior good character, unlikelihood of re-offending and that at age 31 this is his first time in gaol constitute “special circumstances” within s 44(2) of the Act. 
     
      
    32 I consider that a notional head sentence of 8 years is appropriate but that should be reduced to 6 years on account of his plea of guilty, having regard to its utilitarian value, his genuine remorse and contrition, and the fact that his plea has saved the deceased’s family and the witnesses from the ordeal of a trial. 
     
      
     
     
      
    33 MICHAEL DAVISON TILLMAN, for the manslaughter of Christopher Joseph Millen, I sentence you to imprisonment and set a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months with a balance of 2 years 9 months making a total sentence of 6 years. The sentence will date from 26 August 2003 and the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 25 November 2006.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the limiting term of 25 years set by Wood CJ at CL following a jury verdict pursuant to s 22(1)(c) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the MHCP Act) that on the limited evidence available, the applicant on 23 March 1996 murdered Kim Louise Meredith. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was arrested on 28 March 1996 and charged with the murder. On 22 April 1997, he was committed for trial to the Supreme Court, but prior to the trial commencing, his legal representatives raised the issue of whether the applicant was fit to stand trial and a fitness hearing was ordered. In February 1999, a jury found that the applicant was not unfit to be tried. His trial commenced on 27 April 1999 and on 15 May 1999, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 10 September 1999, Newman J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a term of 25 years and fixed a non-parole period of 18 years. 
     
      
    3 Once more prior to the trial and on two occasions during it the question of his possible unfitness was again raised but on each occasion Newman J declined to order a further fitness hearing. The applicant appealed against the refusal to order a further fitness hearing and this Court (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Greg James J) upheld the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed that there be a new trial: R v Mailes (2001) 53 NSWLR 251. 
     
      
    4 The matter was mentioned in the Supreme Court on 7 December 2001 to set a hearing date, but on that occasion the issue of whether the applicant was unfit to be tried was again raised by his legal representatives. Consequently, the matter was set down for a fitness hearing which was heard commencing on 4 April 2002 and on 11 April 2002, the jury found that the applicant was unfit to be tried.  
     
      
    5 The Solicitor General, as delegate for the Attorney General then directed that there be a special hearing pursuant to s 19 of the MHCP Act. Such special hearing commenced on 24 March 2003 before Wood CJ at CL and a jury. On 22 April, the jury returned a verdict pursuant to s 22(1)(c) of the MHCP Act namely that upon the limited evidence available, the applicant committed the offence charged that is, the murder of Ms Meredith. On 1 August 2003, Wood CJ at CL nominated a limiting term pursuant to s 23(1)(b) of the MHCP Act of 25 years and it is in respect of that limiting term that the applicant brings the present appeal. After an extensive review of the legislation and following the decision of this Court in R v Mitchell (1999) 108 A Crim R 85, his Honour declined to fix a non-parole period as part of the limiting term. 
     
      
    6 There is no dispute that in the light of the definitions of “conviction” and “sentence” in s 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the verdict of a jury in the special hearing constitutes a “conviction”, and that the limiting term nominated by the judge constitutes a “sentence” for the purposes of s 5(1)(c).  
     
      
    7 The facts of the offence and the subjective features of the applicant are set out in detail in the Remarks Nominating the Limiting Term: R v Mailes [2003] NSWSC 707. They may be briefly summarised as follows.  
     
      
    8 The deceased, who was a 19 year old university student, worked part time as a bar assistant at a hotel in Albury. After finishing work about midnight on 22/23 March 1996, she drove to another hotel where she met up with friends. She left there between about 1:30am and 1:45am on 23 March and was not seen alive again. It was the Crown case, accepted by the jury, that she was intercepted and killed by the applicant after leaving the second hotel. Her naked body was found in a car park at 2:58am on 23 March by a security guard. Her clothing was found in various locations nearby, as were her handbag and personal papers.  
     
      
    9 She had two incised wounds to the neck, one of which was the cause of death, as well as abrasions consistent with her body having been dragged from the location where she had been killed to an area nearby and back again, and two shoe impressions were found in the blood trail near her body, each of which was consistent with the sole pattern of the shoes worn by the applicant. Blood, the DNA of which was consistent with that of the deceased, was found on the applicant’s trousers, shirt and joggers, and he was found in possession of a Guess brand wristwatch belonging to the deceased. There was also evidence that the applicant attempted unsuccessfully to access the deceased’s bank account through an ATM machine at about 2:40am. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was born on 22 February 1973 and so was 23 years old at the time of the killing. He came from a disturbed background, having seen his father murdered in 1984 when he was aged 11 years. He had been found to be uncontrollable in 1985 and admitted to wardship in 1987, as a result of which he had spent a considerable portion of his life in institutions. He had over the years been reviewed and assessed by a number of psychologists and psychiatrists who had variously described him as intellectually disabled and suffering chronic brain syndrome, and moderate mental retardation, whose ability to comprehend things happening around him was grossly impaired, personality disorder, intermittent explosive disorder and an inability to accept responsibility for what had occurred. Dr Susan Hayes described him as functioning in the moderate range of intellectual ability at a lower level than 99.9 percent of the population and that in relation to the skills of daily living, he was functioning at a moderate to severe level of intellectual disability. There was no evidence of schizophrenia or psychiatric illness. 
     
      
    11 Wood CJ at CL found that although the applicant was street wise to a degree and capable of some independent living, his capacity for judgment and reasoning must be regarded as significantly impaired: [47]. He also found that he will continue to be a danger to the community, unless he maintains his medication and continues to be under close supervision: [56]. 
     
      
    12 The nature and conduct of special hearings in respect of persons found unfit to be tried are provided for in s 21 of the MHCP Act. Section 22 specifies the verdicts which a jury may reach at a special hearing, including “that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged”: s 22(1)(c). The legal effect of such a verdict is prescribed by s 22(3) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) A verdict in accordance with subsection (1)(c)…..: 
         
         
          
          (a) constitutes a qualified finding of guilt and does not constitute a basis in law for any conviction for the offence to which the finding relates; and 
           
           
          (b) subject to s 28, constitutes a bar to further prosecution in respect of the same circumstances; and  
           
           
          (c) is subject to appeal in the same manner as a verdict in an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings; and 
           
           
          (d) is to be taken to be a conviction for the purpose of enabling a victim of the offence in respect of which the verdict is given to make a claim for compensation.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    13 Section 23 deals with the procedure which the court must undertake after a finding under s 22(1)(c). It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “23(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged.…the Court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment or penal servitude; and 
           
           
          (b) where the court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as “a limiting term”, in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of committal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 Once the limiting term has been nominated, the court refers the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) and makes such orders with respect to custody as it considers appropriate: s 24(1). The Tribunal determines the appropriateness of hospital treatment and notifies the court accordingly: s 24(2), (3). The court may make an order as to the custody of the accused: s 27. Pursuant to ss 28-30 if, prior to release on the expiration during the limiting term, a person is found by the Tribunal to have become fit to be tried, and this is confirmed by the court, the criminal proceedings are continued, but if convicted any periods of custody or detention before, during or after, the special hearing must be taken into account in determining the period of any sentence. 
     
      
    15 If the accused is detained in a hospital, prison or other place, the accused is a “forensic patient”: Sch 1, Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW). Thereafter, the continued detention of the accused is determined by procedures established by Chapter 5 of the Mental Health Act. The Tribunal must review forensic patients at least once every six months and make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the patient’s continued detention, care or treatment, fitness to be tried for an offence and release (conditional or unconditional): s 82. A recommendation for release triggers a series of steps which may lead to the patient’s release: ss 83, 84.  
     
      
    16 At the end of the limiting term, release from custody as a forensic patient is automatic. If the person is mentally ill or mentally disabled at the time the limiting term expires, and a medical practitioner is satisfied that no other appropriate means for dealing with the person are reasonably available, the person may be detained as a continued treatment patient: s 89, in which case the Tribunal may order his or her detention for further observation or treatment or both: s 57. The various steps and procedures are conveniently summarised in Tables 2 and 3 to the Mental Health Act, although not forming part of that Act.  
     
      
    17 The grounds of appeal were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1) His Honour erred in the particular circumstances of this case by not setting the overall term by reference to the minimum term originally imposed by Newman J. 
         
         
        2) Alternatively, the limiting term imposed was excessive insofar as, even should it be determined the limiting term should not in the circumstances have been strictly constrained by the prior minimum term, then at least the overall term should have been reduced by reference to that consideration. 
        
       
      
    18 Both grounds were based, as I understand the submissions, on the proposition that whereas under the sentence imposed by Newman J, the applicant had a right to apply for release on parole after 18 years, under the limiting term nominated by Wood CJ at CL he had no such right, and consequently was worse off as a result of his successful appeal, contrary to the principles which normally apply to re-sentencing after a successful appeal and re-trial. 
     
      
    19 It is now well established that ordinarily, where a person is sentenced following a re-trial consequent upon the quashing of a conviction by this Court, such person should not receive a longer sentence than that received following the first trial: R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416 at 419, R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711, R v MM (2002) 135 A Crim R 216, R H McL v The Queen [2000] 203 CLR 452, although there will be exceptional cases where this prima facie approach may be departed from. The reasons behind the convention are explained in the cases cited, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here.  
     
      
    20 As the offence was committed prior to 1 February 2003, the relevant sentencing legislation is the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it stood in relation to Part 4 Division 1 (ss 44-54) prior to the amendments effected by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, no 90, although the amendments to s 21A effected by that Act were applicable at the time Wood CJ at CL nominated the limiting term.  
     
      
    21 Section 44 provided that when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court was required: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(a) firstly to set the term of the sentence, and 
         
         
        (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence…..” 
         
        
       
      which was described as the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence, whilst subs (2) provided that the non-parole period must be not less than three quarters “of the term of the sentence” unless special circumstances were shown. “ 
      Sentence 
      ”, when used as a noun, is defined in s 3(1) of that Act as “ 
      the penalty imposed for an offence 
      ”. These provisions make it clear that the “ 
      sentence 
      ” is the total or head sentence, and the non-parole period is merely a part of the “ 
      sentence 
      ”. 
       
      
    22 The MHCP Act s 23(1)(b) requires the judge to nominate as the “limiting term” the best estimate of the “sentence” the Court would have considered appropriate if the person had been found guilty of the offence at the normal trial. “Sentence” is not defined in the MHCP Act so I would regard “sentence” in that Act as having the same meaning as in the CSP Act, namely the total or head sentence and not the non-parole period. Wood CJ at CL in setting the limiting term was therefore required by s 23 of the MHCP Act to make the best estimate he could of the head sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the applicant had been fit to be tried and been found guilty of the offence in a normal trial. 
     
      
    23 A similar approach was taken in R v Mitchell (1999) 108 A Crim R 85, a case decided when the Sentencing Act 1989 was in force. In that case, a special hearing having found that on the limited evidence available, the applicant had committed the offence, the judge nominated a limiting term of 18 years and 8 months, divided into a minimum term of 14 years and an additional term of 4 years and 8 months. The applicant appealed and submitted that the judge erred in dividing the limiting term into a minimum and an additional term. In a joint judgment, the Court held that s 23 of the MHCP Act did not authorise such a division and only required the nomination of a total term saying at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing in the wording of the section which warrants the nomination of a minimum and additional term. Nor does the purpose and policy of this section indicate that the limiting term should be so divided. In the first place, a minimum term is inconsistent with the (MHCP) Act review process under which a person subject to a limiting term may be released at any point prior to the expiration of the limiting term. Secondly, to do so would not serve any rehabilitative purpose as is the case under the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW).” 
        
       
      
    24 In response to a submission that the limiting term under s 23 should be an estimate of the minimum term and not of the whole sentence, the Court observed that whether a prisoner was released at the end of the minimum term depended on a consideration of the matters specified in s 17 of the Sentencing Act (now s 135 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999) which included giving primacy to the public interest, having regard to the prisoner’s behaviour during the minimum term and having regard to whether the prisoner, if released, would be able to adapt to normal lawful community life. The Court noted that the additional term specified the period beyond which the person could no longer be detained or otherwise subject to penal supervision, and contrasted that with the limiting term which is the period beyond which a person cannot be detained for the offence which was the subject of the special hearing, and noted that such right to release was fundamental to the whole structure of the legislation. 
     
      
    25 In response to the submission that if the limiting term was an estimate of the total sentence, a person could be detained until the expiry of the entire term, and thus potentially be subject to a longer period of detention than the prisoner released on parole of the expiry of the minimum term, the Court said at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In our opinion, the appellant’s submission on this point must fail. Section 23 requires a comparative estimate of “the sentence” considered appropriate if the person had been found guilty after a normal trial. The “sentence” is expressly defined in s 5(4) to be the totality of the minimum and additional term. The “minimum term” is, by the terms of s 5(1)(a), a specified part or term of “the sentence” which is imposed under the section. The purpose in the comparative exercise required by s 23 is to ensure that a limiting term under the (MHCP) Act is neither more harsh nor more lenient than a total sentence would have been in a case of a person fit to plead. Thereafter the operation of the two Acts diverge to take account of the different circumstances with which they deal. In the case of the  
        Sentencing Act 
        , the concern is with the person’s fitness for parole after having served the minimum term. Under the (MHCP) Act the concern is with the person’s mental state from time to time. A person dealt with under that Act is subject to at least six monthly reviews by the Tribunal throughout the course of the limiting term, and may be released prior to the expiry of the limiting term. The fact that a person may be detained for the whole of the limiting period does not involve any unfairness. Rather, the two different schemes give recognition to the differing purposes of the two Acts.” 
        
       
      
    26 This Court then proceeded to itself fix a fresh limiting term and fixed it at 18 years 4 months, which was the total of the minimum and additional terms fixed by the trial judge. 
     
      
    27 Although the Sentencing Act has been repealed and replaced by the CSP Act, I am satisfied that this case remains authoritative under the later Act and should be followed.  
     
      
    28 Although the terminology has been changed (“non-parole period” for “minimum term”, etc) and there is no express provision in the CSP Act similar to s 5(4) of the earlier Act, the scheme of s 44 as it stood before the 2002 amendments is, so far as relevant for present purposes the same, namely a non-parole period which is the minimum term for which the prisoner must be kept in detention, and a further period during which he or she may be released to conditional liberty on parole.29 There is, in my opinion, yet a further reason why the “sentence” referred to in s 23 must be a reference to the total sentence and not to the non-parole period. The only authority in the CSP Act for setting a non-parole period which is less than the total sentence is s 44 which is in Division 1 of Part 1 of the Act; but s 54 expressly provides that the Division does not apply to the sentencing of an offender to detention under the MHCP Act. A corresponding provision was formerly to be found in s 13(d) of the Sentencing Act, but it only provided that the relevant Part of the Act did not apply to detention under ss 25 or 39 of the MHCP Act, which relate to detention following a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. The broader exclusion in the CSP Act is, in my view, significant and must have been intended to refer to all detention under the MHCP Act, including detention under ss 23, 24 and 27. Consequently, simply as a matter of construction, there is no statutory authority in the case of a limiting term for fixing a non-parole or equivalent period at less than the total term. 
     
      
    30 It was submitted that this approach gave rise to an anomaly in the case of persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment for not more than 3 years because in those cases the sentencing court is required to make an order for their release on parole: s 50, and so limiting terms of not more than 3 years would need to have a non-parole period fixed so that s 50 could be complied with. However, s 50 is also in Division 1 of Part 4 and consequently does not apply in the case of limiting terms. Not only is there no authority to fix a non-parole period, but in the case of limiting terms of not more than 3 years, there is no authority for the sentencing court to order earlier release on parole during that period. 
     
      
    31 Incidentally, although not relevant to this case, similar considerations would apply to the new s 44 inserted by the 2002 amendments and applicable to offences committed after 1 February 2003. The section now talks of a “non-parole period for the sentence”: sub-s (1) and the “balance of the term of the sentence”: sub-s (2). What was s 51 has now become s 54D, and, so far as is relevant, is in the same terms. 
     
      
    32 The objects of sentencing a person who has been convicted of a crime following a trial are the punishment of such person and the other objects set out in s 3A of the CSP Act. The object of nominating a limiting term is not to punish the person who has not been convicted of any crime, but to ensure that he or she is not detained in custody longer than the maximum the person could have been detained if so convicted following a proper trial, although such person may be released prior to the expiration of such limiting term depending on the person’s condition, or if such person becomes fit to be tried during such term, he or she can be tried according to law and if found guilty at such trial, can have a proper sentence fixed with a non-parole period. The maximum time that a person can be detained if convicted at a proper trial is the head or total sentence not the non-parole period: MHCP Act s 28 which sentence must take into account any time served under a limiting term. 
     
      
    33 When the appeal was called on for hearing, Mr Dalton, who appeared for the applicant, said that he had indirectly received some information which suggested that one of the factual propositions on which the reasoning in Mitchell was based, namely that persons serving limiting terms were subject to regular reviews by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and could in appropriate cases be released, conditionally or otherwise, pursuant to s 84 prior to the expiration of such limiting terms, was incorrect, and that there was an executive policy that such persons were not to be released prior to such expiration.  
     
      
    34 He therefore sought an adjournment to obtain relevant evidence on this point. The Court refused the adjournment but granted him and the Crown leave to obtain further evidence on the issue and make further written submissions thereon. The Legal Aid Commission, on behalf of the applicant, and the Director of Public Prosecutions both wrote to the Mental Health Review Tribunal which provided a single reply to both requests; and this correspondence together with both sets of further Written Submissions have now been received. 
     
      
    35 In reply to the question whether there is a policy regarding conditional release of persons serving limiting terms, the Tribunal acknowledged its jurisdiction under ss 80(1)(b) and 82 of the Mental Health Act and stated it did not have a policy on the release of such persons prior to the expiration of such terms. It pointed out that generally persons serving limiting terms have an intellectual disability (such as the applicant) and not a mental illness, and usually such persons are detained in the correctional system, subject to the same security classifications as other inmates but, because they do not have non-parole periods, they are not eligible for early release. On the other hand, persons who have a mental illness may spend part or all of their limiting term in hospital receiving treatment for their mental illness, and up to 6 months prior to the expiration of their limiting term they may be classified as a “continued treatment patient” under s 89 of the Act which leads to the cessation of their forensic status and their continued confinement as a compulsory treatment patient under s 57. 
     
      
    36 The Tribunal advised that it was particularly difficult for persons with intellectual disability serving limiting terms to obtain conditional early release because such applications are seldom made on their behalf and there is a severe lack of support services in the community to manage such persons post release. It was therefore unlikely the Tribunal would be able to satisfy itself on the question of management of risk to the patient or the community. The Tribunal also advised that there is in fact no one currently under its jurisdiction, serving a limiting term who has been released prior to the expiry of their limiting term. In response to a similar enquiry, the Attorney General replied that in determining whether to object to the release of a limiting term forensic patient, he would consider each case on its merits by reference to the grounds specified in s 84(1) of the Mental Health Act.  
     
      
    37 The responses of the Tribunal and of the Attorney General indicate that there is no official executive policy to ensure that persons subject to limiting terms are not released conditionally or unconditionally prior to the expiration of the limiting terms although, in practice, such early releases are most unlikely, at least in the case of intellectually disabled inmates.  
     
      
    38 However, the Court’s reasoning in Mitchell was based on the proper construction of the legislation and, in my view, is not affected by the material now adduced or its practical application. The effect of the statutory provisions, including the possible early release of persons subject to a limiting term remains valid and Mitchell should continue to be followed.  
     
      
    39 The difficulties facing intellectually disabled persons subject to limiting terms has been raised by the Tribunal and considered by, inter alia, the Law Reform Commission which, in its Discussion Paper no: 35, People with an Intellectual Disability and the Criminal Justice System: Courts and Sentencing Issues (October 1994) raised the possibility of amendment to the legislation so that the limiting term was divided into minimum and additional terms, but in its final report on the issue: Report no 80 (December 1996) expressly rejected the proposal. 40 Once it is accepted that the limiting term is to be nominated by reference to the head or total sentence that would have been imposed following a conviction in a proper trial and without the setting of a non-parole period, and Wood CJ at CL having nominated a limiting term which is not in excess of the head sentence imposed by Newman J following the first trial, there can be no breach of the convention referred to in Gilmore and the other cases cited above. I assume for present purposes that the convention is applicable to the setting of limiting terms, although this may not necessarily be so, and the question, on which I express no concluded view, may need to be considered if it subsequently arises.  
     
      
    41 It follows that the first ground of appeal must fail. 
     
      
    42 As to the second ground of appeal, it was submitted that if the MHCP Act did not authorise the provision of a limiting term consisting of a non-parole period and a head sentence, or if Gilmore and that line of cases did not require the limiting term to be fixed by reference to the non-parole period fixed after the trial at law; then having regard to the difficulties faced by persons subject to serving limiting terms in obtaining early release, as outlined in the Tribunal’s reply, the limiting term should be fixed at something less than would be appropriate for a head sentence following conviction at a proper trial, to take account of these factors, and it was suggested that the position should be regarded as analogous to that of a prisoner serving a sentence on protection. In addition, reference was made to what was said by Matthews J in R v Boyle (unreported – 18 September 1992).  
     
      
    43 The difficulty with the submission is that it is contrary to the statute which, as I have shown, requires the limiting term is to be set by reference to the head sentence that would have been imposed following a guilty verdict in a proper trial. The fact that there is no provision for the equivalent of a non-parole period does not affect the term of the head sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, and there is no logical reason for reducing it simply because there is no provision for a non-parole period or its equivalent. 
     
      
    44 In addition, the submission is inconsistent with the reasoning in Mitchell where the different objects and different consequences of a regular sentence and the nominating of a limiting term were explained. I have dealt with these above and it is not necessary to repeat them. 
     
      
    45 The applicant is not a prisoner serving his sentence on protection but is accommodated in the ordinary section of the gaol, and at the time of the proceedings before Wood CJ at CL was housed in the Special Unit of Long Bay and employed as a sweeper. Any disadvantages he suffers in relation to his imprisonment do not relate to the conditions of his incarceration, but to the unlikelihood of early release. In fact, any alleged unfairness in not being eligible for early release on parole is more apparent than real because, just as his prospects of early release during his limiting term under s 82 are virtually negligible, the same factors would hinder his release on parole under a proper sentence having regard to the requirements of s 135 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act.  
     
      
    46 Boyle was a particularly anomalous case in that, although of full mental capacity at the time of the alleged commission of the offences and at the time of the committal proceedings, the offender subsequently attempted to commit suicide, as a result of which he sustained severe brain damage and his mental capacity was grossly impaired. He was found unfit to be tried and later at a special hearing, found to have committed the offences. The case is clearly distinguishable from the present, and is not of assistance on the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. 
     
      
    47 I am therefore satisfied that the second ground also fails and no error has been disclosed in the nominating of the limiting term. 
     
      
    48 I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: Steven and Shiree Smit and Donna Tarrant were jointly indicted on a charge that on or about 29 August 2001 at Katoomba they murdered Craig Collins. Following trial before Hulme J and a jury they were convicted and sentenced. Each appeals against conviction. None of them seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    2 At approximately 9 am on Thursday 30 August 2001 Katoomba Police received the first of some anonymous telephone calls, as a result of which they attended at 2/80 Camp Street. They discovered the naked body of Mr Collins wrapped in two blankets. Within the blankets were also wrapped two bloodstained jumpers and a cricket bat. There were large amounts of blood and blood staining throughout the flat. 
     
      
    3 On a lounge chair were found three knives. Another knife was found under a lounge chair and still another on a bed. Some of these knives and other items within the flat were stained with blood identified as that of the deceased and his DNA was detected on a number of items. Dr Ellis, a pathologist who performed the post mortem, testified that death was principally caused by a blow to the throat which fractured the larynx, caused swelling which in turn deprived the victim of oxygen. There were twelve stab wounds, two of which could have contributed to the death, of which one, a penetrating wound to the lung, certainly did. The body also displayed numerous signs of trauma. There were located fourteen areas of bruising, fifty eight abrasions, ten lacerations and eight scratches. There were said to be in excess of one hundred injuries ranging from the minor to the very serious. 
     
      
    4 The opinion of Dr Ellis and evidence from a Mr Mallard (a neighbour of the deceased who saw him at about 2 am on the Wednesday when he asked him to turn down some loud music) establish a likelihood that the killing occurred between 2 am and the daylight hours on that Wednesday.  
     
      
    5 Forensic investigation revealed a partial left palm print of Mrs Smit on one of the knives found on the lounge chair. It was described as a bloodstained steak knife with the blade slightly bent. Ms Tarrant’s right palm print was discovered on the back of the blade of the cricket bat, which was wrapped in the blanket with the body. The various testings of blood and bloodstains within and upon items within the flat were identified as matching that of the deceased. 
     
      
    6 A search of the flat located a wallet containing Medicare and Bankcards, a birth certificate and accounts relating to Ms Tarrant. 
     
      
    7 As a result of enquiries Mr and Mrs Smit were arrested on Friday 31 August. Ms Tarrant was also in police custody on that day, apparently in connection with something else, but she was interviewed about the murder on the following day. 
     
      
    8 Steven Smit participated in a video recorded interview with police. Initially he told them that he had last seen the deceased on the previous Sunday but then admitted that he was at the flat on the Tuesday/Wednesday night when he had intervened to prevent Mr Collins from “raping” his flatmate (a reference to Ms Tarrant). His version then was that the men engaged in physical confrontation during which Mr Smit had grabbed the deceased around the throat “a little bit”. Mr Collins was said to be at the time wearing a shirt but no pants. Later it was Mr Collins who produced a cricket bat and he struck Steven Smit with it, however, the latter was able to take it from him and throw it away. It might be mentioned that the deceased was a small man of about five feet in height and six and half stone in weight, whereas Mr Smit was a large man some six feet two inches tall.  
     
      
    9 After the bat was thrown away Mr Smit claimed that Mr Collins produced a knife and stabbed Ms Tarrant in the thigh. At one point he told police that he thought he remembered Ms Tarrant climbing over the deceased and jumping out the window, as a result of which she thought she was going for help. Thereafter he sat on the lounge and eventually waited for some eight or nine hours during which he fell asleep. 
     
      
    10 When he awoke from sleep he saw the deceased’s naked body. Out of respect, he wrapped him in the blankets (including the cricket bat) and moved the body into the kitchen. He put some items on a lounge chair, one of them being a knife. He found some keys, which he used to lock the premises after which he departed and went to his home arriving at about 4.30 or 5 am. 
     
      
    11 When he arrived he found that both his wife and Ms Tarrant were already there. Mrs Smit had been at the Camp Street flat but her husband said she was only involved to the extent of trying to stop Mr Collins from hitting him with the cricket bat.  
     
      
    12 Police search of the Smit’s premises located Mr Smit’s tracksuit pants, yellow teeshirt and jogging shoes, all of which had spatter of the deceased’s blood on them. At trial this spatter was the subject of expert interpretation evidence. This showed that the spatter was not consistent with having occurred if Mr Smit had merely wrapped a bloodstained body in the blankets and moved it. 
     
      
    13 Mrs Smit exercised her right to decline to answer police questions. 
     
      
    14 Ms Tarrant was interviewed in the early hours of 1 September. She acknowledged that she was also known as Thompson. A document from Centrelink in that name had been located at the Smit’s premises. Ms Tarrant said that she had resided at the Camp Street flat with a friend called Wanda and the deceased sometime ago, but that for the previous three to four months had been residing at Darley Street with a Mr Ricky Ranse. She said she had not seen Mr Collins for over a week, the last occasion being an encounter at the Katoomba Hotel. She had not been at the deceased’s flat on the Tuesday/Wednesday and had not been the victim of any attempted rape by him there. She claimed she had no knowledge of his death until told about it by police. She said that she had been at the deceased’s flat in company with the Smits but this was around about the time of her birthday (which would have been 24 August). 
     
      
    15 Each appellant was separately represented at trial and on the appeal. Different grounds are presented but common to all is a challenge to the correctness of certain directions given by the learned trial judge regarding the basis upon which an accused might have been found guilty of murder (ground 2 in the appeal of Steven Smit; ground 5 in the appeal of Shiree Smit and ground 2 in the appeal of Donna Tarrant). 
     
      
    16 It is convenient to deal first with this common ground. It is necessary to detail the relevant directions given to the jury and a response to an enquiry made by them during their deliberations. The relevant part of his Honour’s charge to the jury was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let me turn to the legal issues involved in the charge of murder. The legal concept of murder involves a number of separate ingredients to each of which you must direct attention. Precision is required and rather than have you take copious notes or test your memory unduly I am going to have given to you a document which sets these out. The document has been drafted so that as far as possible issues can be kept distinct and dealt with in a logical order and should be regarded as part of my summing up. I will give you time to read the document so that you understand its general form and then explain aspects of it to you. 
        
       
       
        
        MFI #10 HIS HONOUR’S WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TO THE JURY. 
        
       
       
        
        (Copies of MFI 10 handed to the jury and counsel). 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You will note there is one page headed ‘Manslaughter’. Nothing has been said in this case about manslaughter yet but I will come to it. 
        
       
       
        
        The charge against each accused is that he or she on or about 29 August 2001 at Katoomba in the state of New South Wales did murder Craig Patrick Collins. 
        
       
       
        
        I will start off with the ingredients of murder. Before you can convict an accused of murder the Crown must establish to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt each of the matters listed in subparagraphs 1 and 2, and one of the elements in each of the subparagraphs 3 and 4 in the section entitled ‘Murder’. That is the first page. 
        
       
       
        
        In the case of subparagraphs 3 and 4 you do not need to be able to choose between the alternatives or options within each paragraph. Thus, in the case of subparagraph 4, if you are satisfied that an accused’s intention fell within one or other of the alternatives there set out, you do not need to decide or be able to decide which. In the case of subparagraph 3 you do not need to decide whether it was the particular accused who killed the deceased providing you are satisfied that one of the three possibilities listed in the subparagraph existed; and, of course, existed in relation to the particular accused who you are considering at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, in this case some of the matters, for example the death of Craig Collins, are not in dispute. Accordingly you should have no difficulty in being satisfied that that occurred. However, I emphasise that before you can convict you must be satisfied as the document indicates.  
        
       
       
        
        Most of the words and expressions used are ordinary English words and need no explanation, or at least I do not think they do. To the extent that the concepts may be unusual I have sought to explain them by notes at the bottom. However, as I have indicated, if you have any difficulty in understanding what is said in the written directions please feel free to ask for further explanation. 
        
       
       
        
        Let me go to the second page headed ‘Manslaughter’. Even though there is no reference to manslaughter in the indictment the law requires me to tell you that when a charge of murder is brought it is open to a jury that finds murder has not been proved to find an accused guilty of the offence known as manslaughter. I make it clear you will only have occasion to consider this separate topic if in the case of a particular accused you are not satisfied that the Crown has proved that accused guilty of murder. 
        
       
       
        
        Manslaughter has a number of ingredients and these are set out on the second page. Looking at that page you will recognise that in the description the ingredients numbered subparagraphs 1 to 3 are identical with the ingredients in the first three subparagraphs on the page headed ‘Murder’. It is the fourth ingredient which is different. It has two elements: Unlawful and dangerous. The written directions provide an explanation of both of those terms. 
        
       
       
        
        I need say no more on the topic of unlawful but I would emphasise in regard to the concept ‘dangerous’ that the test is an objective one. It is whether a reasonable person in the position of the particular accused would have realised that he or she was exposing the deceased to an appreciable or significant risk of serious injury. I have said in the position of the accused. You consider his or her state of knowledge as that of an adult male or female. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not necessary that the realisation be of injury of the precise nature or extent that occurred. In judging whether an act was dangerous you will not limit your consideration to the actual manner of death disclosed in evidence. If you find that the deceased died as a result of a hard blow to the voice box you will consider whether a reasonable person in the position of the author of the blow would have realised that an appreciable risk of serious injury was created by such a blow in that general area of the body. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, as I have said, manslaughter has not hitherto been mentioned in this trial and it may well be that you do not need to spend much time on it given that the issues which have occupied time have tended to be whether the particular accused actually did anything by way of participating in the death of Mr Collins. I said did anything in the precise terms that I have set out in the written directions, but if you are not satisfied of that accused’s involvement in the death then your verdict will be not guilty of both murder and manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    17 The written direction (MFI 10) was in these terms: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “MURDER 
        
       
       
        
        An Accused should be found guilty of murder if, and only if, in relation to that accused, the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt each of ingredients (i) and (ii) and one of the elements in each of sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv) below. 
        
       
       
        
        (i) that Craig Patrick Collins has died 
         
        AND 
         
        (ii) that his death was caused by a deliberate act; 
         
        AND 
         
        (iii) that the deliberate act was 
        
       
      
    · An act of the particular Accused, or· An act done in furtherance of, and within the scope of, a joint criminal enterprise to which that Accused was a party, or· Done, while the Accused was present, intentionally aiding or encouraging the person who did the act, to do it; 
     
      
       
        
        AND 
         
        (iv) that at the time the act was done, it was done with - 
        
       
      
    · An intention to kill, or· An intention to inflict grievously bodily harm. 
     
      
       
        
        Note 
        : The ‘act’ referred to is not the death of Craig Patrick Collins which, in this context, is at most, a consequence. For the purposes of the charge of murder in this case the ‘act’ alleged is the striking of Mr Collins in the vicinity of his voice box. 
        
       
       
        
        A ‘joint criminal enterprise’ includes an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement to do acts which amount to a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from the circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Grievous bodily harm’ means really (or very) serious physical injury. 
        
       
       
        
        MANSLAUGHTER 
        
       
       
        
        If the Crown has not satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt of the ingredients of murder but, in relation to a particular Accused, establishes beyond reasonable doubt each of ingredients (i), (ii) (iii) and (iv) below, you should find that Accused guilty of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        (i) that Craig Patrick Collins has died, 
         
        AND 
         
        (ii) that his death was caused by a deliberate act; 
         
        AND 
         
        (iii) that the deliberate act was, 
        
       
      
    · An act of the particular Accused, or· An act done in furtherance of, and within the scope of, a joint criminal enterprise to which that Accused was a party, or· Done, while the Accused was present, intentionally aiding or encouraging the person who did the act, to do it; 
     
      
       
        
        AND 
         
        (iv) that the act was both unlawful and dangerous as explained below. 
        
       
       
        
        Unlawful and Dangerous Act 
        
       
       
        
        Included in unlawful acts is the deliberate application of force to another person without that person’s consent. 
        
       
       
        
        An act is  
        dangerous 
         if it is such that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that, by that act, the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable (or significant) risk of serious injury. 
        
       
       
        
        NOTE:- 
        
       
       
        
        Again, the ‘act’ referred to is not the death of Craig Patrick Collins which, in this context, is at most, a consequence. For the purposes of the charge of manslaughter in this case the ‘act’ alleged is the striking of Mr Collins in the vicinity of his voicebox. 
        
       
       
        
        Again, a ‘joint criminal enterprise’ includes an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement to do acts which amount to a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    18 The jury enquiry was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Would it be a valid finding to find one member of the criminal enterprise guilty of murder and another guilty of manslaughter”. 
        
       
      
    19 As was appropriate, his Honour raised the matter of response with counsel. In beginning so to do he expressed his view that the simple answer to the question was “No”. As will appear, his Honour considered that this was the precise answer although there is an available perception that there was imprecision in the formulation of the jury’s question.  
     
      
    20 It should be noted that counsel for Mrs Smit submitted that the answer should not be in the negative, however, thereafter the discussion between Bench and Bar turned its focus upon potential liability for “joint criminal enterprise” as distinct from liability pursuant to alternatives which had been postulated in MFI 10. In the event his Honour responded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “You have used the term ‘criminal enterprise’ in your note. The written directions use the expression ‘joint criminal enterprise’. The implication in the expression ‘joint criminal enterprise’ is that all the participants in it had either an intent to kill or an intent to do grievous bodily harm. If only one had that intention and one did not have the intention, it would not be a joint criminal enterprise. So if by your reference to ‘criminal enterprise’ you meant to pick up the words I have used in the written directions, the answer to your question is, no, they could not be a member of a joint criminal enterprise and not both be guilty of murder or manslaughter as the case may be, assuming they are guilty at all. 
        
       
       
        
        The other thing I wanted to say to you was this: That the way in which the case has been presented here is that of a joint criminal enterprise, not some other non-joint criminal enterprise.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    21 The prosecution case was presented asserting that there had been a joint criminal enterprise to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Collins. However, no doubt with the strictures of Pemble v The Queen 1971 124 CLR 107 in mind, his Honour in his written directions defined the three situations in which an accused might be found guilty of murder and explained the elements of the alternative verdict of manslaughter. 
     
      
    22 The first situation was pertinent if the jury found that the death was caused by a particular accused who, himself or herself, intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The second was engagement in the joint criminal enterprise which was the way the Crown case was specifically presented. The third contemplated accessorial liability. 
     
      
    23 The argument on this ground was initially presented by counsel on behalf of Steven Smit which argument was adopted on behalf of the other appellants. 
     
      
    24 The submissions at that point were essentially focussed upon his Honour’s response to the jury question which it was argued “closed off” from consideration possible findings that in a violent encounter with Mr Collins, Mr Smit inflicted an injury which later proved to be fatal when he used more force than he realized and that, he having “subsided” to the lounge, others inflicted the stabbing wounds with intent on their part to kill or do grievous bodily harm. In this “scenario” the stabbings caused or contributed to the death. 
     
      
    25 When counsel were replying to the Crown oral submissions, a significance in the written directions (which were not elaborated beyond what I have above set out) to a possible finding of facts was identified. With reference to the third situation postulated in the written directions, it was necessary for the jury to be directed that, if considering the case of a particular accused, findings were made that the “act” (defined by his Honour as the striking in the vicinity of the voice box) was done whilst that accused was present intentionally aiding or encouraging another person who did the act to do it, the Crown had to prove to the requisite standard that that accused knew or was aware that the intention of the person who did the act was at that time to kill or cause grievous bodily harm: R v Stokes & Gifford 1991 51 A Crim R 25. 
     
      
    26 The matter having been raised so late in the hearing, the Crown was given an opportunity to respond. In relation to the necessity for direction just described the Crown conceded “it would appear the directions were deficient in this regard”. Clearly it was left the jury to understand that any one of the accused could be convicted of murder if that accused were present intentionally aiding and encouraging another who did the act without the particular accused having any knowledge or appreciation of the requisite intention of the actor. In the absence of that proof the crime of murder on the third alternative would not be made out. 
     
      
    27 There was nothing said in the oral directions which instructed the jury that they could not convict of murder on the third stated basis unless satisfied of the knowledge of the accessory concerning the state of mind of the principal. 
     
      
    28 This ground is made out. The omission of the requisite direction identified in Stokes & Gifford was not observed by anyone at trial. It is conceivable that this came about in the course of production of MFI 10 and overlooking the requirement occurred in the context of a trial in which the principal focus was obviously upon the participation of the accused in the act of killing rather than accessorial liability. As I have mentioned, this remained the case on hearing the appeal until the deficiency was noticed by counsel when invited to reply to Crown submissions. The Crown submits that this Court should nevertheless dismiss the appeals invoking the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Before deciding whether or not so to do, the other grounds of appeal should be considered, however, it is inevitable that the outcome of the appeal will, subject to the further grounds, turn upon whether this is a case in which the proviso can appropriately be applied. 
     
      
    29 Steven Smit raises one other ground (ground 1 in his notice) which asserts miscarriage of justice in the conduct of a joint trial of himself and his wife. Donna Tarrant (ground 1 in her notice) contends that she should have been tried separately from both Mr and Mrs Smit. 
     
      
    30 Although there was a pre trial refusal to order separate trials and further refusal when application was renewed in the course of it, such ground is looked at by this Court in the light of the events which have occurred at trial to determine whether there has been miscarriage: R v Black, unreported NSWCCA 17 February 1992. 
     
      
    31 On behalf of Steven Smit it is acknowledged that a prosecution which alleges a joint criminal enterprise should proceed against all alleged participants together if possible. It is contended that this is “the rare case” in which it was impossible for the appellant to have a fair trial that way.  
     
      
    32 There was evidence initially admitted against Mrs Smit only (as his Honour promptly informed the jury) that on the Wednesday she had a conversation with Ricky Ranse during which she told him that she needed a hand to clean up a “fucking dead body” and that a killing had occurred with a cricket bat done by “both of us, but mainly Steve” who had “belted the fuck out of him”. 
     
      
    33 A change occurred when it was apparently realized by counsel for Ms Tarrant that this evidence could be used to her advantage in that Mrs Smit made no mention to Mr Ranse of her presence or participation. In effect the evidence of what Mrs Smit said to Mr Ranse became evidence (although favourable rather than against) in the case of Ms Tarrant. The jury were informed of this change. The complaint on behalf of Mr Smit is that the risk of the jury misusing this evidence would have been compounded by the stance taken on behalf of Ms Tarrant by embracing it and by her counsel endorsing its accuracy. 
     
      
    34 In addition, in referring to Mr Ranse’s evidence the Crown Prosecutor invited the jury to consider “why would he lie”. That should not have been said: Palmer v The Queen 1998 193 CLR 1. His Honour recognized this and gave directions which are the subject of detailed challenge in connection with a ground advanced on behalf of Mrs Smit but of which the present significance is to attempt to fortify the proposition that the task of the jury in considering the case of Mr Smit, ignoring this evidence, was or verged upon the impossible. 
     
      
    35 The applicable principles concerning separation of trials were expressed by Hunt J in R v Middis unreported NSWSC 27 March 1991 and his statement has been approved by this Court in R v Baartman unreported NSWCCA 6 October 1994 and R v Chami and Sheikh 2002 128 A Crim R 428. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Briefly the relevant principles are that: (1) where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him: and (2) where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and (3) where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.” 
        
       
      
    36 Applying those considerations to the present cases it can readily be perceived that the case against Mr Smit is different from the case against the co-appellants. In distinction from them there is direct evidence of his admissions to engaging in altercation with the deceased and being present in the flat both when Mr Collins was alive and after his death. The interpretation of the deceased’s blood spatter on Mr Smit’s clothing and shoes was a powerful link in establishing the case. Although different, the case against Mr Smit was not significantly weaker than that against those with whom he was jointly tried. 
     
      
    37 It is contended that the evidence complained of “undoubtedly made the prosecution case immeasurably stronger” against the appellant. Obviously, if it was admissible to rely on evidence that his wife said that he executed the killing that would be so, but the application of principle requires evaluation of risk. In this case the risk postulated is that the jury would disobey clear instruction that the particular evidence may not be taken into account in considering the case against Mr Smit. 
     
      
    38 The change whereupon the jury were told that the evidence of the conversation between Mrs Smit and Mr Ranse was initially inadmissible only against her and then that they could consider it in the case against Ms Tarrant would only add emphasis to the circumstance that that evidence was quarantined against consideration in the case of Mr Smit. 
     
      
    39 There is ample authority for the proposition that, absent some indicative factor, a jury will not be presumed to have disregarded unambiguous directions. It is a common feature of joint trial that co-accused seek to implicate another or others but that does not, without more, render separate trials necessary in order to avoid miscarriage: Webb & Anor v The Queen 1993 181 CLR 41; R v Fernando & Anor [1999] NSWCCA 96; R v Skaf & Ors [2004] NSWCCA 74. 
     
      
    40 I would reject ground 1 in Mr Smit’s appeal. 
     
      
    41 It is convenient to turn to the similar ground (ground 1) advanced on behalf of Ms Tarrant. At the close of the Crown case application was made on behalf of Ms Tarrant for a directed verdict of not guilty or alternatively severance for separate trial. His Honour dealt with and refused both applications.  
     
      
    42 On behalf of Ms Tarrant submission is made referring to an asserted error of fact in his Honour’s judgment that Ms Tarrant had said that she spent the night at Mr and Mrs Smit’s residence whereas the evidence was that she said a Mr Jackson stayed there. The evidence was that in a conversation with a Ms Watts, Ms Tarrant responded to a question addressed to Mr Jackson who was in her company that he had stayed “at Steve’s place”. Mr Jackson gave evidence (disputed by the Crown) that he had spent the night with Ms Tarrant at the Smit’s house. This evidence in effect provided Ms Tarrant with an alibi which necessarily must have been rejected by the jury. In regard to the present issue the inaccuracy is of no consequence.  
     
      
    43 His Honour commented upon evidence which could demonstrate that Ms Tarrant told untruths to police. These appear on the video record of her interview. It is contended that his Honour should have ascertained whether the Crown intended to rely upon any such lies as manifesting consciousness of guilt. In due course it was ascertained that the Crown did not. 
     
      
    44 The learned trial judge accepted the statement of relevant principles in Middis (supra). In an obvious reference to the first stated matter he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not satisfied that the evidence against Ms Tarrant is significantly weaker than that against other accused, although I would accept the proposition that it is weaker”. 
        
       
      
    45 It was pointed out that his Honour had apparently overlooked earlier saying in an exchange with counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think you can take it that I agree with your proposition that the case against the other two accused is significantly stronger than the case against your client (Ms Tarrant) without taking me to it chapter and verse” (T718). 
        
       
      
    46 Whilst I have noted these complaints, I reiterate the nature of the task upon which this Court is engaged is to consider whether there has been miscarriage in requiring Ms Tarrant to stand joint trial with Mr and Mrs Smit rather than analysis of reasons given for refusal to separate before or in the course of trial. 
     
      
    47 The critical evidence inculpating Ms Tarrant was the identification of her palm prints on the back of the cricket bat which was an instrument capable of being used to inflict the fatal laryngeal injury and which bat was wrapped within the blankets which enveloped the naked body of the deceased. Importantly there was scientific evidence that the palm prints were in wet blood when left on the bat and were not deposited there before the blood. It was likely that the blood was on Ms Tarrant’s hand when she contacted the blood but it was possible that her hand deposited its print through wet blood which was on the bat. 
     
      
    48 This was powerful evidence of the presence of Ms Tarrant in the flat at the time of the killing. As abovementioned Ms Tarrant relied on evidence disputed by the Crown, that she was in the company of Mr Jackson during the Tuesday night and into midday Wednesday.  
     
      
    49 The essence of the appellant’s complaint is that the ERISP with Mr Smit, inadmissible against her, located her at the flat in dramatic circumstances in which, according to Mr Smit, she was the victim of an attempted rape. The submission was also sought to be supported by the change in making admissible the conversation between Mrs Smit and Mr Ranse contrary to his Honour’s initial direction that it was admissible against Mrs Smit only. The submission is that this would confuse the jury. I reject that proposition. I expect that it would be obvious to them that this evidence was being seized upon by Ms Tarrant because it was in her favour. Hearsay is not a concept exclusively understood by lawyers and a jury would be expected to readily understand, for example, that what Mr Smit told police was admissible only against him and what Ms Tarrant told police was only admissible against her. What they were being told was an exception (which again would be readily understandable) that evidence could be used if it was the accused himself or herself who sought to take advantage of something that had been said by another. 
     
      
    50 The risk in this case can be identified as undermining the alibi by using what Mr Smit said to conclude that Ms Tarrant was at the flat rather than with Mr Jackson. I see no reason to conclude that a jury should be taken to be unlikely to adhere to clear direction that what Mr Smit said could only be used when considering the case against him.  
     
      
    51 Part of Mr Smit’s account to police was that Ms Tarrant had been “stabbed” in the thigh by the deceased. If this happened she was necessarily present at the flat. A photograph showed what might be described as a small scratch on her thigh. Counsel for Mr Smit relied on the photograph as supporting his account, however the Crown Prosecutor argued that the incident was a fabrication. This provides a somewhat lesser conflict between jointly indicted accused than “a cutthroat defence”, but even in the latter case separate trial is not mandatory: see Webb & Anor v The Queen (supra). 
     
      
    52 It should be noted that there was other evidence capable of being weighed by the jury in determining whether Ms Tarrant was at the flat at the relevant time. They were entitled to attach considerable significance to the finding of her wallet at the flat which contained documents of the type usually carried on the person. 
     
      
    53 The Crown case was presented as one of joint enterprise and it is recognized that there were distinctly different prominent pieces of evidence pointing to the participation of each individual. Against Mr Smit was the interpretation of the blood spatter of the deceased on his vesture, against Mrs Smit was her confession to Mr Ranse and her handprint on a knife and against Ms Tarrant was her handprint on a likely murder weapon which had been deposited after the spilling of the deceased’s blood. I do not regard these differences as demonstrating that joint trial was unjust. It is true that in accordance with his Honour’s directions there were available for consideration bases of possible liability of offenders other than joint criminal enterprise but this does not, in my view, in these circumstances, detract from the desirability of trying alleged joint offenders jointly. 
     
      
    54 The Middis test requires demonstration of possible injustice in a joint trial. This has not been shown nor has it been shown that, because a joint trial has been conducted, Ms Tarrant suffered miscarriage as a result of standing her trial with those alleged co-offenders. I would reject this ground. 
     
      
    55 I turn next to other grounds presented on behalf of Mrs Smit. Ground 1 asserts that his Honour erred in directions to the jury as to how they were to assess evidence of Mr Ranse. Given his evidence of Mrs Smit’s confessional statements to him there was a considerable attack on his credibility at trial. The outcome of that attack was quintessentially to be determined by the jury. 
     
      
    56 I have already made reference to the rhetoric of the Crown Prosecutor in inviting the jury to consider in relation to Mr Ranse “Why would he lie”. In his charge to the jury his Honour sought to repair the damage which this impermissible oratory might have caused in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “During the course of her address to you, when dealing with the evidence of Mr Ranse, the Crown Prosecutor asked you rhetorically why would Mr Ranse lie? In discussions we have had in your absence, the Crown Prosecutor has conceded that she was in error in posing that question. The central issue here is not whether Mr Ranse had any motive to lie, but whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of each accused. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence called has been directed to that issue of guilt, not to the issue of whether or not Mr Ranse may have lied or had a motive to lie. Whether he had any such motive is not a topic on which there is any evidence or to which anyone has sought to adduce evidence, so it would be quite wrong for you to be diverted from the central issue has the Crown proved the case against each accused beyond reasonable doubt by speculation as to whether Mr Ranse had any reason to lie.” 
        
       
      
    57 Counsel sought further direction on this topic asserting that what had been said did not sufficiently “cure the problem”. His Honour directed counsel for Mrs Smit to formulate exactly what she submitted should be said to the jury by way of direction. This was done. The proposal was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I told you that it was impermissible for you to reason why would Ricky Ranse lie and I remind you of that. The reason is that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The accused does not have to prove anything. Placing upon Miss Smit an obligation to raise an explanation for why Ricky Ranse might be lying reverses the onus of proof. Just because there is no evidence of motive to lie or a plausible explanation for him lying does not mean he was not lying”. 
        
       
      
    58 The Crown Prosecutor expressly agreed with the proposed direction. Thereafter his Honour directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “I directed attention to the topic of the question of whether Mr Ranse had any motive to lie. May I just add this to what I said earlier: Just because there is no suggestion of a motive or, I would add, any evidence of one, does not mean there wasn’t one. Just because there is no suggestion or evidence of a motive, does not mean there wasn’t one. There is, of course, no obligation on an accused person to suggest any motive”. 
        
       
      
    59 His Honour had, of course, when dealing with the matter as set out in the first extract above quoted reminded the jury that it was the central issue of the trial that the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of each accused. Nevertheless, in not literally adopting the draft direction which had been requested and had the support of both counsel, he omitted to caution the jury against the risk of reversal of that onus of proof. The risk of that reversal is a prominent reason for the condemnation of a prosecutor asking a jury a rhetorical question of the nature under examination: see Palmer supra and also R v E 1996 39 NSWLR 450. 
     
      
    60 It was argued that this omission was compounded in its potential adverse effect on Mrs Smit’s case by his Honour’s later expression when summarizing the Crown and defence cases that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In its terms, Mr Ranse’s account of the conversation with Mrs Smit is strong, if not compelling evidence, of Mrs Smit’s participation in Mr Collins’ death”. 
        
       
      
    61 The contention was that the qualification (or description) conveyed by the first three words of that passage might be missed by the jury. I see no reason so to assume. This ground is made out to the extent that an adequate “cure” of what the Crown Prosecutor had said should have included caution against reversing the onus of proof. 
     
      
    62 Ground 3 on behalf of Mrs Smit asserted that his Honour misdirected the jury as to the evidence of the deceased’s “blood” being found on the knife. When it was pointed out by counsel for the Crown that there was specific evidence supporting his Honour’s observation about “Mrs Smit’s palm print on the knife with Mr Collins’ blood on the blade” which had apparently been overlooked, this ground was not pressed. 
     
      
    63 Neither was ground 4 which asserted that his Honour erred in not leaving a possible verdict of being an accessory after the fact to the jury.  
     
      
    64 It is clear that that ground is unsustainable. The situation is as follows. Upon an indictment for murder the jury may acquit, find the accused not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, or convict him of murder, manslaughter or, in the appropriate case, dangerous driving occasioning death. An accused may also be found guilty of an attempt to commit murder or of an assault with intent to commit murder. There are also occasions when on the trial of a person for the murder of a child a jury may convict of concealment of birth or a woman of infanticide.  
     
      
    65 In the absence of a count being specified in the indictment or statutory authority (for example s 340 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code: see Apted v The Queen 1981 5 A Crim R 141) a finding that an accused was an accessory after the fact is not an available verdict on an indictment charging murder solely. 
     
      
    66 Ground 6 asserted “a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury that they could not convict the appellant unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she had confessed her guilt to Ricky Ranse”. 
     
      
    67 Underlying this ground is the assumption that proof of the confessional statement by Mrs Smit to Mr Ranse was an essential intermediate step in proof by the Crown of a circumstantial case: Shepherd v The Queen 1990 170 CLR 573.  
     
      
    68 No direction such as is now proposed was sought at trial. The Crown contended that it was open to the jury to convict Mrs Smit if satisfied of her presence at the flat during the killing, her palm print on the knife, her distressed condition on the Wednesday morning and her seeking out Mr Ranse for assistance (as distinct from confessing involvement to him). The Crown submitted that the jury would be well able to conclude that Mrs Smit “actively participated in causing injury to the deceased or actively gave assistance or encouragement when this occurred”. The latter imports the problem of omission to be aware of the intention of the principal discussed in relation to ground 5 (ground 2 in the cases of the other appellants). 
     
      
    69 In recapitulating submission by counsel on behalf of Mrs Smit at trial his Honour clearly delineated the issue being raised. He said that the submission was: 
     
      
       
        
        “…… if you put aside Mr Ranse, the other evidence in the case including the fingerprint on the knife did not indicate her client was involved in the killing. Indeed, apart from those two matters that is the fingerprint and Mr Ranse’s evidence, there was no evidence Mrs Smit was there at the time of the killing and the print on the knife could have been put there before or after”. 
        
       
      
    70 It can be mentioned that counsel for Ms Tarrant asked for a direction of the kind now contended in relation to his client’s palm print on the cricket bat and, in response to that request, an appropriate direction was given. Counsel for Mrs Smit did not, as I have said, seek such a direction nor was any direction sought concerning Ms Smit’s palm print on the knife.  
     
      
    71 I would not uphold the appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    72 The final ground advanced on behalf of Mrs Smit was ground 2 contending that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
    73 The principal thrust of the argument in support of this ground was directed to asserting that the conviction was wholly reliant upon the acceptance by the jury of the confession by Mrs Smit to Mr Ranse. The Crown does not accept that this is so and argues to the contrary, but, assuming for present purposes only, that the appellant’s submission is correct in that regard, I see no reason for interference with what I have earlier described as a quintessential jury question. The jury saw Mr Ranse, heard the vigorous attacks upon his credit and reliability and were in an advantageous position to determine whether to rely upon his testimony. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    74 Next I turn to the remaining grounds advanced on behalf of Ms Tarrant. Ground 3 asserted that the trial judge erred in directions to the jury regarding evidence that the appellant had attempted to establish a false alibi. 
     
      
    75 Ricky Ranse testified that he was interviewed twice by police, on 30 August and 12 September 2001 respectively. Between those dates Ms Tarrant approached him and asked him to say that she had been at his home for a couple of weeks.  
     
      
    76 In a summation of what he apprehended to be the Crown case against Ms Tarrant his Honour referred to a number of matters and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “…… next, evidence that Ms Tarrant had left Mr Collins’ unit in a disorganized or hasty manner witnessed by her leaving behind her birth certificate, wallet, Medicare and Bankcards; evidence of her fingerprint and blood on the bat indicating she was in the premises with Mr Collins’ blood still wet; evidence from Mr Ranse that she sought to set up with him a false story of staying at his place”. 
        
       
      
    77 That was an accurate précis of the stance taken by the Crown Prosecutor which included in address: 
     
      
       
        
        “You might recall Ricky Ranse’s evidence that she approached him on the Wednesday asking him if he would say that she had been living with him rather than at Camp Street. Why would she ask him that, members of the jury? Is it that she is trying to distance herself from this scene”. (T782) 
        
       
      
    78 No direction was given to the jury as to how they might make use of the circumstance that Ms Tarrant attempted to set up a false alibi, if they so found. It was submitted by the Crown in the appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear the Crown Prosecutor did not refer to ‘consciousness of guilt’ in terms. The matter was relied upon by the Crown as a matter going to her credibility and that the jury would not believe her statement given to the police that at the time of the offence she lived with Mr Ranse”. 
        
       
      
    79 It was attempted to consolidate this with express direction that, insofar as the jury found an accused to have lied, it was relied upon by the Crown only on the issue of credibility (of Mr Smit or Ms Tarrant, Mrs Smit having made no statement to police nor given evidence and such statements as she was evidenced to have made being used to inculpate her). 
     
      
    80 Of course if a false alibi has been set up then reliance on it inevitably involves lying: cf R v Harrol 1996 2 Cr App R 457. That was not this situation. Ms Tarrant was alleged to be asking Mr Ranse to lie for her. He knew what the truth was, he was not deceived by her and she was not lying to him.  
     
      
    81 The question therefore is what use could the jury make of a finding that Ms Tarrant sought the help of Mr Ranse to set up a false alibi. The answer must be that she therefore manifested a consciousness of guilt, whether or not that particular expression was engaged. The fact that that expression was not used is not to the point. The expressions used by both his Honour and the Crown Prosecutor inevitably convey an invitation to use the evidence in that way. It was incumbent upon his Honour to give a full direction as to how the jury could use this evidence to inculpate Ms Tarrant along the lines analogous to that which is required when a prosecution relies upon the telling of lies as evidencing such a consciousness: Edwards v The Queen 1993 178 CLR 193. 
     
      
    82 This ground is made out. 
     
      
    83 Ground 4 on behalf of Ms Tarrant was identical to that advanced by Ms Smit (failure to leave an alternative verdict of being an accessory after the fact to murder) and was not pressed. 
     
      
    84 The final ground on her behalf asserted that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
    85 It was apparent that the real strength of the Crown case were the palm prints on the cricket bat and the circumstance that there was expert evidence that they were deposited in wet blood of the victim. There was also evidence (discussed in relation to ground 3) that could lead to a conclusion that the appellant manifested a consciousness of guilt by her attempt to have another assist her in setting up a false alibi. The deficiency was that the jury were not told how they might use that evidence but in considering the present ground, the existence of the evidence should not be ignored.  
     
      
    86 A reasonable jury, properly directed, had ample material upon which to conclude guilt. I do not conclude that the verdict cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
    87 The ultimate issue is whether in the light of the success of all appellants, on at least ground 2 (Mr Smit and Ms Tarrant) or ground 5 (Mrs Smit) the conviction should be allowed to stand in accordance with the power vested by the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    88 Whilst I accept the Crown submission that on this issue separate consideration needs to be given to the cases of each appellant, it is of importance in my view that the Crown case did not (no doubt because only the participants could provide certainty) establish the precise role of each in the killing. Whilst it was said that the case against Steven Smit was stronger, it is important not to allow that assessment to be too readily made because the version which he gave to the police of sleeping through the commission of the murder by others who inflicted some one hundred injuries, might be thought absurd, rather than relying upon the positive case against him. 
     
      
    89 As earlier stated there are different powerful incriminating features in the cases against the individual accused, prominent being the interpretation of the blood spatter and the respective palm prints. There is, of course, other evidence relied upon by the Crown in the individual cases.  
     
      
    90 Because of the imprecision about the role of each accused (allowing for this purpose that the evidence sustains a finding of the involvement of them all) I do not perceive that it can be said that, had there been no blemish at the trial, an appropriately instructed jury acting reasonably on the evidence before it, and applying the correct onus and standard of proof would have, in each case, inevitably convicted the appellant of murder: see Wilde v The Queen 1998 164 CLR 365. These are not cases in which the proviso can appropriately be applied. 
     
      
    91 In each appeal therefore I propose that the appeal be allowed, the conviction and sentence quashed, and a new trial ordered.92 JAMES J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    93 HOEBEN J: I agree with Grove J and the orders proposed.

       Offences and conviction appeal 
        
       The appellant and John Taufahema on 20 August 2003 were each indicted before his Honour Justice Wood, Chief Judge at Common Law, and a jury in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on the following counts. 
        
        
       Count 1 
        – That he on 27 March 2002 at Hillsdale in the State of NSW did murder Glen McEnallay. 
        
       (Sections 18 and 19A  
       Crimes Act 
        1900 – maximum penalty imprisonment for life). 
       Count 2 (in the alternative to Count 1) that he on 27 March 2002 at Hillsdale in the State of NSW did, while in company use an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension.(S33B(2) Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 15 years.) 
       
      
    4 Each was indicted in relation to other counts to which pleas of guilty were entered in the course of the trial. These other counts are irrelevant to the conviction appeal and will be referred to in the sentence appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    5 It was always the Crown case that Sione Penisini was the person who fired the shots which killed Constable McEnallay. On 21 March 2003 he pleaded guilty to the murder of Constable McEnallay. 
     
      
       
      
    6 The Crown sought to establish the murder count against John Taufahema and the appellant upon two bases. The first was that the two accused had acted in a joint enterprise with Sione Penisini that, if faced with the possibility of being arrested, one of them would use a firearm with intent to prevent their arrest, and that the possibility was in the contemplation of the accused that in so using the firearm, the user would do so in such a way as to result in the death of or grievous bodily harm to the person attempting to arrest them. 
     
      
       
      
    7 The second basis relied upon by the Crown was felony/murder. This required that both the accused were present and encouraging and assisting Penisini to use his pistol, in company, for the purpose of deliberately shooting at Constable McEnallay with the intention of preventing their lawful arrest. 
     
      
       
      
    8 In relation to the alternative count under s33B(2), the Crown also relied upon two bases for making out its case. Firstly, that each accused was a party to a joint enterprise that if faced with the possibility of arrest, one of the persons in his company would use a pistol for the purpose, and with the intention, of preventing their lawful arrest, although not necessarily contemplating that it would be used in a way that would kill or cause serious bodily injury to another. Secondly, that each accused intentionally encouraged or assisted Penisini to use the weapon, knowing that he would do so with the intent of preventing their lawful arrest, although not necessarily expecting or contemplating that the result would be death or serious bodily injury of another. 
     
      
       
      
    9 Following a trial before Wood CJ at CL and a jury, John Taufahema was convicted of murder and the appellant was convicted under Count 2. The appellant appeals against his conviction under Count 2 on the basis that there was no evidence to distinguish any different factor which would play upon either himself or John Taufahema at the time that Penisini shot Constable McEnallay and that therefore there was an inconsistency between the appellant being convicted of the alternative count while being acquitted of Count 1 so that conviction under Count 2 cannot stand. 
     
      
       
        
       Factual background 
        
       
      
    10 At trial there was little dispute as to the facts. Significant admissions were made by both offenders in the course of the trial. The following facts would seem to be uncontroversial. 
     
      
       
      
    11 On 27 March 2002 Senior Constable McEnallay was driving an unmarked police patrol car in Bunnerong Road, Matraville. Near the intersection with Military Road he observed a green Holden Commodore sedan, registration No AJK 32M. The possible presence of this vehicle in the area had previously been reported to him by an off-duty police officer, Constable Deitrich, who had seen it at about 5.30 pm travelling at speed and somewhat erratically, in Botany Road, Matraville. 
     
      
       
      
    12 Senior Constable McEnallay asked for a vehicle check to be made and was advised that it had been reported as stolen. He followed the green Commodore in Botany Road and then right into Beauchamp Street. The two vehicles stopped at the lights controlling the intersection of Beauchamp Street and Denison Road. In the meantime he had asked for assistance from other vehicles, and had also requested the driver of a caged police vehicle, which was in the area, to drop back as he did not want the occupants of the green Commodore to be aware that they were being followed. 
     
      
       
      
    13 In Denison Street, at about 5:51:50 Senior Constable McEnallay activated his siren and lights announcing his pursuit of the green Commodore, which made a right hand turn at speed into Grace Campbell Crescent. On attempting this turn the vehicle struck the gutter, or a traffic island, and came to a stop at about 5:52:10, as a result of damage occasioned to a wheel, which effectively immobilised it.  
     
      
       
      
    14 At this stage Penisini, who was armed with a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver, exited the green Commodore and immediately fired five shots, in quick succession at the driver side window of the police vehicle which had come to a stop about 10 metres away. Senior Constable McEnallay, who had been unable in the time available to draw his own weapon, or to seek a position of safety, suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and head which led to his death, seven days later on 3 April 2002. 
     
      
       
      
    15 Penisini, along with the other occupants of the green Commodore, who included the appellant and John Taufahema, ran from the vehicle in an easterly direction, through some units in Neilson Avenue and Grace Campbell Crescent. On their way, Penisini dropped his revolver and a pouch containing a number of .45 calibre and .38 calibre cartridges, on the footpath outside 9 Grace Campbell Crescent. The appellant was seen to drop his weapon, a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver, in the garden of 12 Grace Campbell Crescent on his way to a residence at 5 Rhodes Street, where he managed to hide from the police, in a laundry, for several hours, before eventually making his way home. Before doing so, he exchanged his clothes for clothing which he found in the laundry. He was not arrested until 3 April. 
     
      
       
      
    16 John Taufahema and Penisini also made their way towards Rhodes Street. They were pursued on foot by Senior Constable Day and Constable Kolosque. While moving through the small area of park, which runs between the premises at 7 and 9 Grace Campbell Crescent respectively, and up a hill to Rhodes Street, John Taufahema presented his hand gun, a .38 Smith and Wesson five round revolver at Constables Day and Kolosque and threatened to shoot them if they did not back off. 
     
      
       
      
    17 Both officers maintained their pursuit. They had drawn their own service weapons and repeatedly warned Penisini and Taufahema to stop and to drop the revolver which Taufahema was holding. 
     
      
       
      
    18 When they reached Rhodes Street, Penisini and John Taufahema made their way north, still pursued by Constables Day and Kolosque. A motor vehicle driven by Lamia Kassis was observed to be slowing for a speed bump. John Taufahema made his way to the driver’s side of this vehicle and pointing his weapon at Ms Kassis instructed her to get out of the vehicle. She complied with his request. In the meantime, Penisini attempted to force his way into the front passenger seat.  
     
      
       
      
    19 At this point Constables Day and Kolosque caught up with the men and began to struggle with them. Senior Constable Day attempted to subdue Penisini and eventually did so, after hitting him over the head with his service pistol and spraying him with capsicum spray. Constable Kolosque fought with John Taufahema who was still holding his handgun and pointing it at the two officers. They struggled over the ignition key and at one stage Taufahema managed to get the vehicle into motion but it moved backwards striking a vehicle behind it. 
     
      
       
      
    20 Eventually John Taufahema was overpowered by Constable Kolosque with the assistance of Senior Constable Day who had come to his aid, although not before being struck on the head several times with the butt of a service weapon, and also being sprayed with capsicum spray. 
     
      
       
      
    21 In the meantime Penisini, who had been sitting for a while on a fence, no doubt still affected by the spray, had moved away from the vehicle into the park to the east of Rhodes Street. He was pursued by Senior Constable Day and with the assistance of Constable Rowbottom, who had also come to the scene, was arrested in that park. The revolver of John Taufahema was recovered from the vicinity of Ms Kassis’ vehicle. 
     
      
       
      
    22 For completeness it should be noted that the other occupant of the green Commodore was one Motekiaa Taufahema. He was apparently the driver of the vehicle. He also ran away from it when it became disabled. He was arrested in the rear yard of premises at 31 Rhodes Street moments after the arrest of John Taufahema and a .357 Magnum six-chamber revolver, which he was seen to drop in the garden of 33 Rhodes Street, was recovered in that location. There is otherwise no need to make further mention of Motekiaa Taufahema. 
     
      
       
      
    23 A search of the green Commodore revealed that it contained gloves, hats and an ice-hockey mask, items capable of being used as disguises. The weapons of the appellant and John Taufahema were fully loaded but had not been fired during the relevant events.  
     
      
       
      
    24 The other relevant evidence was that of Sese Tuiniua, who was a friend of the appellant. He was interviewed by Constable Martin on 22 May 2002 and an ERISP of that interview was obtained. An edited version of this ERISP was marked for identification 4 at the trial and a transcript of that edited ERISP was tendered in the appellant’s case. The transcript referred to a conversation between the appellant and Mr Tuiniua which took place late on the evening of 27 March 2002. 
     
      
       
      
    25 Included in the transcript was the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “A. Yep, yep, I go to Meli, what are you doin’? What are you doin’, mate. He goes, nothin’ man, nothin’. Like, like he sounded like shattered, you know, like he sounded like upset for some reason. … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Like he had, like he was almost crying you know, he was, he was just about to cry, yeah, like that upset, yeah. … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I asked him, I asked Meli, what’s wrong? And he said goes, and he said, and he said that, he, one of the boys just shot a copper. And, I said to him, who, who? And he goes, fuckin’ Penisini shot, shot, shot a fuckin’ copper. And I go, what happened, what happened? And he said that they, he said, well they copped a chase, they ended up losing it. He got out and, and they all started bolting and Penisini turned around and fired shots at the copper. And Meli looked around and seen Penisini shooting at the, at the coppers and the copper, I think. Yeah, and then I asked him if he was all right. He said, he didn’t say much, he said, yeah, yeah. And then after that I go, I asked him if he wanted to come up and get drugs from Redfern to, you know, to ease him. And he goes, no, and he, he just walked off upset.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       Ground of Appeal 1  
        
       
      
    26 The appellant relies upon the following ground of appeal in relation to his conviction. 
     
      
       
        
       (1) The verdict was inconsistent with that delivered against his co-accused John Taufahema and was in the circumstances: 
        
        
       (a) Unreasonable and/or 
        
        
       (b) Cannot be supported having regard to the evidence and/or 
        
        
       (c) In the circumstances is a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
      
    27 The appellant relies essentially upon the statement of principle in Mackenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367/8: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ““Juries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a Judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdict which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a Judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by jury. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         We agree with these practical and sensible remarks. 
         
        
        
         
         Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity of the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. “It all depends upon the facts of the case.” 
         
        
        
         
         The obligation to establish inconsistency of verdicts rests upon the person making the submission. But if, because of inconsistency between verdicts, the appellate court is persuaded that a verdict cannot stand, it must make consequential orders. In the case of a criminal trial, where the verdict has been followed by conviction and sentence, these must be set aside. Where the inconsistency is found between verdicts of acquittal and a verdict of guilty, the appellate court (state apart) may not disturb the acquittal. It may be appropriate to enter a verdict of acquittal on the subject count(s) on the footing that this merely carries forward the logic of the other acquittal verdict(s). But once again, the relief which is appropriate depends upon the facts of a particular case.” 
         
        
       
      
    28 I do not understand the Crown to take issue with that statement of principle. The position of the Crown is that there is no inconsistency. 
     
      
       
      
    29 Factually the argument put on behalf of the appellant is simple. There was no direct evidence as to what agreement or understanding had been arrived at between the persons in the car at the point in time when Penisini fired his revolver at Constable McEnallay. There was no direct evidence as to any conversation between the occupants of the green Commodore prior to the shooting. If a jury was to reach a conclusion as to the state of mind of any of the occupants, it had do so by way of inference. 
     
      
       
      
    30 The appellant submits that there was nothing in his conduct or that of John Taufahema up to the point in time when Penisini fired his revolver at Constable McEnallay which would enable an inference to be drawn by the jury as to any difference in mental state between the appellant and John Taufahema. This would seem to be so. Were there no further evidence it would be difficult as a matter of logic to understand how the jury could distinguish between the respective mental states of the appellant and John Taufahema when the shooting took place. 
     
      
       
      
    31 The evidence, however, was not left in that state. There was evidence which related to the conduct of John Taufahema after the shooting from which it was open to the jury to draw an inference as to his mental state at the time when the shooting took place. That evidence can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       (1) John Taufahema retained his revolver when he fled from the green Commodore whereas the appellant discarded his. 
        
        
       (2) John Taufahema pointed his revolver which he still had with him at the pursuing police officers and threatened to shoot them if they did not back off. 
        
        
       (3) At a later stage in the chase John Taufahema again pointed his revolver in the direction of Ms Kassis. 
        
        
       (4) There was the violent struggle in the vehicle of Ms Kassis which resulted in John Taufahema being disarmed. 
        
        
       This evidence was only admitted against John Taufahema. 
        
       
      
    32 It was also open to the jury to have regard to the evidence of Mr Tuiniua. If accepted, that evidence indicated a significant level of upset on the part of the appellant on the night of the shooting. That evidence could allow the inference that the shooting was unexpected and unwanted by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    33 The appellant’s response is that “It may well be that the jury was unduly influenced by the material relating to what happened involving Penisini and John Taufahema after the shooting of Constable McEnallay.” That does not solve the appellant’s difficulty. 
     
      
       
      
    34 If it was properly open to the jury to infer from the subsequent conduct of John Taufahema that at the time of the shooting his mental state was that if faced with the possibility of being arrested, one of the persons in the vehicle would use a firearm with intent to prevent that arrest and that he had in contemplation the possibility that in so using the firearm the shooter would do so in such a way as to result in the death of or grievous bodily harm to the person attempting to arrest them, it cannot be said that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind to the facts of the case could have arrived at different verdicts as between the appellant and John Taufahema. 
     
      
       
      
    35 It seems to me that it was open to the jury to draw such a inference from the subsequent conduct of John Taufahema. Such an inference was capable of being strengthened by the transcript of the ERISP of Mr Tuiniua. These matters provide a significant difference in the material upon which the jury could find that John Taufahema had the requisite intention to render him liable to conviction for murder whereas the appellant did not. 
     
      
       
      
    36 If that be correct, the only question remaining (which does not seem to have been agitated on behalf of the appellant) is whether, it being open to the jury to distinguish between the intent of John Taufahema and that of the appellant, there remained sufficient evidence from which an inference in the form required for Count 2 could be drawn by the jury against the appellant. There clearly was. The fact that all of the offenders, including the appellant, exited the vehicle carrying weapons when it was clear that they were being pursued by the police was evidence consistent with and capable of supporting a finding by the jury that there was in contemplation by the appellant that one of their group might use a pistol in some way to avoid arrest. It is clear from the jury’s verdict that they were not satisfied that the appellant’s intention went so far as to contemplate that a pistol would be used to shoot the officer or that grievous bodily harm or death was contemplated by the appellant as a possible outcome. 
     
      
       
      
    37 The appellant’s submission that the verdict against him on Count 2 represented a compromise verdict is not made out. His Honour gave an express direction to the jury that they must not approach the alternative count by way of a compromise (summing up 64.6). The fact that the jury asked for a further explanation of the meaning of “joint enterprise” made it clear that they were paying careful attention to that issue (summing up 69.2). The fact that the tape recording of the ERISP of Mr Tuiniua was requested by the jury, would seem to indicate that they had in contemplation the importance of any difference in intent between the appellant and John Taufahema (summing up 77). 
     
      
       
      
    38 Ground of appeal one challenging the conviction of the appellant is not made out. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground of Appeal 2 – Appeal against sentence 
        
       
      
    39 The appellant’s second ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
       (2) Additionally or alternatively, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the learned trial judge in that each of the sentences imposed by him was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    40 His Honour imposed on 2 October 2003 the following sentences on the appellant and John Taufahema.

        Non-parole period fixed. 
        
        Sentence concurrent. 
        
        Plea of guilty. 
        
       
      
    41 The appellant challenges the sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years in relation to the s33B(2) offence on the basis that it offends the principle of parity when compared with the fixed sentence of 7 years imposed on John Taufahema. 
     
      
       
      
    42 It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was a higher level of culpability in the offence of John Taufahema in that he “used” the pistol when he menaced the police officers and Ms Kassis, whereas it was never suggested that there was actual use of a pistol by the appellant. This submission highlights a threshold difficulty for the appellant in relying upon the principle of parity. Although the offences were identical, the circumstances were quite different in each case.  
     
      
       
      
    43 This is tantamount to inviting this Court to compare apples with oranges. This Court is being asked to compare different offending conduct which occurred in different circumstances at different times. The appellant’s offence related to the primary incident when the appellant was in company with three other offenders, all of who were armed with loaded pistols. John Taufahema’s offence occurred in quite different circumstances when he was in company with Penisini who by that time had discarded his weapon. This significant difference in circumstances makes reliance upon the principle of parity at best problematic. 
     
      
       
      
    44 Assuming that the two offences are capable of comparison, a significant consideration is that Taufahema pleaded guilty to his offence, whereas the appellant was only convicted after a trial. The fact that the Crown had a strong case in relation to the s33B(2) offence against Taufahema for which he was convicted (ie that involving the incident after the shooting of Constable McEnallay) is irrelevant to the utility of the plea of guilty and goes rather to the issue of contrition or remorse (R v Thompson & Houlton (2000) 40 NSWLR 383 at [136] and [137]. 
     
      
       
      
    45 Of perhaps most significance is the context in which the sentences were imposed. John Taufahema was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 7 years without a non-parole period because that sentence was wholly subsumed in the sentence which he received for the murder conviction (21 years with a non-parole period of 14 years). In that context it is somewhat artificial to submit that there was a thirty percent difference between the two sentences. Not only were the circumstances of the two offences different but the sentence imposed on John Taufahema has to be looked at as part of a total scheme of sentencing imposed by the trial judge. As against John Taufahema, four offences were involved, and the sentences involved accumulation and concurrency. There were issues of totality reflected in the scheme of sentences which applied to him which were absent in the case of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    46 The principle to be applied remains that stated in Postiglione v The Queen (1996) 189 CLR 295 at 301: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated.” 
         
        
        
       And at p 313: 
        
        
         
         “I do not understand the principles stated by the High Court in  
         Lowe v The Queen 
          to require a reduction in a sentence when the disparity between it and a sentence imposed upon a co-offender is justified by significant differences in their antecedents. As I understand the principle it applies when, although the higher sentence cannot on its face be said to be erroneous or excessive, there is no identifiable factor in the sentencing process which objectively assessed supports the different approach. If there are factors which support different treatment then, to use expressions in the authorities, there can be no justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender who receives the heavier sentence, no appearance of unfairness to the community.” (McHugh J quoting with approval from the judgment of Doyle CJ in  
         R v Cox 
          (1996) 66 SASR 152 at 159. 
         
        
       
      
    47 The offences occurred in quite different circumstances and the sentencing scheme in relation to Taufahema and the appellant was different. The principle of parity has not been offended. No sentencing error has been disclosed.  
     
      
       
      
    48 Ground of Appeal 2 challenging the severity of the appellant’s sentence in relation to the s33B(2) offence is not made out. 
     
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
    49 The orders which I propose are that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. In relation to the application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence, leave should be granted but the appeal dismissed.

      Offences and sentences 
       
      
    4 On 2 June 2004 the respondent entered a plea of guilty to the following offences: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
      : Ongoing supply of a prohibited drug methylamphetamine (d.o.o. between 24 March 2002 – 25 April 2002) contrary to subs 25A(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985. 
       
      The maximum penalty is $385,000 fine or imprisonment for 20 years or both. 
       
       
      Count 2: 
       Supply a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine (d.o.o. between 25 April 2002 and 20 August 2002) contrary to ss 25(1), 32(1)(g) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985. 
       
      The maximum penalty is $220,000 fine or imprisonment for 15 years or both. 
       
       
      Count 3: 
       Supply a prohibited drug, cannabis (d.o.o. between 14 February 2002 and 20 August 2002) contrary to ss 25(1), 32(1)(h) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985. 
       
      The maximum penalty is $220,000 fine or imprisonment for 10 years or both. 
       
      
    5 The respondent came before Phegan DCJ on 27 August 2004 to be sentenced for those offences. In respect of Counts 1 and 2 his Honour imposed concurrent terms of 3 years with a 1 year 8 month non-parole period to be served by way of periodic detention. In relation to Count 3 his Honour imposed an 18 month sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. The commencement date for each sentence was 3 September 2004. 
     
      
    6 The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against those sentences. The Director signed the Notice of Appeal on 17 September 2004. Notice was served on the respondent at his home address on 23 September 2004, within four weeks of sentencing. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    7 Strike force “Tolve” was established to target the supply of prohibited drugs in the Ashfield and Campsie local area commands. A well-organised drug dealing business was operated out of premises in Arthur Street, Ashfield. Customers telephoned mobile telephone numbers to place their orders for prohibited drugs, usually using code words and small quantities of prohibited drugs at a time were dispatched by “runners” in vehicles, often meeting the customers in public places such as car-parks. The offenders were criminally liable, both for individual transactions and because they took part in a joint criminal enterprise. Police obtained telephone intercept warrants and monitored the telephone numbers associated with the persons at the premises. On average there were 75-200 calls per day. 
     
      
    8 The respondent was a member of the syndicate running the business, albeit not a leading member. He was sentenced with other members of the syndicate – John Kairouz, Anthony Kairouz, Charbel Kairouz and Saad Nasr, all of whom played a more prominent part in the syndicate. 
     
      
    9 His Honour made the following findings of facts based on the agreed facts relevant to the respondent and the co-offenders with whom he was sentenced. 
     
      
       
      (a) There was a syndicate involved in the supply of drugs (methylamphetamine and cannabis) in the Ashfield and Campsie area from at least February 2002. 
       
       
      (b) Each offender was a member of that syndicate and was to that extent involved in a joint criminal enterprise to supply such drugs. 
       
       
      (c) Three mobile telephones were used by the syndicate for the purposes of supplying the drugs, false names and addresses having been recorded in respect of those telephones. 
       
       
      (d) Each telephone received a substantial number of calls almost on a daily basis. 
       
       
      (e) Based on thirty three controlled purchases by undercover police and intercepted telephone calls: 
       
       
        
        (i) Methylamphetamine tablets with an average weight of about .3 grams were sold for between $30-$50 per tablet; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Methylamphetamine powder was sold in small bags weighing approximately .51 grams each; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Cannabis was supplied in bags which would either be $20 or $50 deals; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Generally a code was used when discussing drugs, although at times there were slips and common names were used. 
        
       
       
      (f) This was a case of a systematic enterprise for the purpose of profit; 
       
       
      (g) The scale of the operation and the nature of the means used were sufficient to put it on a level of serious and systematic sale of the drugs concerned. 
       
      
    10 Insofar as the respondent was concerned, the agreed fact showed: 
     
      
       
      (a) He at times participated in the actual supply to undercover police officers. 
       
       
      (b) He supplied methylamphetamine on four occasions to undercover officers between 28 April 2002 and 3 May 2002 (ie during the period referred to in  
      Count 
       2) and 
       
       
      (c) He was involved on “almost a daily basis” in the supply of methylamphetamine and cannabis from 15 April 2002 to 25 April 2002. 
       
      
    11 In relation to June 2002, the agreed facts stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 3 June David Nasr was in a vehicle with David Culbert and Stephanie Kipic when a meeting took place with an undercover officer who had made contact to purchase methylamphetamine. At that meeting David Nasr questioned the officer as to how she got the telephone number and, on being satisfied that she was a genuine buyer, he took part in making the arrangements for that supply which took place shortly after the meeting. On 25 June 2002 David Nasr was with Charbel Kairouz when they were stopped by police after visiting “555” tobacconist. On searching their vehicle police located approximately 600 plastic bags to be used in drug supply. Further telephone intercepts throughout the period to August provide evidence of David Nasr discussing matters involving the supply of drugs with other members of the syndicate and his being in the granny flat (at Arthur Street, Ashfield) at various times during the period. The evidence establishes that David Nasr was aware of all facets of the operation.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour found that although the respondent was aware of all facets of the operation, in contrast with the other four offenders with whom he was sentenced, he did not have the opportunity or capacity to exert any control over the operation (ROS 34). 
     
      
       
      Subjective features 
       
      
    13 The respondent was born on 26 October 1978. He was twenty-three at the time of the offences and is now twenty-six. He was the oldest in a family of five children. He had a criminal history albeit one containing relatively minor matters. He had never been to gaol before.  
     
      
    14 At the time of these offences he was subject to a community service order for 150 hours and was also subject to a s9 good behaviour bond for 18 months. Both those orders were imposed by the Bankstown Local Court on 14 February 2002. 
     
      
    15 The respondent completed his schooling with the attainment of the higher school certificate and the completion of an electrical trade course at TAFE. He worked on a part time basis during the latter part of his school years and in electrical trades for 2 years after leaving. His father established a service station business at St Marys in about 1997 and the respondent commenced to work there.  
     
      
    16 On New Years Eve in 1998 the respondent was the victim of a “drive by shooting” at the family home. He had arrived home at about 1.15 am and was walking to his bedroom when unidentified gunmen fired some 23 rounds at the house. There were apparently bullet holes everywhere. Tests administered by a psychologist several months later revealed that the respondent was suffering from a severe form of post traumatic-stress disorder with an accompanying severe anxiety disturbance. 
     
      
    17 His Honour accepted the evidence of the respondent’s younger brother, Mr George Nasr, as to the effect of the shooting. George Nasr said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfortunately David was just about to go to sleep when the incident occurred so he was the only one awake during the shooting and at that point of time him being the eldest in the family it affected his responsibility over the family and his feeling, protecting over the family, pretty much put him down in a pretty strong manner and he spent so much time at home after that, his character began to change in not being so close with the family and yeah, there was some signs of changes.” 
        
       
      
    18 The respondent commenced using cannabis the following year “to calm his nerves”. This escalated to the point of heavy daily use. Amphetamine and Ecstasy use soon followed. Dr Christopher Lennings, a psychologist who provided a report in relation to the respondent, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems the deterioration in his behaviour at home is in part a function of his amphetamine use and disturbance of behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    19 In June 2000 the respondent’s family experienced financial difficulties. His father was forced to sell the service station business. The respondent initially found work at another service station but then accepted unemployment benefits while searching for other work. Mr George Nasr said of this period: 
     
      
       
        
        “Months after that unfortunately he wasn’t able to find work. After my father selling the business we were in quite a bit of debt from the business. He – unfortunately due to his age and his illnesses wasn’t able to find work so we were running on a pretty tight budget. David, his presence at home wasn’t like normal. He would disappear for long periods, come home. There were signs of him taking some sort of substances, coming home, not being able to talk with the parents, with ourselves, try to discuss the situation, very argumentative and some significant character changes, yeah.” 
        
       
      
    20 The respondent was arrested on 20 August 2002. By that time according to George Nasr he had become a stranger to the family. When the family first visited him in gaol he was silent, would not look his parents in the eyes and appeared to be ashamed. However he “slowly started to recognise his faults and started to speak with his parents trying to acknowledge their forgiveness. He did change over those few months in gaol and him being the eldest in the family it really took effect on him.” 
     
      
    21 The respondent was released on bail after four months (130 days) in custody. It would appear that his experience in gaol had a significant and positive impact upon him. He soon found work. At one stage he had a day job as well as a night job. He was successful in applying for a position as a permanent dockhand with TNT Australia on 12 July 2004. 
     
      
    22 Since his release on bail at the end of December 2002 the respondent adopted a completely different lifestyle to the one he had been living over the past few years. George Nasr said that the respondent spent most of his time either at work or at a gym but otherwise at home with the family. The respondent’s relationship with his family had improved and George Nasr did not see any sign of substance abuse. 
     
      
    23 Dr Lennings was of the opinion that the respondent was genuinely remorseful for his offending conduct and that his rehabilitation was proceeding extremely well with strong prospects of ultimate success. He expressed a concern that should the respondent receive a custodial sentence, the rehabilitation process might be significantly jeopardised in that the respondent might lose his motivation and he would, of necessity, be placed in a situation where he would resume contact with anti-social peers. 
     
      
    24 The prospects of rehabilitation played a significant part in his Honour’s approach to sentencing. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the point of view of his personal history and in particular his history since his release from custody, he has demonstrated in a very convincing way a person who first of all fell into a drug habit and ultimately into the supply of drugs as a consequence of circumstances over which he doesn’t appear to have entirely had control and nonetheless has made a very positive and promising commitment to total rehabilitation since that release.” (ROS 37.6) 
        
       
      
    25 It was agreed that the respondent entered his plea of guilty at the earliest reasonable occasion and consequently his Honour discounted the sentences imposed upon him by twenty five percent. 
     
      
    26 Since his Honour imposed the sentence, the respondent has attended every weekend for his periodic detention (12 weeks). The periodic detention arrangement was incompatible with his employment at TNT but the respondent has obtained alternative employment doing formwork on a part time basis. He continues to live at home and his relationship with his family remains good. 
     
      
       
      Crown appeal 
       
      
    27 Although the Crown relies upon two specific grounds of appeal, the real basis of complaint is that the sentences are manifestly inadequate in that his Honour failed to have regard to the objective seriousness of the offences. The apparent failure of his Honour to refer to the fact that the offences were committed while on conditional liberty is by comparison a secondary issue. 
     
      
    28 As the Crown has pointed out, the case law in relation to persons convicted of drug trafficking offences is almost all one way. In the absence of exceptional circumstances custodial terms must be imposed due to the need for substantial general deterrence. The respondent’s subjective circumstances, while clearly impressive in terms of his employment and progress in rehabilitation, are not exceptional and were not so found by his Honour. 
     
      
    29 With reference to these sentences in R v Day [unreported, NSWCCA, 23 April, 1998) Wood CJ at CL at p 11 cited Kirby P in R v Niga (unreported, NSWCCA, 30 April, 1994) to the effect that periodic detention “is not normally considered to be an appropriate sentence in cases involving the supply of illegal drugs for which heavy penalties have been prescribed”. The offences involving the respondent had penalties of 20, 15 and 10 years respectively. 
     
      
    30 In R v Leslie (1991) 55 A Crim R 68 Campbell J said at 70: 
     
      
       
        
        “Periodic detention is a very useful addition to the armoury of a sentencing judge, however, it is not a custodial sentence in the sense that that term is used in the many cases, of which the learned judge mentioned some, making it virtually mandatory that a person such as the respondent involved with the drug trade on a commercial basis should serve such a sentence. Those cases make clear the special features of drug trafficking which call for fulltime custodial sentences.” 
        
       
      
    31 An inescapable consideration to emerge from the agreed facts and his Honour’s findings in relation to the respondent is that over a significant period of time the respondent was actively engaged in a business which involved the serious and systematic sale of drugs for profit. He was aware of all facets of the operation. The fact that he did not have the opportunity or capacity or exert any control over the operation impacts upon his level of culpability by comparison with his co-offenders. It does not take his case out of that category in relation to which this Court has consistently said a custodial sentence is mandatory unless exceptional circumstances can be established. Exceptional circumstances were not established. 
     
      
    32 In factual situations of this kind this Court has consistently held that considerations of general deterrence and denunciation have to be emphasised in the sentencing process. Despite the positive progress on a subjective basis which the respondent has made towards successful rehabilitation, I am of the opinion that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly inadequate. Although his Honour referred to it in his recitation of the facts, it also seems that his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that the respondent was on conditional liberty during the period when these offences occurred. 
     
      
       
      Court’s discretion 
       
      
    33 This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions and as such significant restraint has to be exercised by the Court before intervening. The Court may decline to interfere even if error has been shown and the Court must be astute to avoid a result which may be in the nature of double jeopardy. If the Court does substitute its own sentence for an inadequate sentence, that sentence will generally be less than that which should have been imposed and towards the lower end of the available range. (R v KM & Ors [2004] NSWCCA 65 at [33]) 
     
      
    34 There are some other considerations to be taken into account in this matter. One of those is the principle of parity. It does not arise in relation to the co-offenders sentenced by his Honour with the respondent since his Honour found that their level of culpability was significantly greater than the respondent. It may arise in relation to the co-offender, Culbert, who was more actively involved in the syndicate than the respondent and who received a comparatively modest sentence of fulltime imprisonment from Nicholson DCJ on 4 June 2004. 
     
      
    35 When sentencing the respondent Phegan DCJ was careful to distinguish his conduct from that of Culbert. The most significant point of distinction was that the respondent had been involved in the syndicate throughout the period of its existence whereas Culbert had only become involved in the latter period, albeit in a significantly more active way than the respondent. In the circumstances I am of the opinion that the principles of parity in relation to the sentence imposed on Culbert do not prevent a fulltime custodial sentence being imposed on the respondent. 
     
      
    36 Another matter is the delay between the apprehension of the respondent in August 2002 and him coming before the court for sentence in August 2004. The respondent was in custody until December 2002, but otherwise the delay remains unexplained. As was submitted, somewhat unusually this gave the respondent an opportunity over a period of 20 months to demonstrate to the court that he was capable of successfully rehabilitating himself. That was put as a further reason why this Court should not intervene. 
     
      
    37 The possibility of successful rehabilitation is always an important factor in any sentencing consideration. In this case there is clear evidence over a period of some 20 months of successful efforts at rehabilitation by the respondent. 
     
      
    38 Despite the persuasive nature of this submission, the considerations to which I referred in [28] – [32] remain valid. The nature of the offences, their duration and objective seriousness require a sentence which reflects the importance of general deterrence and denunciation. To do otherwise would bring the criminal justice system into disrepute.  
     
      
    39 I am also mindful that the respondent was sentenced on 27 August 2004 and that the uncertainty surrounding the appeal and the fact of being re-sentenced to a period of fulltime imprisonment can be cruel in its effect (R v Hernando (2002) 136 A Crim R 451). Nevertheless, the seriousness of this offence balanced against the manifest inadequacy of the sentence and the need for clear denunciation requires that the respondent be re-sentenced so that he undergoes a period of fulltime imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    40 The sentence which I propose is 3 years fulltime imprisonment. Applying the twenty five percent discount for the early plea of guilty made by his Honour the sentence is reduced to 2 years and 3 months. T`he subjective factors in this matter, particularly the progress in rehabilitation are compelling. Accordingly, I fix a non-parole period of 1 year. I am also mindful that the respondent spent 130 days in custody between August and December 2002 and that he has completed 12 weeks of his periodic detention. For that reason I propose to backdate the sentence to commence on 1 July 2004. 
     
      
    41 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (2) The sentences imposed in relation to  
      Counts 
       1-2 are quashed. In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced to concurrent periods of imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year. The non-parole period is taken to have commenced on 1 July 2004 and will expire on 30 June 2005. The parole period will commence on 1 July 2005 and will expire on 30 September 2006. 
       
       
      (3) The sentence imposed in relation to  
      Count 3 
       is quashed. In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year. That sentence is taken to have commenced on 1 July 2004 and will expire on 30 June 2005. 
       
       
      (4) I direct that the respondent be released to parole on the expiry of the non-parole period on 30 June 2005.

    1 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: On 11 July 2003 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing ten counts alleging that he had defrauded the Commonwealth contrary to s 29D of the Crimes Act (Cth). Each offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Each of the charges related to dishonest conduct in relation to the applicant’s payment of income tax both on his personal income and that of a company of which he was a director. On his pleading guilty to four of those charges, the Crown accepted the pleas in discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was next before the District Court on 24 July 2003 when he appeared before Judge Christie QC for sentence. On that date the Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts, evidence was led on the applicant’s behalf and counsel addressed. The matter was then stood over to the 30 July 2003 when Christie DCJ imposed sentence upon the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) Count 6 imprisonment for 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 24 July 2003; 
         
         
        (b) Counts 1 and 3 fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months to commence on 24 January 2005 and expire on 23 April 2005; 
         
         
        (c) Count 2 fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months to commence on 24 April 2005 and expire on 23 July 2006. 
        
       
       
      This was an effective sentence of imprisonment for 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 24 July 2003. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 23 July 2005. 
       
      
    5 On 18 December the matter was returned to Judge Christie for a correction of the sentence. It was contended that His Honour had failed to comply with s 19A of the Crimes Act (Cth) in that he had failed to fix an overall non-parole period. Consequently, while not conceding the error, his Honour re-sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) Count 6 imprisonment for 3 years to date from 24 July 2003 and to expire on 23 July 2006; 
         
         
        (b) Counts 1 and 3 fixed terms of imprisonment for 3 months concurrent with each other but cumulative on Count 6; 
         
         
        (c) Count 2 a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months cumulative upon Counts 1 and 2; 
         
         
        (d) A non parole period of 2 years from 24 July 2003 and to expire on 23 July 2005. 
        
       
      
    6 The principal ground of appeal argued by the applicant is that there is fresh evidence that should be admitted by this Court that reveals that his Honour sentenced the applicant upon a false factual basis on count 6. In order to understand this ground it is necessary to refer to the facts that were placed before his Honour and upon which he sentenced the applicant. 
     
      
    7 The applicant and another person were directors of a company named Thermal Power Systems Pty Limited (“TPS”). The applicant, through two other wholly owned companies, owned a 50 per cent share in the company. TPS operated an ‘undisclosed’ bank account, in addition to its trading accounts, into which income of the company was deposited. Funds in this account were not declared in taxation returns but were distributed (at least in part) to the appellant. 
     
      
    8 The allegations in the counts on the indictment, to which the applicant pleaded guilty, were as follows. Count 1 related to an understatement by the appellant in his personal tax return for 1995 of income totalling $142,422.00 received from bank accounts operated by TPS and applied by him for private use. Count 2 related to an understatement of income in his personal tax return for 1996 of $647,670.00 received from the undisclosed TPS account, the transfer of a term deposit held in the name of the company into his own name, and other payments made from a TPS account and applied by him for his private use. Count 3 related to understatement of income in his personal tax return for 1997 of $220,701.00 received from the undisclosed account, from the account of a related company and from another TPS account. 
     
      
    9 Count 6 related to the 1966 tax return of TPS that the applicant had signed on behalf of the company. The Crown’s allegation was that the return was false in that it contained an understatement of income of $1,515,506.00 received by the company from Lend Lease, deductions claimed for expenditure by the company but spent on the private purposes of the appellant and the application of funds to a fellow director’s house purchase which were falsely claimed as a deduction by the company. 
     
      
    10 In respect of that part of count 6 which is relevant to the issues raised in the appeal, paragraphs 55 and 56 of the summary of facts stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        55. TPS also received the following additional payments from a contractor during the 1996 year: 
         
         
        Cheque No. Date Drawn Amount 
         
          
           
          43473 10/4/96 $343,907.00 
           
          455261 24-4/96 $679,844.00 
           
           $1,023,844.00 
          
         
         
        56. These cheques were not deposited into the TPS bank account number 50 930 0161 (the trading account) or the undisclosed account. The general journal entries of TPS for the 1996 financial year had no record of these payments being received. The offender through TPS failed to disclose this business income in the sum of $1,023,751.00 in its 1996 company income tax return. 
         
        
       
      
    11 As has already been indicated, no objection was taken to the statement of facts and no dispute arose in relation to the allegations contained in count 6 during the sentencing hearing. However, it is now contended that the facts were in error because the Crown had not proved that the two Lend Lease payments had been received by the company and evidence, becoming available to the applicant after sentence, indicates that the cheques were not received by TPS. Therefore, the argument runs, his Honour erroneously found that the offence in count 6 was the most serious by reason of the amount of money involved and sentenced the applicant on a false factual basis: that the amount the subject of the charge was $1,515,506.00 rather than $491,855. 
     
      
    12 The fresh evidence is principally a report from a firm of accountants, Anthony Carmody & Associates, dated 4 May 2004. The substance of the report is that, after examining all the known accounts of TPS and the private accounts of the applicant and others, the accountant was unable to find any record of the receipt of the two cheques from Lend Lease. The applicant has also made an affidavit in which he stated that he did not receive the cheques. This affidavit was filed in answer to Crown submissions commenting on the absence of that evidence. 
     
      
    13 Evidence of events occurring after sentence will be admitted by this Court, whether that evidence be fresh or new, where the absence of that evidence before the sentencing court has led to a miscarriage of justice. There are decisions of this Court setting out the pre-conditions that should be shown to exist before the evidence will be received, but those pre-conditions are merely examples of situations in which the Court may find that a miscarriage of justice has arisen. See R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 at 330 and R v Fordham (1998) 98 A Crim R 359 at 377-378. 
     
      
    14 The applicant in the present case does not resile from his plea of guilty to count 6 but now seeks to contest the factual basis for that plea. It is said that a miscarriage of justice arose because his Honour dealt with count six as if it were the most serious matter to which the applicant pleaded and determined that the sentence for that offence should in effect be the head sentence to be served by the applicant for the total criminality for which he was before the court. It is submitted in effect that the sentence for count 6 should be reduced to accord with the criminality reflected in the offence charged without the allegation that the company had failed to disclose the receipt of the Lend Lease cheques. 
     
      
    15 In my opinion the fresh evidence should be rejected on the basis that it does not reveal that a miscarriage of justice occurred. The history of the proceedings is important in reaching this conclusion. The applicant was committed for trial on 10 counts of defrauding the Commonwealth, including what became count 6 on the indictment. He appeared in the District Court on 11 July 2003 before the Chief Judge. He was legally represented on that date and pleaded guilty to the four counts when arraigned. It should be noted that the trial of the committal charges was due to commence on 14 July 2003 and the appellant was represented by Senior Counsel experienced in the criminal law. 
     
      
    16 The matter then came before Judge Christie on 24 July for sentence. On that date a statement of facts was admitted by consent, although Senior Counsel who appeared for the applicant at the sentencing hearing raised with his Honour two matters contained in the facts that were disputed. Neither of those matters relates to the factual issue to which the fresh evidence refers. Evidence was adduced on the appellant’s behalf, and the matter was stood over to 30 July 2003, the date upon which the appellant was sentenced. The matter was again before Judge Christie on 18 December 2003 when the appellant was re-sentenced. 
     
      
    17 In an affidavit placed before this Court the appellant states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When I was at Court with my barrister and solicitor, the DPP/ATO were applying for a further extension. A proposal was offered to my solicitor and he advised me to plead guilty and that would be the best result for me. I was not given much time to think about it or discuss the decision with my family. I pleaded guilty. 
         
         
        I know that I am guilty of most of the things, but I was confused in relation to Count 6 and the two (2) cheques. I had previously written on four (4) occasions to the investigating officers of the Taxation Department requesting particulars of the two (2) cheques but I never received a reply to those written requests at all. I then got my new solicitor to investigate the matter. 
        
       
      
    18 Even accepting that the applicant may have been taken somewhat by surprise by the offer on 11 July 2003 and may have had little time to consider his position before pleading guilty to four of the ten counts, there was ample opportunity for him to have considered the appropriateness of the pleas before sentence was imposed on 30 July. Further, if the two cheques allegedly received by the company from Lend Lease had troubled him to the extent that he was trying to have the matter cleared up with investigators, it is surprising that this was one of the counts to which he was prepared to plead guilty. He could not have been unaware that the most serious charge to which he was being asked to plead guilty, as part of the bargain reached with the Crown, was Count 6 or that the substantial part of the fraud alleged by that charge involved the two Lend Lease cheques. There is no evidence as to why it was that the appellant was prepared to put aside his concerns about these cheques until after sentencing but should raise them again many months later. 
     
      
    19 In any event, the fresh evidence is not inconsistent with the way in which the Crown alleged the offence had been committed for the purpose of the appellant being sentenced. The Crown case was that the company had received the Lend Lease cheques even though the prosecution could not establish into which account the cheques had been paid. It was never suggested that the cheques were paid into the company’s undisclosed account or any other account of which the Crown was aware. The evidence of the accountant now placed before the Court merely confirms that this was the case. 
     
      
    20 In my opinion the fresh evidence does not suggest that a miscarriage of justice has occurred such as to warrant this Court permitting the appellant to withdraw a plea of guilty apparently voluntarily given and with a full appreciation of the nature of the charge to which the plea related. It has never been suggested that the appellant did not understand that the plea to Count 6, in light of the facts presented to the court, acknowledged his guilt in respect of the two cheques or that he did not apprehend that he would be sentenced on the basis that he acted fraudulently in relation to them. 
     
      
    21 The other grounds relied upon on behalf of the appellant assert that in a number of ways Judge Christie erred in determining the sentence he imposed and that the sentence was manifestly excessive. They can in my view be dealt with relatively briefly. It was submitted that his Honour failed to give sufficient consideration to the following matters relevant to the subjective considerations present in sentencing the appellant: the appellant’s contrition; his assistance to the authorities; his payment of the outstanding tax and penalties levied by the Tax Office; his age and health. The difficulty with this argument is that his Honour referred to these matters appropriately during his remarks and, therefore, whether proper weight was accorded to them can only be determined by a consideration of the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    22 It was also submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the delay in the matter being investigated and then prosecuted. No mention was made of this matter during the course of his Honour’s remarks but this is no doubt because counsel for the appellant indicated to his Honour that he could not submit that there was any significant delay. In any event, although delay can be a relevant factor in sentencing, the importance of that matter will depend largely upon the seriousness of the offence for which sentence is being passed and the effect of the delay upon the offender. In my view the concession made by the appellant’s counsel during the sentencing proceedings was appropriate and there was no error in his Honour acting upon it. 
     
      
    23 It was argued that his Honour failed to give sufficient regard to the effect of the imprisonment upon the appellant’s wife and children. Further material in that regard was placed before this Court presumably upon the basis that it might be relevant were this Court required to re-sentence the appellant. The evidence reveals no more than what might be expected as a consequence for the appellant’s family of the gaoling of a loving husband and a caring father. No sentencing court can be unaffected by those consequences but the law is clear and unless they are exceptional they cannot be taken into account to permit departure from a sentence otherwise appropriate. 
     
      
    24 Finally, it was argued that there was insufficient weight given to the plea of guilty. His Honour did not indicate the amount by which he was reducing the otherwise appropriate sentence because of the plea of guilty as evidencing the willingness of the appellant to assist the administration of justice. There was, however, no requirement upon him to do so. His Honour did say: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The prisoner entered a plea of guilty at what was conceded was the earliest opportunity, as I understand it, and as I say the Crown accepted the plea of guilty in respect of these matters in discharge of the indictment. 
        
       
       
      In fact there was no concession that the plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity. To the contrary, the Crown submitted it was not an early plea, and defence counsel accepted that it was not. The plea was entered three days before a trial was to commence. 
       
      
    25 In my opinion there has been no error shown in the sentencing remarks; and, having regard to the seriousness of the criminal activity reflected in the charges and the need for general deterrence in respect of taxation fraud, the sentence was a moderate one. 
     
      
    26 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

     Regina v Ahmed HAWAT 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Ahmed Hawat appealed against his conviction, after a trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Patten and a jury, on two counts of sexual intercourse without consent on 3 December 2001, being offences under s 61I of the Crimes Act. The appellant had been indicted on two counts of the aggravated form of the offence under s 61J of the Crimes Act, the circumstances of aggravation being the infliction of actual bodily harm on the victim, but during the trial the trial judge held that there was no evidence on which the jury could find that the appellant had inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim.  
     
      
    3 The victim of both the alleged offences was a young adult woman, who I will refer to as “the complainant”. At the trial the appellant did not dispute that on 3 December 2001 he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant but he said that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant only once and that that act of sexual intercourse had been consensual.  
     
      
       
      THE CROWN CASE AT THE TRIAL 
       
      
    4 The principal witness in the Crown case was the complainant. Two other important witnesses in the Crown case were two young women, who I will refer to as Andrea and Alison. Other witnesses in the Crown case included another young woman, who I will refer to as Natalie, the complainant’s brother, a police officer who on 3 December 2001 took a short statement from the complainant in his notebook soon after the offences were allegedly committed, certain other police officers and Dr Crampton, a medical practitioner who examined the complainant on 3 December 2001 soon after the offences had allegedly been committed and who took a short history from the complainant. 
     
      
    5 As at 3 December 2001 the complainant, Andrea and Natalie lived together in a rented house at Strathfield. Alison was an acquaintance of the other three young women.  
     
      
    6 Having regard to the grounds of appeal and the submissions made in support of the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to examine in some detail the evidence of the complainant, Andrea and Alison. 
     
      
       
      The Complainant 
       
      Evidence in Chief 
       
      
    7 The complainant gave evidence that she first met the appellant on a Saturday night in mid-October 2001, when she and Andrea were travelling on a train bound for Circular Quay. A group of males who included the appellant approached the complainant and Andrea. They asked the two young women for their names and telephone numbers and the complainant supplied her name and telephone number. The males got off the train at Town Hall station and the complainant and Andrea proceeded to Circular Quay. 
     
      
    8 Later the same night the complainant received a telephone call from a person who identified himself as “Ahmed”. The caller proposed that he and the complainant meet later that night in the city but the complainant declined the proposal. 
     
      
    9 Over the next eight weeks the complainant received a number of telephone calls and SMS messages on her mobile telephone. On some occasions the telephone number which the appellant had supplied as being his telephone number was displayed. On other occasions no telephone number was displayed. The complainant replied that she was not interested in meeting the appellant and that she was trying to study.  
     
      
    10 In late November 2001 the complainant was walking to her home from a railway station, when the appellant hailed her from a building site where he was working. He proposed that he and the complainant go out together but the complainant declined.  
     
      
    11 On 1 December 2001 the complainant received a SMS message from the appellant’s number, “why aren’t you calling me?” At the complainant’s request, Natalie sent a reply, telling the caller to leave the complainant alone. This prompted an offensive reply and then a further message from Natalie and then a further message “if you think you’re a sick bitch like your friend, you’re going down with her”. The complainant said in her evidence “something had changed, he was angry now, so it frightened me”. 
     
      
    12 On the late afternoon of Sunday 2 December 2001 the complainant was at home, trying to study. She was becoming fearful, because she was alone and evening was approaching. She telephoned her brother and asked him to call the appellant and say that the complainant was not interested in him. While she was speaking to her brother, she overheard her brother say on his landline “leave her alone”. 
     
      
    13 At about 7 or 8 o’clock that evening Andrea and Natalie returned to the flat. Alison was with Andrea.  
     
      
    14 At the request of the complainant, Alison telephoned the appellant’s mobile telephone number and had a conversation. About five minutes later the complainant’s mobile telephone rang. Alison answered the call but the complainant took the telephone from her and discovered that the caller was not the appellant but a different male, “Tyrone”, who was the appellant’s cousin. Tyrone had a deeper voice, spoke a lot more quickly and sounded a lot more angry than the appellant. Tyrone made threatening comments about Alison and threatened to kill the complainant too. The complainant sent a SMS message “just leave us alone” and received a message in response “no”. 
     
      
    15 The complainant telephoned the appellant again “and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and he asked to meet at Auburn McDonald’s. I just said ‘why?’ and he just said, ‘just come here. If you don’t, we’ll shoot you in your house’. Then the phone was hung up”. 
     
      
    16 When asked by the Crown Prosecutor whether she believed that the threat was serious, the complainant said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I thought it was highly possible because he worked in my area and I had to pass his work place every day going to the train station. It could have been easy for him to find out where I lived just by following me home or finding which direction I came from”. 
        
       
      
    17 The complainant said that Alison wanted to go to McDonald’s, because she was hungry anyway. Andrea did not really say anything. The complainant said in her evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I thought, if anything, it might be better because it was a public area. McDonald’s being a public restaurant, there would be other people around, whereas being shot in your house was a very private sort of thing. There was no one about. So I didn’t think it was that bad an idea at the time”. 
        
       
      
    18 The three women, the complainant, Alison and Andrea drove to McDonald’s at Auburn in Alison’s car, arriving at about 11 or 11.30. At McDonald’s they saw a parked car with a group of males in it. “The accused walked around and tapped on my window and said, ‘Don’t you say hello?’ They were making gestures for me to get out of the car, so Andrea got up to let me out and I just chatted to them for a while”. 
     
      
    19 The other two women Andrea and Alison remained in their car. The conversation at that time between the complainant and the males was polite. The appellant introduced the complainant to Tyrone and another male named Hussein or Sam. There were two other males, one of whom was named Mark. The complainant had a conversation with Hussein, who by an unlikely coincidence had some names similar to the complainant’s. A number of cars which had been in the car park left. The complainant said in her evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “And then Tyrone said, ‘you’re coming to Silverwater Bridge with us’. At that time I said, ‘Look, no, I’ve met up with you now, I’ve got to go back home and study. I don’t, you know, I don’t want to go to Silverwater Bridge,’ and he just kept asking me, so I said, ‘Look, it’s not up to me, it’s up to the driver’”. 
        
       
      
    20 The complainant continued in her evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “So he went around to Alison’s window and said, ‘Make her come to Silverwater Bridge or we’ll follow you home’” 
        
       
      
    21 The three women had a discussion about what they should do. The complainant said in her evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “We just thought, ‘Okay, if we did drive off at this time, do we think they’re going to follow us’, and we all thought that they would, so we thought maybe the best thing would be to follow them”. 
        
       
      
    22 The three women, travelling in Alison’s car, followed the males’ car to Silverwater Bridge. They arrived at a large car park near the Bridge. 
     
      
    23 At Silverwater Bridge Tyrone and the appellant got out of their car, approached the women’s car and asked the complainant to get out, because they wanted to talk to her. It seemed to the complainant that Tyrone was the one among the males who decided what was to happen. Tyrone said to the complainant:- “you’re here because I want you to be here”. The complainant asked “can we go?” and Tyrone said “no”. 
     
      
    24 The complainant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I think Tyrone and the accused spoke in another language for a couple of minutes. I don’t know what they were discussing. And then the accused said, ‘We are going for a walk’. He pulled me away sort of by my neck and my shoulders”. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              . . . 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        We stopped near by a tree, and I tried to return to walk away, and he just pulled me back. He was asking me to sit down on the ground, and I was just saying no, I wanted to go back to the car, and he said, ‘No, I want to talk to you’. And at that stage I saw Alison’s car driving away, and it slowed to where I was, and they ran down the window and said, ‘We’ll be back soon’, and then they drove away”. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              . . . 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I think I was standing at the front of the car when I was spoken to and taken away. They (the other two women) would have seen me, being pulled away by the accused”. 
        
       
      
    25 The complainant and the appellant walked back to where the males’ car was. The complainant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “..the accused and Tyrone said something else, again in another language, and then the accused took me off into a different direction”. 
         
        . . . 
        
       
       
        
        “Just by force around the shoulder area, same sort of thing as before. This time it was in a completely different direction to which we had come from”. 
        
       
      
    26 When the complainant was taken away by the appellant, the appellant said that there was a gun in the car and that he would shoot the complainant, if she did anything the appellant did not want her to do. 
     
      
    27 The appellant tried to push the complainant to the ground. The complainant said “no, no, no, no”. I don’t want to do this”. The appellant told her to shut up. The appellant was trying “to take off my shirt and pull down my pants”. The complainant resisted and the appellant grabbed both the complainant’s hands by the wrists and held them with his own hand above the complainant’s head. The appellant pulled down the complainant’s tracksuit pants and underwear and penetrated the complainant. The appellant said “if you don’t do this, I swear I’m going to kill you”. The complainant was not sure whether the appellant ejaculated. 
     
      
    28 The complainant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This happened for about five minutes and then he got up and looked towards the direction of the cars and I got up and pulled my pants up. I started running back towards the cars. He caught up to me and pulled me back down on to the ground. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did he grab you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He grabbed me by – he was coming from behind me, so he grabbed me by the shoulders and just pushed me back and then jumped in front of me and pushed me on to the ground. Then he did it again. He pulled my pants down, my underwear down. His penis entered and I’m pretty sure this time that he did ejaculate because I could feel it on my leg. This time it was only for maybe three minutes”. 
        
       
      
    29 During the encounter the complainant was trying to talk, saying “no, no, no don’t do this. Do you know this is rape” but the appellant was trying to kiss her on the lips and eventually covered her mouth.  
     
      
    30 Tyrone came over and spoke to the complainant. He talked generally for a time and then:- 
     
      
       
        
        “..he just tried to kiss me on the mouth. He tried to lay me down on the grass but I was saying, ‘no, no, no,’ and I think eventually he just gave up and dragged me back up to the car”. 
        
       
      
    31 The complainant noticed that Alison’s car had returned. The complainant gave evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I walked up to Andrea’s window and her window had been wound down, so I just – I asked her, ‘can we go? I want to go. I want to leave’. At that time I noticed that they were smoking a bong”. 
        
       
      
    32 The other two women did not respond to what the complainant said. They were laughing and listening to music. 
     
      
    33 The man Hussein or Sam approached the complainant. He touched the complainant on the breasts and said “lets go for a walk”. The complainant said that she did not want to. Hussein took the complainant in the direction she had first been taken by the appellant. Hussein pushed the complainant down on to the ground. Hussein noticed bruises on the complainant’s neck and asked “did Ahmed do that to you?” Hussein said that he could do a better job than the appellant and started kissing the complainant, biting her on the neck. 
     
      
    34 It was this evidence about Hussein’s conduct which led the trial judge to withdraw from the jury the alleged circumstances of aggravation of the appellant inflicting actual bodily harm on the complainant. 
     
      
    35 As Hussein was opening a condom, the complainant jumped up and returned to where the cars were. Her evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “When I got back to the cars, I was crying and I asked the girls again, ‘I want to go. Can we go now?’ They didn’t respond to me”. 
         
          
           
            
             
              
              . . . 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        They didn’t really care. It was very obvious that I was upset. I was crying. I had marks on my neck”. 
        
       
      
    36 The man Mark grabbed the complainant around the waist and said “we’re going for a walk”. Mark and the complainant went past the tree and had a conversation. However, no sexual activity occurred. 
     
      
    37 When the complainant and Mark returned to the cars, “there was a dispute of some sort going on”. Alison was accusing Tyrone of having stolen her mobile telephone. Andrea realised that her mobile phone had also been taken. The appellant took Alison’s car keys and said that he wanted to give the car a test drive but Alison refused. The appellant then threw Alison’s car keys away. The complainant retrieved the car keys. 
     
      
    38 The males drove away in their car. As they drove away, they shouted “we’ve got your phones and your CD’s”. The women drove back to the house at Strathfield. The complainant told the other two women that she wanted the police called. 
     
      
    39 In the police investigation the complainant made photographic identifications of the appellant, Tyrone and Hussein. 
     
      
    40 The complainant gave descriptions of the appellant and Tyrone. She described the appellant as “about five foot six, five foot seven… dark in appearance…of Lebanese appearance, dark hair. It was shaven but a bit longer on top, of probably slim build, I think.” The complainant described Tyrone as “probably five eight or five nine. He had dark hair, dark appearance. I would say of Lebanese appearance again. He was of a large build”. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination 
       
      
    41 The complainant agreed that the threatening message on 1 December 2001 was the first time language of that sort had been used and she was not sure that the message had emanated from the appellant. 
     
      
    42 The complainant said that when the appellant took hold of her and started pulling her away, she screamed out “leave me alone”, “in a pitch that someone could have heard”, but neither of her friends had come to her assistance. 
     
      
    43 At the time when the other women drove past, leaving the car park, the complainant was blocked between the tree and the appellant and it would have appeared to an observer that she was being detained against her will.  
     
      
    44 The complainant was cross-examined about a number of alleged inconsistencies in her evidence or between her evidence and the statement she had made to police on 3 December 2001. 
     
      
    45 In the statement the complainant had said that she was pushed to the ground, before Alison’s car drove past. In her evidence the complainant said that it was after Alison’s car had driven past, that the appellant pushed her to the ground. 
     
      
    46 In her evidence the complainant said that after the first act of sexual intercourse she herself got up off the ground. It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that in her statement she had said that the appellant “pulled her up”. However, it would appear that in her statement the complainant said that after both acts of sexual intercourse she herself “got up” (pars 47 and 49 of the statement). 
     
      
    47 It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that there were inconsistencies in her evidence about whether she struggled against the appellant. The complainant was asked in cross-examination “you tell us that you tried to fight him?” to which she replied “not exactly, no”. The complainant then said that there had been a struggle between the appellant and herself. However, when asked “would you say that you were struggling as best you were able”, she replied “no”. The complainant was referred to her evidence in chief in which she had said “I was trying to fight against (the appellant)”. The complainant said in her cross-examination that she had used as much force as she was able, to break the appellant’s grip on her wrists. 
     
      
    48 The complainant accepted in cross-examination that she had not suffered any injuries to her wrists or back, which might support her account of how the assaults had occurred. 
     
      
    49 In her evidence the complainant said that the appellant had released her hands, so that her hands were free by the time the appellant had intercourse with her and that she was trying to push the appellant off with her hands. In her statement she had said that by “this stage”, that is after the appellant had pulled her clothing down, “he had both his hands on top of my hands”. 
     
      
    50 In cross-examination the complainant was criticised for using the expression “I think”, when answering a question about what she had said to the appellant. The complainant had given evidence “I can’t remember exact words, I think I said ‘stop’”. 
     
      
    51 In her evidence in cross-examination the complainant said that, immediately before the second act of intercourse, the appellant had run past her, got in front of her and pushed her to the ground. It was put that this evidence was inconsistent with her evidence in chief that “he was coming from behind me so he grabbed me by the shoulder, just pushed me back then, jumped in front of me and pushed me to the ground”. Both the Crown prosecutor and the trial judge expressed a view that there was not necessarily any contradiction between the complainant’s evidence in cross-examination and her evidence in chief. 
     
      
    52 In her evidence the complainant denied having used marijuana on 3 December 2001. Both Andrea and Alison later gave evidence that the complainant had in fact used marijuana. 
     
      
    53 Both Andrea and Alison later gave evidence that the complainant appeared “fine”, when she returned with the appellant at Silverwater Bridge. 
     
      
    54 The complainant was cross-examined about why she had not made an immediate complaint of having been raped to Alison or Andrea. The complainant said that she had said to Andrea that she wanted to go, that she wanted to leave the area.  
     
      
       
      Andrea 
       
       
      Evidence in Chief 
       
      
    55 In 2001 Andrea was living in the same rented house at Strathfield as the complainant and Natalie.  
     
      
    56 Andrea was with the complainant on the train journey in October and she gave an account of events on the train journey, which was generally consistent with the complainant’s. 
     
      
    57 When asked whether one of the males on the train had asked for the complainant’s telephone number or whether the complainant had offered her telephone number without being asked, Andrea said that she did not remember. She was then asked by the Crown prosecutor whether having access to the statement she had made to police on 3 December 2001 would assist her in recalling what had happened on the train and she replied “no, but my statement is true”. She said that having access to her statement would not assist her, “because I don’t remember what happened”. The trial judge granted leave to Andrea under s 32 of the Evidence Act to revive her memory by referring to her statement. Andrea then read aloud paragraph 7 of her statement in which she had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A few minutes later I heard the other guy that was with the fellow talking to (the complainant) say, ‘how about giving me your number?’. I then heard (the complainant) read out her mobile phone number to him. As she was doing this I saw this guy keying this number into his mobile phone. He then said, ‘I’m going to ring it to see if it’s the right number’. 
        
       
       
        
        (The complainant) said, ‘why would I give you the wrong number’. This guy then used one of the other male’s mobile phone. A few seconds later I heard (the complainant’s) mobile phone ring. It rang only once before it stopped”.  
        
       
      
    58 Andrea gave evidence that she saw the person who had asked the complainant for her telephone number at McDonald’s at Auburn on 2-3 December 2001. 
     
      
    59 Andrea said in her evidence that the complainant had received telephone calls from the appellant but Andrea did not remember whether she herself had spoken to the appellant. She was given leave to revive her memory by referring to her statement (par 13), in which she had said that she had spoken to the appellant on the telephone three or four times. She said in evidence that the appellant had not been polite and “he was quite adamant about (the complainant) coming on the telephone”. 
     
      
    60 Andrea was given leave to revive her memory by referring to par 15 of her statement, in which she had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He then said, ‘all we want to do is sleep with her’. I said, ‘who’s we and why?’ He said, ‘me and my boys’. He then became abusive and threatening saying, ‘I’ll slit your throat. I can put a bullet in your head’. He also threatened to come around saying ‘I know where you live’. I later learnt that this guy’s first name was Ahmed”. 
        
       
      
    61 In the absence of the jury and of the witness the Crown prosecutor said to the trial judge that “it is quite clear from the demeanour of this witness that she is not… happy being here… it is not expected that there will be an objection to treat this witness as unfavourable”. However, no application was made by the Crown at that stage for leave to cross-examine Andrea. 
     
      
    62 Andrea then gave evidence about events happening on the night of 2 December 2001. She returned to the house at Strathfield at about 8.50, with her friend Alison. The complainant and Natalie were at the house. The telephone rang and Andrea answered it. Andrea said in evidence that she believed that the person who spoke to her was “Ahmed” and that “I had a conversation… about meeting up with him, maybe”. She was given leave to revive her memory by referring to par 17 of her statement and she read aloud from par 17 of her statement in which she had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “About two minutes later (the complainant’s) telephone commenced to ring. I then picked it up and answered it and said, ‘hello’. A male then commenced to speak to me. He said, ‘hello’. I said, ‘who is this?’ He said, ‘Ahmed, what are you up to?’ I said, ‘not much. I’m just at home with friends. What about you?’ He said, ‘I’m at home with the boys. Why don’t you hook up with us?’ I said, ‘because I have work in the morning and as if I’d want to anyway. You’re a dickhead’. He said, ‘don’t raise your voice and swear at me. Do you know who I am?’ I said, ‘obviously not, I’ve met you once before and I’ve spoken to you. What do you think I am, psychic’? He said, ‘I’ll find out where you live and I’ll come and get you and your slut of a friend. You don’t believe me do you, I’ve got shotguns. I know heaps of people. I can find out where you live tomorrow. I then threw the phone down towards (the complainant) before she picked it up and terminated the call”. 
        
       
      
    63 Andrea then said in her evidence that the complainant organised with one of the males to go and meet up with them at McDonald’s at Auburn. She continued in her evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        ”I didn’t really want to go. But (the complainant) and Alison were both saying that they were expecting three of us, so I suggested we didn’t take any money and took our jewellery off, and we took a rolling pin and a steak knife with us”. 
        
       
      
    64 At McDonald’s at Auburn the three women met a group of five males which included the appellant. One of the males, she thought Tyrone, told the three women to follow the males’ car to Silverwater Bridge.  
     
      
    65 Andrea gave evidence that at Silverwater Bridge:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Alison announced that it was 12 o’clock, and that it was my birthday, and Ahmed asked if he could give me a kiss, and I told him no. And I think he said, ‘what about (the complainant),’ and then (the complainant) said, ‘yes, but not here. We’ll go into the bushes’. She didn’t want to kiss him in front of everybody”. 
        
       
      
    66 The appellant and the complainant then walked away side by side, without the appellant’s hand being anywhere on or near the complainant. While the appellant and the complainant were away, the rest of the group played music and talked. The appellant and the complainant were gone for about half an hour. When the complainant returned, she appeared “fine” and did not appear distressed. 
     
      
    67 Andrea gave evidence that there was discussion about obtaining marijuana. In a statement she had made to police on 3 December 2001 she had not mentioned marijuana. She said in her evidence that this was because she and Alison had made an agreement “not to put marijuana in the statements”.  
     
      
    68 Andrea gave evidence that there was a conversation between Alison and Tyrone about going back to the house at Strathfield, getting money, coming back to Silverwater Bridge and then obtaining marijuana. 
     
      
    69 When Alison and Andrea were driving out of the car park at Silverwater Bridge, Andrea saw the complainant and the appellant and told the complainant, who appeared “fine”, that they were going to McDonald’s. 
     
      
    70 The proposal to obtain money and then marijuana was carried into effect and some of the males left and returned to the car park with marijuana. Andrea gave evidence “I didn’t actually see anyone use it but I believe a few of the boys did and Alison and (the complainant)”. She did not see a bong. She herself did not use any of the marijuana. 
     
      
    71 Andrea gave evidence that the complainant and Hussein left to go for a walk in the bush. She accepted there was nothing in the statement she had made to police about the complainant going off with Hussein. She did not know why that had been left out of her statement. 
     
      
    72 When the complainant and Hussein returned, the complainant “had love bites on her neck”. She accepted that there was nothing in her statement about this. 
     
      
    73 Andrea gave evidence that Tyrone and the complainant left the group and sat together near a lake. They were not gone for long. Andrea accepted that there was nothing in her statement about Tyrone and the complainant going off together.  
     
      
    74 Subsequently there was conversation between the three women about going home. During this conversation the complainant appeared “fine” and not upset. The males told the women that they wanted the women to stay. The appellant took the keys from the ignition in Alison’s car and threw them on the grass and the complainant retrieved them. The males drove off in their car. One of them yelled “we’ve got your CD’s and mobile phones”. 
     
      
    75 Andrea was asked whether at any stage she saw the complainant “shaking”. She replied “I believe in my statement, yes, I did put that”. She gave evidence that she did not remember the complainant shaking. Andrea was asked whether at any stage she saw the complainant “visibly upset” and she replied “yes… when we were parked outside my home at Strathfield”. Similarly, she said that the complainant had burst into tears but only when they parked outside the house at Strathfield. Andrea accepted that in her statement made on 3 December 2001 she had given “a different scenario altogether”. 
     
      
    76 The Crown prosecutor made an application for leave to cross-examine Andrea. The application was not opposed by counsel for the appellant and the application was granted. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination by the Crown  
       
      
    77 Andrea was cross-examined by the Crown about pars 27 and 28 of the statement she had made to police, in which she had said that she saw the complainant and the appellant go for a walk and then saw them return. She was then cross-examined by the Crown about all of par 29 of her statement in which she had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “When (the complainant) reached the car she leant on the door where I was seated and said, ‘let’s go, we have to go now’. I could see that (the complainant) was visibly upset and she was shaking. Her eyes looked like she’d been crying. I then noticed two huge marks on either side of (the complainant)’s neck. These marks were very dark and deep. I then turned to Alison and said ‘we have to go”. 
        
       
      
    78 Andrea said that par 29 was what she had said in her statement but that it was not her recollection at the time of her giving evidence. She agreed with the Crown prosecutor that, “as far as your statement goes, that it was truthful but you just now do not have any recollection of those matters”. 
     
      
    79 Andrea agreed in cross-examination by the Crown that there had been a dispute between the complainant and herself about the bond money on the lease of the house where they were living and whether Andrea was entitled to part of the refunded bond money. The dispute gave rise to a series of emails in July 2002 between the complainant and Andrea, which became exhibit G at the trial. 
     
      
    80 The series of emails commenced with an email from Andrea to the complainant, which read as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        ”As I payed (sic) the bond money I am entitled to it. It’s OK, you will be served with a ‘release of funds’ form soon. 
        
       
       
        
        I am capable of giving evidence as is Alison and will do so, but unfortunately, not in the favour of you!” 
        
       
      
    81 The complainant replied as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “You are not entitled to any of the bond money that I got back. This is because you did not sign the lease. Both Gareth and I do not know where your towel or lamp are. Nor do we care. The last that I saw of those items was when we left them at the front of the house in Strathfield – along with your other items that you did not return for. I doubt that you will be going to court in September. The police know that you and Alison are not capable of giving evidence”. 
        
       
      
    82 The emails between the complainant and Andrea continued in similar, acrimonious, terms. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination by the Defence 
       
      
    83 When cross-examined by counsel for the appellant Andrea gave evidence generally in accordance with the evidence she had given in her evidence in chief, as distinct from the statement she had made to police on 3 December 2001. 
     
      
    84 She said that on the train journey a male other than the appellant had done most of the talking. 
     
      
    85 The complainant had not appeared to have been forced to go with the appellant at Silverwater Bridge. When the complainant had returned, she appeared fine, she was not upset or crying and she had no marks on her neck. Andrea recalled the complainant going for only one walk with the appellant at Silverwater Bridge.  
     
      
    86 When Andrea and Alison left to get some money to buy marijuana, Andrea said to the complainant, who was just outside the car, that they were going to McDonald’s and the complainant replied “OK. See you soon”. 
     
      
    87 It was when the complainant returned from a walk with Hussein that the complainant had marks on her neck. 
     
      
    88 There had been no conversation in the car on the way home to Strathfield. When Alison parked outside the house at Strathfield, the complainant said that she had been raped. 
     
      
    89 Cross-examination about the disputed bond money included the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. There has been mention made of this dispute between you and (the complainant) about the bond money. Was that of such a serious nature in your mind that it would cause you to tell lies in the witness box? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ever threaten (the complainant) that you would, in fact, tell lies against her if she didn’t pay the bond money? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I will just repeat the question. Did you ever threaten her that you would tell lies in the witness box if she didn’t pay you the bond money? 
         
        A. Not in them words, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say? 
         
        A. I told her that I wouldn’t give evidence in favour of her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you change your evidence against (the complainant) because of the dispute over the bond money? 
         
        A. No”. 
        
       
       
      Alison 
       
      Evidence in Chief 
       
      
    90 Alison gave evidence that as at December 2001 she knew the complainant and Andrea. 
     
      
    91 On the evening of 2 December 2001, while Andrea was with Alison at her home, Andrea received a telephone call from the complainant. Alison spoke on the telephone to the complainant, who told her that she had received a text message and that she was scared. 
     
      
    92 Alison and Andrea arrived at the house at Strathfield at about 9.30 or 10 o’clock. At the house the complainant received a number of telephone calls. The complainant said that “there were these guys that wanted us to go meet them at Auburn McDonald’s”. 
     
      
    93 Before the complainant received any of the calls, Alison herself made a telephone call to someone who, on the basis of what the complainant told her, she believed to be the appellant. “I was telling him to leave my friend alone and he told me that my friend was ‘a slut’”. 
     
      
    94 Andrea suggested that the women call the police but the complainant said that they should go and meet the males. The complainant said that “they told her that they were going to kill us, if we didn’t go”. Alison agreed to go because the complainant had told her that the males had threatened to kill the women. The women took a rolling pin and a kitchen knife and left their jewellery and wallets behind. 
     
      
    95 Alison drove herself, the complainant and Andrea in Alison’s car to McDonald’s at Auburn. At McDonald’s the complainant got out of the car and started talking to the men. Alison heard the complainant say “you’ll have to ask the driver” and a male then said to Alison “are you going to come to Silverwater Bridge?” and Alison said “yes, looks like we are”. Alison gave evidence that she had not wanted to go to Silverwater Bridge but decided to go, because the complainant said that she wanted to go. All the women were “a bit scared” about going to Silverwater Bridge but they followed the males to Silverwater Bridge. 
     
      
    96 At Silverwater Bridge the complainant got out of the car and started talking to the men. Alison said that it was Andrea’s birthday and one of the men asked for a birthday kiss. The complainant then walked off with one of the males, who was not the appellant. The complainant and this male walked next to each other, not touching. They did not walk far. 
     
      
    97 After the complainant had walked off with this male, another of the males said to Alison “what are the chances of you and I having sex tonight?” to which Alison replied “not likely”. This male then said “what if I raped you?” This male then put his head on Alison’s chest. She was still inside the car. She pushed him away. This male then said in an angry voice, not to touch him. Alison said that she believed that this male’s name was Ahmed. There was just one “Ahmed” at Silverwater Bridge that night. 
     
      
    98 In her evidence up to this point Alison had distinguished between the first male with whom the complainant had walked off and “Ahmed”. However, the Crown prosecutor asked Alison whether it was before or after the incident in the car “that Ahmed” walked off with (the complainant)?” Alison replied that it was “after”. The complainant and Ahmed were away about half an hour and when the complainant returned “she had some bruises or love bites on her neck”. 
     
      
    99 After a further interval in which Alison in her evidence did not describe anything significant as having happened, “Ahmed took my keys from the car and we noticed that everything else was missing”. Ahmed threw Alison’s car keys away and the car containing the males drove off. The complainant retrieved the car keys.  
     
      
    100 The three women decided to leave. Before they left Silverwater Bridge, the complainant told the other two that she had been raped. 
     
      
    101 Alison later gave evidence that she and Andrea had gone to Andrea’s house at Strathfield to get money to pay for marijuana. As Alison and Andrea were leaving to go to the house at Strathfield, they saw the complainant with a male other than Ahmed. Alison said to the complainant “make sure you don’t have sex with him”. At the time she said this, the complainant was about ten metres away from the car. Alison agreed that there was nothing in the statement she had made to police about her saying this to the complainant. 
     
      
    102 After the marijuana had been obtained, Alison and the complainant used some of it. Alison agreed that there was nothing in the initial statement she had made to police about driving away from Silverwater Bridge or obtaining marijuana. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination by the Crown 
       
      
    103 The Crown prosecutor applied for and was granted leave to cross-examine Alison about certain paragraphs of her statement of 3 December 2001. 
     
      
    104 Alison had also made a statement on 14 August 2003, only a few days before the trial commenced. Both of Alison’s statements were ultimately admitted into evidence at the trial as exhibits K and L.  
     
      
    105 In pars 11-18 of the statement of 3 December 2001 Alison had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “11. Some time during the night Andrea got out of the car and one of the males got into the passenger seat, 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘What are the chances of you and I having sex?’ 
         
        I said, ‘No chance at all.’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘Why not’ 
         
        I said, ‘Because I don’t want to’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘Well what if I raped you’ 
         
        I said, ‘ Yeah right’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘So there is still a chance”. 
        
       
       
        
        I didn’t say anything back to him. The male then leaned over towards me and put his head on my chest area. I then with my left hand pushed his head away from me. 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘Don’t fucking touch me’ 
         
        I said, ‘Don’t come near me’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘You pushed me in the eye’.  
        
       
       
        
        The male then got out of the car. A short time later Andrea got back into the passenger seat. 
        
       
       
        
        12. I would describe the male as being, Lebanese appearance, dark skin, dark short hair, about 150cm – 170cm tall, thin build around 17-21 years old. He was wearing dark pants, black shirt which had a picture in the middle of it. The male’s ears were sticking out. 
        
       
       
        
        13. Soon after Andrea got into the car, I saw the same male walking with (the complainant) toward a park. Andrea and I stayed in the car talking to the other males who were standing outside the car. 
        
       
       
        
        14. Around half an hour later I saw (the complainant) and the same male walking back towards us. (The complainant) approached the passenger side and leaned forward, when I noticed (the complainant) had a reddish/blueish marks around her neck. Andrea got out of the car and started talking to (the complainant). I stayed in the car. We stayed there for a while and I decided to leave. I said to (the complainant) and Andrea that we should leave. (The complainant) and Andrea then walked around the passenger side of my car and Andrea noticed that her mobile phone was missing. (The complainant) also noticed that her mobile phone was missing. At that stage I noticed that my mobile phone was still where I left it at the back of the console area. 
        
       
       
        
        15. While looking for the phones the same male that put his head on my chest approached my window and grabbed the car keys from the ignition. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Give me my keys, give me my keys, give me my keys’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘No, I want to drive your car, let me drive your car’ 
         
        I said, ‘No, give me my keys’. 
        
       
       
        
        The male then got into the passenger side of my car and took my glasses from the console area. 
        
       
       
        
        16. I then grabbed the face of my stereo so he can’t take it. 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘Put it back on, put it back on’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘No, give me my stuff’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘I’ll do a deal with you, if you put the stereo back on, I’ll give you back your glasses. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘No, give me my stuff’. At that stage I noticed that my mobile phone was missing. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Give me my phone back’. 
        
       
       
        
        The male didn’t say anything, the male then handed the glasses back to me and got out of the car. 
        
       
       
        
        17. While the male was walking over to the commodore, he turned around and threw my keys on the floor about two hundred meters away from my car. The male then got into the commodore and drove off. 
        
       
       
        
        18. (The complainant) then walked over and picked up the keys. Andrea and (the complainant) then got into my car. I then turned the interior light on and noticed that a number of CD’s were missing. While talking about the stuff that was missing, (the complainant) said, ‘I could get him for rape’, I said, ‘What’, She said, ‘He raped me’. I then drove to (the complainant’s) house and Andrea contacted police”. 
        
       
      
    106 In pars 4-8 of her statement of 14 August 2003 Alison said, with reference to paragraphs of her earlier statement:- 
     
      
       
        
        “4. Re paragraph 11, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a. It was Ahmed, the accused who asked if he could have sex with me. 
           
            
            At some stage I saw (the complainant) go off with Ahmed but this was after Ahmed asked me to have sex. 
            
           
          b. When he said, ‘don’t fucking touch me’ he said it in an angry tone. 
           
          c. After he got out of the car he was probably just standing around talking to the others. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        5. In paragraph 13 I am referring to the accused with (the complainant). I first saw them when they were about 100 meters from the car; I observed them in my rear view mirror. 
        
       
       
        
        6. In paragraph 14 I said that I wanted to leave because it was 4am and I had to go to work the next day. (The complainant) appeared to be acting normal and at no stage did she say that we should go. 
        
       
       
        
        7. In paragraph 18 (the complainant) was referring to the accused as the one who had raped her. She told me this before we drove away but after she found the keys. 
        
       
       
        
        8. When (the complainant) told us that she had been raped I formed the view that she was only a little upset”. 
        
       
      
    107 Alison said in cross-examination by the Crown that the leaving of Silverwater Bridge to get money to buy marijuana should be fitted into par 14 of her first statement, as having occurred after she had noticed marks on the complainant’s neck. 
     
      
    108 Alison said that she had later seen the complainant walk off with “one of the other guys” but “I didn’t see them do anything”. Alison agreed that there was nothing in her statement of 3 December 2001 about this incident. She said with reference to her statement of 3 December 2001:- 
     
      
       
        
        “When I was giving the statement, I hadn’t slept all night, and I had waited at the Burwood Police Station for six hours to give my statement. So my memory was probably a little bit vague”. 
        
       
      
    109 Alison said that on the night of 2-3 December 2001 she had left Silverwater Bridge only once. This was contrary to pars 9 and 10 of her statement of 14 August 2003, made only a few days earlier, in which she said that she had left Silverwater Bridge twice, once to go to McDonald’s to get a drink and the other time to get money to buy marijuana. 
     
      
    110 Alison said that it had been agreed by all three women at the police station to leave out of their statements anything about marijuana. She was cross-examined about par 13 of her statement of 14 August 2003 in which she said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I did not put in my statement anything about going back to McDonald’s or Strathfield because I just wanted to get the statement over and done with, also because the police did not ask me if I had left. There were no discussions with anyone to the effect that we should leave out of the statement anything to do with marijuana”. 
        
       
      
    111 Alison said that her evidence, and not what she had said in par 13 of her statement, was true. When making the statement she had not been under oath, whereas when giving evidence in court she was under oath. 
     
      
    112 Alison said that she was aware that there had been a dispute between the complainant and Andrea about bond money. Her attention was directed to an email in exhibit G from Andrea to the complainant, which states that a copy of the email was being sent to Alison and in which there are references to Alison. Alison said that she did not remember receiving the email. She agreed that she had had discussions with Andrea in which “Andrea was telling me that (the complainant) took her bond money and that she wouldn’t give it back”. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination by the Defence 
       
      
    113 In cross-examination by counsel for the appellant at the trial Alison said that the complainant had wanted to go to McDonald’s at Auburn and meet the males, that Andrea did not want to go and that Alison herself did not really mind. The complainant did say “they’ve got guns”. 
     
      
    114 At McDonald’s one male, who Alison believed was Tyrone, did most of the talking. She was not aware that Tyrone’s real name was “Ahmed” and he had not used the name “Ahmed” that night. 
     
      
    115 Alison had not wanted to go to Silverwater Bridge but the complainant said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…that we should go for a while, and I knew that she had met them before and that she knew them, so I thought well, if she knows them, then it’s not so bad”. 
        
       
      
    116 Alison denied that at McDonald’s Tyrone had said “make her come to Silverwater Bridge or we will follow you home”. However, Alison had believed that the men would have followed her, if she had driven off. Alison did not think that she had felt hungry at McDonald’s. 
     
      
    117 Alison agreed in cross-examination that, in leaving McDonald’s and going to Silverwater Bridge, they were leaving “a public place with lots of people to go to a place that you didn’t know”. 
     
      
    118 After arriving at Silverwater Bridge she had not heard any conversation between the complainant and Tyrone, as alleged by the complainant. 
     
      
    119 It was put to Alison in cross-examination that she was mistaken in saying it was the appellant who had asked her for sex. She replied that “it was definitely him (the appellant)”. She accepted that she had thought the appellant was joking, when he said, “what if I raped you”. 
     
      
    120 The complainant and the appellant walked off together out of sight. When they returned, the complainant did not appear to be under any kind of coercion. She recalled that the complainant and the appellant had walked off together on two occasions. The walks had been in different directions. In each case the complainant had gone “apparently willingly”. 
     
      
    121 Alison said that she saw the complainant, apparently willingly, and Hussein go off together. She did not see the complainant close up, after the complainant returned with Hussein. She agreed that it had been Hussein who the other males were calling “an animal” for giving the complainant love bites. 
     
      
    122 Alison gave evidence that she also saw the complainant, apparently willingly, go off with another man, who could have been Mark, “the white Croatian”. 
     
      
    123 In neither of her statements, including the statement of 14 August 2003, had Alison made any mention of any one of Tyrone, Hussein or Mark going off with the complainant. 
     
      
    124 When the complainant had returned with the appellant, “her hair was a bit messy”, her clothing “looked the same as when she walked off”, there were no grass stains or vegetation on her clothing, she appeared “fine”, she was not crying or upset and she did not then and there ask to leave Silverwater Bridge. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      THE DEFENCE CASE 
       
      
    125 The appellant gave evidence in the defence case. He was the only witness in the defence case.  
     
      
    126 The appellant said that on the train journey the complainant gave her telephone number, because “she was asking for our number, then we asked her for her number”. 
     
      
    127 Over the ensuing weeks the appellant had a number of telephone conversations with the complainant. The complainant had never said not to telephone her. The appellant had not spoken to any of the complainant’s friends. 
     
      
    128 The appellant gave evidence that the meeting at the building site between the complainant and the appellant had been arranged by the complainant. 
     
      
    129 The appellant said that for a period which included 2 and 3 December 2001 the man Tyrone, whose real name was Ahmed Oueik, had the appellant’s mobile telephone and SIM card. The appellant denied that he had spoken threateningly on the telephone to any of the complainant, her brother or her friends. 
     
      
    130 The arrangements to meet at McDonald’s were made on behalf of the males by Ahmed Oueik (Tyrone).  
     
      
    131 At McDonald’s Tyrone took over the conversation. Tyrone made the proposal to go to Silverwater Bridge. Tyrone did not make any threats at McDonald’s. The appellant was aware that threats had been made by Tyrone earlier that night, in a telephone call the appellant had overheard.  
     
      
    132 The appellant said that at Silverwater Bridge the complainant and Andrea had got out of the car in which the women had travelled. There was talk about Andrea and a birthday kiss for her. 
     
      
    133 The appellant’s evidence then continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Then I go to (the complainant),’Don’t I get a kiss hello’. She goes, ‘not in front of anyone’. 
         
         . . .  
         
        Then her friends go then, ‘why don’t youse go for a walk’. So we went for a walk’. 
         
         . . . 
         
        We went.. ‘two minute walk’ 
         
        …I had… my arm around her waist, and we were walking”. 
        
       
      
    134 The appellant denied that he had been forcing the complainant in any way. When the complainant and the appellant got to the vicinity of the tree, they were talking. The appellant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Then we started kissing. Then her friends drove past” 
         
         . . .  
         
        “They stopped the car, and we went and spoke to them”. 
         
        . . . 
         
        “They were saying they were going to Macca’s, and they are going to go and get money”. 
         
        . . .  
         
        “She goes, ‘Okay’”. 
         
         . . .  
         
        “We went back to where the cars were parked. 
         
         . . .  
         
         “…we went for a walk again in the opposite direction”. 
         
         . . .  
         
         “She was saying, ‘let’s go for another walk’”. 
        
       
      
    135 The appellant denied that he had hold of the complainant in any way. The appellant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Went under the bridge next to the park” 
         
         . . .  
         
         “And we sat there, and I asked her, ‘do you want to have sex’. She goes, ‘Yes’”. 
        
       
      
    136 The appellant said that the complainant herself pulled her own clothing down. The appellant denied that he was holding on to the complainant’s wrists. The appellant then had sexual intercourse with the complainant. The appellant denied that the complainant had said anything to him like “don’t do this”. The appellant denied that he had kissed or bitten the complainant on the neck. The appellant, at the complainant’s request, withdrew and ejaculated on the ground. 
     
      
    137 The appellant gave evidence that, after he and the complainant had dressed, the complainant proposed a race between them back to the cars. The appellant denied that there had been any second act of intercourse. When the appellant and the complainant got back to the cars, the complainant was “fine” and “happy”. 
     
      
    138 The appellant gave evidence that everyone used the marijuana which had been acquired, apart from himself and Alison. The complainant used some of the marijuana and was giggling for the rest of the night. 
     
      
    139 The complainant went off with Tyrone, not under any compulsion, and returned after about half an hour. Tyrone told the appellant that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant.  
     
      
    140 The complainant went off with Hussein, not under any compulsion. When the complainant came back, she was laughing with her hands around her neck. The appellant could see red marks on her neck. Hussein told the appellant that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant. 
     
      
    141 The complainant then went off with either Mark or Andrew. Afterwards the complainant went off with the other one of Mark and Andrew. 
     
      
    142 The appellant denied that he had asked one of the other women to have sex with him. The appellant said that it was Hussein who took the women’s telephones and CD’s. The appellant denied that he had called out to the women as the males’ car was leaving. The appellant said that he was not aware that Hussein had taken the telephones and the CD’s, until he was half way home. The appellant denied that he had taken the keys to Alison’s car and thrown them away. 
     
      
    143 I turn now to the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – The trial judge erred by failing to discharge the jury as a consequence of prejudicial media publicity concerning the appellant published during the course of the trial 
       
      
    144 On 18 August 2003, the fourth day of the trial, an article was published on page 17 of the Daily Telegraph newspaper. The article was headed “Daring Life of Crime Finally Faces Justice”. The article included a picture of a person, not being the appellant, named Mahamad Alameddine, holding a pistol. In the article Mahamad Alameddine was described as a high ranking member of a gang of criminals who had carried out a number of robberies. “Ahmed Hawat” is named three times in the article as being a member of the same criminal gang as Mahamad Alameddine. 
     
      
    145 On 19 August 2003 counsel for the appellant at the trial applied for a discharge of the jury on the grounds that the publication of the article would prejudice a fair trial for the appellant. The Crown prosecutor said that he did not oppose, or support, the application. Counsel for the appellant at the trial said that, if his application for a discharge of the jury was refused, he would not seek any direction specifically referring to the article, because any such direction would make the matter worse. On 19 August the trial judge decided not to discharge the jury, without immediately giving any reasons for his decision. 
     
      
    146 On 20 August 2003 counsel for the appellant at the trial renewed the application for a discharge of the jury. On the previous day, when the Crown case had closed, the trial judge had given the jury a Prasad direction but the jury had declined the opportunity of bringing the trial to an early end by returning verdicts of not guilty. On 20 August a police officer of Lebanese extraction gave evidence on the voir dire that the name “Hawat” is a common Lebanese name. 
     
      
    147 On 20 August the trial judge gave a judgment refusing the application for a discharge of the jury. In his judgment the trial judge said that his reasons for not discharging the jury the previous day included the “perhaps impermissible” reason that the jury might themselves decide to put an end to the trial after the close of the Crown case. However, that had not happened. 
     
      
    148 The reasons the trial judge proceeded to give in his judgment of 20 August included the ability of jurors to comply with a trial judge’s directions to put out of their minds irrelevant considerations, that there was no indication that any member of the jury had read the article or, if they had, that they had noted that the name of a member of the criminal gang was the same as the name of the appellant and that, according to the evidence, the name Hawat is a common Lebanese name and the name Ahmed is also a common Lebanese name. 
     
      
    149 On this appeal it was submitted by counsel for the appellant (but not very strongly) that the article published in the Telegraph was so prejudicial that the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion whether to discharge the jury had miscarried and that the trial judge’s decision not to discharge the jury had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    150 I do not consider that the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion or that the omission to discharge the jury gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. The article was published on an inside page (p 17) of the newspaper. The picture in the article was not a picture of the appellant. The appellant was not the focus of the article; the focus of the article was Mahamad Alameddine. The references to “Ahmed Hawat” were not conspicuous. Both the name Ahmed and the name Hawat are common Lebanese names. The article referred to different sorts of offences from the offences for which the appellant was being tried. There was no indication from the jury that any member of the jury had read the article or made a connection between “Ahmed Hawat” and the appellant. The trial judge gave the jury a standard direction to determine all issues of fact according to the evidence presented during the course of the trial. On this appeal the Crown referred, appropriately, to the recent decision of this Court in R v Crowther-Wilkinson [2004] NSWCCA 249 especially at pars 202-208 per Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    151 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 –The trial judge failed to adequately direct the jury as to the inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant and the Crown witnesses Andrea and Alison 
       
       
      Ground 3 – The trial judge erred in his directions on hearsay evidence 
       
      
    152 No complaint relevant to either of these grounds was made at the trial, so that the appellant requires leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in respect of both grounds. 
     
      
    153 The two grounds of appeal were argued together in counsel for the appellant’s written submissions and in her oral submissions. It is, however, convenient to deal with them separately, as they are distinct grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    154 As regards ground 2, it was submitted that the trial judge had not adequately directed the jury about the inconsistencies between the evidence of the complainant on the one hand and the evidence of the witnesses Andrea and Alison on the other hand.  
     
      
    155 In his summing-up the trial judge quoted or summarised in detail the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of the appellant about what each said had happened at Silverwater Bridge. The trial judge did not summarise, and was not asked to summarise, the evidence of Andrea or of Alison.  
     
      
    156 The trial judge in his summing-up then summarised the submissions of counsel. In summarising the submissions of defence counsel his Honour referred to a submission that neither Andrea nor Alison supported the complainant’s evidence that the appellant had taken her off by force, even though, on the evidence, both of them were quite close by and would have been able to see what was happening. His Honour noted a submission by defence counsel “that in many respects the evidence of Andrea and Alison accords more with the evidence of the accused than of (the complainant), particularly when she said that it would have been apparent that she was being held against her will”. 
     
      
    157 The full text of defence counsel’s closing address is included in the appeal books and it can be seen that in a number of parts of his address counsel compared the evidence of the complainant with the evidence of the other two witnesses. The jury should have had no difficulty in following counsel’s submissions. 
     
      
    158 Accordingly, this was a trial in which counsel for the accused addressed the jury at length on inconsistencies between the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of two other Crown witnesses, the trial judge referred to these submissions in a summary way in his summing-up and was not asked by counsel for the accused to say any more. 
     
      
    159 I would refuse leave under r 4 in respect of the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    160 As regards ground 3, it was submitted that by what the trial judge said in his summing-up he had encouraged the jury to regard the statements of each of Andrea and Alison, which had been admitted into evidence as exhibits, as having a higher probative value than the oral evidence each had given in the witness box. The trial judge had not given the jury any warning about the statements, which, it was submitted were properly to be regarded as hearsay. It was submitted that each of Andrea and Alison, while not denying that she had made a statement or statements in the terms of the documents admitted into evidence, had not in her oral evidence adopted the statement or statements, that is, had not said that the contents of the statement or statements were true. 
     
      
    161 At pp 12-13 of the summing-up the trial judge said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now in this case, statements from the witnesses (the complainant), Andrea and Alison were tendered in evidence. You are entitled to use those statements as evidence of the facts stated in them. Where there is a conflict between the evidence of the witness in court and the statement of that witness you are entitled, as judges of the facts, to prefer one version over the other or to reject both versions. It is entirely a matter for you, but you may think that statements made on the very day or the day after the offence are perhaps more likely to be accurate than evidence given more than two and a half years later”. 
        
       
      
    162 On the following day the trial judge corrected what he had said by saying that the oral evidence of the witnesses had been given, not more than two and half years later, but more than one and a half years later. 
     
      
    163 Once the mistake about the length of the time which had elapsed between 3 December 2001 and the trial was corrected, there was no error in the trial judge saying what he did at pp 12-13 of the summing-up. What his Honour said could not be described as “directions”. What his Honour said was merely a suggestion about the facts, of a kind which a trial judge is quite entitled to make. In saying what he did the trial judge used cautious language (“you may think” and “perhaps”) and qualified what he said by saying “it is entirely a matter for you”. Earlier in the summing-up the trial judge had given the jury a standard direction that, if he expressed an opinion about the facts, the jury were entitled, and indeed bound, to disregard it, unless it happened to coincide with an opinion the jurors had independently formed.  
     
      
    164 It is true that the statement or statements by Andrea and Alison were hearsay evidence within the definition in s 59 of the Evidence Act. However, no warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act was required to be given with respect to the statements, because no request was made for such a warning (s 165(2)). Nor was any other kind of warning required to be given. No such warning was asked for; and that there were inconsistencies between the oral evidence and the statement or statements of each of the witnesses Andrea and Alison would have been quite obvious to the jury and was not something only within the special knowledge and experience of the courts. 
     
      
    165 Although the statements were not evidence given on oath in the courtroom and were not adopted in the witnesses’ oral evidence, each witness’ statement of 3 December 2001 had been made on the very day the offences were allegedly committed and this was a strong argument, where there was a conflict between the witness’s statement and the witness’s evidence, for preferring the statement.  
     
      
    166 Although the statements were hearsay within the definition in the Evidence Act, a number of matters which usually tend to render hearsay evidence less reliable than first hand evidence did not apply to the statements. The makers of the statements were reporting events which they had themselves witnessed, not reporting what they had been told by others, and the makers of the statements were witnesses at the trial and were available for cross-examination.  
     
      
    167 Counsel for the appellant at the trial had a forensic reason for not wishing any warning to be given about Andrea’s and Alison’s evidence, because in a number of respects he wished to rely on their evidence.  
     
      
    168 I would refuse leave under r 4 in respect of the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4(a) The trial judge erred by failing to give a warning pursuant to s 116 Evidence Act (NSW) concerning the identification evidence of the complainant. 
       
       
      Ground 4(b) The trial judge erred by failing to give a warning pursuant to s 116 Evidence Act (NSW) concerning the identification evidence of Alison. 
       
       
      Ground 4(c) The trial judge erred by failing to give a warning pursuant to s 116 Evidence Act (NSW) concerning the identification evidence of Andrea. 
       
      
    169 No application for any of these warnings was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial and, accordingly, leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required in respect of each part of this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4(a) 
       
      
    170 The evidence of the complainant in respect of which it was submitted that a warning should have been given was the evidence of the complainant that it was the appellant who, in speaking to her on the telephone on the evening of 2 December, had made the threat that, if the complainant did not come to McDonald’s, “we’ll shoot you in your house”.  
     
      
    171 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the evidence of the complainant, that it was the appellant who had uttered that threat, was evidence identifying the voice of the person who spoke to her as being the voice of the appellant and was, accordingly, “identification evidence” within the definition of that expression in Pt 1 of the dictionary at the end of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    172 In Pt 1 of the dictionary at the end of the Evidence Act “identification evidence” is defined as meaning:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        identification evidence 
         means evidence that is:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where:  
         
          
          (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed, or 
          
         
        (ii) an act connected to that offence was done, 
         
        at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time, or 
         
        (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion”. 
        
       
      
    173 It was submitted that the complainant’s evidence that the person who spoke to her was the appellant was identification evidence within the definition, as being an assertion by her that the appellant was, aurally, a person who was present at a place where an act connected to the offences for which the appellant was being prosecuted was done, at a time at which the act was done, and was an assertion based wholly or partly on what the complainant heard at that time or place. Counsel submitted that the making of the threat was an act connected to the offences for which the appellant was being prosecuted, because the making of the threat had contributed to inducing the appellant to go to McDonald’s and evinced aggression by the speaker against the complainant. 
     
      
    174 It was conceded by counsel for the appellant that no warning was required under s 165 of the Evidence Act, because no request for such a warning had been made by counsel for the appellant at the trial. However, it was contended that directions were required to be given under s 116 of the Evidence Act, which provides that, if identification evidence has been admitted, then, without the need for any request, the trial judge must give directions in accordance with s 116. 
     
      
    175 In my opinion, it is at least doubtful whether this part of the complainant’s evidence should be regarded as coming within the definition of “identification evidence”. However, even if this part of the complainant’s evidence should be regarded as coming within the definition of “identification evidence”, I would refuse leave under r 4 in respect of this ground. 
     
      
    176 By the evening of 2 December the complainant had had a number of opportunities to become familiar with the sound of the appellant’s voice and was well qualified to express an opinion about whether a voice she heard was the appellant’s. She had heard the appellant’s voice on the train journey, in the telephone conversations she had had with the appellant over a period of eight weeks and in the conversation she had had with the appellant at the building site.  
     
      
    177 The only other person who could conceivably have been speaking to the complainant in the telephone conversation was Tyrone but earlier that evening the complainant had spoken to Tyrone on the telephone and she readily distinguished Tyrone’s voice from the appellant’s voice, in that Tyrone had a deeper voice, spoke a lot more quickly and sounded angrier than the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4(b) 
       
      
    178 The evidence of Alison in respect of which it was submitted that a warning should have been given was her evidence that it was the appellant who had asked her to have sex with him and said “what if I raped you” and that it was the appellant who took and threw away the keys to her car. It was submitted that both of these pieces of evidence were “identification evidence” within the definition in the Evidence Act and, although no direction or warning had been applied for by counsel for the appellant at the trial, directions should have been given pursuant to s 116 of the Evidence Act. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that Alison had never met the appellant before the night of 2 December and submitted that Alison had made at least one false identification claim in her evidence in saying that the first male the complainant had walked off with at Silverwater Bridge was someone other than the appellant. 
     
      
    179 I do not consider that leave under r 4 should be granted in respect of this ground. 
     
      
    180 There were only five males at Silverwater Bridge on the night in question. Two of those males, the man Mark who was a Croatian and the driver, were not Lebanese. The three Lebanese males were the appellant, Tyrone and Hussein. In saying that it was the appellant who had done some act at Silverwater Bridge Alison was not required to identify the appellant out of a large or indeterminate number of other individuals but merely to be able to distinguish the appellant from Tyrone and Hussein. Alison’s evidence, both in her oral evidence and in her statements, was that it was the same male person who had sought to have sex with her and who had taken and thrown away the keys to her car. It is clear that in both incidents the male had come very physically close to Alison, in one case laying his head on her chest and in the other taking the keys out of the ignition of her car while she was in the car, and it was likely, from the very nature of the acts done, that Alison would have closely observed the person who did them. 
     
      
    181 In her statement made on 3 December 2001 Alison said that it was the same male in both incidents (pars 11 and 15 of the statement) and she gave a description of the male (par 15). In par 14 of her statement she said that she had seen the same man with the complainant at Silverwater Bridge. In par 4 of her statement of 14 August 2003 she said that it was “Ahmed” who asked if he could have sex with her and that she had subsequently seen the complainant go off with Ahmed. Even if Tyrone’s real name was also “Ahmed”, there was no evidence that Tyrone, as distinct from the appellant, had been referred to as “Ahmed” on the night of 2-3 December 2001.  
     
      
    182 Alison’s evidence that it was the appellant who had taken her car keys was supported by the evidence of the complainant and Andrea. All three of the Crown witnesses, the complainant, Alison and Andrea, whatever the other differences in their evidence, were unanimous in saying that it was the appellant who had taken Alison’s car keys and thrown them away. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4(c) 
       
      
    183 The evidence of Andrea in respect of which it was submitted that a warning should have been given was her evidence that it was the appellant who took and threw away the keys to Alison’s car. 
     
      
    184 For some of the same reasons as I have given in considering ground 4(b), I consider that leave under r 4 should be refused in respect of ground 4(c). 
     
      
    185 Andrea was not required to identify the appellant out of a large or indeterminate number of other persons but only to be able to distinguish him from two other Lebanese males. In par 30 of the statement Andrea made on 3 December 2001 she had said that it was the appellant who had removed the keys from the ignition of Alison’s car, who had asked Alison to be allowed to drive her car and who, when Alison refused to let him drive her car, had thrown the car keys away. 
     
      
    186 As I have already noted, on this matter Andrea’s evidence was in accordance with the evidence of both the complainant and Alison. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 The verdicts of guilty constituted a miscarriage of justice in that the jury ought in all the circumstances to have entertained a reasonable doubt. 
       
      
    187 The principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in determining a ground of appeal against conviction of this kind are set out in such cases as M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 622-624 (52-59) and there is no need to repeat those principles in this judgment. 
     
      
    188 Reasons advanced by counsel for the appellant why the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt were, principally, what was submitted to be (1) inconsistencies between the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of Andrea and Alison (2) inconsistencies in the complainant’s oral evidence or between the complainant’s oral evidence and the statement she had made to police and (3) inconsistencies between the evidence of the complainant and the history which Dr Crampton had recorded as having been provided to her by the complainant. It was also submitted that the complainant’s account of what had happened at Silverwater Bridge was not supported by any physical evidence. 
     
      
       
      As to (1):- 
       
      
    189 There were, undoubtedly, inconsistencies between the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of Andrea and Alison.  
     
      
    190 According to the complainant’s evidence, it would have been apparent to the other two women that the complainant was being forced to accompany the appellant, when the appellant and the complainant walked away from the group at Silverwater Bridge and the complainant said in her evidence that she screamed loudly enough for the other two women to have heard her screaming. 
     
      
    191 However, Andrea gave evidence that the complainant had been agreeable to kissing the appellant, provided it did not happen in front of the others; that when the appellant and the complainant had walked off together, the appellant had not been holding the complainant; that when the complainant had returned with the appellant, she was “fine” and showed no sign of distress or of crying; and there had been no marks on the complainant’s neck. Andrea gave evidence that the complainant had not made any complaint of having been raped, until after the women had returned to Strathfield. The complainant had been visibly upset and had cried, only after the women had returned to Strathfield. 
     
      
    192 Alison gave evidence that the complainant had gone with the appellant, apparently willingly, and that when she had returned with the appellant she appeared “fine”, she was not crying or upset and she did not then and there ask to leave Silverwater Bridge. Her clothing had “looked the same as when she walked off” and there were no grass stains or vegetation on her clothing. 
     
      
    193 Alison’s evidence was, in some respects, more consistent with the complainant’s evidence than with Andrea’s. For example, Alison said that, when the complainant had returned with the appellant, there were bruises on the complainant’s neck and that the complainant had complained of having been raped while the women were still at Silverwater Bridge. 
     
      
    194 In my opinion, it would have been open to the jury to take an unfavourable view of Andrea’s credibility as a witness. 
     
      
    195 In giving her evidence in chief Andrea repeatedly asserted that she had no recollection of some matter she was being asked about and, on the application of the Crown, she was given leave on a number of occasions to revive her recollection by referring to her statement. 
     
      
    196 The Crown prosecutor, without any objection by counsel for the appellant at the trial, described Andrea as an “unwilling witness” and later made an application for leave to cross-examine Andrea, an application which was not opposed by counsel for the appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    197 Some of the evidence Andrea had given when being examined in chief by the Crown was radically inconsistent with what she had said in par 29 of the statement she had made on 3 December 2001, that is later on the same day that the offences had allegedly occurred. In par 29 of her statement Andrea had said that, when the complainant had returned with the appellant at Silverwater Bridge, the complainant was visibly upset, she was shaking, she looked like she had been crying and there were marks on her neck. 
     
      
    198 Despite her claimed poor recollection of matters which had occurred on 2-3 December 2001, Andrea gave evidence about a number of matters which were unfavourable to the complainant, notwithstanding that they had not been included in her statement made on 3 December 2001. These matters included that the complainant had gone off with Hussein, that when the complainant had returned with Hussein the complainant had had marks on her neck and that the complainant had then gone off with Tyrone. 
     
      
    199 Furthermore, there was evidence of a plausible reason why, at a time after she made her statement but before she gave evidence, Andrea should have become antagonistic to the complainant. It is clear from the emails exhibit G that Andrea was angry with the complainant for not returning bond money which Andrea considered she was entitled to and that Andrea made a connection between her dispute with the complainant over the bond money and her giving evidence at the trial of the appellant for sexually assaulting the complainant. 
     
      
    200 It is true that, when asked by counsel for the appellant at the trial whether the dispute about the bond money would have caused Andrea to tell lies in the witness box, she replied “no”. However, the jury could have regarded as significant Andrea’s answer to the following question, an answer which was obviously not anticipated by counsel for the appellant at the trial. Andrea was asked “did you ever threaten (the complainant) that you would, in fact, tell lies against her if she didn’t pay the bond money?” to which Andrea answered “that’s correct”. 
     
      
    201 As regards Alison’s evidence, I have already remarked that there were some respects in which Alison’s evidence was more consistent with the complainant’s evidence than with Andrea’s evidence. Insofar as Alison’s evidence was inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence, it would have been open to the jury to take an unfavourable view of Alison’s credibility as a witness. Alison, like Andrea, gave evidence of a number of matters which had not been mentioned in the statement she had made to police on 3 December 2001. The evidence she gave about why she had not included anything in her statement of 3 December 2001 about the obtaining or use of marijuana was inconsistent with what she had said in a statement she had made to police on 14 August 2003, only a few days before the trial commenced. 
     
      
    202 Although Alison was not a party to the dispute about the bond money, she was referred to in the emails, one of the emails from Andrea to the complainant stated that Andrea was sending a copy of the email to Alison and Alison agreed in evidence that Andrea had told her that the complainant had taken Andrea’s bond money and would not give it back. The jury could readily have inferred that Alison had taken Andrea’s side in the dispute and that she was antagonistic to the complainant. 
     
      
       
      As to (2):- 
       
      
    203 I have earlier in this judgment in summarising the cross-examination of the complainant referred to alleged inconsistencies within the complainant’s oral evidence or between the complainant’s evidence and her statement.  
     
      
    204 As regards the principal matters relied on by counsel for the appellant on this appeal, in both her evidence and in her statement the complainant said that, after the first act of sexual intercourse, she herself had got up off the ground, so that there was no inconsistency. There was not necessarily any inconsistency in the complainant saying that she had struggled against the appellant but had not struggled to the utmost of her ability. There was an inconsistency between the complainant’s evidence and her statement as to whether her hands were being held or were free by the time the appellant had sexual intercourse with her. 
     
      
    205 It does not appear to me that such inconsistencies as there were should, of themselves, lead this Court to conclude that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about whether the appellant was guilty. 
     
      
       
      As to 3:- 
       
      
    206 Dr Crampton, a staff specialist doctor at a large hospital, who examined the complainant in an examination commencing at 8.20 am on 3 December 2001, recorded in her notes the history of the incident which the complainant gave her. 
     
      
    207 In her notes Dr Crampton stated that “Ahmed” had “vaginal intercourse” with the complainant but there is no reference in Dr Crampton’s notes to there having been more than one act of sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    208 I accept that there is an inconsistency between the complainant’s evidence and Dr Crampton’s record of what the complainant had told her. However, it would have been open to the jury to regard this inconsistency as lacking in importance. The history recorded by Dr Crampton in her notes was fairly brief and did not purport to set out a full account of what had happened at Silverwater Bridge. When on the following day 4 December 2001 the complainant made a full statement to the police, she asserted that two acts of sexual intercourse had taken place. 
     
      
    209 In considering the fifth ground of appeal I have so far dealt with reasons advanced by counsel for the appellant why the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about whether the appellant was guilty and I have concluded that the reasons advanced by counsel for the appellant would not have precluded the jury from being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. I will now refer to further reasons why, in my opinion, the fifth ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    210 In the trial of the appellant the advantage the jury had of seeing and hearing all of the complainant, Andrea, Alison and the appellant give their evidence was a considerable advantage and is, of course, an advantage this Court does not have. 
     
      
    211 It would have been open to the jury to accept, in preference to her oral evidence, what Andrea had said in par 29 of the statement she had made on 3 December 2001 that, when the complainant returned with the appellant at Silverwater Bridge, the complainant was visibly upset, was shaking, looked like she had been crying and had marks on her neck. The jury could also have accepted Alison’s oral evidence that when the complainant returned with the appellant she had bruises on her neck. 
     
      
    212 The jury could have accepted the complainant’s evidence and Alison’s evidence that the complainant made a complaint of having been sexually assaulted, before the three women left Silverwater Bridge. 
     
      
    213 It would have been open to the jury to accept evidence given by Natalie, the third person living in the house at Strathfield, who had not gone to McDonald’s or Silverwater Bridge. Natalie gave evidence that, when she saw the complainant at about 5.30 in the morning of 3 December 2001, the complainant appeared to be in shock and “it looked like she had been crying”. 
     
      
    214 There was some support for the Crown case in findings made by Dr Crampton on her examination of the complainant on the morning of 3 December 2001. Dr Crampton found bruising on the complainant’s neck, swelling of the complainant’s external genitalia and some bleeding in her genitalia and Dr Crampton expressed the opinion that “the findings on physical examination were consistent with the history given”. 
     
      
    215 It would have been open to the jury to have formed an unfavourable view of the appellant’s credibility. As the trial judge said in his summing-up in summarising some of the submissions made by the Crown, “the Crown pointed out that the accused denied everything negative about him raised in the evidence, even to the extent of denying that he threw the keys of the car away, an event which all three of the women gave evidence about”. 
     
      
    216 In my opinion, the fifth ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    217 As I consider that all the grounds of appeal against conviction should be rejected, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 18 November 2003, the respondent was charged with one count of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and committed by him on 22 July 2001 when on parole (the subject offence). On 21 January 2004, he entered a plea of guilty to this charge at the Local Court. The respondent adhered to this plea when he came before his Honour Judge Maguire in the Campbelltown District Court for sentence on 13 May 2004. 
     
      
    2 On 5 August 2004 his Honour sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment of 6 months backdated to commence 29 November 2001 and which he made wholly concurrent with sentences separately imposed upon the respondent on 17 February 2003 in Campbelltown District Court and on 14 March 2003 in Liverpool Local Court. Due to the length of those other sentences, his Honour effectively did not impose any additional penalty upon the respondent for the subject offence. As is obvious, the sentence had already expired when it was imposed.  
     
      
    3 The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the sentence imposed by his Honour pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
       
      The nature of the offence 
       
      
    4 The circumstances giving rise to the subject offence are not in dispute. For present purposes, it is sufficient to adopt the facts as set out in the Crown's written submissions with some additional material taken from the victim's tendered statement. 
     
      
    5 The victim of the offence, Srecko Parlic, had been shopping with his wife at Liverpool on Sunday 22 July 2001. When they had finished shopping, he returned to their car in the car park with her handbag while she went to the toilet. He sat in the driver's seat waiting for her and placed her handbag on the passenger seat. The respondent approached the car, opened the driver's door and threatened him with what appeared to be an empty syringe with an exposed needle. The respondent reached across and grasped the handbag, but as he was about to decamp, the victim grabbed hold of his hair and a struggle ensued. The struggle lasted for several minutes during which the respondent punched and kicked the victim to the face, body and legs. Eventually, the respondent escaped to a waiting get-away car with a purse that had fallen from the handbag containing personal items and $420. He was not identified or captured at that time. However, he lost a clump of hair during the struggle and this was DNA tested later in 2003 and found to contain DNA consistent with his DNA sample. As a result of the struggle, the victim suffered scratches and bruising to his face, a cut hand and grazed leg. Needless to say, the victim said that he was terrified of being stabbed with the syringe and was concerned that in the ensuing struggle he might have been.  
     
      
       
      The respondent's previous convictions 
       
      
    6 The respondent's criminal history commenced when he was 13 years of age and has continued until his latest incarceration. However, relevantly for present purposes, on 23 August 1996 he was sentenced in Liverpool District Court for a number of break, enter and steal offences in respect of one of which he was sentenced to a minimum term of 2 years 6 months to commence on 24 November 1998 and conclude on 23 May 2001 with an additional term of 3 years commencing on 24 May 2001 and concluding on 23 May 2004.  
     
      
    7 The respondent was duly paroled on 23 May 2001. Whilst on this parol he committed the subject offence on 22 July 2001 and two offences of robbery on 7 October 2001 and 11 November 2001 respectively.  
     
      
    8 On 17 February 2003 the respondent was sentenced by Acting Judge Andrew in Campbelltown District Court in respect of the robbery offences for each of which he received a term of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months commencing on 29 November 2001 and concluding on 28 May 2005 with a non-parole period of 18 months concluding on 28 May 2003. A number of stealing, assault and malicious damage offences committed between October and November 2001 were also taken into account on a Form 1. All the offences for which he was sentenced on 17 February 2003 were thus committed over a five week period. 
     
      
    9 On 14 March 2003 the respondent was sentenced in Liverpool Local Court in respect of some seven offences, including larceny, goods in custody and forging and uttering a false prescription. He was sentenced to seven concurrent terms of imprisonment of 6 months, also to commence on 29 November 2001.  
     
      
    10 In his remarks on sentence of 17 February 2003, Acting Judge Andrew considered that the respondent was at a cross-roads in his life and that, accordingly, the case was one in which it was appropriate to deal leniently with him upon the basis that leniency might at this stage of his life lead to reform. At that time the respondent had been assessed as suitable for the Salvation Army Bridge Program in relation to his drug problems as a consequence whereof his Honour imposed a condition on his parole that he be released to the Salvation Army Recovery Services Command under the Bridge Program at Surry Hills and that he undertake that program for 12 months or until release at the discretion of the Director of the Recovery Services Command of the Salvation Army. His Honour noted that he found special circumstances in that firstly, there were prospects of rehabilitation and, secondly, that the respondent was intellectually limited. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge's reasons 
       
      
    11 Having noted that the maximum penalty for the crime of robbery armed with an offensive weapon was 20 years, the sentencing judge observed that the respondent had in fact been released on 28 May 2003 as contemplated by Acting Judge Andrew. However he had failed to enter the Bridge Program, an important part of the sentencing regime, which that judge had imposed. Unfortunately, and notwithstanding that the respondent's reasons for not entering the program, which were accepted by the sentencing judge even though he described them as being ""complicated, silly and inadequate"", the respondent had relapsed into drug use. He was arrested on 24 July 2003 and his parole revoked with the consequence that he will now remain in custody until 9 July 2005.  
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge then noted the circumstances under which the respondent had come to be charged with the subject offence. In particular, he observed that it was not until November 2003 that a forensic procedure was conducted during which a hair sample was obtained from the respondent for cross-matching with the clump of hair which was pulled from the victim's during the struggle at the time of robbery. The DNA match having been obtained, the respondent was duly charged at which time he acknowledged his guilt. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge's reasons for the sentence he imposed are encapsulated in the following paragraph of his remarks on sentence in which the references to ""his Honour"" are references to Acting Judge Andrew: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is not his fault that his crime was not solved before he appeared for sentence on the subsequent offences. I find that if this matter had been solved before then, either the offender would have pleaded guilty and been dealt with by his Honour or it would have been included in the Form 1 schedule. Having read with care the whole of his Honour's remarks on sentence, I am of the view that had his Honour been dealing also with the matter now at hand, the considerations of totality would have resulted in a sentencing regime no different from that which his Honour in fact imposed."" 
        
       
      
    14 Accordingly, the sentencing judge approached the matter by, in effect, putting himself in the place of Acting Judge Andrew and sentencing the respondent upon the basis that the subject offence was also being dealt with at the time that the judge sentenced the respondent on 17 February 2003.  
     
      
       
      The respondent's subjective circumstances 
       
      
    15 The respondent was born on 20 July 1970 and is now 34 years of age. The sentencing judge accepted that as he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the subject offence, he had no recall of committing it. There is no doubt that he has had a miserable life having commenced substance abuse at around 10 years of age and graduating to injecting heroin by time he was 18. As a consequence, he has a lengthy criminal history having spent 11 of his adult years in gaol including 7½ of the past 8 years. A pre-sentence report suggested that he was bordering on institutionalisation.  
     
      
    16 As I have noted, upon being released on parole in May 2003, the respondent failed in his attempts to enter the Bridge Program. The sentencing judge accepted that he had attended the Salvation Army Recovery Services Command at Surry Hills on two occasions but had been turned away because he did not have the fee necessary to permit him to enter the program.  
     
      
    17 Since his return to custody in July 2003, the respondent has undergone a number of courses and programs which he has completed including the ""Enough is Enough"" anti-violence program and an anger management program. He has also received individual counselling in relation to substance abuse issues. His desire remains to enter a full time residential drug rehabilitation program upon release from gaol. Although he has been favourably assessed for admission to a 12 month program at the Westside Mission Residential Drug & Alcohol Centre at Windsor, the pre-sentence report indicates that that is not a program favoured by the Probation & Parole Service for parolees.  
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 1 : the sentence is manifestly inadequate in light of the guideline judgment in R v Henry & Ors and insufficient weight was given to the very serious aggravating feature that the offence was committed whilst on parole. 
       
      
    18 It is not in dispute that the sentencing judge did not refer to this Court's guideline judgment in R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 in his remarks on sentence. In that case, the Chief Justice (at 380 [162] and [165]) stated that for an offence of robbery with an offensive weapon having the following characteristics, namely,  
     
      
       
      (i) young offender with no or little criminal history; 
       
      (ii) weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
       
      (iii) limited degree of planning; 
       
      (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
       
      (v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shop keeper or a taxi driver; 
       
      (vi) small amount taken; 
       
      (vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case, 
       
       
      a term of imprisonment of between 4 and 5 years was generally appropriate. The Chief Justice also recognised that aggravating and mitigating factors would justify a sentence below or above that range.  
       
      
    19 Although the Crown submissions recognised the applicability of overall considerations of totality for the offences for which the respondent was sentenced by Acting Judge Andrew in February 2003, the High Court's decision in R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 required the sentencing judge in the present matter firstly, to fix an appropriate penalty for the subject offence and, secondly, to then make necessary adjustments to reflect totality. It is clear that his Honour did neither.  
     
      
    20 Furthermore, it was submitted that the sentencing judge erred when he said that in hindsight it was not for him to say that Acting Judge Andrew's optimism that the respondent was at a cross-roads in his life was misplaced by the fact that when he was released in May 2003 he had breached his parole. 
     
      
    21 Finally, it was submitted by the Crown that the sentencing judge clearly failed to take into account the fact that the subject offence was committed in July 2001 when the respondent was on parole for the offences for which he had been sentenced on 23 August 1996. It was submitted, and not contested, that that was a very serious aggravating feature as it amounted to a ""betrayal of the opportunity for rehabilitation"": R v Tran [1999] NSW CCA 109 at [15] per Wood CJ at CL. In R v Hernando [2002] NSW CCA 28 [42] the Chief Justice, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Kirby J concurred, noted with approval the following passage from the judgment of Lee J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Abadee J agreed, in R v Vranic (NSW CCA 7 May 1991 unreported) where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The commission of offences on parole demonstrates that the expectation of rehabilitation of the prisoner has not been realised and that through his own conduct the substantial mechanism designed for rehabilitation, i.e. parole, has failed to achieve its purpose. The court in such circumstances cannot proceed on the same expectation of rehabilitation that is open in other circumstances."" 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Cicekdag  
      [2004] NSW CCA 357 at [7], [52]. 
       
      
    22 The respondent quite properly did not put in issue the correctness of the foregoing submissions of the Crown. However, he submitted firstly, that the 4 and 5 year range indicated for a typical case described in Henry was subsequently said in Thompson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [161] to be applicable only where there was a late plea of guilty, whereas in the present case there was an early plea. Secondly, it was submitted that in the present case there had been significant delay and reference was made to the principles conveniently summarised in the recent judgment of McColl JA, with whom Levine and Hidden JJ agreed, in R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130 at [23]-[27]. It was submitted that although the present was not a case where delay was caused by intervening State boundaries or delays in the criminal justice system and that the respondent could not claim to have been left in an uncertain state of suspense, nevertheless there was an unexplained delay of almost two and a half years in the investigation, detection and charging of the respondent with the subject offence. Unlike the offender in Kay, the present was not a case where the respondent remained silent hoping that his association with the offence would not be detected. This was because he had no idea that he was responsible for the offence as he was in the throes of a serious drug addiction at the time it was committed. 
     
      
    23 The Crown responded to this submission by contending that the respondent did not suffer any detriment from the delay because he did not remember the offence. The respondent rejoined by submitting that he had suffered from not having the subject offence prosecuted in a timely manner to make it possible for it to have been dealt with in the same sentencing exercise as was undertaken by Acting Judge Andrew in February 2003. Accordingly, it was open to the sentencing judge in the present case to look closely at the sentences imposed by Acting Judge Andrew and to give consideration to the type of sentence that might reasonably have been expected if the subject offence had been dealt with by that judge at that time.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion the Crown submissions should be accepted. Firstly, the subject offence, even if it had been dealt with at the time that Acting Judge Andrew sentenced the respondent in February 2003, was significantly more serious than the offences in respect of which he was then sentenced. Accordingly, it would have been totally inappropriate for that offence to have been merely taken into account on the Form 1. On the contrary, if it had been dealt with at that time, it would have been the primary offence for which the respondent was sentenced.  
     
      
    25 Secondly, the offences for which the respondent was sentenced by Acting Judge Andrew involved a continuous bout of criminality over a limited period of 5 weeks, whereas the subject offence occurred some 3 months prior to the commencement of that period, was quite separate from the offences committed within that period and involved no common victims. Accordingly, in my opinion there was no inevitability that the sentence for the subject offence, had it been imposed by Acting Judge Andrew, would have been made wholly concurrent with the robbery offences for which he was sentenced at the time.  
     
      
    26 Thirdly, in my opinion the sentencing judge erred in approaching the appropriate sentence to be imposed with respect to the subject offence as if the respondent had been sentenced for that offence at the same time that Acting Judge Andrew sentenced him for the robbery offences. As will appear when dealing with Ground of Appeal 2, it should not have been dealt with in the retrospective manner that the sentencing judge adopted. The application of the principle of totality would take account of the necessity to make adjustments to reflect the earlier sentences. 
     
      
    27 Fourthly, I can see no justification for the sentence for the subject offence being other than in accordance with the guideline judgment in Henry. Even if the respondent had been sentenced in February 2003 for this offence, Acting Judge Andrew would have been obliged to apply that guideline. No basis has been advanced by the respondent to justify the failure of the sentencing judge to apply that guideline when he sentenced the respondent in August last. Given the fact that at the time of the offence the respondent was on parole, was not a young offender and had a lengthy and depressing, criminal record, to impose a sentence of 6 months was as offensive to public confidence in the criminal justice system as it was manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    28 Accordingly, in my opinion, this ground of appeal is made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 2 : his Honour was in error and his application of the principle of totality both as to the term of the sentence and by backdating it to 29 November 2001. 
       
      
    29 This ground of appeal overlaps with the first ground. Nevertheless, notwithstanding that there will be some repetition of matters already referred to, I will deal with it separately.  
     
      
    30 The Crown submits that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence which he believed would have been imposed by Acting Judge Andrew had the matter been before him in February 2003 having regard to the principle of totality. Alternatively it was submitted that his Honour has imposed a sentence which was apparently designed not to disturb Acting Judge Andrew's sentencing having regard to the principle of totality.  
     
      
    31 The Crown submits that in so approaching the matter, the sentencing judge erred in a number of respects. Firstly, he erred by failing to acknowledge that the subject offence was more serious than those with which Acting Judge Andrew was dealing. As I have already observed, the maximum penalty for the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon is 20 years imprisonment whereas the maximum penalty for the offence of robbery is 14 years imprisonment. Furthermore, the subject offence would clearly have been dealt with as the primary offence even if it had been charged at the time of the later 2001 offences and, therefore, according to Pearce, would have required separate consideration.  
     
      
    32 Secondly, the Crown submits that the subject offence was committed three months prior to the group of offences committed over a five-week period with which Acting Judge Andrew was dealing. Accordingly, the principle of totality did not necessarily require that any sentence imposed for the former be made wholly concurrent with those imposed for the latter or, more accurately, that the sentences imposed for the latter be made wholly concurrent with that imposed for the former. The circumstances justified some accumulation of sentences even if the subject offence had been before the judge in February 2003. Furthermore, even if categorised as part of a series of offences or one bout of criminality, the victim of the subject offence was not a victim of the other offences and, therefore, it was necessary for the total sentence to reflect that fact and be sufficient having regard to the usual principles of deterrence, rehabilitation and denunciation: see R v Cotter [2003] NSW CCA 273 at [69] where Hulme J said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It may fairly be said that the two offences by each offender were but incidents of one bout of criminality but where the offences involved different victims and each of whose lives have been detrimentally affected to significant degree by that criminality, the total sentence should reflect that fact."" 
        
       
      
    33 Again, in R v KM [2004] NSW CCA 65, Miles AJ with whom Santow JA and James J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""55 …In particular, whilst the totality principle is familiar enough and applied commonly enough in favour of an offender in order to avoid an excessive or crushing punishment, it is not to be disregarded for the converse purpose of assessing whether the overall effect of the sentences is sufficient having regard to the usual principles of deterrents, rehabilitation and denunciation. 
        
       
       
        
        56. In particular, when there is a series of offences, some committed on one victim, others committed on another victim, there is special need to ensure that concurrency of sentence does not gloss over that feature, a point made by Hulme J in  
        Cotter 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    34 It was next submitted by the Crown that it was erroneous for the sentencing judge to conclude that the matter should have been before Acting Judge Andrew and, in effect, to attempt to deal with it as if it had been. It was submitted that the proper approach was to deal with the matter as it was presented at the time. The principle of totality would operate to require regard to be had to the fact that the respondent was serving an existing sentence and the overall effect of that custody, together with any additional sentence to be imposed for the subject offence, would need to be considered.  
     
      
    35 Accordingly, it was submitted that the approach adopted by his Honour has had the effect that the respondent has not been penalised at all for what was an objectively serious offence. As Sully J, with whom Carruthers AJ agreed, observed in R v Wheeler [2000] NSW CCA 34 at [34]-[37], there is a need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice, and that this is a countervailing factor to the principle of totality necessary to ensure that any perception that there is not that much to choose between a person who commits one or two offences and a person who commits six or seven offences is not permitted to take hold.  
     
      
    36 As I read the written submissions of the respondent, and as was frankly acknowledged by Mr Hulme SC in oral argument, he does not seek to meet the Crown's submissions head on. Rather, he submits that on the basis of the principle of totality which the Crown accepts as being a relevant consideration, the appropriate question for this Court to pose for itself is: what is the least amount of additional imprisonment that should have been imposed upon the respondent for the armed robbery offence? A number of scenarios were then posited, all of which involved the imposition of an additional non-parole period that would expire on or about 9 July 2005 when the respondent currently becomes entitled to be released.  
     
      
    37 In my opinion, the Crown's submissions should be accepted as demonstrating that the sentencing judge committed appealable error. It is clear that the sentence of six months backdated to 29 November 2001 was idiosyncratic and manifestly inadequate given the errors that have been exposed. It was, with respect, a token sentence for what was, objectively, a very serious offence. 
     
      
    38 Although I am conscious of the necessity to avoid a result which may be in the nature of double jeopardy and of this Court's residual discretion not to intervene and proceed to re-sentencing even if error be shown, I do not consider that either fairness or justice to the respondent in the particular circumstances require that that discretion be exercised: R v Hernando (2002) 136 A Crim R 451 at 459-460 [18]-[19]. Quite properly the respondent did not contend to the contrary. Accordingly, the sentence below should be quashed and the respondent re-sentenced. 
     
      
       
      Re-sentencing of the respondent 
       
      
    39 The principles which apply to a Crown appeal are well known and have been recently stated by Hoeben J, with whom Grove and James JJ agreed, in R v Cicekdag [2004] NSW CCA 357 at [33]. In particular, I bear in mind that where the Court substitutes its own sentence for a manifestly inadequate sentence, the former will generally be less than that which should have been imposed and in any event towards the lower end of the available range.  
     
      
    40 In determining an appropriate sentence for the subject offence, I take into consideration the guideline judgment in Henry, as well as the aggravating factors in the present case that firstly, the respondent is not a young offender with little or no criminal history but a mature one with a substantial history and, secondly, that the subject offence was committed whilst the respondent was on parole. On the other hand, the guideline judgment of four to five years assumes a late plea of guilty whereas the respondent's plea of guilty was an early one with consequent greater utilitarian value. Taking these factors into account but selecting a starting point at the lower end of the range, in my opinion an appropriate starting point would be 4 years imprisonment which I would discount by 25% to take into account the utilitarian value of the respondent's plea of guilty as well as the remorse which the respondent has shown, giving a full term sentence of 3 years. 
     
      
    41 Given the subjective circumstances to which reference has been made and taking into account the desire of the respondent to reform himself and to undertake a full time residential drug and alcohol program when released to parole as contemplated in the affidavit of Ms Stella Calomeris sworn 25 November 2004, I would set a non-parole period of 2 years. His attendance at such a program should be a condition of any parole. 
     
      
    42 The more difficult question is: should that non-parole period expire, as the respondent submits, on 9 July 2005 or, as the Crown submits, at some later point of time? In support of his submissions the respondent notes that at present he is serving out the full sentence of 3 years 6 months imposed on him by Acting Judge Andrew due to his breach of the condition of his parole when he was released to parole at the expiry of the 18 month non-parole period on 28 May 2003. This notwithstanding, it would be open to the respondent to apply for parole at any time after the disposition of this appeal and, so he contends, there is no reason to believe that he would not have reasonable prospects of parole being granted given his achievements whilst in custody and manifest desire to reform himself. 
     
      
    43 The respondent therefore submits that he will be deprived of this opportunity if he is now sentenced for the subject offence and a non-parole period expiring on or prior to 9 July 2005 is imposed. Accordingly, he submits that this deprivation would, in the circumstances, be sufficient to mark the public's outrage at the affront which the sentence of 6 months was likely to have engendered notwithstanding the objective seriousness of the offence for which it was imposed 
     
      
    44 In further support of this contention, the respondent pointed to the importance of encouraging his desire to rehabilitate himself and to be released as soon as possible into a full time residential program in order to achieve that objective. 
     
      
    45 I am unable to accept the respondent's submission. Firstly, there is no certainty that if the respondent applied for parole (assuming it was open for him to do so), it would be granted. Secondly, the deprivation of the opportunity to gain parole relied on by the respondent as being sufficient additional punishment for the subject offence involves a subtlety, which most members of the public as well as the victim of the offence would neither recognise nor appreciate. Thirdly, the very question that the respondent posed for this Court in his written submissions, namely, ""what is the least amount of imprisonment that should have been imposed upon the respondent for the subject offence?"" – expressly and, in my opinion, correctly, contemplates imprisonment in addition to that which he is currently serving. 
     
      
    46 Finally, an additional term of imprisonment extending beyond 5 July 2005 for a period of 6 months is, in my view, the only way that the objective seriousness of the subject offence can be given at least some recognition and the principle of personal and general deterrence and denunciation can be given effect to without offending the principle of encouraging the respondent's desire for rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    47 For the foregoing reasons, I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed and the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Maguire on 5 August 2004 quashed. 
       
       
      (3) In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years which is to be taken to have commenced on 10 January 2004 and which will expire on 9 January 2007 with a non-parole period of 2 years which is to be taken to have commenced on 10 January 2004 and which will expire on 9 January 2006, on which date the respondent shall be released on parole.  
       
      
    (4) It shall be a condition of such parole that: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the respondent be subject to supervision prescribed by the regulations under the  
        Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act  
        1999 during the period specified by those regulations, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) immediately upon release on parole the respondent is to enter into a full-time drug rehabilitation program approved by his supervising parole officer and to remain in such program for as long as that officer considers it appropriate. 
        
       
      
    48 SULLY J: I agree with Tobias JA. 
     
      
    49 HOEBEN J: I agree with Tobias JA.

     Regina v Paul DUNCAN 
      
     Regina v Adam John PERRE 
    The Appellants, Duncan and Perre, were convicted on 24 March on counts of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent (s 33 Crimes Act 1900 NSW) and affray (s 93C Crimes Act) and were sentenced on 19 August 2003. A fight had erupted between two groups giving rise to the victim being attacked by a number of assailants with poles, a machete and a wheel brace. This resulted in his permanent disability. The Appellants received sentences of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years for the s 33 offence and concurrent fixed terms of 2 years for the s 93C offences. They each bring an appeal against the convictions and seek leave to appeal against the sentence. Perre’s Appeal Against ConvictionGrounds 1-2Did His Honour’s discretion miscarry in allowing the Crown under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine the witness, Siljanoski in relation to his visual identification? Held: R v Tahere [1999] NSWCCA 170 and R v Taufua NSWCCA 11 November 1996 are distinguishable. First, in the present case, the witness had sufficient prior familiarity with the accused. Secondly, in the context of whether it would have been reasonable to have an identification parade, Perre had earlier not co-operated in an identification parade related to a connected assault from the same night. It was certain that his participation pertaining to a more serious charge would have been refused. Additionally, no objection was made at trial (see Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 199 ALR 547and R v Stanley [2004] NSWCCA 278). Appropriate directions on identification evidence generally were given to the jury. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeals Rules applies. Leave to argue this ground is refused and the appeal against conviction is dismissed. Perre’s Appeal Against SentenceGround 3 Held: There was no error in his Honour’s approach to the evidence concerning the fact that the Appellant had been drinking alcohol before the offence. While alcohol may mitigate culpability through an offender acting out of character or in affecting the deliberateness of a crime: R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 417, it is not a license to commit crime: R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381 at 387 per Tierney J. The deliberate and sustained nature of the crime suggests that the Appellant was not affected by alcohol to any great degree. Grounds 4 –6Held: There was latent error in the sentence given for the s 33 offence, being so far outside a proper exercise of legitimate sentencing discretion such that sufficient weight could not have been attached to the favourable subjective circumstances of the Appellant, including special circumstances existing relating to his age, thereby extinguishing all prospects of rehabilitation. Orders:1. Appeal against convictions dismissed;2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, but confined to the sentence for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm; 3. Appeal in respect of the sentence for the s 33 offence allowed; 4. Quash the sentence for the s 33 offence and in lieu thereof the Appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period set of 9 years. Duncan’s Appeal Against ConvictionGround 1Did his Honour correctly allow Siljanoski to be cross-examined by the Crown? Held: His Honour correctly decided that the witness, Siljanoski’s evidence was at odds with his statement within s 38(1)(b) and (c) of the Evidence Act, thereby allowing the earlier out of court statement to be received as evidence of the facts of the attack: R v GAC NSWCCA 1 April 1997. S 38(1)(a) was also available, in so far as the evidence in chief was unfavourable to the Crown (see R v Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712, R v Veleski (No 2.) (1997) 93 A Crim R 420 and R v Lozano NSWCCA 10 June 1997).His Honour did not fail to give sufficient attention to the probative and potential prejudicial effect of the evidence pursuant to s 192(2)(b), nor was he in error in not giving consideration to ss 135 and 137 when granting leave. The witness’s statement could not be considered unreliable or unfair: R v Nguyen (2002) NSWCCA 342 and R v Suteski (2002) NSWCCA 509. Moreover evidence of one witness’s identification may be properly taken into account in the context of the evidence as a whole: R v Tugaga (1994) 74 A Crim R 190 and R v Rima (2003) NSWCCA 405.Ground 2: Should evidence of questioning of the Appellant during a search of his bedroom have been admitted, in that a support person was not present pursuant to s 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987? Held: Admissibility of this type of evidence depends upon the support person being in sufficient physical proximity. If this could not be proven, then s 13(b) had to be addressed and proper and sufficient reason shown for the absence of the support person. The evidence was of little importance in the entirety of the trial. No miscarriage of justice occurred, even if there were insufficient reasons. Ground 3Was there error in his Honour not giving a warning relating to evidence of Siljanoski in his statement, and elicited in cross-examination, as to Duncan being involved in the assault? Held: The need for care was obvious to the jury. Counsel had had not sought additional directions and a comprehensive direction had been given earlier in relation to consistency and inconsistency of account and in judging witnesses. Rule 4 applies and leave should be refused. Ground 4Was there error in not giving an Edwards direction? Held: The ground that his Honour erred in his directions to the jury regarding lies has no merit, in the context of a Zoneff direction being given. Ground 5Did his Honour fail to adequately direct the jury as to specific intent and the alternative to the first count on the indictment? Held: This ground is not made good. Comprehensive directions were given in relation to joint enterprise and participation and his Honour gave a sufficient explanation of the ways that the Appellant could be held criminally responsible under the first count or the statutory alternative. The principles enunciated in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 and McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 applied. Ground 6Did his Honour fail to direct the jury with respect to the evidence of Siljanoski?Held: The ground that his Honour insufficiently directed the jury is not made good.Ground 7Did his Honour err in his directions to invite the jury to convict upon a basis apart from a proper evaluation of the evidence and its application to the ingredients for the offence? Held: His Honour’s directions were clear. This ground is not made good. Duncan’s Appeal Against Sentence Ground (a)Did his Honour make erroneous findings as to the objective circumstances of the offence such as overstating the role and objective criminality of the Appellant? Held: There was evidence supporting findings that Duncan initiated the events leading to the attack and it was properly open for his Honour to find he was an active participant. Grounds (b), (c) and (d)Held: His Honour’s findings in respect of his lack of remorse and lack of insight were correct, but understated rehabilitative aspects connected to his relatively minor record, his immaturity and youth and his otherwise favourable subjective circumstances (see Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; s 3A(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999); and R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112).Ground (e)Held: In view of the significant differences between Duncan and Lamacchia, another offender, the parity argument was not made good: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 98 A Crim R 134. Ground (f)Held: The sentence was so far outside the range of a legitimate sentencing discretion as to establish latent error. Leave to appeal is granted.Orders:1. Appeal against convictions dismissed;2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, confined to the sentence for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm, but otherwise refused;3. Appeal in respect of the sentence for the s 33 offence allowed;4. Quash the sentence imposed for that offence, and in lieu thereof sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period set of 9 years. - 96 -IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The Appellants were indicted before his Honour Judge Dodd and a jury, on 24 February 2003, upon counts of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm (s 33 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)), and affray (s 93C Crimes Act). The Appellant Duncan was also indicted upon two further counts, each of maliciously damaging property (s 195(a) Crimes Act). 
     
      
    2 On 24 March 2003 the jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to each Appellant, on the s 33 and s 93C counts. Duncan was acquitted of the two s 195(a) counts. 
     
      
    3 Each Appellant brings an appeal against the convictions and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence, which was imposed on 18 August 2003, for the s 33 offence, of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. Concurrent fixed terms were imposed of 2 years imprisonment for the s 93C offences. The maximum sentences for these offences were imprisonment for 25 years and 5 years respectively.  
     
      
       
      A. THE EVIDENCE 
       
      
    4 The evidence is somewhat complex, having regard to the manner in which the events unfolded on the night of the offences, and also having regard to the large number of young people who were called as witnesses, not all of whom gave the same account.  
     
      
    5 To some extent these witnesses fell into separate groups. As will appear from the analysis of the evidence which follows, there were:  
     
      
       
      (a) Eight people who might loosely be described as the victim and his associates, namely the victim Christopher Wilson, Daniel Wilson, Mathew Michael, Paul Beiruti, Tughlet Homeh, Snezana Tankoska, Jovana Ljubojevic, and Christina Kusonogovski (from time to time referred to as “the Sydney group”); 
       
       
      (b) Four people who were independently present at the park, Diana Petroska, Lena Ivanovska, Ahmed Kak and Joseph Mishawi; and 
       
       
      (c) The remainder, excluding police and the witnesses who were not at the park, were friends and associates of the Appellants (from time to time referred to as “the Wollongong group”). 
       
       
      The Two Groups of Young People Gather in Stuart Park 
       
      
    6 On the night of Friday 2 November 2001, the victim Christopher Wilson travelled from Sydney to Wollongong with his brother Daniel Wilson, Paul Beiruti, Mathew Michael, and Tughlet Homeh. It was their intention to meet three local girls Snezana Tankoska, Jovana Ljubojevic and Christina Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    7 After meeting in the area near the lighthouse, they decided to drive to Stuart Park, in two motor vehicles, a blue Toyota Camry owned by Jovana Ljubojevic’s father and a black Toyota Celica owned by Mathew Michael. They parked near the Old Lagoon Restaurant intending to take shelter from the rain in a hut. Daniel Wilson, Tughlet Homeh and Paul Beiruti went to the hut. Jovana Ljubojevic sat in the Celica with the other two girls.  
     
      
    8 At the same time there was a birthday party taking place at the house of Elbert Jose, in Beach Street, which was a walk away from the Park. Both of the Appellants were described by a number of witnesses, including the host, Elbert Jose, as having been present at this party.  
     
      
    9 At about 11:30 PM, by which time it was common ground that the night was dark and that it was raining, the party started to break up and some of those present walked, or drove, to an area known as “the Strip” at South Beach, which is a known gathering spot for young people in Wollongong. 
     
      
    10 The Appellant Duncan (“Babe”) travelled to Stuart Park with Zoran Mitic, Steven Siljanoski, and two girls in a green Nissan Pulsar driven by Oliver Gjoreski. 
     
      
    11 The Appellant Duncan recognised Christina Kusonogovski at the Park, and using Zoran Mitic’s mobile phone he telephoned her elder brother, Jason Kusonogovski (“Bear”). In this regards Steven Siljanoski said that, after arriving at Stuart Park with Duncan, he saw him walk across the car park to speak to a girl. He said that it was then that Duncan asked Zoran Mitic if he could borrow his mobile phone. At the trial he acknowledged having heard bits of the conversation that followed, but said that he was not sure to whom Duncan was speaking. He said in chief that he heard him tell someone to “come down to the beach”. When he was cross-examined, by leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act, he acknowledged having said to police that Duncan had said over the phone:  
     
      
       
        
        “Come down to the beach if you don’t want your sister to get raped by a pack of Lebos”. 
        
       
       
      That evidence was only admitted against Duncan. 
       
      
    12 Zoran Mitic confirmed that he had lent his phone to Duncan, and said that he did not know Jason Kusonogovski. Of some importance in relation to this evidence is the fact that the telephone call charge records record a call from Mitic’s mobile phone to Kusonogovski’s phone at 11:57, followed by a call to the phone of Chi Tam Huynh (“Big Chi”), followed by another call to Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    13 Oliver Gjoreski gave evidence that after leaving their car for a while, Duncan returned and asked him whether he had a baseball bat in his car. Gjoreski said that he had removed it. Duncan then asked if he had anything else? Gjoreski pulled his boot release handle, saying that he did not know, but that Duncan was free to check. He heard Duncan rummaging around in the boot, but was unable to say whether he saw him remove anything before walking away. He gave evidence to the effect that there had been a wheel brace in the breakdown kit in the boot (possibly more appropriately described as a tyre lever as it was about 20 cms long and L-shaped). When he examined the breakdown kit two weeks later it was missing.14 Jovana Ljubojevic and Snezana Tankoska each said that they saw Duncan talking to Christina Kusonogovski in the car before Jason Kusonogovski, and the others, arrived at the Park. Jovana Ljubojevic indicated that she had previously known him through school friends, while Snezana Tankoska said that she had known him from primary school. Jovana Ljubojevic said that while Duncan was sitting in their car, Jason Kusonogovski came over and spoke to his sister. The next thing she saw was them whispering together outside the car and then walking towards the hut where the Sydney boys had gathered. She also said that she saw another Islander there, who the Crown asserts was Sione Amone who gave evidence of walking over to the car and speaking to Christina Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    15 Christina Kusonogovski said that, while she was sitting in the car with Snezana Tankoska, her brother Jason Kusonogovski came over. He asked her for some money, told her it was late, and added that she should be getting home. She agreed that Duncan had also come to the car and spoken to her, but could not remember what he had said.  
     
      
    16 Jason Kusonogovski said that he had walked to South Beach. He confirmed that he had received a phone call from Duncan. He told him that he was looking for his sister. Duncan said that she was at South Park. He denied that Duncan had made any mention of him needing to go down to the Park if he did not want his sister to “be raped by a pack of Lebos”. He said that he rang his sister who confirmed that she was at South Park and could give him $10. He obtained a lift from Alana Ljubicic who drove him to the Park. He said that it was after he received some money from his sister who was sitting in Jovana Ljubojevic’s Toyota Camry, that he saw Duncan. 
     
      
    17 Although there were some differences in the accounts given by the various witnesses who were present, the Crown contended that at least four cars containing the people from the party, arrived at the Park. Subject to some differences in recollection, it would seem that those vehicles included a red Mitsubishi Lancer driven by Alana Ljubicic, which also contained Jason Kusonogovski, Sione Amone and Carla Busuttil; the green Nissan Pulsar previously mentioned, driven by Oliver Gjoreski; a blue Ford Laser driven by Tracey Saye; and a red Ford Laser driven by Chi Tam Huynh (“Big Chi”). It does have to be acknowledged, as I have observed, that there were inconsistencies in the evidence concerning the occupants of the various cars when they arrived at the Park. For reasons that will become obvious, of more importance was the identification of their occupants when they left the park.  
     
      
    18 There was another group of people in the Park, although independently from those previously mentioned. They were Diana Petroska, Ahmed Kak, Joseph Mishawi and Lena Ivanovska, who had travelled there in Mishawi’s Honda.  
     
      
       
      The Taking of Mathew Michael’s Phone 
       
      
    19 Mathew Michael said that as he walked away from the Sydney group to take a call on his mobile telephone, he was approached by two men (Duncan and Kusonogovski), who he described, respectively, as “Islander looking” and as “Yugoslavian or Serbian”. The latter man, he said, asked if he knew a girl Christina, and indicated that he was her brother. Michael said that the man of Islander appearance grabbed his phone and put it in his pocket. Words were exchanged including a description of the Sydney group as “fucking lebs”. He asked for the return of his phone. 
     
      
    20 Daniel Wilson said that when he heard Mathew Michael asking for his phone to be returned he went across, with Homeh and Beiruti, to see what was occurring. He saw two men standing near him, one he thought to be of Samoan or Islander appearance, and the other to be either Australian or Croatian. One of the men, who he thought to be the Samoan, whistled, after which they both walked down towards the car park. He saw about 20 “guys” waiting down there.  
     
      
    21 He said that after the man of Samoan appearance whistled, his brother Christopher joined his friends. There was swearing and words were exchanged from both sides.  
     
      
    22 Mathew Michael also said that the two men made off for the car park at some speed. They were followed by himself and his friends. He heard the Islander (Duncan) whistle to another group of males who then emerged from the car park. He estimated them to number about 15 people. 
     
      
    23 He similarly said that it was at this stage, that Christopher Wilson rejoined them. He said that he saw the Islander place the phone in a red Lancer. He heard someone from the Wollongong group, also of Islander appearance, scream, “let’s fight one on one”. 
     
      
    24 Sione Amone confirmed that it was he who had made this observation although he said his suggestion had been addressed to Duncan, who he had observed being chased. On his account he said to Duncan “why don’t you fight him one on one?” Snezana Tankoska also identified Amone as the speaker. She thought that the words had been directed at the person who was later attacked; while Carla Busuttil thought they had been directed by Amone to Duncan. Alana Ljubicic said that she saw Amone approach the ethnic looking group who had been chasing Duncan, and heard him tell them to fight “one on one”.  
     
      
    25 Jovana Ljubojevic also described hearing an argument over a phone, and seeing Duncan and Kusonogovski running from the hut and being followed by the Sydney boys down towards the car park. She also recalled hearing Duncan whistle.  
     
      
    26 Snezana Tankoska provided a similar account, and said that she had been able to recognise a number of the people who had gathered in the area where the two groups come together, including Sione Amone, Jap, Big Chi, Elbert Jose and Jason Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    27 Steven Siljanoski acknowledged seeing Duncan walking back towards the car park followed by some males, and also recalled hearing someone calling out “give me back my phone”.  
     
      
    28 Hayley Girgin who was still seated in Big Chi’s red Laser, described hearing someone calling out “give my phone back” followed by Sione Amone saying “Do you want to fight one on one?” 
     
      
    29 Jason Kusonogovski gave an altogether different account. He said that after getting some money from his sister he walked up the hill towards the group of men in the hut, followed by Duncan. Once there he said he was surrounded by these men, one of whom grabbed his shirt. He introduced himself as Christina’s brother, and said that he did not “want any trouble”. They asked him why he had walked up to them and whether he “wanted to start anything”. He repeated that he did “not want any trouble” and walked off. He said that they then pursued him back down the hill. He claimed not to see what Duncan was doing. He said that he walked across the car park and past Alana Ljubicic’s car and then hid where there was another hut and some bushes.  
     
      
       
      The Red Lancer is Driven Furiously Around the Park by Duncan 
       
      
    30 Alana Ljubicic said that Duncan made his way back to her red Lancer, and clambered into the driver’s seat after instructing her to move over. He began to drive the vehicle around the Park at speed, and in different directions, while, according to her, the other guys were trying to smash it with bottles.  
     
      
    31 She said that he had driven her car toward the lagoon, and then over towards the Novotel, and had been swerving the vehicle in an attempt to avoid the bottles. After parking the vehicle, she said, he got out and walked away.  
     
      
    32 Steven Siljanoski similarly said that when Duncan got into the car, it was surrounded by six to seven men of Lebanese appearance, who started smashing it with bottles. It was because of this, he said, that Duncan had driven it forwards and backwards. Sione Amone however said that Duncan had jumped into the car after being chased by three guys. He did not recall seeing any bottles being thrown at this vehicle at that stage, and confirmed that he saw Duncan swerving the car towards the people who had been pursuing him.  
     
      
    33 Mathew Michael, Snezana Tankoska, Hayley Girgin, Carla Busuttil, Freda Iordanidis, Zoran Mitic, Jovana Ljubojevic, and Sione Amone all confirmed that it was Duncan who had climbed into, and driven the vehicle around the Park after he had been pursued back to the car park by the Sydney group. They described him driving towards people, swerving in their direction and, on Mathew Michael’s account, doing wheelies, burnouts, spins and reversing the vehicle, causing people to jump out of the way.  
     
      
    34 Daniel Wilson and Tughlet Homeh each described having to move to avoid being struck. Homeh admitted to having smashed a bottle on the vehicle. He also thought that Daniel Wilson had thrown a bottle at it.  
     
      
    35 Snezana Tankoska said that Duncan brought the car to a stop near the entrance to the cricket oval. Zoran Mitic said that while Duncan had been driving the car backwards and forwards, bottles were being thrown at it, and it was being struck by someone with a wheel brace. Steven Siljanoski also described seeing people surrounding the car and hitting it with bottles before Duncan drove it away. He lost sight of him after he stopped the car. Freda Iordanidis also said that she saw the man who had been arguing with Duncan “smashing at” the Lancer. At that point she said Big Chi told Jose Elbert to move his car away. Jose then took his car down near the Lagoon.  
     
      
    36 Oliver Gjoreski said that it was shortly after Duncan had looked into the boot of his car, that he saw him returning to the car park area followed by six more men of Lebanese or European appearance. He heard an argument about a phone and saw Sione Amone trying to settle things down. Then he said that bottles started to be thrown on the road. Next, he said, Duncan got into a red Lancer, which he quickly accelerated and reversed. He also said that a scuffle was taking place at the time between the various people who had gathered near the car park. At that point, he said, he yelled out to his friends “hurry up. Let’s go”. Zoran Mitic and Siljanoski and another male, who had a bleeding hand, jumped into his car and he then drove off.  
     
      
    37 Anthony Quach similarly said that he heard yelling about a phone and saw people coming down the hill. He heard Alana Ljubicic scream at someone to get her out of her car, which was being driven backwards and forwards, while it was being hit with bottles and a wheel brace. It stopped eventually on the lagoon side of the park.  
     
      
    38 Hayley Girgin said that while Duncan was driving the car around the park, she walked across to Tracey Saye’s blue Laser. She noticed Sione Amone and Adam Perre also standing there.  
     
      
    39 Tracey Saye said that after seeing Paul Duncan being chased down the hill by a group of ethnic people, and hearing yelling about a phone, she saw a group of people gathering in a horseshoe at the back of Alana Ljubicic’s car and heard Sione Amone saying words to the effect “we don’t want a brawl, just one on one”. It was then that she saw Duncan driving Ms Ljubicic’s car, while the Lebanese group threw their bottles and pieces of wood at it.  
     
      
       
      The Fight Erupts 
       
      
    40 It is convenient first to note the evidence of the Sydney group.  
     
      
    41 Daniel Wilson said that after the red Lancer was driven away, he saw a man of Asian appearance (on the Crown case Chi Tam Huynh or “Big Chi”) open the boot of a vehicle and pull out machetes, baseball bats and trolley poles. At that point “all hell broke loose”. He said that he threw a bottle that he had in his hand toward the crowd, and together with his friends he ran up towards the hut pursued by the Wollongong group.  
     
      
    42 He also said that when the weapons were produced, he heard one member of the Wollongong group yell out “you Lebbos – get out of here”. He said, as did Mathew Michael, that as his group ran away, the victim Christopher Wilson became separated from the others. He was next seen by him to have been caught up near the barbeque area, where he became the victim of a savage attack, being struck with a machete and other implements, repeatedly to the head and body. He was also kicked and punched.  
     
      
    43 Mathew Michael said that after the red car had stopped driving around, he saw a group of young men coming towards his group with weapons in their hands, which he described as machetes, club locks, bats and wooden poles. He saw Beiruti being kicked and punched. He said that his group ran back towards the huts and the Lagoon Restaurant. When they arrived they realised that Christopher Wilson was missing.  
     
      
    44 He then described seeing an Asian man beating a man down, and other people hitting and kicking him. They were about 100 metres away. The man striking the victim on the head, he said, had a wheel brace in his hand.  
     
      
    45 Paul Beiruti also described seeing a large group of males approach them from the car park. He said that he fell to the ground and was kicked, punched and hit with a baseball bat carried by an Asian guy. He saw one male with a wheel brace. He managed to get away and to join his friends. He added that when they realised that Christopher Wilson was missing, his group armed themselves with garden pickets and ran back to where they had last seen him. He acknowledged having used one of these pickets to strike the rear window of the red Lancer. He identified, via some photographs, the injuries which he sustained.  
     
      
    46 Tughlet Homeh said that, after hearing Mathew Michael ask for the phone back, and hearing the Islander who had been arguing with him whistle, he saw about eight men walking towards them, with other males jumping out of cars. He said that Beiruti dragged him out of the way of the red Lancer as it was heading towards him. It was being driven, he said, by the Islander who had whistled. After hearing another Islander suggesting that they fight one to one, he noticed weapons being taken from the cars, including the club lock and a spanner. The islander had the club lock and the Asian had the spanner. The man with the club lock he said was not Sione Amone.  
     
      
    47 He said that, when his group began to run back towards the car park with the garden poles, the other group drove off in their cars. When he reached the car park he noticed the victim lying on the ground and he heard a girl crying.  
     
      
    48 On the following night he made an identification, from a group of photos, of the man who had whistled and had driven the red Lancer. He made a further identification on 20 April 2002. The Crown concedes that it was Sione Amone that he identified. On its case that had been a mistaken identification of Duncan. Each of these men was in fact of Islander appearance.  
     
      
    49 Jovana Ljubojevic said that after she heard Mathew Michael requesting the return of his phone, and Duncan whistle, she and the victim had left her car and made their way towards the hut. About half way there she saw her friends running towards the car park. It was after Duncan had been driving the red car around, that she saw “Jap” (Chi Bin Nguyen) take a machete out of the boot of the car. She said that she saw him swing the machete at the victim. The next thing she saw was the victim surrounded by a group of people who were armed with bats and poles. She said that she only recognised “Jap” who, at this time, had a metal pole, which he was using to hit the victim over the head repeatedly. Others in the group she said were also hitting him with poles and a bat before walking away. Three of them however came back and kicked him a few more times before leaving. 
     
      
    50 Snezana Tankoska also said that she saw “Jap” swing a machete at the victim, who ran towards the shed near the old restaurant, but was struck down before he got there, being surrounded by twenty or so people who were hitting and kicking him.  
     
      
    51 Christina Kusonogovski said that when she saw people running around and fighting, she moved away from the cars over towards the Novotel. The next thing she noticed was Jovana Ljubojevic’s car being smashed.  
     
      
    52 It is next convenient to deal with the evidence of the Wollongong group who had been at the party.  
     
      
    53 Sione Amone said that Big Chi took a machete out of the boot of his red Laser and gave it to Jap. At that point, he said, he tried to take the machete off Jap to stop him, succeeding only in cutting his finger. The injury he said was attended to by Tracey Saye, who had a beach towel in the back of her car. He said that he then remained near the car with Tracey Saye and Carla Busuttil.  
     
      
    54 He also said that he saw Duncan and the others chasing “a guy” back towards the barbeque area. He next saw a person on the ground with three or four persons standing over him, and hitting him with something. He recognised that the persons included Big Chi, Jap, and “some of the Massos” (Macedonians and Serbians). He agreed that he had not noticed anything in Duncan’s hand while he had been chasing the guy. He said that he saw another man, who he thought was Zelco, with a metal bar and Big Chi with a baseball bat running behind Jap.  
     
      
    55 He described seeing Duncan, Big Chi and Jap up in the area where the Sydney group had left their cars, smashing those cars. Although he said in chief that Duncan was kicking the cars, in cross-examination he withdrew that answer. He said that he, along with Carla Busuttil and Jason Kusonogovski, jumped into Alana Ljubicic’s red Lancer and left. As they did so the rear window was smashed after being struck twice. Duncan, he said, was standing near the other vehicles when they left.  
     
      
    56 He acknowledged having been charged over the assault, but said that the charge was later withdrawn. He admitted having told the police a lie about not having been to the park, when interviewed by them, and having offered Carla Busuttil as an alibi witness. The reason he said was because he was scared and wanted to stick up for his friends. 
     
      
    57 However, on 6 November 2001, he spoke again to police and provided answers to questions concerning the events in the park. He acknowledged having told police a lie on this occasion in so far as he had explained the cut on his finger as having occurred when he pushed out the broken rear window of Alana Ljubicic’s car, because he did not think they would have believed that it occurred when trying to disarm Jap.  
     
      
    58 Carla Busuttil said that she also saw Duncan running up towards the grassed area, chasing some people, after bringing the red Lancer to a stop.  
     
      
    59 She then saw “Big Chi” open the boot of his red Laser and take out a machete which he gave to “Jap”. They then ran off towards the grassed area. Elbert Jose moved Chi’s car, as did Alana Ljubicic. Carla said that she walked over to where Ljubicic’s car was parked. She saw people fighting in the grassed area, using pieces of wood or sticks, and kicking a person on the ground. She saw Jap swinging the machete in the air as he ran towards the grassed area. After that she got into Alana Ljubicic’s car together with Jason Kusonogovski and Sione Amone. 
     
      
    60 While Alana Ljubicic was yelling out for Duncan to join them, she saw that there were four people left in the grassed area: the victim who was lying on the ground, Duncan, Big Chi and Jap. Jap was hitting the man with the machete, Duncan was punching him and kicking him in the stomach, and then, on her account, he took the machete from Jap and struck the victim with it. The next thing she saw was Big Chi smashing windows of the cars and jumping on top of them. He was joined by Jap who also kicked and struck the cars. He was later joined by Duncan who similarly struck the cars. Big Chi ran to his red Laser, followed by Jap and finally by Duncan. The driver she said was Elbert Jose. As Ljubicic’s vehicle drove off it was struck from behind by someone, shattering the rear window.  
     
      
    61 Similarly to Amone, she acknowledged having given police a false account when interviewed by them on 3 November. On 5 and 25 November she provided further information to police in the form of an interview and statement, which she said had been truthful. Although she did acknowledge giving an explanation to the effect that the cut on Amone’s finger occurred while he was washing up, she said that at the time she had believed this to be the case, as she had seen him cut his hand on a broken glass in the sink.  
     
      
    62 She acknowledged having been Sione Amone’s girlfriend as at 2 November 2001, and said that their relationship was continuing. She denied that Amone had been involved in the fight, saying that he had remained with her between the time that he had told Duncan to fight them “one on one” until they had left the area.  
     
      
    63 She also denied having placed Duncan in the place of Amone in relation to the fight, and confirmed that Amone’s clothes had not been covered in blood. She had initially lied to police, she said, because she had been confused and scared of getting Amone and herself into trouble and of dobbing other people in.  
     
      
    64 Hayley Girgin also described seeing “Jap” with a machete in his hands, standing beside the man on the ground, along with eight or ten men who were kicking and hurting him, although in cross-examination she appeared to be less certain as to what precisely was occurring. She said that she did not recognise the people involved other than Jap.  
     
      
    65 She also gave evidence of Sione Amone receiving assistance for a cut to his hand. Additionally, she said, she had not seen him involved in any of the fighting.  
     
      
    66 Tracey Saye said that after Duncan had driven off in the red Lancer, she saw Sione Amone come over to her car with a cut on his hand. She took an old beach towel out of her boot and wrapped it around his head. While the boot was open, she said, Adam Perre came over, and took from it a wooden leg, which she had previously broken off from a “For Sale” sign. He then ran over to where the fight was taking place. She said that she heard people yelling and screaming and saw Perre hitting the boy on the ground with the piece of wood that he had taken from her car “like a cricket bat – just hitting.” 
     
      
    67 She said that she had not seen Duncan at the park after he had earlier got into Alana Ljubicic’s car and driven off in it. When that vehicle later drove off she confirmed seeing the boys of Lebanese appearance hitting it with bottles and sticks.  
     
      
    68 She agreed that she had not seen any blood on Duncan’s person or clothing at the house when the Wollongong group later gathered.  
     
      
    69 It was her evidence that she had driven Hayley Girgin, Adriano Karuso, Adam Lamacchia, and Anthony Quach from Stuart Park.  
     
      
    70 Although Alana Ljubicic initially said in chief that she had not seen Duncan after he had left the car, when she was cross-examined by the Crown by leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act, she acknowledged having told police (Detective Pamozzo) on 3 November 2001 that she had seen a number of fights breaking out in which Duncan and Jap had been involved. She said that what she had told police would have been true, although she did not now remember it.  
     
      
    71 In cross-examination she indicated that she could not fix any particular fight in which Duncan was seen by her to be a participant. Rather she was referring to the whole situation, pointing out that she had not actually seen the assault on the young man who was injured.  
     
      
    72 She also said that she sat in her car, which she had moved back from where Duncan had left it, while the fight was occurring. She recalled seeing Duncan jump into Big Chi’s car, which then drove off. Sione Amone, she said, got into her car together with Carla (Busuttil) and Jason Kusonogovski. As they were leaving, someone smashed the back window of her car. Sione Amone, she noticed, had cut his finger. He explained that he had been trying to take the knife off someone.  
     
      
    73 Jason Kusonogovski denied being involved in the fight that left the victim injured. He said that, while hiding on the other side of the park, he could hear yells and swearing and saw people running around but could not otherwise see what was happening. He eventually went back to Alana Ljubicic’s car and asked her to leave the area, as he was scared. She drove off. He was sitting in the back seat when the window was smashed by someone with a pole. He confirmed that the other occupants were Carla Busuttil and Sione Amone.  
     
      
    74 Steven Siljanoski said that after Duncan stopped the car “everything was just mayhem” with people running around and ending up on the grass near the beach. He remained near Gjoreski’s car, hiding behind it. He initially said that although he saw someone on the ground being hit with branches and perhaps a pole, he did not recognise any of the members of the group of three or four persons. He also said that when Oliver Gjoreski called out that it was time to go, he and Mitic jumped into Gjoreski’s car, followed by someone he did not know who had blood on his fist. As they left he saw Big Chi smashing one of the vehicles of the Sydney group.  
     
      
    75 He was cross-examined pursuant to leave given under s 38 of the Evidence Act and admitted to having made a statement to police, which he agreed he had read before signing it, and which he also agreed had been made to the best of his knowledge at the time.  
     
      
    76 In that statement, he accepted, he had told the police that he saw Duncan and Perre in the group of men who were hitting and kicking the victim. He said that he had seen someone with blonde hair in the group, and according to him the detective asked him if that had been Adam Perre. That led him to ask if Perre had blonde hair? The detective, he said, replied in the affirmative, even though Perre had black hair. He had also said that he had to wear glasses when he drove and that he could not see 100 percent.  
     
      
    77 When asked at the trial as to the extent of his knowledge of Perre, he said that “he didn’t really know him but he just knew the name.” He would not say they were friends but he “knew who he was”.  
     
      
    78 When cross-examined by defence counsel he reverted to saying that he could not now be certain that Duncan and Perre were members of the group who were attacking the victim.  
     
      
    79 Zoran Mitic said that he had been taken to the park in Oliver Gjoreski’s green Pulsar, and had hidden behind Oliver Gjoreski’s car while Duncan was driving the Lancer around. When he re-emerged he saw a man on the grass up near the beach being kicked and punched, but could not recognise those involved. He said that he left the area in Gjoreski’s vehicle, with Steven Siljanoski and someone else who he did not recall, who was holding his hand. They drove to the JJ Kelly Park. There, he said, he saw Duncan.  
     
      
    80 There was no suggestion made of Duncan having phoned him for a lift from the park, or of him driving Duncan away.  
     
      
    81 Oliver Gjoreski said that when he saw people scuffling and bottles being thrown, and the Lancer driving around, he called out to Mitic and Siljanoski “hurry up, hurry up, let’s go”. They joined him in his car, followed by someone who was dark, and who had blood on his hands, whom he did not know. He knew Duncan who had driven from Elbert Jose’s party to the park.  
     
      
    82 The person with blood on his hand, who got into this vehicle, the Crown asserted, was Adam Lamacchia.  
     
      
    83 Elbert Jose who acknowledged having had a fair bit to drink, said that he had been sitting in Big Chi’s car, sleeping while the fight occurred. He acknowledged hearing bottles breaking and people yelling. When he was woken up, he drove Big Chi’s vehicle toward the Novotel but then got out and someone else drove. He recalled its occupants being Big Chi, Frieda Iordanidis, Adam Perre and another person who he could not recall. He claimed not to have seen Duncan at the park or in the car.  
     
      
    84 Frieda Iordanidis said that after she noticed “Big Chi” smashing a car, she asked Elbert Jose to drive his car back to pick him up. She said that Big Chi, “Jap” and Perre got into his red Laser, in which she was sitting, followed finally by Duncan. Jose drove part of the way and was then replaced by Big Chi as driver. Alana Ljubicic also said that she saw Duncan jump into Chi’s car as she left.  
     
      
    85 Anthony Quach said, in cross-examination, that at the time that the two groups were yelling at one another and after the Lancer had been driven around, he saw people getting “stuff” out of the boot of a car, including a wheel brace.  
     
      
    86 Iannis Mellos said that he had not been involved in the fight, but indicated that he had seen “Jap” fighting a man.  
     
      
    87 Finally, reference may be made to the group of people who had not been to Elbert Jose’s party and who had independently arrived in the park.  
     
      
    88 Joseph Mishawi did not identify any of the assailants, but confirmed seeing someone being hit on the grassed area with poles by about three people. They then ran past his car. The next thing he saw was a red car leaving.  
     
      
    89 Ahmed Kak said that he had arrived in the park at about midnight with Joe (Mishawi) and Lena Ivanovska, and Diana. While they sat in Mishawi’s car, he noticed a “couple of guys” who looked like Syrians and who were screaming and swearing, kick and hit the red Lancer. He said that people inside that car, who he described as Asians, got out of the car with metal poles and chased the Syrians or Lebanese back towards the beach. One, he said, was too slow and was caught. He was then hit with poles, and hit and kicked by four or five men while he was on the ground. This continued for 3 or 4 minutes. One of the girls with them he recalled, was saying “stop, stop hitting him”.  
     
      
    90 Diana Petroska also described ten or more people bashing a man on the ground with poles, over the grassed area on the beach side of the park. One of these people she recognised as “Jap”, who she knew from school. This, she said, followed her observation of a red Lancer being driven around, and of people moving out of its way.  
     
      
    91 Lena Ivanovska gave a somewhat similar account of an attack taking place after the red car had been driving around, making turns and doing burnouts and skids. She was unable to see precisely what then occurred, but recalled seeing men with sticks and poles and then seeing people crowded around a man on the ground. She said that she was scared and tried to avoid looking.  
     
      
       
      The Fight Ends 
       
      
    92 It was the Crown case that the Wollongong group left the park in the following manner: 
     
      
       
      (i)  
      Red Lancer 
       (Alana Ljubicic) 
       
       Alana Ljubicic 
       
       Sione Amone 
       
       Carlo Busuttil 
       
       Jason Kusonogovski 
       
       
      (ii)  
      Red Laser 
       (Big Chi) 
       
       Chi Tam Huynh 
       
       Chi Binh Nguyen 
       
       Duncan 
       
       Perre 
       
       Elbert Jose 
       
       Freda Iordanidis 
       
       
      (iii)  
      Green Pulsar 
       (Gjoreski) 
       
       Oliver Gjoreski 
       
       Steven Siljanoski 
       
       Zoran Mitic 
       
       Adam Lamacchia 
       
       
      (iv)  
      Blue Laser 
       (Saye) 
       
       Tracey Saye 
       
       Haley Girgin 
       
       Anthony Quach 
       
       Michael Gaspari 
       
       Iannis Mellos 
       
      
    93 There was general consensus among the witnesses in this respect, save for the fact that Tracey Saye alone said that Adam Lamacchia left in her car. Hayley Girgin said that she saw him leave in the red Laser. Tracey Saye’s evidence in relation to Lamacchia was not supported by the other occupants of her car, namely Girgin, Quach, Mellos, while Karuso, who said that he was asleep, had no memory of driving away.  
     
      
    94 Daniel Wilson said that when he realised that his brother was not with their group, he went back looking for him and saw him lying on the ground. Before doing so he dug out a wooden stake that was supporting a small tree. He did not, however, get to use the stake, because there was no one there to use it on. He noticed a couple of men walking away. After going over to assist his brother who was lying in a pool of blood he noticed Beiruti and Michael screaming and throwing things at the red Lancer (of Ljubicic) as it drove off.  
     
      
    95 Mathew Michael also said that when they realised that Christopher Wilson was missing and was being beaten, he and the others in the group took up garden pickets and started to run back towards the incident. It was at that stage that the Wollongong group ran towards their cars, but not before the man with the wheel brace and another man smashed the windows of his vehicle and that of Jovana Ljubojevic’s father. He acknowledged that his friend Paul Beiruti hit the back widow of the red Lancer, with the stake which he was carrying, before it left the area.  
     
      
    96 Tughlet Homeh said that the red Lancer whose rear window was smashed was the last vehicle to leave the scene.  
     
      
    97 Snezana Tankoska said that when she attempted to place a call for an ambulance on her mobile phone, someone who she did not see, who she thought was Nanad Radavassovic, but who the Crown asserts was the Appellant Perre, asked “who are you calling?” He then punched her to the face, cutting her lip and knocking her to the ground. She said that after getting up and placing a second call for help, she also noticed “Jap” smashing Jovana Ljubojevic’s car and “Big Chi” smashing Mathew Michael’s car. The last car that left the area, she said, was the red Lancer. One of the Sydney boys threw something at it, as it left, breaking the rear window.  
     
      
    98 Jovana Ljubojevic said that she raised the head of Christopher Wilson who was bleeding badly and having trouble breathing, and asked someone to call for an ambulance. She also said that she had earlier begged “Jap” to desist but that he and the others had refused, returning several times to resume their assault. One of these people told her, at one stage to “fuck off”.  
     
      
    99 She added that, while she was endeavouring to assist the victim, she looked up and saw Jap smashing the side windows and windscreen of her car.  
     
      
       
      The Wollongong Group Meet After the Fight 
       
      
    100 After the incident, most of the members of the Wollongong group drove to the JJ Kelly Park, a five minute drive away. While there, according to Tracey Saye, the Appellant Perre said that he had hit one of the girls in the face. She said that he was drunk and had blood on the top of his creamy coloured pants.  
     
      
    101 From this park a number of people moved on to FJ’s place in Lake Heights (premises owned by Sione Tuifua, a cousin of Sione Amone). Perre was driven there in Tracey Saye’s car. She had in her car, additionally, Hayley Girgin and Adrian Karuso. 
     
      
    102 Hayley Girgin said that, during the drive, Perre boasted of beating the victim and punching the girl. He told Hayley Girgin: “I was hitting him with a stick, the stick kept breaking into pieces, so I pick the pieces up and kept hitting him”. He also said that a girl was trying to stop him so he “punched her out”, causing her to fall to the ground.  
     
      
    103 Tracey Saye said that he made a similar admission to her, about hitting the victim with the stick, which broke into pieces, which he used until he had nothing left. Additionally she said that, at the JJ Kelly Park, he mentioned hitting one of the girls in the face.  
     
      
    104 Hayley Girgin said that she noticed that Perre had a cut on a knuckle, and blood on his creamy colour trousers. Carla Busuttil also said that she noticed that his hand was swollen and recalled him mentioning that it was “sore”. 
     
      
    105 Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin gave evidence of driving Perre home from FJ’s place. Tracey Saye said that she told him that he would be in a lot of trouble for this incident. His response was “I hope it’s worth it then”. She said that he had been very drunk.  
     
      
    106 Hayley Girgin also recalled him saying: ”I don’t want to go inside. I have blood on my trousers. My mum will get angry. How am I going to get it off? It is not my blood. I think it is the guy on the ground’s.”  
     
      
       
      The Findings at the Crime Scene 
       
      
    107 The ambulance officer Anthony Ryan who examined the victim said that he had six to seven head wounds, with exposed brain tissue emerging from one wound. He had severe swelling to one of his eye orbits and welt marks to the legs, as well as a partially severed finger. 
     
      
    108 Police and ambulance officers including Senior Constable Weir who came to the victim’s assistance said that they found him being cradled by Jovana Ljubojevic, and that they observed, in the immediate vicinity, 6 pieces of broken timber, some 3 metal star pickets, and a chrome coloured metal wheel brace with fresh blood on it.  
     
      
    109 Detective Sergeant Doherty who carried out a crime scene examination recorded that the pieces of wood, which were bloodstained, bore fine impact splatter. The six pieces of wood could be rejoined to make a stake. On the face of two of the broken sections of the stake there were screws consistent with it having been part of a ‘For Sale’ sign.  
     
      
    110 He also gave evidence of finding bloodstains on the exterior and interior of the red Mitsubishi Lancer, particularly in the rear of the vehicle. Nothing of significance was found in the blue Laser, of Tracey Saye. He also gave evidence of finding a sheath for a machete, but not the machete itself.  
     
      
    111 Regrettably, due to resource limitations, not all of the crime scene exhibits were tested for fingerprints or for DNA. However, as emerged from the evidence of Detective Sergeant Doherty and Virginia Friedman, DNA evidence was obtained showing matching profiles, according to the Profiler Plus system, as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) the profile of the swab from the exterior of the red Lancer of Alana Ljubicic matched the profile of Sione Amone.  
       
       
      (ii) the profile of two swabs from the interior of that vehicle matched the profile of the victim, Christopher Wilson. 
       
       
      (iii) the partial profile of a sample from a Magnalite torch recovered from the red Laser of Chi Tam Huynh could have come from the victim; 
       
       
      (iv) A profile of a swab from one of the car seat covers from the red Laser matched that of the victim; 
       
       
      (v) Other swabs from this vehicle threw up a mixed profile, for which Chi Tam Huynh could have been a contributor; 
       
       
      (vi) the profile from staining on Chi Tam Huynh’s trousers matched that of the victim; and  
       
       
      (vii) the profile from the staining on the blue board shorts of Duncan matched that of the victim.  
       
      
    112 Detective Sergeant Doherty said that a tubular steel wheel brace was found some distance from the area where the victim was found, but the testing of it was negative for blood. No L-shaped tool was found at the scene.  
     
      
    113 He said that he examined a pair of trousers that had been seized from Chi Tam Huynh’s home, which were found to have staining on the front of one leg.  
     
      
    114 Detective Sergeant Doherty also gave evidence of a comparison which he made between the linear patterned abrasions to the back of Paul Beiruti and the stained area on the leg of Chi Tam Huynh’s trousers, and which revealed a sufficient similarity for the conclusion that the weapon which had caused Beiruti’s injuries had caused the staining on these trousers.  
     
      
    115 He also gave evidence of a cream pair of cargo pants having been found in the plastic bag, which contained the blue shorts of Duncan. They had some stains on them, but that was not tested for DNA, by reason of the positive testing which had been conducted on the shorts. Detective Sergeant Panozzo confirmed that Duncan’s fingerprints were found on the red Lancer.  
     
      
    116 Dr Duflou gave evidence based upon the medical records (without having examined the victim) to the effect that, if the wheel brace had been used to strike his head, in the right orientation, it could have produced the four injuries that were represented by lacerations in the shape of incomplete circles. He said that it was unlikely that the circular head wounds had been caused by shoes. He could not say whether the pieces of timber, or the machete, had caused these head injuries. He did say that a number of the other lacerations to the back of the head and to the face could have been caused by kicking or stomping, or by the victim having been struck with pieces of wood or a baseball bat.117 The victim was hospitalised between the time of the attack and his release on 19 January 2002. He suffers permanent disability, arising from the comminuted fracture of the left parietal and occipital bones, the fracture of the right parietal bone, the underlying haematoma and bruising, and the diffuse axonal injury which was occasioned. He has ongoing and permanent lost of visual function, reduced memory and learning capability, slowed thinking and motor responses, and is at increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy. 
     
      
    118 On any view, the behaviour of those involved in this wanton and vicious attack on a young victim who had done nothing, at any stage of the evening to provoke them, was utterly appalling. Their attack was vicious. It was brutal and cowardly, and not one of those involved is entitled to regard the evening as involving a shred of “honour”. 
     
      
      Perre’s Subsequent Accounts of the Incident and the Evidence in his Case 
       
      
    119 On the day following the incident Perre attended work at the Leisure Coast Garden Centre. A work colleague, Simon Baker gave evidence of noticing that he smelt of alcohol. He also noticed that he had a gash on a knuckle of one on his hands, which had been a little swollen in the morning but progressed as the day went on. Perre was holding it as if it was sore. When asked how his night out had been, Perre replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I beat up some Lebo from Campbelltown. I had a me[t]al pole and my mates had machetes.”  
        
       
       
      He went on to say, according to Mr Baker: 
       
       
        
        “When I woke up in the morning I had blood all over my pants and all over my bed sheets. There was so much blood. I kept hitting him. I think I may have killed him.” 
        
       
       
      He also said, according to Mr Baker, that he was not sure how he had injured his knuckle, observing, “I think I might have been hit with one of the machetes.” Mr Baker added that he had said that he kept hitting the man in the head with the pole.  
       
      
    120 Perre was interviewed by Police, in the presence of his father on 12 November 2001, at a time when he was not a suspect. He said that he had been pretty drunk, and had not seen what happened, although he did acknowledge hearing shouting and the smashing of bottles and glass from the other side of the driveway, and seeing a few punches being thrown. He denied assaulting anyone.  
     
      
    121 When he arrived at the Park, he said, he had felt sick and had vomited. He said that he had experienced trouble focussing. He claimed to have seen someone having “a go” at Michael Gaspari, and had walked over to pull Gaspari away. He said that he and Gaspari had stayed behind the cars until it was all over. He had then jumped into the red Laser, in which he said there was Elbert Jose and Freda Iordanidis and Chi. He added that someone else got into the back of the car behind him, but he did not know who it was, as “I didn’t really look at him. I was, like sleeping, just put my head back”. He said that while Jose had begun to drive the vehicle, he was replaced as driver by Chi.  
     
      
    122 He acknowledged being taken home by Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin, but claimed to have kept to himself at the house to which they had gone on the way. He claimed not to have had much recollection of the night. 
     
      
    123 He informed police that he had worn “light greeny-brown coloured cords” and a black skivvy on the night of the incident. Later that day he took to the police station a pair of light green corduroy trousers, a pair of white joggers, and a black skivvy. 
     
      
    124 On 15 November 2001 he was arrested and on that occasion he declined to be further interviewed in relation to the attack on Christopher Wilson, or the assault of Snezana Tankoska. On the following day an order was obtained for him to provide a buccal swab.  
     
      
    125 Hayley Girgin said that the clothes which he claimed to have been wearing were not the clothes that she had seen him in that night, recalling that he had in fact worn cream coloured pants and black leather shoes.  
     
      
    126 Perre gave evidence at the trial, in the course of which he said that he could not recall who had driven him from Elbert Jose’s party to Stuart Park. It was while he was vomiting, he said, that he could hear screaming, shouting and bottles breaking. At that stage, he said, he felt scared. He could see people over the hill and he walked over, and joined his friend, Michael Gaspari, when he saw a man walking towards him and yelling “come on. Do you want to go. Let’s go”. He thought this man was going to punch Gaspari so he went over to help and pulled him away. 
     
      
    127 He said that he had then hit the other man in the mouth, cutting his knuckle. He said that he returned to where the cars were parked on the mountain side of the driveway and stood behind them. He saw a red Laser approach. When it stopped he jumped in. The vehicle, which was being driven by Elbert Jose, waited for someone else, and then left the area. He acknowledged that its occupants included additionally Freda Iordanidis, Big Chi and someone else who sat on his right. Big Chi he recalled, took over driving from Elbert Jose.  
     
      
    128 He denied making the admissions which had been attributed to him by Tracey Saye, Hayley Girgin and Mr Baker, although he acknowledged that he had informed the latter that he had been in a fight with “Lebbo’s from Sydney”. He had said that, he explained, because he had heard Anthony Quach mention it at FJ’s house. He maintained his account of having worn the green corduroy trousers and white joggers and denied that they had received any blood stains. He said that the injury to his knuckle had bled overnight leaving some little spots of blood on his pyjama pants and doona. He denied hitting anyone with a stick or using any other weapon. He also denied having taken a piece of wood out of the boot of Tracey Saye’s car, or having struck Snezana Tankoska in the face. He denied seeing any weapons but acknowledged that Tracey Saye had driven him home.  
     
      
    129 His mother gave evidence to the effect that he had in fact been wearing white Nike shoes and fawn/beige coloured corduroy trousers. She added that she had not noticed any blood on his clothing. She did however say that when she washed his sheets she noticed a spot of blood on the doona cover. 
     
      
    130 Both she and Perre said that his black school shoes had been thrown out before the incident. 
     
      
    131 The Appellant called two character witnesses Ronald Sattin and Garry Norris. 
     
      
       
      Duncan’s Account of the Incident and the Evidence in his Case  
       
      
    132 Duncan presented himself to police on 5 November 2001, with his girlfriend Sheree Machan. He took part in an ERISP in the course of which he said that he had arrived at the park, merely in the course of driving around Wollongong, on the night of the incident, in the blue Honda Civic of his friend Zoran Mitic. He denied having anything to do with the fight, or having taken the mobile phone of Mathew Michael. He claimed to have been near the car in which Christina Kusonogovski had been sitting when the fighting broke out, to have seen two Asians “Vim” and “Huy” at the scene and to have seen Asians running down the hill. He denied hearing Amone make any mention of fighting “one on one”, and he denied whistling to the other people who had come to the park. He said that he observed the Asians and Serbs fighting, and asserted that it was the Serbs who had weapons in their hands and that he had been pursued by one man with a bat.  
     
      
    133 He said that he had been chased over to Alana Ljubicic’s car and had driven it off in an attempt to get away. He explained the subsequent manoeuvres as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I reversed it that way, and then went out the no entry way, and then people were still running towards me for that way, I turned around because I tried to get out of there…” 
        
       
       
      He said that he got out of the car when Alana Ljubicic said that she wanted to go home. He said that he then phoned Zoran Mitic from his mobile to pick him up and added that Zoran took him home in his car, along with Mitic’s cousin. He denied getting into Big Chi’s car or leaving the scene with him.  
       
      
    134 He denied having been to Jose’s party that night, or having phoned Jason Kusonogovski. On his account he had seen him for the first time that night as he was walking across to speak to his sister, shortly before the fight broke out. He said that the injuries, which had been occasioned to his knuckles, had occurred as the result of his use of a punching bag at his kickboxing class. He did acknowledge having spoken to Christina Kusonogovski with her brother, but said that he had not realised that she had been there until Jason Kusonogovski arrived. He also said that, while he had been driven away from the scene, he had not gone on to Lake Heights. He denied leaving the scene in the red laser which took Big Chi and Perre from the scene.  
     
      
    135 He also nominated as being present at the scene apart from the brothers “Vin” and “Huy”, another man whose nickname was Zelks (who no one else noticed) and a man Nanad.  
     
      
    136 After being interviewed, and placed under arrest, he was taken to his home by police while they made a search. The search and some further questions were video taped. Present at the home at the time were his mother and his girlfriend, Sheree Machan. During the search he identified the clothes which he claimed to have been wearing on the night of the incident.  
     
      
    137 Sheree Machan, who was called in the Prosecution case, said that before driving Duncan to the police station that morning, she had collected some of his clothes from the floor, because they looked dirty. She said that she had placed them in a plastic bag which she then left in her car. It had been her intention to wash them. She indicated that she usually washed his clothes on a daily basis. After the house had been searched she allowed police to search her car, as a result of which they found and examined the bag of clothes. They included the pair of blue board shorts previously mentioned, which had a red staining, the analysis of the DNA of which was found to be consistent with that of the victim. Inside the rear pocket of these shorts, police found a mobile phone Sim card belonging to Mathew Michael. There was no issue in the case concerning Duncan’s ownership of these shorts, trial counsel having expressly accepted that to have been the fact.  
     
      
    138 An attempt was made to organise an identification parade, but that did not proceed when a group of young Islander males who had been contacted, refused to assist. When an attempt was made to reinterview Duncan on 28 November he exercised his right not to be interviewed. It was then that he was arrested.  
     
      
    139 Duncan did not give evidence. He called Linda Machan, the mother of his girlfriend, who said that she had spoken to Sione Amone on the Monday following the offences, and had been told by him that he had cut his hand when trying to get the machete off Jap, that the blood of the victim, over whom he had been standing, “went all over me”, and that he had disposed of his clothes that night. Her daughter Sheree Machan gave similar evidence. Although leave was given to the Crown to cross-examine Sheree Machan, she denied having made up her evidence. She did, however, accept that she had initially lied to police in relation to her assertion that the clothes in the car had belonged to her brother.  
     
      
    140 There was no evidence presented at trial from Chi Tam Huynh, Chi Binh Nguyen, Adam Lamacchia, or Michael Gaspari, each of whom was convicted and sentenced for offences arising out of the night’s events. Nor was there any evidence from the two girls who were taken to the park by Oliver Gjoreski, but whose identities were unknown. 
     
      
    141 There was, however, some evidence from a man Nanad Radavassovic to rebut a suggestion that he may have been the person who struck Snezana Tankoska and the person to whom Duncan had referred. It was his uncontroverted evidence that he had been at work for the entirety of the night, and had been uninvolved in any of the events at the park. In reply, however, the defence contended that it was not Nanad Radavassovic who Duncan had in mind but someone else altogether known as Nennard. 
     
      
       
      B. THE BASIS ON WHICH THE CROWN CASE WAS PRESENTED 
       
      
    142 It was the Crown case that Jason Kusonogovski had not been telling the truth, and that while Steven Siljanoski and Alana Ljubojevic had initially told the police the truth, in relation to the fight, they had dishonestly attempted in the witness box to retreat from their original position.  
     
      
    143 Otherwise it put forward the various witnesses who were called in its case as credible witnesses, and offered as an explanation for any discrepancies, or lack of observation, the traumatic and rapidly unfolding nature of the night’s events, or alternatively the fact that they focussed upon only a part of what was occurring.  
     
      
    144 The prosecution case was based upon joint enterprise depending upon Perre and Duncan having personally inflicted the relevant injuries or having encouraged or assisted others to do so, with the intention, in each case, of occasioning that victim grievous bodily harm. Extended joint enterprise was also relied upon in so far as the Crown contended, in the alternative, that the two Appellants were parties to a joint enterprise to assault the victim, and contemplated the possibility of grievous bodily harm being occasioned to him. 
     
      
    145 It was its case that Kusonogovski and Duncan were not impressed by the fact that the sister of the former had met up with the Sydney group in the park, that a fight with them was contemplated, and then provoked by the two of them and particularly by Duncan when he took Mathew Michael’s phone, and effectively whistled up the members of the Wollongong group, whose presence had already been encouraged, for assistance. It was its case that Duncan added to the provocation for a fight by placing the stolen phone in the red Lancer and then deliberately driving it at the various members of the Sydney group.  
     
      
    146 The Crown asserted that there was a considerable body of evidence which excluded the defence proposition that it was Sione Amone, rather than Duncan, who had been the Islander involved in the fighting. The one obstacle in the way of that submission, it accepted was the finding of blood, the profile of which was consistent with that of the victim in the red Lancer in which Amone was driven from the park. However it also pointed to the presence in the vehicle, at that time, of Jason Kusonogovski, who on its case was one of the persons who effectively provoked the incident.  
     
      
    147 Otherwise it relied upon the individual strands of evidence, which will be referred to later in these reasons, to establish its case against each Appellant.  
     
      
       
      C. THE DEFENCE CASES 
       
       
      Perre 
       
      
    148 It was his case that each of Tracey Saye, Hayley Girgin, Steven Siljanoski and Simon Baker were either liars or the subject of fallible or false recollections, and as such were neither credible or reliable witnesses. In particular, reliance was placed upon what was said to be inconsistencies in their accounts over time.  
     
      
    149 It was also submitted that the Crown had incorrectly cited the transcript in support of the reasons which were advanced by it for proof of its case; that there was no independent forensic evidence linking him to the attack. Reliance was placed on the absence of any witness asserting that they saw blood on the Appellant’s clothing at FJ’s house, other than Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin, who on the defence case had an interest to serve, in protecting Sione Amone; as well as the absence of any witness other than Tracey Saye saying that they saw Perre remove a piece of wood from the boot of her car; and additionally, the absence of any independent support from the other occupants of the car in which Perre was taken to FJ’s place, for the admissions which Hayley Girgin said that he made on the way there, or for the admissions which Tracey Saye said he made at the JJ Kelly Park, or at FJ’s place, or back outside his own home.  
     
      
    150 Reliance was also placed (as was the case in relation to Duncan) on the evidence of Snezana Tankoska and Jovana Ljubojevic which, it was suggested, pointed to there having been another Islander, “James”, at the scene, that is, an Islander other than Duncan and Amone, as well as a man Zelco who some witnesses nominated as having been present. These persons were not identified and not called, leaving open the possibility, so it was put, that they had been involved.  
     
      
    151 Moreover, it was submitted that the evidence of the mother of this Appellant contradicted any evidence concerning the sighting of the blood on his clothing, or admissions to that effect attributed to him.  
     
      
    152 Further, it was submitted that Siljanoski’s evidence was not to be accepted, in view of the contradictory accounts which emerged during the cross-examination pursuant to leave given under s 38, and the evidence which he offered concerning his eyesight, which is considered in more detail later in these reasons, since it is of relevance for the ground of appeal which is pursued in that respect.  
     
      
    153 Emphasis was given to the inevitable problems of identification in a setting that was dark, when it was raining, and when there was a great deal of activity taking place. Reliance was also placed upon the evidence that was available to the Appellant of prior good character.  
     
      
    154 An alternative hypothesis was said to remain open in relation to the injury to Perre’s hand, referable to him having suffered a cut to the knuckle when punching the man who, on his account, he believed to be posing a threat to Michael Gaspari.  
     
      
    155 It was contended that Tracey Saye was not a credible witness, suggesting that she had fabricated aspects of her account. Simon Baker was also suggested to have made up aspects of his account, for example in relation to the Sydney boys having come from Cabramatta, and in relation to Perre’s reported use of a metal pole, neither of which accorded with known facts. The submission was made that his evidence was based not upon any conversation with Perre, but rather from what he had learned from the media or other sources.  
     
      
       
      Duncan 
       
      
    156 Counsel for this Appellant accepted that he had participated in the night’s events to the extent of phoning Kusonogovski, talking to his sister, taking Michael’s phone and provoking what followed by that action, and also by driving the red Lancer in a somewhat dangerous manner. However, it was the defence case that this is where his involvement stopped, and that he did not become party to any joint enterprise of the kind asserted by the Crown, or become personally involved in any attack on the victim.  
     
      
    157 Considerable emphasis was placed by the defence upon the problems of identification in the circumstances of this night, and upon the proposition that by the time he had been pursued down the hill and driven Alana Ljubicic’s Lancer away, no weapons had been produced by members of the Wollongong group. This, it was contended, pointed to the absence of any knowledge, or expectation, on his part, of there being an altercation in which any of the Sydney group would be attacked and weapons used against them.  
     
      
    158 The driving away of the vehicle, and the manner thereof, it was contended, was attributable to fear and panic on his part to make an escape.  
     
      
    159 Further, it was submitted, in relation to Gjoreski’s evidence that no tyre lever or implement, of the kind that he said had gone missing from his tool kit, was found at the scene; and that it was somewhat improbable that the Appellant would have come to his vehicle seeking a weapon, before he had spoken to Christina Kusonogovski. A possible answer, for Gjoreski’s evidence, counsel suggested, was a desire to write himself out of the scene, it being implicit in this submission, despite the complete absence of evidence suggesting that Gjoreski had been involved in the fight, that he had in fact been one of the offenders.  
     
      
    160 A similar submission was advanced in relation to Carla Busuttil and Sione Amone, in so far as it was submitted that they were placing Duncan in Amone’s place. There was an associated submission that having regard to the physical likeness of these two men, a question arose as to identification. Reference was also made to the evidence of Snezana Tankoska and Tughlet Homeh which was suggestive of a third Islander, “Jamie”, or “James” having been observed in the park, adding to the risk of misidentification.  
     
      
    161 Reliance was placed on the fact that several witnesses described seeing Duncan in jeans. No one mentioned seeing him wearing the board shorts which were found to have the blood stains, and which he had allowed his girlfriend to collect and take away to be washed. Counsel did not offer any explanation for the presence on the shorts of a small amount of blood of the victim, but did question whether, if Duncan had been involved, there would not have been a good deal more blood upon them. The risk of contamination with other exhibits or of manipulation occurring, was somewhat obliquely suggested, although there was evidence that the shorts had been separately bagged.  
     
      
    162 The finding by police of the SIM card in the shorts was also questioned, it being asserted that it would have been somewhat unusual for the card to be kept and not the phone if that had been stolen by Duncan.  
     
      
    163 It was asserted that the jury would not accept that Siljanoski’s statement to police (in relation to the telephone call from Duncan to Kusonogovski) was correct, in the light of his evidence at trial concerning the making of that statement, it being contended, in effect, that the police had out of zealous enthusiasm, inserted their words into the document rather than his. Reference was also made to his asserted eyesight deficiency and uncertainty in relation to the identification of the co-accused Perre, so as to weaken his evidence.  
     
      
    164 An argument was advanced that Jovana Ljubicic, who knew Duncan and others from the Wollongong group, could however be trusted, and that it was significant that, even though she was very close to the fight, the only person she could identify as a participant was Jap.  
     
      
    165 Defence counsel accepted that he had lied in the ERISP, including, she suggested, that he had scripted Sione Amone out of the scene in order to protect him, but suggested that he may have responded differently had he been aware that he was facing the present charge rather than that of assault, in respect of which he was arrested.  
     
      
       
      THE SENTENCES PASSED ON OTHER OFFENDERS 
       
      
    166 Sione Amone was initially charged upon the basis of the identification made by Tughlet Homeh which was later accepted as having been mistaken. The charges against him were then withdrawn. 
     
      
    167 Chi Binh Nguyen (Jap) who was 19 years old at the time of the offence, and who had a prior record for violence, including an offence for which he had been on conditional liberty, pleaded guilty, at his arraignment on 6 February 2003, to the same s 33 offence, to affray, and to two counts of malicious damage to a motor vehicle. He was given a discount of 25 per cent for the plea, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years for the s 33 offence, and was given terms of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months for the malicious damage charges, and a fixed term of 2 years for the affray offence. The sentence for the s 33 offence was cumulative upon the non-parole period for the malicious damage offences. The overall sentence was therefore one of 14 years and 3 months with an overall non-parole period of 11 years 3 months. 
     
      
    168 Chi Tam Huynh (Big Chi) who was 18 years of age at the time of the offence, and who had a prior history of malicious damage and of affray, pleaded guilty, just prior to the commencement of the trial, to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (s 35 Crimes Act), and to one count of malicious damage to a motor vehicle (s 195(a) Crimes Act). A form 1 matter was taken into account of having a prohibited weapon. He was additionally sentenced for a separate offence namely the ongoing supply of a prohibited drug (s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). 
     
      
    169 He was given a discount for the plea of 25 per cent, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years for the s 35 offence, with a non-parole period of 4 years, and to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years for malicious damage. A sentence of 3 years was imposed for the drug offence, and the sentence for the s 35 offence was made cumulative upon that sentence by 1 year in round terms. The overall sentence was accordingly one of 8 years, in round terms, with a non-parole period of 5 years.  
     
      
    170 Adam Lamacchia also pleaded guilty shortly before trial to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Mr Wilson, contrary to s 35 (1)(b) of the Crimes Act, an offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years, and to affray. He had been aged 18 years at the time of the offence and had no prior record of violence.  
     
      
    171 He was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years which was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the s 35 offence, and to a s 9 bond for 4 years in relation to the offence of affray. 
     
      
    172 Michael Gaspari later pleaded guilty to one count of affray. He was sentenced by Phelan DCJ to an unconditional s 9 bond for 2 years. 
     
      
       
      D. PERRE’S APPEAL 
       
      
    173 Perre has raised the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “GROUND 1. His Honour’s discretion miscarried and he was wrong to allow the Crown to cross-examine the witness Siljanoski in relation to that witness’s visual identification of the Appellant because he failed to consider s 114 of the  
        Evidence Act. 
         
         
        GROUND 2. The trial miscarried because his Honour erred in allowing the Crown to lead the inadmissible evidence of visual identification of the Appellant by Siljanoski. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    174 The Appellant also applied for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
         
        GROUND 3. His Honour was in error not to take the intoxication of the Applicant into consideration as going to the degree of deliberation involved in the offence. 
         
         
        GROUND 4. His Honour failed to take into account, properly or at all, the youth and good character of the Applicant or that he was a juvenile at the time of the offence. 
         
         
        GROUND 5. His Honour was in error not to have found special circumstances. 
         
         
        GROUND 6. The sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    175 Before dealing with these grounds it is convenient to note that the case against Perre  primarily rested upon: 
     
      
      (a) Tracey Saye’s evidence of him taking the wooden leg from the boot of her car, and striking the victim, while he was lying on the ground “like a cricket bat, like just hitting – just hitting”. 
       
       
      (b) The admission which Tracey Saye, and Hayley Girgin said that he made to them, to the effect that he had hit the victim with a stick that kept breaking into pieces, which was consistent with the six bloodied pieces of garden stake that were found at the scene. 
       
       
      (c) The observations of Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin as to the presence of blood on his cream pants, and the admission which he made to Hayley Girgin as to his concerns about going home with blood on his trousers, which he thought had come from the “guy on the ground”. 
       
       
      (d) Snezana Tankoska’s evidence of being punched by a man while she was phoning for help in circumstances where no other female who was present that night said that she was struck and where Perre had admitted to Hayley Girgin and to Tracey Saye that he had struck a girl. 
       
       
      (e) The presence of a cut and bruised knuckle on his hand that was seen by Simon Baker, Hayley Girgin and Carla Busuttil.  
       
       
      (f) His admission to Simon Baker of beating up “some Lebo” and hitting him with a pole. 
       
       
      (g) His false claim to have worn the green corduroy trousers on the night of the assault, which he produced to police. 
       
       
      (h) His attempt to minimise his participation in and recollection of, the nights’ events, under a veil of intoxication. 
       
       
      (i) His presence with the other principal offenders in the red Laser of “Big Chi” which took them from the scene, that being a vehicle in which blood was found having a profile that matched that of the victim. 
       
       
      (j) Steven Siljanoski’s account to police as to having seen Perre in the group of men who were striking the victim. 
       
       
      APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 -  
       
       
      Ground 1: His Honour’s discretion miscarried and he was wrong to allow the Crown to cross-examine the witness Siljanoski in relation to that witness’s visual identification of the Appellant because he failed to consider s 114 of the  
      Evidence Act. 
       
        
       
      Ground 2: The trial miscarried because his Honour erred in allowing the Crown to lead the inadmissible evidence of visual identification of the Appellant by Siljanoski. 
       
      
    176 These are obviously overlapping grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    177 There were two witnesses who were relied upon by the Crown as having identified Perre as one of the attackers: Tracey Saye and Steven Siljanoski. 
     
      
    178 The identification by Tracey Saye was positive and unequivocal, and she was a person who had known him before the incident. Although there was an attack made upon her credit, she remained unshaken and was obviously accepted by the jury. His Honour gave a sufficient direction in relation to visual identification evidence, and no point is taken upon appeal in relation to this aspect of the case.  
     
      
    179 The appeal is, accordingly, concerned with the evidence led from Steven Siljanoski, in particular as to whether leave should have been given to the Crown, under s 38 of the Evidence Act, to cross-examine him, and as to whether there had been compliance with s 114 of the Evidence Act. That section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Exclusion of visual identification evidence 
         
         
        (1) In this section:  
         
         
        visual identification evidence 
         means identification evidence relating to an identification based wholly or partly on what a person saw but does not include picture identification evidence. 
         
         
        (2) Visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless:  
         
         
        (a) an identification parade that included the defendant was held before the identification was made, or 
         
         
        (b) it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade, or 
         
         
        (c) the defendant refused to take part in such a parade, and the identification was made without the person who made it having been intentionally influenced to identify the defendant. 
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court in determining whether it was reasonable to hold an identification parade, it is to take into account:  
         
         
        (a) the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned, and 
         
         
        (b) the importance of the evidence, and 
         
         
        (c) the practicality of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things:  
         
         
        (i) if the defendant failed to cooperate in the conduct of the parade—to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure, and 
         
         
          
          (ii) in any case—to whether the identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence, and 
          
         
         
        (d) the appropriateness of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the defendant and the person who made the identification. 
         
         
        (4) It is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade if it would have been unfair to the defendant for such a parade to have been held. 
         
         
        (5) If:  
         
         
        (a) the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade unless a lawyer acting for the defendant, or another person chosen by the defendant, was present while it was being held, and 
         
         
        (b) there were, at the time when the parade was to have been conducted, reasonable grounds to believe that it was not reasonably practicable for such a lawyer or person to be present, it is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade at that time. 
         
         
        (6) In determining whether it was reasonable to have held an identification parade, the court is not to take into account the availability of pictures or photographs that could be used in making identifications. 
         
        
       
      
    180 In order for this ground to be considered it is necessary to set out Siljanoski’s evidence in a little more detail, and to note what occurred at the trial in relation to it. 
     
      
    181 In chief, his evidence was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you recognise anybody that was hitting [the victim]? 
         
        A. Hundred percent sure, no. 
         
        ….. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know a person named Adam Perre? 
         
        A. Yes I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long have you known him? 
         
        A. I don’t really know him, just know the name. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know him or not? 
         
        A. Well, I wouldn’t say I’m friends with him, I don’t know him, really spoken to him before, but like, I know who he is, but I don’t know – we have never really had a conversation together. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see, Mr Siljanoski, you have told the Court you already knew what Adam looked like before this night? 
         
        A. Yes, I knew what he looked like.” 
        
       
      
    182 The Crown then made an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine him in respect of the inconsistent statements contained in a statement which he had made to the police on 29 November 2001. 
     
      
    183 The application was opposed. Counsel for the Appellant conceded that s 38 of the Evidence Act (“the Act”) applied but submitted that his Honour would not grant leave because of the provisions of s 192 (2)(b) of the Act. When asked by his Honour “what (other) provisions of the Act” were relevant, counsel replied, “No. Probably for the very good reason that none apply”. Counsel maintained that the effect of the evidence of Siljanoski was that “he didn’t really know” the Appellant, and it was upon that basis that leave to cross-examine him was opposed. 
     
      
    184 His Honour granted leave to the Crown to cross-examine Siljanoski and observed in his judgment “the evidence could be of crucial importance so far as the Crown case is concerned in respect of each accused”. In his judgment he referred only to ss 38 and 192 of the Act. 
     
      
    185 The Crown cross-examined Siljanoski who then gave evidence that he had made a statement to the police which contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “At that stage [Duncan] almost ran me over so I ran behind Ollie’s car. They must have done something like put the breaks [ 
        sic 
        ] on hard. They skidded and the bottles landed near me… [Duncan] must have got out of the car and went back to fight because I looked back towards where the fight was taking place and saw a group of 4 or 5 guys around maybe one guy. I saw [Duncan] was one of the guys in that group a guy I know as Adam Perre and others. They were hitting him maybe with a pole a branch… I yelled out… “Hurry up let’s get out of here”. I remember leaving, Ollie was driving. Zoran got in the front seat. I got in the back seat. We started driving off towards the south. At this time another guy, some other guy, ran up to the car jumped in behind Ollie’s seat.” 
        
       
      
    186 When Siljanoski was confronted by his statement to the police identifying the Appellant as one of the assailants, he said (T275.6): 
     
      
       
        
        “…when I made that statement I told – the detectives asked me, I said there was someone with maybe blond hair. He said “was it Adam Perre?” I said “I am not sure, does he have blonde hair?” And he said “Yeah he does and he was just arrested a day before that.” 
        
       
      
    187 Detective Senior Constable Worthington said, in his evidence, that he could not recall whether Siljanoski’s eyesight was discussed when the statement was being taken; whether Siljanoski had said there was a person with blond hair or whether Siljanoski asked him whether the Appellant had blond hair. It was his account that he typed the version which he was given on the word processor. What he was told he put into the statement.  
     
      
    188 The evidence of Siljanoski led through cross-examination by the Crown was obviously visual identification evidence falling within s 114(1) of the Evidence Act, and was inadmissible (R v Tahere 1999 NSWCCA 170) unless one of the three conditions referred to in s 114(2) had been met. No identification parade had been held and the Appellant had not been asked whether he would take part in one in relation to the investigation into either of the offences contained in the indictment. 
     
      
    189 There had however been a request made of him to participate in an identification parade in relation to the alleged assault by him of Snezana Tankoska which had occurred during the general incident at Stuart Park. The Appellant declined to participate in that parade. The identifying witness for that assault was not Siljanoski. The information relating to the request for and refusal of an identification parade for that assault was not placed before the jury. Nor was evidence led to show that it became necessary for police to obtain an order for him to provide a buccal sample for DNA testing, since he was not prepared to give his consent.  
     
      
    190 It was submitted that, upon the evidence, Siljanoski had been not been sufficiently familiar with the Appellant to conclude that it would not have been reasonable, on that account, to have held an identification parade. 
     
      
    191 While neither the Crown nor defence Counsel referred his Honour to the requirements of s 114, it is now submitted that, at the very least an inquiry should have been made by his Honour as to whether s 114 of the Act had been satisfied. 
     
      
    192 Reliance was placed on decisions of this Court in R v Tahere [1999] NSWCCA 170 and R v Taufua NSWCCA 11 November 1996. Each is distinguishable. The critical finding in Tahere was that there was no evidence to show that at the time of the trial, or at a time reasonably proximate to the trial it would not have been reasonable to have held a parade. In the present case there was evidence of that kind available related to the earlier lack of co operation on the part of the Appellant.  
     
      
    193 Taufua was a case that was concerned with the application of s 114 in the case of an in-Court identification, and also with the question whether the witness had sufficient prior familiarity with the accused for the trial judge to have reached a conclusion that it would not have been reasonable to hold an identification parade. The present case is in a different position, since there was evidence available upon which such a conclusion could readily have been reached.  
     
      
    194 In summary there are obvious problems, in relation to this submission, in so far as:  
     
      
       
      (i) Experienced trial counsel did not take any objection at trial; 
       
       
      (ii) The evidence was capable of showing that Siljanoski already knew the Appellant;  
       
       
      (iii) Having refused an identification parade in relation to one aspect of the night’s events, it was virtually certain that any request to participate in a parade concerning the more serious charge would have been refused; 
       
       
      (iv) There was a considerable body of evidence, apart from that of Siljanoski to show that Perre had been actually engaged in the assault, not only from Tracey Saye, but in the form of the several admissions previously mentioned; and  
       
       
      (v) The Wollongong group which included Perre and Siljanoski had all come from the same party, with the result that Siljanoski would have been likely to have recognised him later that night. 
       
      
    195 The High Court in Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 199 ALR 547 pointed out that the provisions of the Evidence Act need to be assessed in the adversarial context of the trial. In a joint judgment Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said at 20: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sections 114 and 115, like many other provisions of the  
        Evidence Act,  
        declare that evidence of a certain kind is not admissible in certain circumstances, or unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Yet evidence of a kind to which those sections refer may not be the subject of objection. Counsel for an accused person may have any one of number of reasons for not objecting. A trial judge ordinarily will not know why no objection is taken, and may have no right to enquire. Counsel might decide not to object simply because he or she knows that that accused, upon giving evidence, will admit that the identification evidence is correct. The  
        Evidence Act  
        applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties, and their counsel, who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection…” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Stanley 
       [2004] NSWCCA 278.  
       
      
    196 In the present case, had the absence of an identification parade been taken up by the defence, the Crown would have been entitled to lead evidence from Detective Senior Constable Audrey Pearson concerning the Appellant’s refusal on 15 November 2001 to participate in a parade, in relation to the assault of the female, an event which was very closely linked with the central events of the night. Having been refused once, police would have been reasonably entitled to assume that any further request would also be declined, particularly in view of the Appellant’s refusal to enter into an ERISP after his arrest, and the need for police to seek an order to obtain a buccal swab from him. 
     
      
    197 Absent any evidence from experienced trial counsel as to why the point was not taken, and given the appropriate directions that the jury received as to identification evidence generally, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Leave to argue this ground should, in my view, be refused. 
     
      
    198 For these reasons the appeal of Perre against conviction should, in my opinion, be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE 
       
       
      Ground 3 - 
       
      His Honour was in error not to take the intoxication of the Applicant into consideration as going to the degree of deliberation involved in the offence. 
       
      
    199 His Honour noted the submission that he should find that the Appellant, whose role was assessed to have been among the most serious of the various offenders, had committed the offence because of his drunkenness and that this factor should have been treated as one operating in mitigation of sentence. He observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not convinced that any aspect of your account is true. 
        
       
       
        
        Anyway, intoxication due to alcohol consumption is, in view of the jury verdict, no excuse or mitigation. On the other hand, if all that is sought is an acknowledgment that you may on occasions drink too much and be better off not doing so, then I am prepared to make these findings.”  
        
       
      
    200 It was submitted that his Honour was in error to dismiss the question of intoxication out of hand since the degree of culpability of an offender may be influenced by the degree of deliberateness involved in an attack R v Sewell and Walsh (1981) 5 A Crim R 204, and this may in turn be affected by intoxication. 
     
      
    201 There was evidence to show that the Appellant had been affected by alcohol, coming not only from himself, but also from Tracey Saye. On the other hand as his Honour correctly observed, by its verdict the jury had been satisfied that he had not been so affected as to have lacked the specific intent required for the offence. 
     
      
    202 The deliberate and sustained nature of the conduct attributed to the Appellant, both in savagely beating the victim, and in punching Snezana Tankoska in order to stop her calling for help, and his apparent awareness of what had occurred as disclosed by the various admissions which he made to Tracey Saye, Hayley Girgin and Mr Baker after the offence, are inconsistent with him having been affected by alcohol to any great degree. 
     
      
    203 While it is correct that alcohol may tend to mitigate the culpability of an offender where it causes him to act out of character, or where it affects the deliberateness of his act (R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 417), the evidence in the circumstances outlined in this case, fell well short of this mark. At most this was a case of reduced inhibitions, without any suggestion of any decrease in the Appellant’s awareness of what he was doing. Alcohol is not a licence to commit crime: R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381, at 387 per McTierney J, and it was obviously to that principle that his Honour was referring when he noted that intoxication “is no excuse or mitigation”. 
     
      
    204 I am accordingly not persuaded that his Honour’s findings were erroneous, or that any lessening in the Appellant’s culpability is to be attributed to the fact that he had been drinking alcohol before the attack. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 4, 5 and 6 -  
       
       
      Ground 4: His Honour failed to take into account, properly or at all, the youth and good character of the Applicant or that he was a juvenile at the time of the offence. 
       
        
       
      Ground 5: His Honour was in error not to have found special circumstances. 
       
        
       
      Ground 6: The sentence imposed by his Honour were [ 
      sic 
      ] manifestly excessive. 
       
        
       
      
    205 His Honour appropriately noted that there was nothing remarkable about the Appellant’s upbringing or background “except that he had achieved well in all areas”, and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good. He continued “however in view of the objective facts of this matter, this aspect plays little significant role in the ultimate sentence”. 
     
      
    206 It was submitted that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the evidence, which showed that the Appellant, who was aged just short of 18 years at the time of the offence, had a prior excellent character with a substantial history of employment and involvement in the community. In this regard it was the case that he had a supportive family, he had completed his HSC, he was undertaking a civil engineering course at a TAFE college, he had bright career prospects, and the offence was described by those who knew him as being out of character. He had no criminal antecedents, he was of above average intelligence, and he had excelled at soccer.  
     
      
    207 Properly understood it is obvious from the reasons for sentence, that his Honour accepted that the subjective circumstances of the Appellant were favourable, in these various respects, and that his observation as to there being “nothing of note” did not go beyond an indication that there was nothing adverse in his record. 
     
      
    208 Reliance was placed on the general principle exemplified in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 and R v C; R v S; R v T, NSWCCA 12 October 1989, that the youth of an offender will generally mean that less weight will be given to deterrence and more to rehabilitation. 
     
      
    209 This is, however, subject to the qualification that when the nature of the conduct includes extreme violence, or is akin to that which is more commonly expected of an adult offender, then the interest of rehabilitation has less significance: R v Tran (1999) NSWCCA 109, R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451, and R v Voss (2003) NSWCCA 182. The principles referred to in these authorities were directly applicable in the light of his Honour’s finding, which was amply based on the evidence, that he had deliberately struck the victim with a piece of wood, several times, while he was being attacked by co-offenders with implements such as a machete, poles and a wheel brace.  
     
      
    210 There is a further qualification of particular relevance in this case, in so far as the fact of age becomes of less importance the closer the offender is to adulthood. The Appellant was born on 20 December 1983, and was therefore only months short of his eighteenth birthday at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    211 The case is one for which the observations of Lee CJ at CL in R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 are particularly apposite: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of  
        Williscroft  
        [1975] VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment, ie, coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society.” 
        
       
      
    212 Although the Appellant was by no means a mature adult, he was no child. He knew well the grave seriousness of the violence to which he was a party.  
     
      
    213 It was also submitted that the sentence imposed was crushing and was outside the legitimate range for offences of its kind. In this respect, attention was drawn to the JIRS statistics, which suggest that both the sentence and the non-parole period were 50% higher than any sentence previously imposed upon an offender less than 21 years of age (the highest, albeit in a population of only 26 offenders, having been a head sentence of 10 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years). 
     
      
    214 There is limited value in any comparison based on such a small sample, particularly when the statistics include cases displaying a wide range of objective and subjective circumstances; equally it is the case that only limited assistance can ever be attained by reference to individual cases of the same general type, involving other offenders, having regard to the fact that they form part of the range, and also having regard to the need to assume that they were correct: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43.  
     
      
    215 It does however remain necessary that consistency be achieved in sentencing R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174, and in this respect regard to the statistics, and to the cases that make up the range, can help, so long as the practical constraints mentioned are kept in mind. 
     
      
    216 In this instance reference was made to three s 33 cases that resulted in the victim sustaining a permanent and serious brain injury: R v Henderson NSWCCA 5 November 1997, R v McKnoulty NSWCCA 20 May 1998 and R v Sumea [2002] NSWCCA 271. In Henderson a sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years was imposed after a plea; in McKnoulty, after trial, a sentence of 18 years with a minimum term of 13½ years was imposed; and in Sumea, a sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years was imposed, following a plea. There were obvious differences in the objective and subjective circumstances in these cases, and in the result they provide relatively little assistance.  
     
      
    217 The s 33 offence in this case was of very great objective seriousness such that a condign sentence was called for, that reflected not only a significant punitive and retributive element for the serious and permanent brain injuries that were caused, but that also conveyed a substantial element of general deterrence.  
     
      
    218 Young offenders who elect to respond to any form of confrontation between different groups, need to understand, with crystal clarity, that sentences of imprisonment await those who cause the confrontation to be elevated to one involving extreme violence. Particularly is that so if they band together, in a brutal and cowardly pack attack with weapons, on a single unarmed and defenceless victim. 
     
      
    219 The present case falls precisely into that category, and it was in the upper range of seriousness. It was not a case where the Appellant has shown any remorse or contrition, having continued to maintain his innocence. While he is not to be punished additionally for going to trial, or for maintaining this appeal, or for his lack of contrition, on the other hand he is not entitled to claim any discount or mitigation, on either account. 
     
      
    220 The critical question for this aspect on the appeal, which is tied up with the next ground, is whether the sentence was so far above the range, having regard to the Appellant’s otherwise favourable circumstances, that some lesser sentence was warranted in law, and should have been passed: s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    221 His Honour observed, relevantly for ground 5: 
     
      
       
        
        “I could find special circumstances on account of your youth and other matters, but because of the structure of the sentence I am about to impose, I see no reason to increase the period available for parole.” 
        
       
      
    222 Although this passage is somewhat opaque, it would seem that his Honour regarded the period for potential release on parole of 4 years to have been sufficient to accommodate the kind of post release supervision that would have been required to ensure the Appellant’s successful return to the community. 
     
      
    223 There can be no quarrel with such a conclusion particularly having regard to the fact that the Appellant was not shown to have any psychological condition, or problems with substance abuse, that called for particular attention, and also having regard to the current practice as to when effective supervision ceases. 
     
      
    224 The case was one where there were factors that could properly have been taken into account when setting the head sentence, which also fell into the category of circumstances that can qualify as special circumstances, such as the age of the Appellant, the fact that this was his first time in custody, and his good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    225 It was not obligatory for his Honour to have found special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1997: R v Holmes [2003] NSWCCA 258. 
     
      
    226 The existence of an undue readiness for this provision to be used, as a means of reducing an otherwise appropriate sentence, has been noted in decisions in this Court such as R v Fidow (2004) NSWCCA 172 that is, where they have already been given full weight when setting the head sentence. 
     
      
    227 What is of concern in the present case is whether any weight was given to the Appellant’s subjective circumstances at all, when the head sentence was determined, against which a non-parole period was fixed in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    228 I can see no error, whether latent or patent, in relation to the sentence for the affray offence.  
     
      
    229 I have however reached the conclusion that the sentence for the s 33 offence was so far outside a proper exercise of legitimate sentencing discretion, that his Honour could not have allowed sufficient weight to be attached to the favourable subjective circumstances of the Appellant. It is, a sentence that would all but extinguish his prospects of rehabilitation, and in this respect latent error has been established.  
     
      
    230 In my view the lesser sentence that was warranted was one of imprisonment for 13 years, with a non-parole period of 9 years. This involves a minor variation in the statutory ratio, but I am persuaded that special circumstances exist relating to the age of the Appellant, to the interest of securing his rehabilitation and to the fact that he is to serve a lengthy period of imprisonment.  
     
      
    231 I would propose, accordingly in the appeal of Perre, the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against convictions dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, but confined to the sentence for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 
       
      3. Appeal in respect of the sentence for the s 33 offence allowed. 
       
      4. Quash the sentence for the s 33 offence and in lieu thereof the Appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years to date from 18 August 2003 and to expire on 17 August 2016 with a non-parole period set of 9 years to date from 18 August 2003, and to expire on 17 August 2012, that being the earliest day on which the Appellant would be eligible for release on parole. 
       
      
    232 I observe that in re-sentencing the Appellant, I have taken into account the additional material tendered which confirms the progress of the Appellant while in custody, and supports his favourable prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
       
       
      DUNCAN’S APPEAL 
       
      
    233 Duncan has raised the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “GROUND 1 His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to cross-examine the witness Stephen Siljanoski pursuant to s 38 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        , in that the witness was not “unfavourable” within the meaning of the act particularly s 38(1)(b) and (c) and s 192 AND His Honour failed to consider s 135-7 of the  
        Evidence Act  
        with respect to this evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 2 His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of questioning of the Appellant in the search warrant video. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 3 His Honour erred in his directions to the jury regarding the evidence of identification. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 4 His Honour erred in his directions to the jury regarding “lies”. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 5 His Honour failed to adequately direct the jury as to specific intent and the alternative to the first count on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 6 His Honour failed to direct the jury with respect to the evidence of Siljanoski. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 7 His Honour erred in his directions to invite the jury to convict upon a basis apart from a proper evaluation of the evidence and its application to the ingredients of the offence (by leave).  
        
       
      
    234 Additionally Duncan has brought an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        a) His Honour made erroneous findings as to the objective circumstances of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        b) His Honour rejected or failed to adequately take into account the subjective findings favourable to the Applicant that were available and uncontested on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        c) His Honour failed to adequately consider the age of the offender and the evidence of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        d) It is submitted that His Honour should have found special circumstances within section 44 of the  
        Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. 
        
       
       
        
        e) Parity. 
        
       
       
        
        f) The sentence imposed by His Honour was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    235 Again before dealing with the separate grounds of appeal it may be noted that the case against Duncan primarily rested upon: 
     
      
       
      (a) The evidence which suggested a degree of hostility on his part towards the Sydney group, including the making of a phone call to Jason Kusonogovski, and his inquiry of Gjoreski as to whether he had a baseball bat. 
       
       
      (b) The presence of a wheel brace near the place where the victim was found, and his search of the boot of the vehicle of Oliver Gjoreski, and the fact that a brace which had previously been in the boot was later found to be missing, in association with the evidence of Dr Duflou that some of the injuries could have been caused by such an implement. 
       
       
      (c) The fact that he took Mathew Michael’s phone, the SIM card for which was found in his blue shorts, and that he initiated the confrontation which followed, by whistling up his friends, and by then driving around the Park in an erratic and dangerous manner. 
       
       
      (d) The observations of Sione Amone and Carla Busuttil of him chasing the Sydney group back towards the grassed area where the victim was attacked, and of him hitting the man on the ground. 
       
       
      (e) The description by Alana Ljubicic and Steven Siljanoski in their initial statements, and of Carla Busuttil of his involvement in the fight, and their observations of him punching and kicking the victim, and of hitting him with a machete. 
       
       
      (f) The presence of blood, the DNA of which was consistent with that of the victim, on his blue shorts. 
       
       
      (g) The damage which he sustained to his knuckles. 
       
       
      (h) The evidence of Freda Iordanidis, Carla Busuttil and Alana Ljubicic to the effect that the person who was seen by others to have been principally involved in the fight, re-entered the red Laser in which she was sitting, in the order of Perre, “Big Chi”, “Jap” and finally Duncan.  
       
       
      APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
       
       
      Ground 1 -  
       
      His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to cross-examine the witness Stephen Siljanoski pursuant to s 38 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      , in that the witness was not “unfavourable” within the meaning of the act particularly s 38(1)(b) and (c) and s 192 AND His Honour failed to consider s 135-7 of the  
      Evidence Act  
      with respect to this evidence. 
       
      
    236 It was after Siljanoski had given evidence at the trial that he had seen a group of people hitting someone on the grass, that he indicated that he “couldn’t be a hundred per cent sure who they were”, and that he had not recognised anybody who had been involved in the assault, that leave was given for him to be cross-examined under s 38 of the Evidence Act. He was then asked to read the relevant paragraphs in his earlier statement to police, which he agreed had constituted the account which he had given and which, he also agreed, had been true to the best of his knowledge and ability at that time. The relevant paragraphs in the statement so far as Duncan was concerned, were to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “At that stage Babe (the Appellant) almost ran me over so I ran behind Ollie’s car. They must have done some thing like put the brakes on hard. They skidded and the bottles landed near me. 
         
        Q. Would you read a little bit more slowly? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Babe must have got out of the car and went back to fight because I looked back towards where the fight was taking place and I saw a group of four or five guys around maybe one guy. I saw Babe was one of the guys in that group a guy I know as Adam Perre and others. They were hitting him may be with a pole, branch. I saw it had leaves on it, another pole. I also saw people kicking the guy that was on the bonnet. Ollie yelled out to me, in “Hurry up let’s go”. So I yelled out to Big Chi, “hurry let’s get out of here”. I remember leaving, Ollie was driving. Zoran got in the front seat, I got in the back seat. We started driving of [ 
        sic 
        ] towards the South. At this time another guy, some other guy, ran up to the car jumped in behind Ollie’s seat. Then we stopped and were looking back.” 
        
       
      
    237 His Honour decided, as clearly was correct, that the witness’ evidence at the trial, was at variance with his statement, and that the case came within “s 38(1)(c) and (e)” of the Evidence Act, the latter obviously having been intended by his Honour as a reference to sub para (b). The case was one to which decisions of this Court in Regina v GAC NSWCCA 1 April 1997 applied, and which permitted the contents of the earlier out of court statement to be received as evidence of the facts concerning the attack on the victim.  
     
      
    238 There was also a proper basis for the case to have been brought within s 38(1)(a), in so far as the evidence given in chief was unfavourable to the Crown, as this term has been judicially interpreted: R v Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712 at 715, R v Velevski (No. 2) (1997) 93 A Crim R 420 and R v Lozano NSWCCA 10 June 1997. 
     
      
    239 Objection was taken to leave being given under s 192 of the Act, it being submitted, by reference to s 192(2)(b), that it would be unfair to the accused for such cross-examination to be permitted. His Honour did not overlook the need to give consideration to the matters referred to in s 192, as had been held necessary in Stanoevski v The Queen  (2001) 75 ALJR 454, Adam v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 1537 and R v Fowler (2000) NSWCCA 142. It was however submitted that error arose in so far as insufficient attention had been given to the probative value and potential prejudicial effect of the evidence, so far as fairness under s 192(2)(b) was concerned. 
     
      
    240 It was submitted, on appeal although not at the trial, that his Honour should have additionally given consideration to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act before giving leave. 
     
      
    241 The principle basis of these submissions rested upon the proposition that the witness’ evidence was unreliable, as he had already indicated that he “could not see one hundred per cent” without glasses, and that he had been pressured by police into making the statement. The evidence which he gave in this regard, once leave had been granted, was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you told Det Worthington the things that appear in Paragraph 13 of your statement, that is right isn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes, but there was something that I think he worded wrong, the way it came out on [ 
        sic 
        ] my mouth. Because I told him from the distance I was and my eyesight, I have to wear glasses when I drive, by the way, I could not see 100 per cent. And for some reason that is not in the statement. I did not know that until I went to the committal here I never got a copy of my statement as other people did.” 
        
       
      
    242 In cross-examination, he agreed that he had felt under pressure at the police station, that he had been embarrassed by having been visited by police at his place of work, and that what had appeared in his statement had been what the police officer (Det Worthington) had wanted to put down, and not what he had meant.  
     
      
    243 It was submitted that the overall weight and reliability of the statement was also weakened by the possibility that it had been based upon reconstruction after the event, from knowledge which had been later acquired, by the unfavourable lighting, and general confusion in the park, and by the distance between him and the fighting which was calculated to have been in the order of 20 metres, to the point where leave should have been refused under s 192 or the evidence otherwise excluded under ss 135 or 137. 
     
      
    244 There was evidence from Det Worthington denying that he had “composed words” for the witnesses. He said that his general practice was to include in statements that which he was told by witnesses. Additionally it was the case that Siljanoski acknowledged knowing Duncan, Big Chi, Little Chi and Sione Amone, and conceded, at one point, that his eyesight was “alright” for long distance. He said that he had been about 20 to 25 metres away from where the person on the ground had been struck, and was able to see the leaves on the branch that was being used by some of the attackers. Duncan was a solid man of Islander appearance who had been wearing a distinctive sleeveless T-shirt, and there was no obvious reason for the witness to confuse him with Sione Amone who had been excluded by the other witnesses. 
     
      
    245 Having regard to the remaining evidence and to the contemporaneity of the initial account, and the witness’ acknowledgement that the statement had been truthful to the best of his knowledge and ability at the time of its making, I am not persuaded that it should have been regarded as unreliable. 
     
      
    246 In any event, it is well established that the “unfairness”, with which s 135 and s 137 are concerned relate to the risk of the evidence provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or of it being given more weight than it truly deserves: R v Nguyen (2002) NSWCCA 342 at para 28 and R v Suteski (2002) NSWCCA 509 at para 116. The fact that the evidence may be weak, or the subject of challenge, is not of itself a ground for its exclusion: Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at para 51 per McHugh J. 
     
      
    247 Moreover, evidence of one witness’ identification may properly be taken into account in the context of the evidence as a whole: R v Tugaga (1994) 74 A Crim R 190 at 196 and R v Rima (2003) NSWCCA 405. In the present case, there was evidence as to Duncan’s involvement from Alana Ljubicic, Carla Busuttil and Sione Amone. Additionally, there was evidence as to the presence of blood consistent with that of the victim on his shorts, and as to him searching for a weapon before the attack. 
     
      
    248 A reading of the examination in chief and the cross-examination shows that the witness Siljanoski was somewhat uncooperative, and was obviously attempting to avoid saying anything that would be harmful to the Appellants. In those circumstances the case bears some similarity to that which came before this Court in R v GAC NSWCCA 1 April 1997. In that case the fact that the witness’ memory or certainty as to events which he had recounted to police, soon after the relevant events, had only failed him at the critical stage, and the fact that he was available for cross-examination at the trial, were each taken into account in determining whether leave should have been given. 
     
      
    249 Clear directions were given in relation to visual identification evidence, both generally and specifically, and in considerable detail, in relation to the care which needed to be given in relation to Siljanoski’s evidence on that aspect of the case. The issues which arose in relation to s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act were essentially the same as those arising under s 192(2)(b), as was the case in Regina v GAC. Moreover the defence had ample opportunity to cross-examine him on the prior statement and to obtain answers which potentially assisted their case, subject of course to an assessment of their credibility.  
     
      
    250 No argument was advanced at trial to the effect that the use of the evidence should be restricted under s 136 to that which was permissible prior to the enactment of the Evidence Act. In any event no proper basis would have been established for such a restriction, since the out of court statement went directly to the events in question, was made shortly after their occurrence, and the witness was clearly being evasive and protective of the Appellants. This ground has not been made good. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 2 – HIS HONOUR ERRED IN PERMITTING THE CROWN TO ADDUCE EVIDENCE OF QUESTIONING OF THE APPELLANT DURING THE SEARCH.  
       
      
    251 A voir dire examination was conducted in relation to the admissibility of this evidence, which related to the questioning of the Appellant, in his bedroom, during the search of the premises where he lived. A video was tendered of this search and of the questioning that occurred.252 In the course of earlier questioning at the police station, the Appellant had said to police that he was wearing his jeans, a grey ""cut off like, top thing"", and the jacket and shoes that he was wearing during the interview. He said that the rest of his clothes were at his home and he agreed to let police search the premises for them.253 While he was in his bedroom, he pointed out the grey sleeved T-shirt, which was then taken into police custody, along with his jacket and shoes. The only part of the video recording objected to a trial was the following question and answer: 
     
      
        
       
        
        Kelly: “Who does the washing here?” 
         
        Duncan: “I do”.  
        
       
      
    254 That answer was relied upon by the Crown as a lie, in so far as Sheree Machan had given evidence that it was she who washed his clothing, on a daily basis.255 The admissibility of this portion of the conversation was challenged, at trial, and upon appeal, by reference to s 13 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. That section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        13 Admissibility of certain statements etc 
         
         
        (1) Any statement, confession, admission or information made or given to a member of the police force by a child who is a party to criminal proceedings shall not be admitted in evidence in those proceedings unless:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) there was present at the place where, and throughout the period of time during which, it was made or given:  
           
           
          (i) a person responsible for the child, 
           
            
             
            (ii) an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the person responsible for the child, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) in the case of a child who is of or above the age of 16 years—an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the child, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iv) a barrister or solicitor of the child’s own choosing, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) the person acting judicially in those proceedings:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) is satisfied that there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such an adult from the place where, or throughout the period of time during which, the statement, confession, admission or information was made or given, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the statement, confession, admission or information should be admitted in evidence in those proceedings. 
            
           
          
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (2)... 
        
       
       
        
        (3)… 
        
       
      
    256 It was asserted that the requirement that the support person be ""present at the place"" where, and throughout the period of time during which, the Appellant's statement was made, meant that such person had to be physically located in the bedroom where the discussion took place.257 The video shows the Appellant speaking to police. It does not show the mother or the girlfriend at the time of this conversation, although it is evident from a viewing of the video as a whole that they were present in the dwelling which contained this bedroom.258 The house was small, there were only a few rooms, and there was not much space in the bedroom where the Appellant and police were standing. Detective Kelly said, on the voir dire, that his last recollection of the mother was of her standing in the corridor about 3 metres from where he and the Appellant stood. He was unable to say precisely where she was at the time of the particular question and answer.259 The Appellant propounded a test for the section as one which required the support person to be ""in a physical position to influence the questioning"". This involves something of an overstatement. I am of the view that the section should be understood in the way that was outlined by me in Regina v Phung and Huynh NSWSC 26 February 2001:  
     
      
       
        
        “34. It may be accepted that the purpose of the legislative regime, that now applies to the interview of children, and particularly those in custody following arrest, is to protect them from any disadvantage inherent in their age, as well as to protect them from any form of police impropriety. As to the former, what is required is compliance with the procedure laid down so as to prevent the young or vulnerable accused from being overawed by the occasion of being interviewed, at a police station, by detectives who are likely to be considerably older and more experienced than they are. 
        
       
       
        
        35. This principle derives from what was said by Lee J in  
        Warren  
        (1982) 2 NSWLR 360; by Roden J in 
         Williams 
         NSW Supreme Court 9 August 1982; by Hunt J in 
         Cotton 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 593; by Carruthers J in 
         Dunn 
         NSW CCA 15 April 1992; and also by Hidden J in H (supra). 
        
       
       
        
        36. The role of the support person is to act as a check upon possible unfair or oppressive behaviour; to assist a child, particularly one who is timid, inarticulate, immature, or inexperienced in matters of law enforcement, who appears to be out of his or her depth, or in need of advice; and also to provide the comfort that accompanies knowledge that there is an independent person present during the interview. That role cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled if the support person is himself or herself immature, inexperienced, unfamiliar with the English language, or otherwise unsuitable for the task expected, that is, to intervene if any situation of apparent unfairness or oppression arises, and to give appropriate advice if it appears the child needs assistance in understanding his or her rights.” 
        
       
      
    260 These observations were cited, with apparent approval by this Court in Regina v Tang (2001) NSWCCA 210 where Greg James J, with whom Spigelman CJ agreed, said, additionally: 
     
      
       
        
        “58 It can be seen from the structure of the provision that it lays the onus entirely upon the Crown, should it seek to tender the material. The section, by providing the exceptions, provides circumstances in the absence of which the evidence must be, in law, rejected. Other provisions, eg., those in Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act 1995 make further provision for the admissibility and inadmissibility of such material. My view of s. 13 is that for the Appellant to satisfy this court that, in the admitted absence of such a person as s.13(1)(as) refers to, there was a significant possibility the evidence would be rejected, merely requires the Appellant to satisfy us that there is a significant possibility, notwithstanding that the police were misinformed as to his birth date, that a judge would still reject the evidence. The judge is required to do that unless, even if satisfied there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such an adult, only if that judge considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the evidence should be admitted. On consideration of such a matter, a judge would have regard to the history of provisions of this kind (see  
        Regina v. Aquilina  
        (1978) 1 NSWLR 358;  
        Regina v. Warren  
        (1982) 2 NSWLR 360;  
        McKellar & Booth v. Smith  
        (1982) 2 NSWLR 950;

        … 
        
       
       
        
        60 It must be noted that the law not only requires the affording of an opportunity to a child during an interrogation to exercise on proper advice the option to speak or remain silent, but to have that advice so as to give consideration as to whether, in speaking, they might produce an account which does not do justice to their position.” 
        
       
      
    261 It would normally be necessary for the support person to be within a sufficient proximity to provide the protection which the section contemplates. It would not be enough, for example, if the support person was allowed to speak to the suspect but then required to wait in the general office of the police station, while the suspect was interviewed elsewhere. Nor would it be sufficient if the interview was conducted wholly out of earshot of the support person, or in a language which the latter did not understand.262 In the present case, while it is clear that the support person was in the company, in a broad sense, of the Appellant, at all times, there was no evidence to show her precise location at the time of the relevant question and answer, or to show whether she was in a position to hear the conversation.263 The trial Judge found that, on the balance of probabilities, both the accused mother and Sheree Machan were in the house throughout the period of the search, and held that this was sufficient to meet the statutory requirement. Alternatively, His Honour held that if he was in error in this respect, then there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of the support person at the relevant time, and that the statement should be admitted into evidence, in accordance with s 13(b) of the Act.  
     
      
    264 A submission was developed to the effect that his Honour addressed the wrong question in so far as he focused upon the place where the search took place as distinct from the place where, and the time at which, the relevant statement was made. This involves something of a literal reading of the reasons, but whether His Honour erred in this respect or not, it remains appropriate for us to determine whether error occurred by reference to the issue which appropriately arose, that is, whether the support person was present at the place where, and at the time when, the relevant statement was made by the Appellant.  
     
      
    265 The onus of establishing admissibility rested upon the Crown. Absent proof of sufficient physical proximity at the time of the relevant question, it needed to rely on s 13(b). There was a strong argument available in the circumstances of a search which was being conducted, while those concerned were walking through a small house, and conversing briefly in a bedroom, which was barely large enough to contain the Appellant and the officers who were conducting and recording the search, that there was sufficient and proper reason for the absence of the support person in the immediate vicinity of that conversation. However, where the evidence which was to be adduced merely went to credibility, I am not persuaded that the second leg of s 13(b)(ii) was satisfied.266 That is not, however, a sufficient basis to quash the conviction. The evidence in question was of little moment in the entirety of the trial, as indicated by the fact that it was not the subject of mention in the summing up. I am not persuaded that its admission gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. If error occurred then the proviso applies. 
     
      
      GROUND 3 – His Honour Erred in His Directions to the Jury Regarding the Evidence of Identification 
       
      
    267 This ground essentially involves the assertion that his Honour failed to give a warning in relation to the evidence elicited from Siljanoski, in cross-examination, as one of the persons involved in the assault, when giving his initial statement to police.  
     
      
    268 The difficulty with this ground is that no additional direction was sought by counsel for Duncan at trial even though, at the request of counsel for Perre, a comprehensive direction was given in relation to the matters which may have rendered his identification of Perre unreliable. Many of those, for example, his distance from the fight, the poor conditions of visibility, his asserted eyesight problems, were common for each Appellant, and there is no reason to suppose that the jury overlooked those matters.269 There was an important difference between the appellants in so far as Siljanoski’s evidence at trial introduced some qualification as to the extent of his knowledge of Perre. He did not do so in relation to Duncan, who, it was common ground, had been well known to him and who had arrived at the park in the same motor vehicle.  
     
      
    270 The only direction that was sought by counsel for Duncan, in this respect, was to point out to the jury the fact that when giving evidence in chief, Siljanoski had not mentioned seeing Duncan in the group attacking the victim, that it was only in cross-examination that it emerged that he had given an account of seeing him in that group, and further, that he had given an explanation in that he wished to rectify what he had said in that statement.271 That this was the case could not have been other than crystal clear to the jury. There had been extensive cross-examination on the issue, and when dealing with the address of counsel for Duncan, his Honour reminded them that she had pointed out that Siljanoski had ""said that there were things in that statement that he'd never said, and she submitted that you would find that he was trying to put things right in the evidence that he gave to you.""  
     
      
    272 While it is the case that a recital by a trial judge, in a summing up, of an argument put by counsel cannot substitute for a caution or direction where it is required, a failure to deliver such a caution or direction does need to be considered in the context of the trial, and in particular in the context of what was obvious to the jury.273 Counsel, in this instance, was not seeking a direction or caution. At most, a comment was sought drawing a distinction between what had been said out of court and pre-trial, albeit in a context where counsel had been able to cross-examine the witness in a way that was favourable to his case, subject to the jury's assessment of the witness’s credibility.274 Moreover, this was a case where a comprehensive direction had earlier been given in relation to the way that consistency or inconsistency of account could be taken into account in judging witnesses. In my view, Rule 4 applies and leave should be refused to argue this ground.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 4 – His Honour Erred in His Directions to the Jury Regarding “Lies” 
       
      
    275 In relation to the topic of lies, his Honour gave the following general direction: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The next direction that I must give you is about  
        lies 
        . It has been part of the Crown submissions made to you that each of the accused has told lies at various stages, including lies to the police and, in the case of Mr Perre who gave evidence, lies in Court. You will make up your own mind about whether either of the accused was telling lies and, if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case, but I give you this morning, do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something that is evidence of guilt."" 
        
       
      
    276 Thereafter, when dealing with the case concerning each accused, his Honour carefully pointed out that the lies which the Crown asserted that each had told went only to the credibility of the accounts which they had given in their ERISPs or, in Perre’s case, additionally in his evidence. In that respect his Honour also pointed out that Duncan's ERISP, having been tendered, was before them as his version of events.277 For example when dealing with Perre’s evidence of not having remembered things, and of being asleep in the car, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""They are matters concerned with, to a large extent, with aspects of Mr Perre’s credibility and your assessment of him in terms of whether he is telling the truth in the witness box. On those kinds of grounds alone, you would not convict Mr Perre of course, but they are matters to be taken into account in assessing whether you think he is telling you the truth about his movements and his actions on the night."" 
         
        
       
      
    278 In relation to the sixth reason advanced by the Crown in relation to Duncan, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        "" Item number six is Mr Duncan's version given to police in his interview, where the Crown says he lied. I have already given you a direction in respect of lies. If you find them in fact to be deliberate lies, and if you found that to be the only thing made out by the Crown, that in itself would not support a finding of guilt. But you have regard to all of the evidence in the case and all of the submissions made by the Crown."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    279 This then was a case where the Crown made it clear that it did not rely on lies, in either case, as consciousness of guilt, for which a direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 would have been required. It specifically relied on lies only on as a matter that went to the credibility of the versions of facts put forward by the two appellants.280 The decision of the High Court in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 is pertinent. It was there held that an Edwards direction should only be given where the prosecution contends that a lie is evidence of guilt. When there is a concern as to the risk of the jury engaging in an impermissible process of reasoning, and of elevating lies which are relied upon as going to credibility alone, as matters going to proof of guilt, then, the Court held, the type of direction which was given in this case, should be given.281 In circumstances where His Honour underlined, on several occasions, that the prosecution relied upon Duncan's lies only as going to the credibility of his answers in the ERISP, where a Zoneff direction was given, and where no Edwards direction was sought at trial, this ground is without merit. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 5 – His Honour Failed to Adequately Direct the Jury as to Specific Intent and the Alternative to the First Count on the Indictment 
       
      
    282 This ground needs to be understood in the light of the entirety of the directions that were given in relation to intention, in relation to the way in which the Crown put it case on the principal count, and in relation to the statutory alternative of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (which was properly left having regard, for example, to Regina v King [2004] NSWCCA 20).283 Early in the summing up, his Honour gave some general directions in relation to the expressions ""maliciously"" and ""intentionally"". They were somewhat incomplete in relation to ""maliciously"", in so far as his Honour only said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Something is done maliciously, if it is done intentionally and without lawful excuse”.  
        
       
      
    284 Any inadequacy in this direction was however corrected when his Honour returned, a little later, to give a redirection concerning this expression.285 In relation to intention his Honour gave an entirely unexceptional direction, in so far as he explained that this word had its ordinary English meaning, and also explained how it was that intention could be inferred, or deduced, from the circumstances in which certain activities occurred. In the course thereof, his Honour made it clear that the Crown had to prove, in relation to Count 1, that there was an intention to occasion the victim grievous bodily harm.286 The elements for Count 1 were summarised by way of a direction that there were three elements to be made out beyond reasonable doubt: ""... that there was grievous bodily harm inflicted upon Christopher Wilson, that that was done maliciously, and that was done with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm."" 
     
      
    287 His Honour then moved on to the statutory alternative, explaining that it was also necessary, in order for this count to be made out, that the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of grievous bodily harm and malice, the only difference being that, for this count, the Crown did not have to prove the specific intent to do grievous bodily harm.288 Next, his Honour dealt with the joint criminal enterprise, both in its basic form and its extended form where the Crown relied upon common purpose.289 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The law is that where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. A joint criminal enterprises exist where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. 
         
         
        The understanding or arrangement need not be express. That means they do not have to actually say or write down anything expressing that agreement and its’ existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any particular time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit a crime."" 
         
        
       
      
    290 His Honour applied this principle to the present case, first in general terms, and then specifically in relation to the evidence. He began with the following directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has sought to rely upon two alternatives which are commonly referred to in a discussion of joint criminal enterprise. The first is this, if the agreed crime is committed by one or others of the parties to that joint criminal enterprise or if all played some part in committing that crime, then all parties are equally guilty of the crime, regardless of the part played by each in its commission. I will give you an illustration of that shortly. 
         
         
        The alternative aspect of it is this, where firstly instead of the crime agreed another crime is committed by one or other of the parties to that joint criminal enterprise or, secondly, all played some part in committing that other crime and, thirdly, where the Crown has established that the parties to that enterprise had contemplated that other crime as a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime, all parties are equally guilty of that other crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission. It does not matter then that the crime committed does not correspond in every detail with that contemplated by the parties. What must be contemplated by the parties is the substantial risk, not merely a slender chance, that it will be committed."" 
        
       
      
    291 His Honour dealt with the element of participation in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person participates in a joint criminal enterprise either by committing the crime charged itself or with knowledge that the crime is to be committed by intentionally assisting or encouraging another party to the joint criminal enterprise to commit a crime. The presence of a person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give  
        and 
         if required are sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participants in the joint criminal enterprise to commit a crime."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      Almost certainly the emphasised “and” in this passage was a mistype for the word “assistance”. 
       
      
    292 Some illustrations followed of joint enterprises which came into being spontaneously, or as a result of planning, in the course of which his Honour pointed out the ways in which the participants would become criminally responsible for the acts of those who were involved in the enterprise. His directions were explicit and correct.293 It was at this point that his Honour applied these directions to the first count in the present case, with an explanation to the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “You, if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the ingredients of the offence, can come to a finding of guilt in respect of the first offence in the indictment by different ways. Firstly, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused personally and maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Chris Wilson with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm, that is by causing the injuries personally.” 
        
       
      
    294 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now where you have got a number of people attacking another it may be difficult to show on the evidence that any one particular person in the attack inflicted a particular injury amounting to grievous bodily harm and you might well be justified in taking that view in this case as to either of these accused. 
         
         
        There is then, and this is why the Crown relies on joint criminal enterprise, a different way in which you can come to a finding of guilt in this case in (sic) that is by finding beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was part of a group, some of whom individually or together, maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Christopher Wilson with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm and others who assisted or encouraged that to take place, knowing it is occurring, that is that grievous bodily harm is being inflicted or that it will occur. 
         
         
        There is the third possibility and that is much the same as in the second alternative I have just given you, but without the accused actually knowing that grievous bodily harm is being inflicted or will be inflicted, but having in contemplation that it may be occurring, it might be inflicted, or that it may occur, that it might be inflicted... 
         
         
        When you come to consider that possibility it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that the precise injuries actually inflicted were within the contemplation of the accused, but only to prove to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that it was within the contemplation of the accused that grievous bodily harm of some form might be occurring or might occur and you will remember what I said to you about grievous bodily harm, it is bodily injury of a really serious kind. So in order for you to find guilt on that basis it is not necessary for you to find that it was within the contemplation of either of the accused that Christopher Wilson suffer the precise injuries he did or necessarily to the extent that he did but, if you were to come to a finding of guilt on that basis, it is necessary that you find beyond reasonable doubt that it was within the contemplation of either of the accused that bodily injury of a really serious kind was being inflicted or might be inflicted."" 
        
       
      
    295 These directions were then specifically related to the Appellant Duncan, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of the accused Mr Duncan, just going to the evidence in respect of him and this all depends upon your findings as to fact of course, if you were to find that he took part in a group attack on Christopher Wilson on the basis that he was part of a group which together maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Christopher Wilson with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to him and that they all helped each other with the same intent as demonstrated by their actions towards Christopher Wilson, then you would be entitled to find the accused Mr Duncan guilty of that first offence. 
         
         
        You would also be entitled to find him guilty if you were to find that any part of his behaviour from the time of making a phone call to Jason Kusonogovski through taking the mobile phone from Matthew Michael to, if you found it to be the case, luring the Sydney boys down to the car park to trying to run them down with the car, if that is what you find it to be, was with the intention that others of the group would fight the - for want of a better term what I will call the Sydney boys - and cause one or more of them grievous bodily harm with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm or with the intention that others of the group would fight the Sydney boys and in so doing might cause one or more of them grievous bodily harm with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm as I say, that will also be one way of finding guilt."" 
        
       
      
    296 At the next break, in response to his Honour's invitation to counsel to raise any matters of concern, counsel for Duncan then sought a redirection based upon the proposition that the evidence might support a conviction upon the statutory alternative to the principal count, but not upon the principal count itself.297 This involved a submission that there was a possible view of the evidence open which meant that, while Duncan may have initiated the altercation, he was unaware of the presence of any weapons in the possession of his associates, or of the possibility of their use, or of the ferocity of the attack upon which they embarked, such that the only count available would be in the alternative.298 The Crown referred his Honour to the decisions in R v Esho and Sako [2001] NSWCCA 415 and Regina v Gilbert Adam (1999) 47 NSWLR 267, in relation to joint enterprise and the alternative count.299 After the break his Honour revisited the directions previously given in relation to specific intention, malice, and the statutory alternative. In relation to the element involving specific intention, His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""You will recall that I said that one element of ‘malice’, or ‘maliciously’, was doing something intentionally, and I also said that intent or intention, intentionally had the same meaning as the word ‘intent’ and its associates as ‘intent’ is used later on in the charge where it reads ‘with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson’. Let me make it clear that the intent to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson, where it is used as the final words of that charge, referred to the specific intention to do grievous bodily harm to Christopher Wilson. As I have said to you, it dose (sic) not necessarily mean to the extent of the injuries actually inflicted but it does mean specifically to do grievous bodily harm to him."" 
         
         
         
        
       
      
    300 After reminding the jury that the Crown also had to prove that the accused acted maliciously, his Honour first read to them the statutory definition of that expression and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Maliciously 
        , as used in count 1, does not precisely equate with the words ‘with intent to case grievous bodily harm’. In order to prove malice, it is sufficient for the Crown to prove indifference to human life or suffering, or intent to injure in some way, which might in fact fall short of grievous bodily harm, or recklessness, or wantonness. And the difference between count 1 in the indictment and the statutory alternative, of course does not lie in the use of the word ‘maliciously’ but lies in the presence of the words in count 1 ‘with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson’ and the absence of that element from the statutory alternative. So that in order to convict in respect of count 1 in the indictment, you would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the Crown case that the accused intended to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson. If you are not so satisfied of that but you were satisfied of the other elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt, then you would be entitled to find the accused guilty on the statutory alternative."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    301 No further complaint was made by counsel in relation to these directions. It was however submitted on appeal that the directions were misleading and deficient, in that there was a failure to apply the evidence that was available to support the elements of the primary count and of the statutory alternative, in a way which differentiated between them.302 In essence, it was contended that: 
     
      
       
      (i) The summing up was confusing, and blurred the concepts of malice, specific intent, and the elements of the statutory alternative; 
       
       
      (ii) it did not provide sufficient direction upon the elements of the offences and the burden and standard of proof that was applicable to each; and that 
       
       
      (iii) there should have been directions, although none were sought at trial, to the effect that mere presence as a bystander is insufficient to incur criminal liability:  
      Regina v Doorey & Gage 
       [1970] 3 NSWR 351 and  
      Regina v Clarkson 
       (1971) 1 WLR 1402, and that a person who is present at the commission of a crime is not liable as an accessory, unless he intentionally assists or encourages the principal offender to commit a crime:  
      Regina v Stokes and Difford  
      (1990) 51 A Crim R 25.  
       
      
    303 I am not persuaded that there is any substance in these submissions, or that his Honour failed to give the jury a sufficient explanation of the ways in which the Appellant could be held criminally responsible, upon the first count or the statutory alternative respectively, for the attack upon Christopher Wilson, in accordance with the principles identified in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 and McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108. These directions did not, on a fair reading, obscure the difference between the principal charge and the alternative.304 It is not clear what was intended by the submission that the directions were unclear as to the ingredients of the primary offence, or as to the burden and standard of proof applicable thereto. The elements of the first count, and of the alternative, were specifically and correctly identified. His Honour made it clear, from the outset, that the onus of proof of those elements rested upon the Crown, and that it was one requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt. At no time was anything said to derogate from that, or to blur the distinction between the elements required for the primary count and the alternative, respectively.305 The submission that the concepts of malice and specific intent were blurred in the directions which were initially given, concerning the first count, is similarly without merit. The passages which I have extracted show that, when the summing up is considered as a whole, adequate and clear directions were given which separated the two elements. The jury could not have been left in any uncertainty in this respect, as was also made abundantly clear in the final two paragraphs of the last extracted section of the summing up.306 I turn next to the submission that his Honour should have given a direction to the jury, in the terms that was sought by trial counsel, as to the circumstances in which the jury should convict on the statutory alternative rather than the primary count. The direction sought was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""The Crown has relied on the presence and use of weapons such as machetes, iron bars, stakes, wheel braces and a wheel lock, as evidence of intention that really serious bodily harm would or could be inflicted. In respect of Paul Duncan if you are satisfied on the remaining elements required to make out count 1 of the indictment, but you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Paul Duncan knew of the presence or use of such weapons, you would convict on the statutory alternative, that is maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm in circumstances without intent to inflict grievous bodily harm."" 
         
        
       
      
    307 In essence Duncan asserts that this involved a hypothesis, consistent with innocence, which should have been the subject of a specific direction. There are obvious problems with that submission. First a hypothesis consistent with innocence must be both reasonable and available on the evidence: R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203 (at para 56) and R v Skaf and Others [2004] NSWCCA 74 (at para 190-191). In the present case the Appellant had made an inquiry of Gjoreski for a weapon before the incident began. He had also asked Ljubicic whether she had anything. He acknowledged to police that he saw some persons with a bat, and there was evidence previously mentioned as to his personal involvement in the fight, in the course of which it must have been patently obvious that weapons were being used.308 In any event, the jury were not left uninformed in relation to the fact that this was an argument which had been advanced by the defence, in so far as his Honour said that counsel had:  
     
      
       
        
        “submitted to you that, before that, you would find there was a verbal slanging match and that at the time that Paul Duncan got into the car no weapons had been produced by the group called the party goers and that you would be satisfied that there’s no evidence that Paul Duncan knew that such weapons were to be used or that there would be an overall stoush, as she put it, between the two groups."" 
        
       
      
    309 Finally, in relation to this ground, is the submission that the directions were deficient in so far as there was no instruction that mere presence of a bystander was insufficient, and that a person who is present at the scene is not liable as an accessory unless he intentionally assists or encourages the principal offender to commit the offence.310 I am not persuaded that this ground is made good. The prosecution case was always one depending upon the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Appellant’s active participation in a joint enterprise. Comprehensive directions were given in relation to joint enterprise and participation, and the suggested directions would not only have been superfluous but they risked complicating what was already a sufficiently complicated matter.311 This ground is not made good. 
     
      
      GROUND 6 – His Honour Failed to Direct the Jury with Respect to the Evidence of Siljanoski 
       
      
    312 This is essentially a repetition of Ground 3, which has already been addressed. It is not made good.  
     
      
       
      ADDITIONAL GROUND 7 –  
       
      His Honour erred in his directions to invite the jury to convict upon a basis apart from a proper evaluation of the evidence and its application to the ingredients of the offence (by leave) 
       
      
    313 The Crown Prosecutor offered ten reasons why, in her submission, the jury should find Duncan guilty. In summary they were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Sione Amone’s evidence of seeing Duncan chase the Sydney group up the hill;  
       
       
      (ii) Carla Busuttil’s evidence of seeing Duncan, Big Chi and Jap hitting and kicking the man on the ground; 
       
       
      (iii) Oliver Gjoreski’s evidence, before the attack, of Duncan asking if he had a baseball bat and then making a search of the boot of his car; 
       
       
      (iv) Steven Siljanoski’s initial statement to police in which he described seeing Duncan and Perre in the group of men who were striking the victim; 
       
       
      (v) Alana Ljubicic’s initial statement to police of Duncan getting out of her car, at a time when people were yelling out “get something” and of them seeing him and Jap in the fights.  
       
       
      (vi) The fact that Duncan told lies in the ERISP to the effect that he had not been at the party, that he had not telephoned Jason Kusonogovski, that he left the park with Alana Ljubojevic, that he was near the car in which Christina Kusonogovski was seated when the fights started, and that the first thing he saw was Asians running down the hill towards him, that persons called “Vim” and “Huy” (whom no one else mentioned) were at the scene, that he was chased by two persons, one of whom had a bat, that he had not realised that Christina Kusonogovski was in the park until Jason Kusonogovski arrived and that he had not got into the red Laser or gone on to Lake Heights; 
       
       
      (vii) The fact of his erratic driving which was only consistent with provocative conduct on his part, and inconsistent with an attempt to get away; 
       
       
      (viii) The fact that blood having the same DNA profile as the victim was found on his shorts; 
       
       
      (ix) the fact that Mathew Michael’s SIM card was found in the pocket of those shorts; 
       
       
      (x) The evidence pointing to him being the last person to get into the red Laser that was driven away, initially by Jose Elbert and then by Big Chi.  
       
      
    314 This ground focuses on the following observations by his Honour, which preceded his summary of the ten points relied upon by the Crown:  
     
      
       
        
        “Let me say, that if you were satisfied that the case had been made out beyond reasonable doubt by  
        any one of those 10 reasons 
        , then that would be sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused. The Crown does not argue, and does not have to argue, that it requires all of that evidence to be accepted by you in order for you to find the accused guilty, but taking into account the evidence that you do find established, you must, before coming to a conclusion of guilt be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that guilt."" 
        
       
      
    315 The opening sentence was somewhat unfortunate, although properly understood I am satisfied that it did not bear out the connotation which is sought to be placed upon it, namely, that the Appellant's guilt could be established if any one of the 10 reasons was made good. That is not what was said. Read fairly, what his Honour was saying was that if any of the ten reasons left the jury satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Appellant's guilt, then it did not matter if some or even all of the others were not made good. It is obvious from the nature of the matters listed that no single one of them taken alone, save for item (ii), could prove the Appellant’s guilt. Nor did the Crown Prosecutor suggest that to be the case.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    316 That this was the sense of what was conveyed to the jury emerges with crystal clarity from the additional observations which his Honour made.  
     
      
    317 At the next adjournment, Counsel pointed to the possibly misleading nature of the opening observations.  
     
      
    318 His Honour then put the matter beyond doubt by directing the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: members of the jury, let me just return to what I was saying before lunch about the Crown's arguments in respect of the guilt of Mr Duncan. Just to make it clear. The Crown does not have to prove each and every one of those items of evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown does not, in fact, have to prove any one of those items of evidence beyond reasonable doubt. You consider all of the evidence and you decide on the basis of all of the evidence whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the ingredients or elements of the offence of count 1 in the indictment, are made out and only then would you convict Mr Duncan. If you are not so satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the elements of that offence, then you would find him not guilty of course. And the same applies to each of the other offences. For instance, you may well think that if the only evidence in the case was that of Ms Busuttil, that you could have difficulty convicting on the basis of that. Similarly, if you had only the evidence of Mr Siljanoski, you may well think you would have great difficulty convicting on the basis of that, and so on with some of the other aspects of the evidence. It depends on what you think of it, and I am not trying to tell you what to think of any one particular witnesses evidence, that you make of it. It may be that on the basis of some other aspect of the evidence that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that alone. But what the Crown says to you is when you take account of all of that evidence, you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt because those various aspects of the evidence buttress and support each other for you to come to the conclusion, in the end that the accused is guilty."" 
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    319 Subsequently, his Honour made it clear that in relation to Counts 3 and 4, the only evidence of Duncan smashing the motor vehicle was that of Carla Busuttil, and directed the jury that in order to convict him on those counts, they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was ""telling the truth and accurately recounting what had occurred...so far as those particular aspects are concerned"". This was accompanied by a direction to scrutinise her evidence carefully. This ground is also not made good. 320 For these reasons I am of the view that Duncan's appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
      DUNCAN SENTENCE APPEAL 
       
       
      GROUND (a) - His Honour Made Erroneous Findings as to the Objective Circumstances of the Offence. 
       
      
    321 It was submitted that his Honour overstated the role, and the objective criminality, of the Appellant, in so far as he found that he had been “the architect of the night’s events”, and had “deliberately set about inciting an attack upon” the Sydney group. It was also submitted that he erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that Duncan had been part of the group beating Christopher Wilson and in so far as he added:  
     
      
       
        
        “You were very prominent this night. You were in the centre of attention for a number of reasons. You had summoned your troops. You drove the car dangerously. You got out of the car. There is not a single witness who says they saw you just standing by, watching what was going on, or, for that matter, doing anything else unconnected with the assault on Christopher Wilson. Not one of them says anything like “Babe was with me while Christopher Wilson was being assaulted. 
        
       
       
        
        However I should also say that it seems to me to add or subtract little from your criminal culpability whether you were the person involved in beating Christopher Wilson. The alternative is that you stood by and watched all [the] people you had called up, and provoked, did so, and you did nothing to stop them… 
        
       
       
        
        In the circumstances, having stirred up and unleashed your followers, if you did stand back, the only reasonable conclusion to reach is virtually letting them to (sic) your dirty work. In my view, there would not be a matter sounding in mitigation of this offence.” 
        
       
      
    322 These findings, it was submitted, were not properly open on the evidence, and that rather than the incident having involved a planned attack, it was one that unexpectedly developed and escalated, in the volatile circumstances of the night.  
     
      
    323 Further it was contended that although his Honour found that Carla Busuttil’s evidence was buttressed by that of Steven Siljanoski, there was still a deficiency of evidence to establish that this Appellant was one of the persons who had personally assaulted the victim, or alternatively that he knowingly stood by and encouraged those who were directly involved in the attack to beat and assault the victim. 
     
      
    324 This Court is a Court of error, it does not conduct a review of factual findings unless there was no evidence to support those findings: R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351, R v Kelly (1993) 30 NSWLR 64; House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499; R v Crowley [2004] NSWCCA 256; R v Randell and McAlister [2004] NSWCCA 337. 
     
      
    325 In the present case there was evidence to support the findings that by his actions Duncan initiated the events that led to the attack upon the victim, and that he personally participated in the attack. There was no evidence of premeditation, and to that extent it may be accepted, in the Appellant’s favour, that the incident escalated somewhat quickly, and did not begin with any specific intention on the Appellant’s part to occasion grievous bodily harm, specifically to Christopher Wilson as distinct from someone in the Sydney group. The Appellant’s submission that there was no evidence to show that he was present when the victim was attacked, cannot be sustained, and at best comes very close to traversing the jury’s verdict.  
     
      
    326 In the particular circumstances of this case, while it was properly open for his Honour to find that the Appellant was an active participant in the violence inflicted upon the victim, I am also unpersuaded that the alternative scenario, which would still have involved the Appellant’s participation in a joint venture which he had initiated, would have involved any significant lessening in his objective criminality.  
     
      
       
      GROUNDS (b) AND (c): 
       
       
      b) His Honour Rejected or Failed to Adequately Take Into Account the Subjective Findings Favourable to the Applicant that were Available and Uncontested on the Evidence. 
       
       
      c) His Honour Failed to Adequately Consider the Age of the Offender and the Evidence of Rehabilitation. 
       
      
    327 The Appellant was born on 26 November 1983 and was aged 17 years and 11 months at the time of the offence. He had a juvenile record which included entries for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two counts of affray, which had attracted Community Service Orders only four months earlier, two offences of driving while disqualified, one offence of reckless driving and one offence of drive conveyance taken without consent. He was subject to a 2 year Order for Probation in relation the second drive while disqualified offence, at the time of the current offences.  
     
      
    328 He had been kept in detention for 9 months following his arrest, before being bailed. He had established a record of exemplary behaviour during that period.  
     
      
    329 There was also evidence in his favour that he had been of good behaviour, had been employed and was living in a steady domestic situation while he was on bail.  
     
      
    330 There were reports before his Honour from Juvenile Justice Officer Kilby, Dr Westmore and Associate Professor Susan Hayes. There was also a substantial number of character references.  
     
      
    331 His Honour was somewhat critical of Officer Kilby’s report in so far as the Appellant’s regret for his actions, and realisation of the wrongness thereof, which that officer recorded, were said to be inconsistent with his denial of any responsibility for the offence. His Honour also rejected this Officer’s suggestion that the situation got out of control due to peer pressure, immaturity, and alcohol, upon the basis that the Appellant had been in complete control of matters, and showed no difficulty in carrying out the physical and mental steps involved.  
     
      
    332 His Honour was also critical of Dr Westmore’s report, in so far as the history which the Appellant was recorded as giving was considered to have been “almost entirely at variance with the evidence given at the trial and with the jury’s verdict.” This account, his Honour found, demonstrated the emptiness and insincerity of the expressions of remorse which he had purportedly disclosed to Officer Kilby, indicating a lack of insight, and being suggestive of a habit of minimising his criminal culpability in defiance of the proved or admitted facts.  
     
      
    333 His Honour was similarly critical of the report of Professor Hayes in so far as the history which she was apparently given by the Appellant was said to be “far removed from the truth”, and also in so far as she had also offered an opinion that alcohol consumption, or the influence of the peer group, had been major factors in the commission of the offence, and had described the Appellant as remorseful.  
     
      
    334 While his Honour was dismissive of the reports from Dr Westmore and Professor Hayes in relation to their assessment of the triggers for the offences, it remains the fact that they did identify some favourable subjective circumstances, in so far as Dr Westmore saw it as a positive that he had been able to maintain a lengthy relationship with his girlfriend and had reduced his use of recreational drugs and alcohol during the period on bail. He excluded any sign of major psychotic illness, but drew attention to the Appellant’s earlier history of polysubstance abuse.  
     
      
    335 Professor Hayes noted that because of his below average intelligence, he might have been expected to have had limited insight into the causes of his own offending behaviour, in the past, and on this occasion. She also suggested that he may stay out of trouble if he could continue to receive the kind of sympathetic supervision which he had received from the Machan family. Additionally she drew attention to his somewhat dysfunctional background, which had involved abuse of alcohol and violence on the part of his father, and which had eventually led to the break up of the family. It was during this period, when he lacked family support, that his earlier offending had occurred. Psychotic disorders were excluded.  
     
      
    336 In the result his Honour dealt with this aspect of the sentencing exercise in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “You were the ringleader in the perpetration of the terrible events of this night. I find no evidence of any genuine contrition or remorse, nor any acceptance of the jury’s verdict, or its ramifications. Youth is really the only matter in your favour, but considerations of giving greater weight to rehabilitation on that account cannot outweigh the factors to be attributed to the objective circumstances of the offences where there is little to support the youth factor. In your case, there is no contrition or remorse, and no real insight into the nature of what you have done and why.”  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    337 In general terms it was submitted that his Honour should have given greater weight to the expert opinions which had not been challenged by the Crown, and should have made a more positive finding as to the Appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation and also as to his remorse. Similar submissions to those that were advanced in relation to Perre were made, concerning the greater importance of rehabilitation in the sentencing of a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    338 In these respects it was argued that insufficient weight had been given to the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as it applied at the relevant time. 
     
      
    339 I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in relation to his findings as to lack of remorse and contrition, or as to a lack of insight. While the Appellant is not to be additionally punished for defending the proceedings, his continued claim of innocence, and his distortion of the facts when providing histories to the expert witnesses, amply justified his Honour’s findings.  
     
      
    340 I am, however, of the view that his Honour somewhat understated the significance of rehabilitation for a young offender who had a relatively minor record, albeit that he was on Probation, and had only recently received a sentence involving community service, and who had shown some signs of behaving in an acceptable fashion between the time of the offence and the time of sentencing. The principles identified in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 were applicable as was the Appellant’s immaturity (R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; see also s 3A(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). This was subject to a suitable balance being struck in the light of the consideration that the case was one involving extreme violence, and was also one where the offender was approaching adulthood: R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 and R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 per Lee CJ at CL.  
     
      
    341 As these reasons later indicate I have reached the conclusion that the sentence was so far outside an appropriate range of sentencing discretion that at least latent error was disclosed. It may be that, in part, this was due to his Honour giving insufficient weight to these considerations.  
     
      
       
      Ground (d) 
       
      it is submitted that his Honour should have found special circumstances within section 44 of the C 
      rimes Sentencing Procedure Act. 
       
      
    342 His Honour said, in this respect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although it is open to me to find special circumstances on account of youth, and perhaps other matters, in my view, the period of supervision available on parole will be sufficient in view of the structure of the sentences I propose.  
        
       
       
        
        I take into account the eight months eighteen days spent in custody.  
        
       
       
        
        A submission was made on your behalf that I should order that so much of your sentence as possible be served in a juvenile institution. You will be twenty this coming November. Most of your sentence will have to be served in an adult institution. In my view, the concerns about spending your time in an adult institution are not more than apply to most prisoners unfortunately. I see little point in making such an order.”  
        
       
      
    343 It was submitted that there were a number of factors that potentially qualified as special circumstances within the meaning of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, including the Appellant’s age, his stable relationship and support within the Machan family, his prospects for rehabilitation, and the fact that this was to be his first prison sentence, being one that was to be served in an adult gaol. 
     
      
    344 It was also submitted that his Honour erred in apparently viewing the special circumstances to be relevant only in relation to the period during which the offender would be subject to supervision; whereas in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, it had been made clear that the primary consideration should be the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration, and that this encompasses the full range of issues which are relevant to this period. 
     
      
    345 As in the case of Perre, the non-parole period was set at the statutory ratio, and similar considerations arise in relation to this ground, which overlaps with the final ground of challenge to the sentence, concerning whether or not sufficient weight was given to the subjective circumstances of the offender, when the sentence as a whole was constructed. 
     
      
    346 It is to be recalled that it was made clear, by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 (paras 63 and 65), that the ultimate constraint on the discretion of a sentencing judge to find special circumstances warranting a reduction of the non-parole period, is that the non-parole period must itself reflect the criminality involved in the offence, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence. His Honour continued (para 67): 
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
        “Where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of the head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non-parole period. Before a sentencing judge further reduces the non-parole period by reason of that circumstance, he or she must undertake a process of analysis which travels beyond that which has been undertaken in the course of determining the head sentence.” 
        
       
      
    347 In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 the Chief Justice observed at para 18: 
     
      
       
        
        “‘Double counting’ for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non-parole period, must be avoided. (See  
        Simpson  
        at [47]). Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur.” 
        
       
      
    348 It is self evident that the various matters identified by the Appellant were potentially capable of qualifying as special circumstances. The real question is whether they were given sufficient weight in accordance with the decision in Regina v Simpson, which inevitably also drew attention to the potential period of release upon supervision. 
     
      
    349 Two considerations weigh in relation to parole. First, release on parole does provide a constraint on poor behaviour and re-offending in view of the possibility of its revocation and return of the offender to custody to serve the balance of parole. Secondly, there are practical constraints in relation to the period of time for which supervision can be given, as well as questions as to its continued utility where rehabilitation has been achieved. As a result there may, sometimes, be no real purpose in structuring a sentence in a way that will potentially provide an unduly lengthy period of release on parole. In other cases a prolonged period of release on parole may be appropriate.  
     
      
    350 Essentially the same considerations apply in relation the absence of a finding of special circumstances in Duncan’s case, as applied in relation to Perre. The question is inextricably linked with the final ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground (e) - Parity 
       
        
      
    351 The parity argument was largely confined to the comparison that was made with the sentence that had been imposed on Lamacchia.  
     
      
    352 The principle of parity was settled in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 98 A Crim R 134 at 301. For the Court to intervene, it must be satisfied that the difference in sentences between co-offenders, after making sufficient allowance for any differences in their objective and subjective circumstances, would leave the Appellant with a justifiable sense of grievance. As was said in Postiglione at 303: 
     
      
       
        
        “As between co-offenders, different criminal histories and custodial patterns may be such as to justify a real difference in the time each will serve in prison. And, of course, it is necessary when applying the parity principle that like be compared with like. There may be some aspect of one offender’s criminal history or custodial situation which has no counterpart in the case of his or her co-accused. If so, it may justify the imposition of a different sentence or the structuring of the sentence in such a way that it results in some difference in the period actually spent in custody.” 
        
       
      
    353 In the present case there were a number of differences of significance between Duncan and Lamacchia, in that Lamacchia had: 
     
      
       
      (i) pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to an offence contrary to s 35  
      Crimes Act 
       carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years, compared with the s 33 offence which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years to which the Appellant had pleaded not guilty; 
       
       
      (ii) he had confessed to his part in the attack when first interviewed by police; 
       
       
      (iii) he was genuinely contrite and remorseful; 
       
       
      (iv) he was not armed; 
       
       
      (v) he kicked Christopher Wilson twice towards the end of the assault, there being no evidence that his acts caused any particular damage; 
       
       
      (vi) he did this on the spur of the moment without premeditation; 
       
       
      (vii) whilst he had a criminal record it did not include any offences of viole",2004-12-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

      Regina v John Bodie Daniels 
       
       
       
      Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The offender, John Bodie Daniels, was tried for the murder of his partner, Janelle Tahuri, in the early hours of 31 October 2002 at the home unit in which they were living at Mortdale. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. He stands for sentence on the basis that he killed Ms Tahuri by an unlawful and dangerous act, but without the intention to kill her or inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. 
     
      
    2 The jury’s verdict amounts to a rejection of the offender’s account in evidence at the trial which, if accepted, would have meant that he was not criminally responsible for the death. There was no eyewitness in the Crown case, although sounds of a commotion in the unit were heard by other residents in the block. However, sufficient facts for the purpose of sentence can be inferred from the evidence.  
     
      
    3 Ms Tahuri was killed after a violent episode in which the offender angrily remonstrated with her, believing her to have been unfaithful to him. The incident lasted for some time, although for how long I cannot say. It woke their two little children, who were in the unit at the time. He mounted a sustained attack on her, as a result of which she suffered a serious brain injury from which she later died in hospital. I can reach no firm conclusion about the exact nature of the violence which he inflicted upon her throughout the attack but, in the light of the evidence of neighbours and the medical evidence, I am satisfied that the brain injury was the result of his propelling her head against a wall.  
     
      
    4 He had been drinking prior to the incident and I have no doubt that he was affected by liquor, although I cannot say to what extent. At one stage he was heard to say, “Go in and show the fucking kids your face”. It was the Crown case that, when he said that, Ms Tahuri’s face was bleeding from her injuries and he intended the children to see her in that condition. In evidence, he denied that Ms Tahuri’s face was bleeding and, although he acknowledged having said those words, he explained them as no more than an emotionally charged utterance by which he meant that she should acknowledge her guilt to the children. 
     
      
    5 However this dispute might be resolved, the fact that the offender sought to involve the children in this incident is a particularly unpleasant aspect of the case. I do not find it necessary to resolve the dispute, although I can see the force of the Crown’s position. On either view of it, the evidence shows the extent of his rage, which is also demonstrated by his uncooperative attitude to the police officers who arrived at the unit in response to a call from one of the neighbours.  
     
      
    6 He was arrested that same morning and has been in custody since. On legal advice, he declined to be interviewed.  
     
      
    7 The offender was thirty-eight years old at the time of the offence and is now forty. He was born and raised in New Zealand, and it was there that he commenced his relationship with Ms Tahuri and their two children were born. The family came to Australia in 2001. He has a criminal history in New Zealand through the 1990s, consisting mainly of offences of dishonesty, which is of little significance for present purposes. His only convictions in New South Wales are for three summary offences, apparently arising out of the same incident, for which he was dealt with in a local court on 25 September 2002. Their only significance is that for one of those offences he was placed on a twelve month bond, which was current at the time of the manslaughter. 
     
      
    8 He had a disturbed upbringing, which it is unnecessary to recite. It is sufficient to say that it provides the background to his leaving school at the end of second year of high school, his coming into conflict with the law, his heavy use of cannabis in earlier years and his heavy drinking throughout his adult life. Nevertheless, it seems that he has a reasonable record of employment in unskilled positions, both in New Zealand and in this country. He has always been close to his mother and his relationship with her current partner is satisfactory. 
     
      
    9 I have a report of a psychologist, Mr John Machlin. To Mr Machlin he described a relationship with Ms Tahuri which had not been without its difficulties, saying that there had been between them “probably some physical stuff but not violence”. He did not elaborate upon this. Their two children are now in the care of Ms Tahuri’s parents in New Zealand. Mr Machlin reported that, while he maintained his account at the trial of the circumstances in which Ms Tahuri met her death, he mourns her passing and his loss is compounded by his separation from the children.  
     
      
    10 Mr Machlin reported that he suffered “ongoing mental health problems” upon his admission into custody. This was amplified in a report of another psychologist, Kirk Stenhouse, employed at the Kevin Waller Therapeutic Unit (KWTU) within the Long Bay Correctional Centre. Early in 2003 he cut his wrists with a razor blade in what he said was an attempt to end his life, leading to his transfer to the Acute Crisis Management Unit (ACMU) at Long Bay.  
     
      
    11 Mr Stenhouse reported that he provided “a long history of self-harm, with and without suicidal intent”, most of these instances having been “triggered by relationship conflict”. He remained at the ACMU for six months, during which time there was another incident when he slashed his arm with a razor. He was depressed and displayed psychotic symptoms, including paranoid thoughts. He was considered by a treating psychiatrist, Dr Juratowitch, to be at risk of suicide, given his history and his psychotic symptoms, together with his perception that he had lost everything and his expressed belief that he would be re-united with Ms Tahuri in the afterlife.  
     
      
    12 His symptoms improved with anti-psychotic medication, and towards the end of 2003 he was transferred to the KWTU. There he underwent counselling and completed courses such as self-awareness, emotional regulation, relaxation and alcohol and drug issues. By June 2004 Mr Stenhouse observed him to be “co-operative and compliant”, interacting well with other inmates and being “generally well regarded by staff”. There had been no further incident of self harm but, given his history, Mr Stenhouse considered him still to be at risk of it. The offender acknowledged that he still had thoughts of ending his life. Generally, however, Mr Stenhouse saw him as “settled and focused on the future”.  
     
      
    13 No doubt, the offender’s concern about the outcome of these proceedings contributed to his mental state. Nevertheless, these incidents of self harm and psychotic symptoms convey to me that he has been tormented by his crime, even if he has little insight into his conduct. Mr Machlin found his intelligence to be just below average, and his personality to be characterised by depression, a lack of self-esteem and a pre-occupation with securing affection, leading to “conflicting feelings such as rage, love and guilt towards others”. Mr Stenhouse described his personality as “rigid”, and reported that he was assessed as “someone who would benefit from the KWTU program due to his paucity of skills for managing emotional difficulties”.  
     
      
    14 While not excusing his behaviour on the morning in question, these observations go some way towards explaining it. This, however, is not to deny the seriousness of his crime. I received a victim impact statement from Ms Tahuri’s parents, which expresses in a moving way the lasting effect of her untimely death upon them and upon her two children. To them I can do nor more than to convey my deepest sympathy. However, I do not consider it appropriate to have regard to that victim impact statement in determining the appropriate sentence: s28(4)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Inevitably, a violent crime such as this devastates the victim’s loved ones, including his or her dependents, and my approach to the present case is in accordance with that of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 ACrim R 76. In so saying I am mindful of the observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [42]-[45]. It should be noted that the Crown prosecutor did not rely upon the parents’ statement to establish the aggravating factor set out in s21A(2)(g) of the Act. 
     
      
    15 I have had regard generally to the aggravating and mitigating factors in s21A. In particular, I note that no weapon was used: cf subs(2)(c), and that the offence was unplanned, being the result of a spontaneous outburst: subs(3)(b). On the other hand, it was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty: subs(2)(j). Indeed, he had been placed on a bond only a little over a month previously, albeit for an offence very much less serious than the present offence.  
     
      
    16 He has not admitted responsibility for Ms Tahuri’s death in a manner consistent with the jury’s verdict and, in that sense, could not be said to be contrite. His undoubted regret about the loss of his partner seems to stem to a significant extent from his feeling of isolation, including separation from his children. Nevertheless, I accept that his psychological turmoil while in custody is also the product of a sense, at some level, of the enormity of his crime. In short, while he may not have come to terms with what he has done, he has suffered for it.  
     
      
    17 Clearly, he is in need of ongoing counselling, and upon his release he will need an extended period of supervision and guidance to settle back into the community. With that assistance, I think that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. I find special circumstances calling for a non-parole period less than the statutory proportion, although I am aware of the need for that period adequately to reflect considerations of retribution and deterrence.  
     
      
    18 I have been assisted by a schedule supplied by counsel of sentences in eight cases of manslaughter in a domestic setting, with a brief summary of the facts and salient subjective features of each offender. It is not necessary to refer to them except to say that I was supplied with the remarks on sentence of Grove J in one of them, R v Nardoni [1999] NSWSC 1097. Of that case I would observe only that, while it has some similarities to the present case, that offender pleaded guilty, was clearly contrite and was able to make out a stronger subjective case than the present offender. Insofar as the cases might suggest a range, the sentence which I propose is towards the top of it.  
     
      
    19 John Bodie Daniels, you are sentenced to imprisonment for eight years, to date from 31 October 2002, with a non-parole period of five years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 30 October 2007.

    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Barr J.  
     
      
    3 BARR J: This is an application for an extension of time within which to appeal under s5F Criminal Appeal Act against what is said to be an interlocutory judgment or order of Gibson QC ADCJ.  
     
      
    4 The applicants, Simon Daher and Tod Tochel, were committed to the District Court for trial, each on charges including a charge that at a particular time and place he manufactured an amount of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug. The facts were that the police entered the applicants’ premises and found them in the process of manufacturing the drug by heating the contents of a flask. The police seized the flask and its contents and sent them for analysis. The contents weighed 998.7grams and were analysed to contain 23.1per cent pure methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    5 By s4 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 a reference to a prohibited drug includes a reference to any preparation containing any proportion of the prohibited drug. 998.7grams exceeds the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, which is 250grams.  
     
      
    6 Each applicant wished to mount an argument that if he had been permitted to finish manufacturing the drug he would have had less than 250grams for sale. Each applicant wished to argue that s4 of the Act did not apply to preparations produced during the course of manufacture. That would have involved a challenge to the decision of this Court in R v R (No.2) (1990) 19 NSWLR 573.  
     
      
    7 There was frank discussion from the bar table and defence counsel as good as told his Honour that there was no defence to the charge and that a plea of guilty would be entered by each applicant. The only matter of contention was whether the Crown could prove the commercial quantity. The parties wanted his Honour’s view about that and each of defence counsel and the Crown Prosecutor told his Honour that if he took a view contrary to the one he or it wished to put, he or it would wish to test the matter on appeal before the matter went any further. Discussion followed about whether the applicants should be required to enter their intended pleas of guilty, but that never happened. The parties put the relevant statements and certificates of analysis before the Court. It thus appears that, although evidence was tendered, the sentencing proceedings were never entered upon and no order adverse to either applicant was made.  
     
      
    8 Counsel for the parties then put their arguments. His Honour gave an opinion in what was called -  
     
      
       
        
        Judgment on application of whether Court of Criminal Appeal decision still binding.  
        
       
      
    9 In that decision his Honour observed that the two applicants had been charged or were to be charged with producing the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. There was a reference to the evidence tendered. His Honour observed that the question to be answered was whether the decision in R v R (No.2) was binding. His Honour expressed the opinion that it was.  
     
      
    10 Mr Korn, who appeared for the applicant Daher, invited his Honour to certify under s5F(3)(b) Criminal Appeal Act that the judgment or order was a proper one for determination on appeal. His Honour said -  
     
      
       
        
        I’ll certify that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal. 
        
       
      
    11 The scheme set up by the Criminal Appeal Act contemplates that before rights to appeal or to seek leave to appeal arise from proceedings on indictment in the District Court the proceedings should be completed. So persons who are convicted and sentenced may appeal against their convictions and seek leave to appeal against their sentences. The Crown may appeal against sentences. The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may state a question for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal after there has been an acquittal: see ss5, 5D, 5A Criminal Appeal Act. The only contemplation of an appeal or of an application for leave to appeal during the currency of proceedings on indictment lies under s5F. There is no provision for a judge of the District Court who is unsure about the law to state a question for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal. There is no provision, where the parties wish to test a judge’s opinion of the law before the proceedings are carried through, for the judge to state a question of law for determination.  
     
      
    12 Section 5F does not contemplate appeals against advisory opinions or decisions made in advance of a trial on matters affecting the conduct of the trial such as the admissibility of evidence, the sufficiency of evidence to prove the charge or questions of law which will arise during the course of the trial: R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213. It seems to me that that is what happened in the present case. Although his Honour’s determination is called a judgment it is not in my opinion a judgment for the purposes of s5F. All his Honour was doing, in my opinion, was indicating to the parties what view he would take if the case proceeded and evidence in accordance with that tendered to him were put before the Court. It seems to be that what the parties are really doing is asking this Court to answer a question of law as though on a stated case. In my opinion, even if the question were stated with sufficient particularity, the Court would have no power to answer it.  
     
      
    13 In my opinion these applications are incompetent and should be dismissed. Both matters should be remitted to the District Court.  
     
      
    14 WOOD CJ AT CL: The Court makes orders accordingly.

      Facts 
       
      
    4 On 3 May 2003 at about 9 PM, EC parked her red Mercedes coupe, registration number EUN 603 in the wash bay zone of her sister’s unit block in Newington.  
     
      
    5 At around 11 PM she left these premises with her Maltese terrier dog. She saw two men in the alley, and waited until they had passed the gate before walking out. As she began to walk to her car she saw one of the males standing in the alleyway. Suddenly the Prisoner emerged from the bushes and stood in front of her. When he spoke, her dog started barking and she picked it up and walked on towards the Woolworth’s car park. She decided to delay getting into her car while the two men were in the area. 
     
      
    6 After walking around the car park for a few minutes she returned to the wash bay area of the units and looked, but could not see, either of the two men. As she was about to enter the car, she heard running footsteps. She looked up and saw the Prisoner running from in front of the vehicle. He grabbed the offside door and pulled it open. The victim could see that he was the same person who had earlier appeared out of the bushes.  
     
      
    7 The Prisoner pushed a black gun against her temple and she began to scream. He said, “Shut up”, and pushed her over to the front passenger seat. As she was moving into the passenger seat he demanded the keys to the car, threatening her with a knife. She could see the second man standing at the passenger door. He was also trying to get into the car, but the door was locked. While the Prisoner was trying to start the car the victim saw that he was holding a knife which was approximately 20 centimetres long with a silver blade. As the Prisoner was attempting to start the car he was yelling at the victim.  
     
      
    8 After placing the vehicle into motion he drove around the streets of Newington with the victim on board. When she asked him what he wanted he replied “nothing”.  
     
      
    9 There was some conversation about his companion when they saw him walking along the side of the road. The Prisoner stopped the car and told the victim to get into the back. As she did so she felt the Prisoner push her. She saw that he had the knife in his hand. His companion sat in the front passenger seat and the two men began talking to each other, and laughing and giggling.  
     
      
    10 The Prisoner asked the victim if she had a purse or a credit card and she replied in the negative. He drove the car through Lidcombe, Chester Hill, Villawood and onto the Hume Highway. He stopped the vehicle near a service station in the vicinity of the intersection with Woodville Road. The passenger took some coins out of the ashtray and left the car. The Prisoner then climbed onto the back seat carrying a knife in his hand. The victim began to scream softly and the Prisoner said to her, “Shut up and don’t look at me.” He slapped her face and pulled her legs towards him. She screamed and the Prisoner repeated his earlier instruction and pushed her face away from him. 
     
      
    11 He cut her underpants and when she tried to push him away she was threatened with the knife. Whilst still wearing gloves the Prisoner inserted fingers of his right hand into her vagina for several minutes. It felt rough and hurt her, and she cried. The prisoner withdrew his fingers, undid his pants, punched her arms and slapped her face with one hand while holding the knife in the other. He then pushed his penis into her vagina while telling her to shut up and pushing her face away from him.  
     
      
    12 When he had finished, the second male opened the door of the car and the Prisoner climbed across the victim and left the vehicle. The two men began talking while standing beside the passenger side of the car. The Prisoner pulled some wet tissues out of the glove box and passed them to the victim and told her to clean herself up.  
     
      
    13 As the Prisoner began to get back into the vehicle he noticed the victim’s wallet in the door pocket. He began to shout and swear at her. He opened the wallet and found her licence and bankcard. He demanded the PIN number for the account and threatened to injure or kill her with the knife, if she did not provide the PIN number. She could not remember the number but told him several numbers which were later unsuccessfully tried by the Prisoner. 
     
      
    14 The victim was eventually released and ran to a nearby block of units where she was unable to obtain any assistance. She then ran to a townhouse behind those units and while there spoke to her mother and to the police.  
     
      
    15 When her car was eventually recovered it was found that her mobile phone had been stolen. The SIM card belonging to Linda Berry, the de facto partner of the Prisoner has been identified by Vodaphone as being subsequently used in this phone.  
     
      
    16 On 4 May 2003 Dr Young examined the victim and identified several injuries to her. She was found to have bruising to her head and damage around her vagina which was painful to the touch. There was a superficial laceration 3.5 centimetres long to the Labia minora and a tear 2 centimetres in length further into the labia minora. The underpants of the victim had been cut open. 
     
      
    17 Police recovered three “Wet Ones” tissues on a grassed area near the Mobile Service Station at Lansvale. The Prisoner’s DNA was identified on a high vaginal swab and it could not be excluded as being a major contributor to DNA located on the seat of the victim’s motor vehicle.  
     
      
    18 These matters were transferred to the Supreme Court, pursuant to s 128(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act. They had been originally fixed for trial in the District Court, but were transferred to this Court to be dealt with at the same time as the other matters in respect of which the Prisoner stands for sentence. As a result of the pleas which were entered on 22 November 2004 the Crown elected not to pursue the other six matters which were charged in the same indictment. The Prisoner had originally pleaded not guilty to all of the counts in this indictment when appearing before Judge Sides in the District Court, on 6 August 2004.  
     
      
       
      SECOND INDICTMENT DATED 24 JUNE 2004 
       
       
      Count 3:  
      On 28 July 2003, at Cabramatta in the State of New South Wales, being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, did rob Hoang Thi Nguyen of a mobile telephone.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    19 At about 6:30 PM Hoang Thi Nguyen was working in a convenience store at Canley Heights. When she went out the back of the store to her car, the Prisoner pushed her into the vehicle. At the time he was armed with a knife approximately 30 centimetres in length with a silver coloured handle.  
     
      
    20 After forcing her into the driver’s seat he held a knife to the right side of her neck and asked “Where’s your money?” The victim replied that she had no money, and said that she just worked there. The Prisoner said that she was a liar, to which the victim replied that she was telling the truth, adding that her friend had money, and was waiting outside. The Prisoner instructed her to open the door and to call her friend. She replied that she could not do that because she was waiting outside with her boyfriend. The Prisoner said that he knew that only the two of them worked at the shop and that she had to call out in English. The Prisoner then took hold of her hair and forced her to the back door of the shop.  
     
      
    21 When she opened the door she saw Thi Thanh Ho. The Prisoner released her and grabbed Ho. A second person seized Nguyen and forced her to the ground.  
     
      
    22 The Prisoner held a knife to the right side of Ho’s neck. He seized her handbag and went through the contents. He took a sum of money totalling approximately $6,000 in cash. He then said that he wanted more money and asked where it was. He asked her to show him how to open the front cash register and she then opened the cash register and the young boy with the Prisoner took about $500 from it. 
     
      
    23 The Prisoner then took Ho and Nguyen to an office at the rear of the store where he forced Ho to open a cash drawer which was however empty. The Prisoner said that they were lying and asked Ho to show them where the money was. The second offender kept watch over the two women whilst the Prisoner went into the shop and returned a short time later with a box full of cigarettes and phonecards. The two offenders then left the shop with the money, cigarettes, phonecards and the mobile phones which they had taken from each of the women and entered a light blue coloured car.  
     
      
    24 Police later located that car at the residence of the de facto wife of the Prisoner at Tregear. A white coloured porcelain water pipe was subsequently identified as coming from the store. When a search warrant was executed at 8 Disalvo Close, Cabramatta West, which was a place of residence used by the Prisoner, police located a number of phone cards similar to those which had been stolen during the robbery.  
     
      
    25 Ms Nguyen had a Nokia model 8210 mobile telephone handset and Ms Ho had a Nokia model 8855 mobile phone handset stolen during this armed robbery. Inquiries from Vodaphone Law Enforcement revealed that Ms Nguyen’s phone had been used between 29 July 2003 and 6 August 2003 with a SIM card in the name of Amanda Aslett, who was the sister of the Prisoner.  
     
      
    26 Inquiries from Vodaphone Law Enforcement showed that the phone belonging to Ms Ho had been used between 12 August 2003 and 22 August 2003 with a SIM card of Linda Berry who was the de facto partner of the Prisoner. It was also used with the SIM card of Amanda Aslett on 28 July 2003.  
     
      
       
       
      Count 4:  
      On 30 July 2003, at Auburn in the State of New South Wales, being then armed with an offensive weapon, namely a baseball bat, the Prisoner did rob Eduardo Arbis of a Smith and Wesson Magnum revolver, and a Colt semiautomatic pistol, a quantity of ammunition, a pair of earmuffs and a bag.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    27 At about 8:10 PM on this day, Eduardo Arbis left the Shooting Academy in Auburn carrying a Smith and Wesson model 666 .357 calibre Magnum six shot revolver and a Colt model 1911 eight shot semiautomatic pistol. These firearms were secured in a green canvas bag which was locked with a padlock. It also contained 10 rounds of .357 calibre ammunition as well as some earmuffs, a visor and a cleaning kit.  
     
      
    28 As Arbis placed the bag into the boot of his car he saw the Prisoner who was armed with a baseball bat running towards him. The Prisoner swung the bat in the direction of Arbis’ head. Arbis lifted his hand over his head to defend himself. The bat struck his right hand. The Prisoner then swung the bat again, saying to Arbis, “Back off”. Arbis stepped back and the offender removed the bag containing the firearms, and other items from the boot of his car and then ran off.  
     
      
    29 On 22 August 2003, the Prisoner was arrested in the Liverpool area in relation to other matters. At the time of his arrest, he was found to be in possession of the Smith and Wesson Magnum revolver. During the execution of a search warrant, at an address where he had been residing, a 35 millimetre camera film was seized. The film was developed and included a number of photos that show the offender posing with this firearm. This weapon was later used by the Prisoner in the several armed robberies and one murder.  
     
      
    30 The second firearm that was stolen has not been recovered. 
     
      
    31 As a result of being struck with the baseball bat during the robbery, Arbis suffered bruising and cuts to his right little finger.  
     
      
       
      Count 5:  
      On 31 July 2003 at South Auburn in the State of New South Wales, being then armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a handgun, the Prisoner did rob Jeky Li of a sum of money, a wallet and a mobile phone.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    32 At about 8:40 PM on 31 July 2003 Jeky Li, who was the owner of Mega Lighting of 1/10 Newton Street South Auburn, commenced to close his store. He placed the day’s takings ($800) into a black laptop. At approximately 9 PM he locked and closed the store and left the premises through the rear door and walked to his car. As he started the vehicle he was approached by the Prisoner who was wearing dark clothing, a balaclava and black gloves with the fingertips cut off. He was holding a silver coloured handgun. He was accompanied by a second person who was also wearing a black balaclava, and holding a knife approximately 30 centimetres long. 
     
      
    33 The Prisoner placed the gun up against Mr Li’s head. The second male placed the knife to his throat. The Prisoner instructed Mr Li to get the money. Mr Li replied that he did not have any. The Prisoner pushed the gun hard up against his head and as a result Mr Li removed a wallet from his bag and handed it over. The Prisoner took the gun away from his head, but then said that there was not enough money in the wallet and once again pointed the gun to his head. 
     
      
    34 Mr Li attempted to push the weapon way and the Prisoner warned him not to touch the gun, indicating that if he touched it he would die. He opened the chamber of the gun and showed Mr Li the six rounds of ammunition that were loaded in the chamber.  
     
      
    35 Mr Li produced his personal wallet and the Prisoner took $150 - $200 in cash from it. He also removed approximately $30 in change from the car.  
     
      
    36 The Prisoner then dragged Mr Li to the rear door of his store. He forced him to open the door and to turn off the alarm, and pushed him into the store where he asked where was “the big money?”  
     
      
    37 As Mr Li was walking towards the main showroom he could feel the gun being pressed into his back. When he reached the cash register he showed the Prisoner there was no money in the cash trays. The Prisoner asked where was the money, and when Mr Li informed him that there was no more money, the Prisoner took him to the rear storeroom where he was made to lie on the ground. He said “We’re going to kill you. Where’s the money?” He also commanded Mr Li to hand over his mobile phone, which he did. Mr Li was made to walk, at gunpoint, into the toilet, where he was instructed to remain otherwise he would be killed. Sometime later Mr Li left the toilet and called the police.  
     
      
    38 Approximately $180-$230 in cash and a mobile phone were stolen. The description of the firearm that was used matches the Smith & Wesson 666 .357 Magnum revolver which had been stolen on the previous day.  
     
      
    39 The Prisoner pleaded guilty to Counts 3, 4 and 5 before Judge Sides in the District Court on 6 August 2004. Upon that basis the Crown has permitted the matters which had originally been charged under Counts 1 and 2 to be taken into account when the Prisoner is sentenced for Count 3 (that is, items (a) and (b) below). A further three matters are to be taken into account, on a separate Form 1, when sentencing the Prisoner for Count 5 (that is, items (c) to (e) below).  
     
      
    40 The Form 1 offences were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Robbery while armed with an offensive weapon: 
       
      
    41 This related to the robbery of Ms Ho on 25 July 2003, three days before the offence charged in Count 3. The Prisoner went to her shop and followed her after she closed the shop that night. She became frightened and took refuge in a nearby shop before walking to her car and driving to the BKK car park in Cabramatta. As she left her car the Prisoner threatened her and took her handbag which contained $3000 in cash and three mobile phones. 
     
      
       
      (b) Robbery while armed with an offensive weapon: 
       
      
    42 This related to the robbery of Ms Ho of her handbag, containing $6000 in cash, and cigarettes and telephone cards referred to in the facts outlined for Count 3 of the indictment.  
     
      
       
      (c) Robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon 
       
      
    43 This offence was committed just after 5 PM at the premises of Bob Jane T-Mart, when Mathew Ryder noticed the Prisoner inside the store which had been closed, wearing a balaclava and carrying a gun. A second, younger male who was in his company, held a knife to the victim’s throat. Cash was taken from the till and from the victim’s pocket. The Prisoner instructed the victim to open a safe. When this could not be achieved, the Prisoner smashed all of the landline phones in the store and took some mobile phones and car keys. The victim was tied by his hands and feet before the offenders left. 
     
      
       
      (d) Take and drive conveyance 
       
      
    44 Having left Mr Ryder bound in the store, the Prisoner went to his Ford Falcon utility and drove it away without the victim’s permission. 
     
      
       
      (e) Aggravated kidnapping 
       
      
    45 This related to the fact that the victim the subject of Count 5 was forced, at gunpoint, to walk to the toilet where he was instructed to remain under threat of being killed.  
     
      
       
      INDICTMENT DATED 1 JULY 2004 
       
       
      Count 1:  
      On 1 August 2003 the Prisoner did murder Emad Youssef. 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    46 The deceased, Emad Youssef, was the proprietor of a pharmacy situated in a small shopping centre at Canley Heights. At about 6:15 PM on Friday 1 August 2003 the Prisoner who was armed with a .357 Magnum pistol went to these premises with the intention of robbing Mr Youssef of the day’s takings. 
     
      
    47 At about 6:30 PM the deceased, having closed the pharmacy, walked with a staff member, Eva Keovongsack, to the secure parking area at the rear of the centre. Ms Keovongsack reversed her car out of the secure area and the deceased followed and locked the gate. As he re-entered his car, he was confronted by the Prisoner who had been waiting in a car in the public parking area which was also located behind the shopping centre.  
     
      
    48 The Prisoner was seen by Katherine Tran to open the door of the deceased’s car, whereupon the men began to struggle. The Prisoner placed his hand into his pants pocket and took out a gun. The weapon discharged inflicting the wound from which the victim died.  
     
      
    49 Ms Keovongsack who was, at this time, driving down the service lane between the car park and Peel Street heard a gunshot. She looked in her rear vision mirror and saw the deceased staggering towards her vehicle and calling out her name. She stopped her vehicle and ran back to where he had collapsed. She noticed that he was bleeding, and ran into one of the shops to raise the alarm. Mr Youssef was, however, dead by the time that the police and ambulance arrived.  
     
      
    50 After shooting the deceased the Prisoner took his brief case and fled to his sister’s house at Cabramatta West. There he made admissions to both his sister Catherine and to Irene Lynette to the effect that his attempt to rob the pharmacist had gone wrong, and that he had accidentally shot the man. Later that night a teenage nephew of the Prisoner disposed of the stolen briefcase by throwing it into a creek behind the Mount Pritchard Community Club, where it was later found. 
     
      
    51 On 22 August 2003, police received information that the Prisoner was at premises in Busby. Members of the Tactical Operations Unit were dispatched to the area and shortly after 10:50 PM Senior Constables Lawlor and Smith approached those premises through the rear yard. As they approached the rear dividing fence they heard the sound of footsteps and saw the Prisoner climbing over the fence. The Prisoner ignored a direction not to move, and jumped over the fence, throwing an object away as he did so. He was apprehended, and, in the area where the Prisoner had thrown the object, Police found a pistol in a black holster. The prisoner acknowledged having thrown it there.  
     
      
    52 He was taken into custody, and on 26 August 2003 he was interviewed by members of the Risk Assessment Team attached to the MRRC at Silverwater. The Prisoner began to sob and said “I can’t sleep, I’m thinking about the man I killed.” He admitted killing a man at Canley Vale during the course of a robbery which went wrong. He said that the police had found the pistol which he had used.  
     
      
    53 Whilst still in custody the Prisoner contacted Detective Sergeant McNeil by telephone and indicated that he wanted to speak to him. On 23 October 2003 he was interviewed by Det Sgt McNeil and admitted that he had gone to the shopping centre on 1 August 2003, armed with a pistol, with the intention of robbing the deceased. He said that a week or so before the robbery a friend had shown him how the deceased left his business. He said that on the day of the killing he had been smoking “ice” and heroin. He acknowledged that after running to the driver’s side door of the deceased’s vehicle, he had operated the lever to open the boot. The deceased, he said, had grabbed his arm and began yelling. He pulled out his gun, intending to scare his victim. He said that he had spoken to police to get the matter off his conscience. He indicated that he had run away believing the victim had only been shot in the shoulder and that he would be alright.  
     
      
    54 The pistol which was recovered by Det Lawlor was examined by the Police ballistic and fingerprint experts. A comparison of the bullet recovered from the body of the deceased with a bullet which was test fired from the gun, revealed that both bullets had been fired from the same weapon. An examination of the weapon by a fingerprint expert showed that a left thumbprint found on the right side of the barrel matched that of the Prisoner.  
     
      
    55 The Prisoner pleaded guilty to this offence on his arraignment before Barr J on 2 July 2004.  
     
      
    56 I have received and read the victim impact statement which was provided by the widow of Mr Youssef, which discloses the enormous personal and financial loss suffered by her and by her daughters, as a result of this senseless murder. Apart from losing a loved husband and father, they have been deprived of the benefit of the two pharmacy businesses which the deceased owned, and this will impact significantly upon them. Mrs Youssef had also suffered a severe depressive reaction to the loss of her husband which will require ongoing treatment.  
     
      
    57 A question arises, by reason of the enactment of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as to the continuing application of the decision in R v Previtera  (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. That was left open in R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300. However I consider that I should continue to follow Previtera until it is reconsidered by the Court of Criminal Appeal, and I have taken this victim impact statement into account on that basis.  
     
      
       
      INDICTMENT DATED 29 NOVEMBER 2004 
       
       
      Count 1:  
      On 6 August 2003 at Towoon Bay in the State of New South Wales the Prisoner when armed with a dangerous weapon did rob Warren Richardson of $596 in cash, assorted bottles of alcohol and cigarettes, the property of Robert Anderson trading as Towoon Bay cellars.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    58 At about 9 PM on 6 August 2003 an employee of the Toowoon Bay Cellars, Warren Richardson, was closing the business. He was standing inside the store near the front door when he was confronted by the prisoner and an unknown accomplice, each of whom was wearing a balaclava. The Prisoner said to him, “We don’t want to hurt you. We want the money”. At that stage the Prisoner pointed a loaded silver coloured .357 calibre magnum revolver to the stomach of Mr Richardson and said “It has hollow nose bullets.” 
     
      
    59 The Prisoner directed Mr Richardson to go behind the counter and give him the money. When Mr Richardson opened the cash register the Prisoner instructed him to put the money in a plastic bag. Mr Richardson then removed the cash money, placed it into a plastic bag, and handed the bag to the offender who asked “Where is the rest of the money?”. 
     
      
    60 The co-offender said “I will have some cigarettes”. Mr Richardson was then directed to remove a quantity of Longreach and Winfield cigarette packets which he placed into the same white plastic bag. He filled another bag full of cigarette packets. 
     
      
    61 A total of $596 in cash, assorted bottles of alcohol and cigarettes belonging to the business, as well as a sports bag containing a jacket, wallet, personal papers and assorted cards, the property of Warren Richardson, were taken.  
     
      
    62 When interviewed by police the Prisoner admitted to the commission of these offences saying that he had travelled to Toowoon Bay Cellars in a 1987 VL turbo Holden Commodore which he had previously stolen from Gosford. He informed police that he had divided the cash which had been stolen because he did not drink alcohol or smoke, and the remaining property had been kept by his co-offender.  
     
      
       
      Count 2:  
      On 6 August 2003 at Tuggerah in the State of New South Wales the Prisoner did steal a 1987 turbo Holden Commodore sedan with registration number XLD 216, the property of Scott Lambert.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    63 Between 8 PM and 9 PM on 6 August 2003 a VL Holden Commodore XLD 216 was stolen from the service area of Grawill Ford, at Gosford 
     
      
    64 This vehicle was recovered on 21 August 2003 at the intersection of Bay Road and Ocean Parade, The Entrance. The vehicle was found to be missing a steering wheel, stereo, speakers, turbo pop-off valve and car mats. It was also found to be fitted with different wheels and tyres.  
     
      
    65 When interviewed the Prisoner admitted to the theft of the vehicle from the service area. He claimed that at the time of the theft he had only the intention to take and use the vehicle. He said that he later sold some of the parts, which he had taken from the vehicle, to a friend, and that this friend had also removed some parts without his consent.  
     
      
       
      Count 3:  
      On 11 August 2003 at Ourimbah in the State of New South Wales, when armed with a dangerous weapon, the Prisoner did rob Shirley Ellis of $1840 in cash, the property of Memtown Proprietary Limited trading as Ourimbah Post Office.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    66 At about 4:40 PM on Monday 11 August 2003 the Prisoner and an unknown co-offender parked the vehicle which they were driving in the vicinity of the Ourimbah Medical Centre. The Prisoner and his companion walked to the Ourimbah Post Office. Each disguised his appearance by wearing a balaclava. They there confronted the owner of the business, Shirley Ellis. 
     
      
    67 Whilst armed with a loaded silver coloured .357 calibre magnum revolver the Prisoner and his accomplice jumped the service counter and removed cash from the wooden style cash drawers beneath that counter. They placed the money into a dark-coloured backpack before running from the Post Office.  
     
      
    68 Outside the premises the co-offender confronted Haley Kuhn and demanded the keys to her motor vehicle. Whilst the co-offender was trying to remove them from her hand, the Prisoner called out, “Don’t take your anger out on her, come on.”  
     
      
    69 The Prisoner and his companion were last seen driving away. A sum of $1840 was stolen from the Post Office. When interviewed by police the Prisoner admitted the offence and stated that he tried to calm the victim down due to her hysteria and age. 
     
      
       
      Count 4:  
      On 13 August 2003 at Wyoming in the State of New South Wales, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, the Prisoner did rob Paul Marlow of one black briefcase containing personal papers the property of the victim.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    70 At about 6:35 PM on Wednesday 13 August 2003 the owners of the Maidens Brush Newsagency, at Wyoming, Paul and Jennifer Marlow, were closing the business down for the night. Paul Marlow walked outside the rear door to remove rubbish from the premises. When he returned he left the back door open. Jennifer Marlow walked to the door and was there confronted by the Prisoner and a co-offender. Both were wearing balaclavas. Mrs Marlow screamed when she saw that the Prisoner was in possession of a handgun. The Prisoner took her to the safe and said “Open the safe you cunt”. Mrs Marlow said that she did not know how to do so. The Prisoner said, “Yes you do cunt.” He then directed her to lie on the floor and to face the wall. 
     
      
    71 While lying on the floor Mrs Marlow screamed, which alerted Mr Marlow. He turned and saw the prisoner pointing the firearm towards him. He ran from the shop to an adjoining premises where he caused the police to be contacted. The prisoner remained in the newsagency for a short time and again demanded that Mrs Marlow open the safe. She again claimed that she did not know the combination. The Prisoner remained in the shop for a short while longer before stealing a black coloured briefcase containing personal papers.  
     
      
    72 When interviewed by police the Prisoner admitted the offence. He said that on leaving the store he ran on foot for a short distance before entering the vehicle, which was not stolen and then travelled back to The Entrance area. He claimed that he threw the black briefcase from the car whilst returning to The Entrance.  
     
      
       
      Count 5:  
      On 14 August 2003 at Bateau Bay in the State of New South Wales, when armed with a dangerous weapon, the Prisoner did rob Gary Ives of $4019 in cash, the property of Beryl Ives and Gary Ives.  
       
       
      Count 6: 
       At the same time and place the Prisoner did, when armed with a dangerous weapon rob Gregory Culpan of one leather wallet containing $10 in cash the property of Gregory Culpan.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    73 Shortly before 5 PM on Thursday 14 August 2003 the Prisoner drove to the Post Office at Bateau Bay in a stolen Holden Commodore registration number UMZ-549 accompanied by two co-offenders. He entered the Post Office in the company of one of his co-offenders, and in possession of a loaded .357 magnum revolver. Each was wearing a balaclava. 
     
      
    74 The Prisoner approached the service counter and forced the only customer, Gregory Culpan, to the ground. He demanded money from Gary and Beryl Ives, the owners of the business. He remained on the customer side of the service counter while his co-offender jumped over the counter and removed an amount of cash from the cash drawers. While that was happening he also took the wallet of Gregory Culpan which had been left at the service counter.  
     
      
    75 The Prisoner and his co-offenders left the Post Office and escaped in the vehicle UMZ-549.  
     
      
       
      Count 7:  
      On 20 August 2003 at Tuggerah in the State of New South Wales, when armed with a dangerous weapon, the prisoner did rob Peter Sutherland of $28,075 in Australian currency, 20 Great Britain pounds and 300 Eurodollars, the property of the National Australia Bank Ltd.  
       
       
      Count 8:  
      On the same date at Tuggerah in the State of New South Wales the Prisoner did steal a 1985 Maroon coloured Holden Commodore sedan with registration number NQL-340 the property of Paul Richards. 
       
       
      Count 9:  
      On the same day at Tuggerah he also stole a 1989 Holden Commodore sedan registered number QRU-579 the property of Therese Wilkinson.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    76 At about 3:55 PM on Wednesday 20 August 2003 the Prisoner entered the National Australia Bank in the Westfield Shopping Centre Tuggerah. He was disguised with a cap and sunglasses. He approached a staff member, Peter Sutherland, who was behind an open inquiry area and threw to him a plastic bag which landed on the floor. 
     
      
    77 Mr Sutherland collected the bag and at that time noticed that the Prisoner had produced a loaded silver coloured .357 calibre magnum revolver which was partially concealed within a leather holster. The Prisoner said, “Fill it up. Do as I say and no one will get hurt.” He followed Mr Sutherland through an access door leading into the teller area. Mr Sutherland removed all of the cash from the top three drawers between two female staff members, and placed it in the plastic bag.  
     
      
    78 The Prisoner said, “Where is more?” Mr Sutherland then opened the lower drawer and removed three bundles of $50 notes which he also placed in the plastic bag.  
     
      
    79 The Prisoner said to him “Don’t look at me”. While behind the customer counter area he pointed to a mobile telephone belonging to a staff member, Jennifer Hickman and said “Give me the mobile phone”. That phone was then placed into the same plastic bag by Mr Sutherland. This mobile telephone was located on the Prisoner when he was arrested. The Prisoner then walked away from the customer area and left the Bank.  
     
      
    80 As a result of the commission of these two offences a total amount of cash comprising $28,075 in Australian currency, 20 Great Britain Pounds, and 300 Eurodollars, and one Nokia 3310 mobile telephone were stolen.  
     
      
    81 During the commission of the offences a witness made observation of tattoos on the left fingers of the offender and the description of those tattoos is similar to those on the hand of the Prisoner.  
     
      
    82 At the time of his arrest the Prisoner had a total amount of $9,396.90 upon his person. He used a portion of the proceeds of this robbery to purchase a vehicle.  
     
      
    83 When interviewed the Prisoner admitted to committing the offences. He also admitted having stolen a Maroon coloured Holden Commodore NQL-340 from the Supa Centre at Tuggerah which he had driven to the Westfield Shopping Centre.  
     
      
    84 He said that he had used an amount of amphetamines and heroin before stealing another vehicle which was a red coloured VN Commodore registration number QRU 579. He then drove that vehicle to the car parking area outside the National Australia Bank where he carried out the robbery mentioned. He then left the bank and drove the red Commodore back to the rooftop of Westfield Shopping Centre and parked it in a different location. The vehicle sustained damage to the ignition and steering column. He then entered the first stolen vehicle, NQL-340, before travelling to Anzac Road Long Jetty where it was abandoned.  
     
      
    85 In relation to these matters, which were also transferred to the Supreme Court pursuant to s 128(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, the Prisoner offered guilty pleas in the Local Court on 26 April 2004. He was committed to the District Court for sentence. By reason of the pleas to Counts 1 to 9, the Crown allowed the remaining matters to be dealt with on a Form 1, when he was sentenced in relation to Count 7.  
     
      
    86 The Form 1 offences were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      Robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon: 
       
      
    87 This related to the robbery of Ms McKinnon’s mobile phone during the offence the subject of Count 7. 
     
      
       
      (b)  
      Carried in conveyance: 
       
      
    88 This related to the Prisoner being carried as a passenger in the stolen Holden Commodore registration number UMZ 549 prior to the commission of the offence the subject of Count 5. 
     
      
       
      (c)  
      Carried in conveyance 
       
      
    89 This related to the Prisoner being carried as a passenger, on 8 August 2003, in a stolen motor vehicle OLM 650 in the Tuggerah area.  
     
      
       
      (d)  
      Armed with intent to commit an indictable offence 
       
      
    90 This relates to the fact that on 8 August 2003 the Prisoner attended outside the Long Jetty Post Office with the intention of committing a robbery at those premises, while armed with the 357 Magnum. 
     
      
       
      SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES  
       
       
      Prior Offending 
       
      
    91 The sentencing of the Prisoner for this extraordinary saga of ongoing, and major, criminality is complicated by the circumstance that, on 26 November 2004, he was sentenced by Judge Finnane, after trial in the District Court, in relation to eight further exceedingly serious offences, which were also found to have been committed during the period mentioned. 
     
      
    92 The reasons for sentence of Judge Finnane record that those offences were committed on 17 July 2003 (that is, before all of the matters for which I am to impose sentence save for those included in the first of the four indictments set out above), when the prisoner and three younger persons went to the suburb of Newington looking for a place to burgle. They selected the unit of a family of Asian origin, which they entered after climbing up to a balcony. They wore masks and gloves and carried knives. The male householder was tied up and threatened with knives upon his return home from work at about midnight, and his wife was compelled to open a safe, from which jewellery was stolen. Additionally the offenders stole money, electrical goods and compact discs. The premises were ransacked.  
     
      
    93 His Honour found that the Prisoner was responsible for leading this venture and for giving orders to his accomplices. He was the first to have sexual intercourse without consent with the 16 year old daughter of the household. He did so at knifepoint, having threatened to poke her eyes out if she looked at him. 
     
      
    94 Although she had been a virgin he had vaginal intercourse which left her bleeding and distressed. With the Prisoner’s encouragement, two of his accomplices also had forced sexual intercourse with her without her consent. Their conduct included vaginal rape, anal rape, and forced fellatio. The young girl suffered extensive tearing to her vagina and perineum which required surgery later that morning.  
     
      
    95 The offences were described by Judge Finnane as having involved a particularly brutal and planned home invasion, and together with the sexual assaults as ones in which gratuitous cruelty had been inflicted. His Honour went on to find that the Prisoner had expressed no remorse or compassion for his victims and in sentencing him took into account his finding that the Prisoner was a “cold, callous, vicious and extremely dangerous criminal”, a finding which precisely reflects my own assessment of him.  
     
      
    96 As a result of this episode of criminality, the Prisoner received the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: Specially aggravated breaking and entering: 
       
        
         
          
          - non-parole period of 10 years to commence on 22 August 2003 with the balance of the term being one of 3 years and 4 months; 
          
         
        
       
       
      Count 2: Sexual intercourse without consent: 
       
       Contrary to s 61JA of the  
      Crimes Act -  
       
        
         
          
           - non-parole period of 20 years to be served concurrently and partially cumulatively upon the sentence for Count 1, with the balance of the term being one of 6 years and 8 months; 
          
         
        
       
       
      Counts 3  
       
      and 4 
      :  
      Sexual intercourse without consent: 
       
       Contrary to s 61JA of the  
      Crimes Act 
       
        
         
          
          - concurrent non-parole periods each of 15 years, to commence on 22 August 2010 (that is, upon a date 7 years after the commencement of the non-parole period for Counts 1 to 2), with the balance of the terms each being 5 years. 
          
         
        
       
       
      Counts 5, 
       
      6 and 7: Sexual intercourse without consent 
       
       Contrary to s 61JA of the  
      Crimes Act 
       
        
         
          
           - concurrent non-parole periods each of 8 years to commence on 22 August 2025 (that is, upon a date 22 years after the commencement of the non-parole periods for Counts 1 to 2), with the balance of the terms each being 10 years. 
          
         
        
       
       
      Count 8: Aggravated act of indecency 
       
        
         
          
          - Fixed term of 2 years to be served concurrently with the sentence for Count 1 and 2.  
          
         
        
       
      
    97 The effective overall sentencing order was one providing for a non-parole period of 30 years commencing on 22 August 2003 and expiring on 21 August 2033. By reason of the length of the balance of the term set for Counts 5, 6 and 7 the length of the overall sentence was effectively 40 years. 
     
      
    98 Although the Prisoner has foreshadowed an intention to pursue an appeal against these convictions and against the length of the sentences imposed, I have no choice other than to proceed to sentence upon the assumption that the convictions were regularly entered and that the sentences have as yet been undisturbed.  
     
      
    99 In sentencing the Prisoner, Judge Finnane had regard, as must I, to the very lengthy and disturbing criminal history of the Prisoner. I must also have regard to the evidence that was placed before me in relation to his subjective background. 
     
      
    100 His criminal history began in the Children’s Court at the age of 11 years, when on 18 May 1982 he was sentenced to four years probation for offences of take and drive, offences of break enter and steal, offences of stealing, offences of malicious injury, and one offence of attempt to steal.  
     
      
    101 On 7 September 1982 he was committed to an institution in general terms for an offence of break enter and steal. On 14 June 1983 he was placed on probation for 12 months for an offence of larceny. While on probation he was committed to an institution, on 22 March 1984, for offences of malicious injury, break and enter with intent, and stealing (two offences). Those committals were however suspended upon him entering into a good behaviour bond for 12 months.  
     
      
    102 The encouragement of a recognisance seemingly had no effect upon him, because, within two months, he was charged with stealing and was then, on 10 May 1984, committed again to an institution in general terms.  
     
      
    103 On 14 February 1985 he was recommitted to an institution in general terms for stealing a motor vehicle, and illegal use of a motor vehicle. On 27 September 1985 he was committed to an institution for two years for a total of thirteen offences of stealing a motor vehicle, five offences of malicious injury, one offence of escaping lawful custody, one offence of absconding from proper custody, one offence of stealing, as well as offences of unlicensed driver, driving in a manner dangerous and negligent driving.  
     
      
    104 On 14 October 1985 he was committed to an institution for 12 months for offences of break enter and steal, and stealing, and for 15 months for offences of take and drive conveyance, unlicensed driving, and two offences of stealing motor vehicles.  
     
      
    105 Just seven days later on 21 October 1985 he was committed to an institution for an accumulation of three months for one offence of stealing a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    106 On 18 December 1985 he was again committed to an institution in general terms for a further offence of absconding and for illegal use of a conveyance, while on 20 January 1986 he was again back in the Children’s Court and recommitted to an institution in general terms for two further offences of absconding and two offences of stealing. 
     
      
    107 On 28 February 1986 he was committed to an institution for 18 months for one offence of absconding lawful custody, one offence of malicious injury, two offences of stealing a motor vehicle, and three offences of unlicensed driver.  
     
      
    108 On 11 March 1986 he was committed to an institution for 2 years for three offences of stealing a motor vehicle, one offence of malicious injury, one offence of escaping lawful custody and two offences of break enter and steal. Nine days later, on 20 March 1986 he was committed to an institution for 3 years for offences of take and drive conveyance and absconding.  
     
      
    109 On 1 July 1986 he was again committed to an institution in general terms for four offences of escape lawful custody, and four offences of absconding.  
     
      
    110 On 15 July 1986 he was again committed to an institution for 3 years for illegal use of a motor vehicle, unlicensed driving and absconding. 
     
      
    111 On 21 January 1987 he was committed to an institution for 3 months for absconding from lawful custody. 
     
      
    112 On 8 July 1987 sentences committing him to an institution were suspended conditional upon him entering into a 12 months community service order for two offences of possess an implement to enter a conveyance, two offences of take and drive, one offence of malicious injury and one offence of illegal use of a conveyance. 
     
      
    113 On 17 August 1987 a control order for 18 months was imposed when he appeared on two further counts of stealing a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    114 On 25 January 1988 a control order for 2 years with a 12 months non probation order was imposed for an offence of stealing a motor vehicle, and a control order for 6 months was imposed for an offence of malicious injury.  
     
      
    115 On 15 February 1988 control orders were made for 21 days for an offence of escaping lawful custody, and of 2 years with a non probation period of 2 months for offences of stealing a motor vehicle and possession of implements. 
     
      
    116 On 6 September 1988 and on 22 September 1988 control orders of 6 months and of 1 month were imposed respectively for offences of malicious injury and attempting to escape lawful custody (two counts).  
     
      
    117 On 4 October 1988 another control order, this time for 4 months, was imposed for an offence of malicious damage. This was followed by another control order on 14 November 1988 of 3 months for yet another offence of escape lawful custody; on 21 November 1989 by a control order for 6 months for an offence of break enter and steal; and on 14 February 1990, by control orders for 12 months for offences of break enter and steal and carry a cutting implement.  
     
      
    118 This brought to an end the Prisoner’s appearance in the Children’s Courts of this State which had seen him sentenced by Courts at Cobham, Yasmar, Minda, Bidura, Yass, Orange, Kempsy and Tamworth. 
     
      
    119 His record, however continued unabated in Local Courts and in the District Court.  
     
      
    120 On 17 March 1989 a control order for 12 months with a non probation period of 5 months was imposed in the District Court in Parramatta for an indictable assault.  
     
      
    121 On 20 July 1989 he was sentenced to 6 months hard labour, and fined in the Local Court of Port Macquarie for driving in a manner dangerous. 
     
      
    122 On 1 September 1989 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, in the District Court at Port Macquarie for an offence of possession of property stolen outside the State. Sentences of 3 years and 2 years were imposed for offences of stealing and possessing household implements.  
     
      
    123 On 2 April 1990 the Prisoner was sentenced in the Burwood Local Court to imprisonment for 18 months for an offence of break enter and steal, for 12 months for offences of malicious damage and illegal use of a motor vehicle, for 15 months for an offence of possessing implements, for 3 months for failure to appear, and for 12 months for stealing a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    124 On 10 May 1990 cumulative control orders were imposed in the Sydney District Court of 6 months for four offences of larceny of a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    125 On 10 July 1990 he was sentenced in the Local Court at Cessnock to a fixed term of 6 months for malicious damage. On 18 May 1993 he was given separate fixed terms each of 6 months for offences of illegal use of a conveyance, disqualified driver, drive manner dangerous, and possess implements.  
     
      
    126 On 12 February 1996 he was sentenced in the Parramatta District Court to a fixed term of 18 months for offences of break enter and steal and larceny of a motor vehicle and to concurrent terms of 12 months for possession of implements, larceny, larceny of a motor vehicle and possession of housebreaking implements. On the same date, he was also sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years for an offence of accessory after the fact to malicious wounding; to a minimum term of 2 years 6 months with an additional term of 2 years for an offence of assault with intent to rob while armed; and to a fixed term of 12 months for a further offence of possess implements. All of these sentences were set to commence on the same day, but to the extent of the overlap there was an accumulation. Additionally on the same date a concurrent fixed term of 9 months was set for an offence of escape lawful custody. 
     
      
    127 On 25 February 1998 at Fairfield Local Court the Prisoner was sentenced to a minimum term of 12 months with an additional term of 4 months for an offence of stealing a motor vehicle, and to fixed terms of 6 months each for offences of driving in a manner dangerous and possessing a prohibited drug. Upon appeal the last two convictions and sentences were confirmed but the sentence was reduced to a minimum term of 8 months with an additional term of 8 months.  
     
      
    128 On 7 August 1998 he was sentenced in the Sydney District Court to a fixed term of 3 months for attempted escape.  
     
      
    129 On 27 July 2000 the Prisoner was sentenced in the Liverpool District Court to imprisonment for 5 years with a 2 year non-parole period for an offence of robbery in company, commencing from 23 September 1999. He was sentenced to a concurrent term of 2 years, in the same Court on the same date for a further offence of robbery in company.  
     
      
    130 On 21 November 2002 in the Liverpool Local Court he was sentenced to fixed terms each of 6 months for offences of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty, possessing implements, take and drive conveyance, custody of a knife in a public place and possession of equipment for the administration of drugs.  
     
      
    131 Finally on 8 December 2004 the Prisoner was sentenced in the Local Court for eight offences: one offence of goods in custody, two firearms offences, two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, one offence of assault police, one offence of resist police, and one offence of drive conveyance without consent, to concurrent terms of imprisonment totalling 12 months arising out of the events which are later referred to in these reasons, as being the events which on the Prisoner’s account preceded the sustained period of criminality that most recently brought him back into the criminal justice system.  
     
      
    132 I have omitted from this dismal record a number of offences that were dealt with by way of a fine, or by the Prisoner being sentenced to the rising of the Court, or taken into account in relation to other matters. 
     
      
    133 While most of the offences related to offences of dishonesty, particularly involving the stealing or unlawful use of motor vehicles, the overall seriousness of which risks being overstated if attention is confined to their number, the record also includes other serious matters. It also presents a picture of wilful disobedience to the law, a complete failure on the Prisoner’s part to respond to any of the opportunities that have been provided for rehabilitation and for supervision, as well as an escalating pattern of criminality.  
     
      
    134 The net result has seen him in almost continuous custody, in one form or another, between the age of 11 years and his current age of 33 years.  
     
      
       
      The Evidence Tendered by the Prisoner 
       
      
    135 It is necessary to refer to the evidence which was placed before me in an attempt to understand why the Prisoner has engaged in such unremitting and escalating criminality. It came from the Prisoner, his mother and Anna Robilliard, a forensic psychologist and it shows that the Prisoner was born on 25 May 1971. He was apparently the youngest in a family comprising on his account 10 siblings. His mother, who is an indigenous Australian worked as a nurse, while his father worked as a removalist. It was reported that the family home had been stable and that his parents have a close continuing relationship. The case is not one where the Fernando considerations (R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58) apply.  
     
      
    136 The Prisoner claimed to Ms Robilliard that he was sexually molested by one of his step brothers for a period of two years or so, commencing when he was aged eight years. He eventually ran away from home and began to associate and identify with a delinquent peer group. It was at that stage of his criminal behaviour that detention in boys homes commenced. At one stage he was placed in foster care but ran back home as he did not care for that experience.  
     
      
    137 He was educated in the community to part way through Year 8, and thereafter continued his education, on an intermittent basis, while in custody, which regrettably included learning, from older boys, how to steal motor vehicles. He does not seem to have passed beyond Year 10, and has never held down any form of employment, although he has acquired some training and experience as a welder and labourer while in custody.  
     
      
    138 He has been involved in some short term unstable relationships which collapsed because of his imprisonment. The last relationship ran into problems because of his use of drugs and his friendship with another woman, which apparently led to a fight between her and his partner. The Prisoner became involved in this altercation, and was charged with several offences, although on his account unfairly.  
     
      
    139 It was by reason of his concern about being sent back to prison because of these charges, and his lack of confidence in the solicitor who was acting for him that, he said, led to him not appearing in court. It was also this factor, he says, that sent him seriously off the rails in 2003, and led him into an escalating use of illegal drugs and to the saga of criminality that now sees him awaiting sentence for the 19 offences which I have mentioned.  
     
      
    140 The Prisoner informed Anna Robilliard that he had sniffed glue and petrol in late childhood but gave that practice away because of an unfortunate experience while in a detention centre. In his evidence he claimed to have commenced sniffing these substances at the age of eight or nine years.  
     
      
    141 He began to smoke cannabis, although not to any great extent, preferring to smoke heroin, a practice which he says he began in late 1997 while in Lithgow Correctional Centre. Following his release from custody in mid 2003, he stopped using heroin in favour of smoking “shabu” or “ice”, in the free base form of methamphetamine.  
     
      
    142 His intelligence has been assessed as falling within the average range. From Ms Robilliard’s report, it appears that psychological testing has shown that he has a “highly significant score on a dimension measuring symptoms of paranoid personal disorder”, as well as “significant scores on the dependent, depressive, antisocial, avoidant, schizoid and passive/aggressive scales in that order”. 
     
      
    143 Ms Robilliard reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “The central issue for people suffering Paranoid Personality Disorder is suspiciousness and defensiveness combined with feelings of superiority. They are likely to feel bitter toward other people who have been successful and deny their own shortcomings, often blaming others as the cause. They are constantly vigilant, expecting others to criticise, deceive or injure them, and innocuous events will be perceived as insults or attempts to control and manipulate them. Responses will frequently be abrasive, touchy, hostile and irritable. The self fulfilling nature of Paranoid Disorder reinforces the patterns of behaviour. Others react to them negatively thus reinforcing their perception of the world as a dangerous and insecure place. 
        
       
       
        
        Paranoid disorder in combination with Schizoid and Avoidant personality attributes, results in a progressively more insular, reclusive and socially isolated disposition. Insularity is intended to protect the individual from fears that others may be able to influence or control them. In combination with Passive/Aggressive personality attributes, paranoid presentation would represent an exaggeration of the persons’ fault finding, resentful and discontented characteristics.  
        
       
       
        
        Antisocial personality attributes are consistent with an history of criminal behaviour and substance abuse. Impulsive acting out of antisocial feelings is the hallmark and these individuals who are typically interpersonally irresponsible violating the personal rights of others in work, relationship and financial context.” 
        
       
      
    144 Ms Robilliard also reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the section of the test that measures current reactive mood states and behaviours, significant scores on this profile are on scales measuring Anxiety, Dysthymia, Drug Dependence and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The highest score, which is on the Dysthymia scale, is equivalent to reactive depression. The individual is acknowledging feelings of sadness, pessimism, hopelessness, apathy, low self-esteem and guilt, which are directly related to current life events and circumstances. A sense of futility generally pervades their thinking and they are pre-occupied with their own inadequacy and helplessness. Suicidal ideation may be present and should be monitored.”  
        
       
      
    145 Of concern, apart from the foregoing, is the history which the Prisoner provided to Ms Robilliard of having a sense of hopelessness, and of his idea about the future being “a blank”, as well as her assessment that the current offences took place at a time when his life was in chaos and that the more chaotic he felt the greater the amount of drugs he used. She thought him likely to become fragile, and possibly self destructive after sentencing was completed. Clearly the correctional authorities will need to give careful attention to this, as he has a history of attempted suicide.  
     
      
    146 Ms Robilliard found no signs of psychiatric illness, such experience that he had had in the past of paranoid and delusional episodes having been attributable in her view to heavy drug use.  
     
      
    147 Attention was drawn by Ms Robilliard to the fact that Robert Julien in Primer of Drug Action (2001) describes ice as: 
     
      
       
        
        “a free base form of methamphetamine”. In other words ‘ice is to methamphetamine as crack is to cocaine: the free base concentrated smokable form of the parent compound. Unlike crack, methamphetamine has an extremely long half life (about 12 hours) resulting in an intense, persistent drug action. 
        
       
       
        
        Repeated high dosage of methamphetamines are associated with violent behaviour and paranoid psychosis…Just as prolonged cocaine use can result in psychoses resembling paranoid schizophrenia, smoking ice produces a pattern of acute, delusional and psychotic behaviour. However, unlike that of cocaine, amphetamine induced psychosis can persist for several weeks.” 
        
       
      
    148 In a lengthy report that was tendered by the defence, Associate Professor Starmer described the effects of methamphetamine, cannabis and cocaine use. 
     
      
    149 In relation to the substance methamphetamine, of which crystallised “ice” tends to be a very pure form, he explained that it “can have an effect in increasing libido, and a speeding of mental processes to the extent that the subject becomes submerged in a flood of thought associations, so that the attention jumps rapidly and ineffectually from one thought to another, as in a manic psychosis”. He also stated that high doses can result in the development of an amphetamine psychosis, which is characterised by intense emotional lability, hallucinatory phenomena and paranoid ideation in a setting of clear consciousness, and which closely resembles schizophrenia. He also indicated that the substance may lead to thought disorder, and that withdrawal can lead to amphetamine “crash”, which involves a depressive phase, fatigue, and suicidal tendencies.  
     
      
    150 Otherwise he referred to the well known effects of chronic cannabis and cocaine use, in relation, for example, to impairment of memory, concentration, cerebration, and elevated mood or euphoria; which do not require any greater analysis. Professor Starmer observed, finally, that while it is entirely possible that a change in behaviour can be attributed to the use of “ice”, that would require a close examination of time-relationships between its use and the change in the pattern of offending.  
     
      
    151 The Prisoner did claim in his evidence that his use of this substance escalated after the assault charges had been brought, and that the more he smoked this substance the more he committed offences. He also said that he had not considered that the further offences mattered because of the likely consequences of the assault charges. The proceeds of the robberies he said he used to purchase more drugs. 
     
      
    152 On his account the whole period was quite unreal and he cannot believe the mess in which he found himself. Otherwise there is very little material available upon which I can determine the extent of his use of “ice” or its time relationship to the offences. That it had some effect may be accepted, but it is also not to be overlooked that the Prisoner had anything but a good record before the assault charges, and there is very strong evidence that he was already committed to a life of crime. 
     
      
    153 In relation to the murder offence, he said that it had been his intention, having checked out the location and the habits of the deceased, to wait for his departure, to open the boot of his car, to grab his bag with the day’s takings, and to then run. The plan went astray, on his account, when the deceased seized his arm as he tried to operate the boot release, and held onto him and yelled out.  
     
      
    154 He said that he pulled out the gun, which he had previously loaded, in an attempt to scare off the deceased, but when he continued to struggle with him, the weapon discharged inflicting the fatal wound.  
     
      
    155 He said that he had been smoking “ice” before committing the offence, and had not realised, until the following day, that the victim had died.  
     
      
    156 He indicated that he had difficulty in talking about his emotions, but said that he felt “pretty bad” about this offence and that he felt “sorry” for the victim’s family, although he acknowledged that was a “feeble” word to express his feelings. He claimed to have had bad dreams about the incident, and had acknowledged his guilt to police to get it off his conscience, an observation which does not sit well with his continuing offending after this offence, or with his attempt to escape arrest on 22 August 2003. 
     
      
    157 One might have expected that, having killed in the course of a robbery, he would have refrained from any further robberies using a gun had he been truly remorseful for the murder. To the contrary he committed a large number of further robberies over the course of which he presented the same weapon at his victims. His explanation to the effect that he had pushed the earlier murder to the back of his mind does not sit comfortably with him having entertained any great concern over that offence. 
     
      
    158 In relation to the offences involving Ms EC, he asserted that he had also taken drugs before its commission, and had gone to the shopping centre where the hijack occurred, only with the intention of stealing a motor vehicle, and without any plan to have forced sexual intercourse with anyone. He acknowledged that when he had been interviewed by police, he had been prepared to admit his guilt, but had not wanted to talk about the matter because he felt ashamed and embarrassed about his conduct. He claimed to feel “bad” about the victim. 
     
      
    159 The selection of the victim’s motor vehicle, with her sitting inside it was, on his account, a spur of the moment decision, although as he conceded he and his companion had been casing the area for some time looking for a suitable vehicle to steal.  
     
      
    160 When asked what he had attempted to do in the past to address his drug habit, he said that he had approached several medical practitioners for help, but had been turned away as they did not treat “junkies”. He also said that he had never been offered any assistance while in custody, and that during his last release, he had tried home detoxification but that it had only lasted a few weeks, having been interrupted because of his relationship problems and the assault charges. 
     
      
    161 His mother gave evidence to the effect that he had first fallen into trouble due to the encouragement of the boyfriend of one of his sisters, who had been a car thief, and that from the age of ten or eleven until the age of seventeen he had spent most of his life in boys homes. Thereafter, until his latest release, she said he had spent most of his life in adult prisons.  
     
      
    162 She also said that his last release had been his longest period outside and confirmed that he had tried to obtain assistance from medical practitioners, without success. She had enlisted the aid of the Aboriginal Health Service, and as a result he had tried detoxification at home. She also confirmed that he had gone off the rails again as a result of his concern that his parole would be revoked by reason of the assault charges, which he had described as having been a police set up.  
     
      
    163 She said that both she and her husband had health problems which made it difficult for them to visit him in custody. She had however seen him twice since his arrest on 22 August 2003, and noticed that he had put on weight and looked “like [her] son again”. She said that he phoned his family daily and had sent letters to them apologising and expressing regret for what he had done. She also noted that he has said that he now has “no future”. 
     
      
       
      MATTERS OF RELEVANCE FOR SENTENCE 
       
       
      Remorse 
       
      
    164 I accept that the Prisoner does entertain some remorse concerning his extended criminality, although that is largely confined to the murder and the sexual assault of Ms EC, and was not of sufficient weight to deter him from re-offending in a very significant way.  
     
      
    165 While almost certainly a significant part of that remorse relates to his own circumstances, I am prepared to accept, by reason of the pleas and his evidence, that he has some limited insight into the stupidity and violence of his past behaviour, so far as his inhibitions were reduced by his abuse of narcotic drugs. 
     
      
       
      Drugs 
       
      
    166 Precisely which drugs he was using during the period covered by the indictments is not entirely clear, since somewhat different histories have been given. I accept that they included “ice”; and if Professor Starmer’s history is correct they may also have included cannabis, heroin and cocaine. 
     
      
    167 The abuse of drugs by the Prisoner helps to explain his behaviour but it does not excuse it.  
     
      
    168 In relation to this aspect of the case the principles which I set out in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and which were approved by the remainder of the Bench, are applicable to the sentencing of the Prisoner. They are to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “273. In my view the relevant principles are as follows:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence, and of itself is not a matter of mitigation;  
        
       
       
        
        (b) however the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence in so far as it may throw light on matters such as:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it; (cf  
          Bouchard 
           (1996) 84 A Crim R 499 at 501-2); and  
          Nolan 
           (1988) VSCA 135 (2 December 1998);  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the existence or non existence of any alternative reason that may have operated in aggravation of the offence, eg that it was motivated to fund some other serious criminal venture or to support a campaign of terrorism;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment, eg if he or she was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that may have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a willed act;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) It may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, in so far as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it, might:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) impact upon the prospects of recidivism/rehabilitation, in which respect it may on occasions prove to be a two-edged sword (eg  
          Lewis  
          Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 1 July 1992);  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness, or surgery (cf  
          Hodge 
           Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 2 November 1993; and  
          Talbot 
          ); or where it occurred at a very young age, or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) justify special consideration in the case of offenders judged to be at the ""cross roads"":  
          Osenkowski 
          (19882) 5 A Crim R 394.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        274. To go further, and to accept the fact of drug addiction as a mitigating factor generally, would not be justified in principle. Moreover, it would involve an exercise in irresponsibility on the part of the Court, if it were understood as a message that committing the crime of armed robbery to feed a drug habit is less deserving of censure than would otherwise be the case.” 
         
        
       
       
      The Pleas of Guilty 
       
      
    169 It may be accepted that the pleas of guilty to the 19 counts, and the admission of the Form 1 offences, has had a very great utility in saving the time and costs of the courts and of policing/prosecution agencies, and has also avoided the need for witnesses, who were no doubt traumatised by the offences, to undergo the ordeal of giving evidence. 
     
      
    170 The value of the pleas, and the contrition associated therewith, or otherwise evidenced, are such that discounts in the upper range of those considered in Regina v Thomson and Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 would have been appropriate had the various offences stood alone. A discount in the range of 20 to 25% remains appropriate for all of the offences, except for the offences of aggravated sexual assault in company and of murder, the enormity of which, and the circumstances in which they occurred, having been such that the utilitarian principle should yield to the public interest in securing a very heavy sentence for those offences: R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 and Regina v Thomson and Houlten at 158. 
     
      
    171 Although it was submitted that absent the Prisoner’s confession the Crown would have found difficulty in proving his guilt of the murder offence, that overlooks the ballistics and fingerprint evidence, the fact that he was arrested in circumstances where the weapon was linked to him, and the availability of eyewitness evidence.  
     
      
       
      Form 1 Offences 
       
      
    172 In so far as offences have been taken into account on a Form 1, they are to be dealt with according to the principles established in the guideline judgment of this Court: Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518 per Spigelman CJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “39. The sentencing court is sentencing  
        only  
        for the ""principal offence"". It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a ""discount"" for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        42. The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        44. The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account Form 1 offences. (See  
        R v Kay  
        at [69].)” 
        
       
       
      
    173 I voiced some concern in relation to the Hoang Thi Nguyen and Thi Thanh Ho indictment, in so far as the Crown elected to charge the Prisoner, in Count 3, with the armed robbery of Hoang Thi Nguyen’s mobile phone and to include on a Form 1, in relation to that offence, two further armed robbery offences involving the stealing from Thi Thanh Ho of the sums of $3000 and $6000. I was however informed that this followed upon negotiations between the parties which preceded the taking of pleas in the District Court.  
     
      
    174 Although this was somewhat irregular, particularly in the light of the observations of Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment at paras 49 and 50, I am satisfied that no material unfairness arises for either the Crown, the community or the Prisoner in following this course in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    175 I also voiced some concern as to whether the Prisoner had been appropriately charged with a s 154AA or s 154A offence in relation to the three charges of stealing a motor vehicle which were involved in the 29 November indictment (the Central Coast offences), since in at least two cases the offence seemed more akin to take and drive offences than stealing. I was again informed that the pleas followed upon negotiations which preceded the Prisoner’s committal for sentence and which led to a number of other associated matters being dealt with on a Form 1. Upon the basis that the charges, framed in terms of stealing, were take and drive offences, I will allow the convictions to stand. Again, in the context of the Prisoner’s overall criminality, these offences pale into insignificance and do not materially contribute to the sentencing exercise.  
     
      
       
      Vulnerability of the Victims 
       
      
    176 A further aspect of relevance in this case is the fact that most of the victims were in a position of vulnerability in so far as they were robbed while working in shops or in similar places of business: R v Thwaites NSWCCA 6 October 1993; or were the subject of bag snatches while leaving work: R v Ranse NSWCCA 8 August 1994, or were the subject of sexual assault: O’Grady NSWCCA 13 May 1997. 
     
      
    177 In each instance the fact of vulnerability is an aggravating feature, attracting a need for a condign sentence.  
     
      
       
      Offences Committed while on Parole 
       
      
    178 All of the offences were committed while the Prisoner was on parole for the matters referred to in para 129 above, a matter of serious aggravation for the reasons referred to in R v + NSWCCA 7 May 1991, R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28, R v Huynh [2003] NSWCCA 239 and R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109.  
     
      
       
      Deterrence 
       
      
    179 Although it is clear that the passing of sentences of imprisonment on the Prisoner in the past has had little or no effect on him by way of personal deterrence, that does not mean that he should not continue to receive such sentences. 
     
      
    180 More important however in this case is the need for a significant element of general deterrence to be built into the sentences for the reasons discussed in R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 where Spigelman CJ said:  
     
      
       
        
        “ Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Regina v Bahsa 
       [2003] NSWCCA 36.  
       
       
       
      Totality and prior record 
       
      
    181 The case is one where the totality of the criminality involved has to be taken into account in structuring the sentences, not only for offences which formed part of one incident, but between each separate group of offences, in accordance with the principles outlined in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at paras 45 to 48; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15 and R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. 
     
      
    182 The effect of these decisions is to require an appropriate sentence to be fixed for each offence, after which consideration is to be given to questions of concurrence or accumulation, including the “stepping stage” process referred to in R v Finnie [2002] NSWCCA 533 where there are offences charged on separate indictments, or involving separate episodes of criminality, such that the totality principle referred to in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 applies. The present case is one of escalating criminality of a very serious kind which, for the reasons identified in R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 at paras 38 and 39, calls for significant sentences in relation to the multiple offences of armed robbery. The use of a knife and a gun in these robberies, while elements of the offences charged, do make them particularly serious, having regard to the inevitable fear and trauma occasioned to victims who are confronted with weapons of this kind and then forced to give up their property.  
     
      
    183 In relation to these offences of armed robbery, the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 applies. In most instances features (ii), (iv), (v) and (vii) mentioned at para 162 of that judgment were present. In some instances aggravating circumstances were present in so far as substantial amounts of money were taken, and there was planning. In no case did the Prisoner answer feature (i).  
     
      
    184 Similarly the offences of aggravated sexual assault in company called for condign sentences and an accumulation upon the sentences passed by Judge Finnane for the reasons identified in R v AEM and Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 relating inter alia to denunciation and general deterrence.  
     
      
    185 The proper approach in a case where an offender has a prior record, or faces sentence for a series of later offences committed during an extended period, is captured by s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and also by the “rule of law” which became established at common law, and which was identified in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 where Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 477): 
     
      
       
        
        “… the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences: Director of Public Prosecutions v. Ottewell (1970) AC 642, at p 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner's claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community's understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties.” 
        
       
      
    186 The Veen (No 2) principle was described by Howie J in R v Shankley (Glen William) [2003] NSWCCA 253, in the following terms (at para 31): 
     
      
       
        
        “The effect of the prior criminal record of the offender, where it is relevant to sentencing, is not to increase the objective seriousness of the offence committed but rather that ‘retribution, deterrence and protection of society may indicate a more severe sentence is warranted’.” 
        
       
      
    187 That this rule of law is to be taken into account was confirmed in Regina v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76, where the repetition of firearms offences was held to be capable of illuminating his moral culpability and of demonstrating the particular need for both general and personal deterrence see also R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152.  
     
      
    188 Although, in a very broad way, all of the offences were committed in the course of an extended bout of criminality, they did involve different victims, each of whose lives has been affected significantly. That circumstance must be reflected in the total sentence and cannot be glossed over by reference to the totality principle which is designed to prevent accumulation to the point where the overall sentence is harsh and disproportionate: see R v Cotter [2003] NSWCCA 273 and R v KM and Ors [2004] NSWCCA 65 at paras 55 and 56.  
     
      
    189 The perception that there is not much to choose between a person who commits one or two offences and one who commits six or seven offences cannot be permitted to take hold, as Sully J said in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at paras 34 and 37.  
     
      
    190 Offences committed following the commission of any of the offences for which the Prisoner stands for sentence can also properly be taken into account: Regina v Hutchins (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 75.  
     
      
    191 Moreover, even though the Prisoner has indicated an intention to lodge an appeal against the convictions and sentences in the trial before Judge Finnane, those convictions and sentences do need to be taken into account by me. They are not to be regarded as having involved provisional verdicts or sentences: R v Sinanovic [2000] NSWCCA 394.  
     
      
    192 The effect of the very heavy sentences imposed by Finnane DCJ would be to lead to a virtual life sentence if there were to be any accumulation, upon those sentences (either on the non-parole period or a large proportion of it), that are appropriate, in this case, for the armed robbery and aggravated sexual assault offences, leaving aside the sentence for the murder count. This does provide something of a conundrum in the present case, particularly if those sentences are successfully appealed. I propose to resolve that by imposing sentences which I consider individually appropriate, and by postponing their commencement by 5 years from the time of arrest, so as to allow for a partial accumulation, and more importantly, to take the offences dealt with by Finnane DCJ into consideration, so far as they are relevant for my assessment of the Prisoner’s dangerousness and prospects of rehabilitation, which are of central importance for the sentence in relation to the murder count.  
     
      
       
      Standard non-parole periods 
       
      
    193 As I have observed, the offences of murder, aggravated sexual assault and aggravated carjacking are offences for which standard non-parole periods apply. While it was held in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 that these periods were intended to apply to offences of a middle range of seriousness decided after trial, they still take their place as a reference point in cases where there have been pleas of guilty: R v Davies [2004] NSWCCA 319 and see also R v Goodwin [2004] NSWSC 757. 
     
      
    194 I propose to approach the sentencing of the Prisoner for these charges on that basis.  
     
      
       
      Special circumstances  
       
      
    195 While matters such as an accumulation of sentence and the need for extended supervision following the return of a Prisoner to the community, after serving very lengthy periods in custody, would qualify as special circumstances within the meaning of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the nature of the sentences which I consider is required in this case, means that there is no occasion for the power reserved in s 44(2) to be invoked, save in the one respect later mentioned.  
     
      
    196 Otherwise the case is one where all factors, including matters of accumulation and totality of criminality, and any subjective features of relevance, will be taken into account in fixing the non-parole periods and any balance of term. The principles discussed in Regina v Simpson (2001) 126 A Crim R 525 and R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 apply.  
     
      
       
      Dangerousness to the Community 
       
      
    197 While it may be accepted that the Prisoner had used drugs at the time of the relevant offences, his behaviour at the scene of the various crimes does not suggest that he was other than aware of what he was doing or in full control of the situation. He had chosen his targets with some care, and the offences were premeditated, although perhaps with the exception of the sexual assault of Ms EC, which in all probability involved a spur of the moment decision.  
     
      
    198 Of concern is the fact that for a number of the offences for which I am to impose sentence, and also for the offences which were dealt with by Judge Finnane, the Prisoner had taken younger males with him. The encouragement that he was giving these young persons to follow him into a life of crime was particularly discreditable. It indicates not only that he presents as a danger to the community, but underlines the need for the sentences to demonstrate, by way of deterrence, the consequences for any offender who choses to follow in the footsteps of the Prisoner. 
     
      
    199 It is rare that one can say, with any confidence, that a Prisoner presents a very serious ongoing danger to the community, or that his rehabilitation prospects are negligible. The present however is a case where I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt, although it does not have to be established to that standard (R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310 and R v McNamara  [2004] NSWCCA 42) that each finding should be made.  
     
      
    200 That this is so appears from the lengthy record of the prisoner, the very great objective culpability involved in each of the offences before me, the number of these offences, and the appalling criminality involved in the offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Finnane. The Prisoner has shown himself to have no regard for person or property, he has ignored the lessons which his prior sentences should have conveyed, and he has effectively placed himself outside all normal standards of behaviour or constraints of civilised living. The manner in which he posed with a fistful of bank notes and with a pistol on his hip in the photograph which was tendered, says much as to the way in which he regards himself. 
     
      
    201 The psychological profile similarly holds out very little hope of him ever being rehabilitated, or of controlling his aggressive and dangerous impulses. He came from a supportive family. While it was a big family which had its own problems, with the exception of the alleged sexual abuse by a step brother, of which no evidence came from the Prisoner or his mother, there is nothing to suggest that his early years were particularly dysfunctional.  
     
      
    202 His subsequent periods of custody either in boys homes, in detention centres or in adult prisons have, no doubt, hardened him to the point where, if he is not already institutionalised, he is very close to it. Again, his history of almost continuous detention away from his family, and the inevitable exposure to delinquent peer behaviour almost certainly go a long way to explaining where he is today, and why he has chosen to continue offending.  
     
      
    203 It may be accepted that prolonged imprisonment, particularly in maximum security, which is the lot of the most serious offender and also of the offender with a history of escape, such as the Prisoner, offers little encouragement or opportunity for reform. Rehabilitation, however, is only one of the objectives of sentencing which are specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The courts have no alternative to imposing custodial sentences for serial offenders and habitual criminals, such as the Prisoner, and it does not sit well in their mouths to assert that the fact of imprisonment has hardened them or set them more firmly on the path of crime.  
     
      
    204 While it is hard for an offender to rehabilitate himself, or to abandon the use of drugs, it can be done, and there are opportunities for rebuilding lives available for those who chose to use them 
     
      
    205 As I have observed the Prisoner in this case has not altered his course, and his history, personality, and level of criminality of the most sustained and serious kind, shows that he is an ongoing danger to the community, and one of the relatively rare offenders who falls into the category of offender mentioned in the passage from Veen v The Queen (No 2) cited earlier in these reasons. 
     
      
    206 To that principle is added the circumstance that s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act lists the protection of the community as one of the several purposes of sentencing which also include adequate punishment, personal and general deterrence, denunciation, accountability and recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community, in addition to that of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    207 The protection of society has long been an important theme in sentencing: R v Valentini (1980) 2 A Crim R 170 at 174, and R v Cuthbert (1967) 86 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 272 and it now clearly stands as a sentencing objective in its own right.  
     
      
    208 That would not justify a departure from the equally long standing principle of the need for proportionality of the sentence to the offence before the Court, nor would it of itself justify purely preventative detention. Nevertheless it is a matter properly to be taken into account in the way recognised in Veen v The Queen (No 2).  
     
      
       
      THE SENTENCES 
       
      
    209 In the light of these principles and findings I will now deal with each of the 19 offences.  
     
      
       
      FIRST INDICTMENT 
       
       
      Count 1: Aggravated Car Jacking 
       
      
    210 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), (j), (m) and (n) which were not elements of the offence. The only mitigating factor present was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k), namely the plea of guilty which I take into account. It is a standard non-parole period offence, and the Table provides a reference point. It was a particularly serious offence of its kind.  
     
      
    211 For this offence I sentence the Prisoner to a fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 22 August 2008 and to expire on 21 August 2012.  
     
      
       
      Counts 2 and 3: Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company 
       
      
    212 These were the offences involving digital and vaginal penetration, and they were offences where there were present the aggravating features mentioned in s 21A(2), (d), (g), (j), (l) and (m), which were not elements of the offence. The only mitigating factors were those referred to in s 21A(3), (b) and (k), each of which I take into account. They were standard non-parole period offences, and the Table provides a reference point. Each was a particularly serious offence of its kind.  
     
      
    213 For these offences I sentence the Prisoner to concurrent non-parole periods each of 12 years to date from 22 August 2008 and to expire on 21 August 2020, and to a balance of parole of 4 years expiring on 21 August 2024.  
     
      
       
      Count 4: Aggravated Robbery Being Armed with a Dangerous Weapon 
       
      
    214 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2), (d), (e), (j), (m) and (n), not being elements of the offence. The only mitigating factor was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k), which I take into account. It is an offence within the Henry guideline, and I sentence the Prisoner to a fixed term of imprisonment for 5 years to date from 22 August 2009 and to expire on 21 August 2014. 
     
      
       
      Count 5: Specially Aggravated Kidnapping 
       
      
    215 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2), (d), (g), (j), (l), (m) and (n) not being elements of the offence. The only mitigating factor was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k) which I take into account. I sentence the Prisoner to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years to date from 22 August 2010 and to expire on 21 August 2013. 
     
      
       
      Count 6: Attempt to Obtain Money by Deception 
       
      
    216 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating features mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), (j), (m) and (n), not being elements of the offence. The only mitigating circumstances present were those referred to in s 21A(3)(a) and (k) which I take into account. I sentence the Prisoner to a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months to date from 22 August 2010 and to expire on 21 February 2012.  
     
      
    217 The effective overall sentence imposed in relation to this indictment accordingly involves a non-parole period of 12 years, commencing on 22 August 2008 and expiring on 21 August 2020 and a balance of term of 4 years expiring on 21 August 2024.  
     
      
    218 Where fixed terms have been imposed that is because they are wholly subsumed in the sentences for Counts 2 and 3 and in the case of Count 6 because it is intrinsically linked with Count 5. There has been some accumulation of sentence to mark the totality of the criminality involved in these offences which continued for some time, and involved separate and very serious offences.  
     
      
       
      SECOND INDICTMENT 
       
       
      Count 3: Robbery While Armed with an Offensive Weapon 
       
      
    219 This was an offence where there was present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), (j), (l), (m) and (n) which were not elements of the offence. The only mitigating factor present was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k) which I take into account. It falls within the Henry guideline, and it is an offence in respect of which two further similar offences, one committed on the same day, and one committed three days earlier, is to be taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    220 Taking these matters on the Form 1 into account I sentence the Prisoner in relation to this offence to a non-parole period of 6 years to date from 22 August 2019 and to expire on 21 August 2025, and to a balance of parole of 2 years, to expire on 21 August 2027. 
     
      
       
      Count 4: Robbery While Armed with an Offensive Weapon 
       
      
    221 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), (j) and (n) which were not an element of it. The only mitigating factor was that mentioned in s 21A(2)(k) which I take into account. It is also a case within the Henry Guideline. I sentence the Prisoner to a fixed term of 4 years to date from 22 August 2021 and to expire on 21 August 2025.  
     
      
       
      Count 5: Robbery while Armed with a Dangerous Weapon 
       
      
    222 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), (e), (j), (l), (m) and (n) which were not elements of it. The only mitigating factor present was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k) which I take into account. It was also a case within the Henry guideline, and one where I am to take into account, on a Form 1, an offence of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon involving a quite separate victim and place, an offence of take and drive associated with that offence, and an aggravated kidnapping associated with the offence the subject of this count.  
     
      
    223 I impose a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 22 August 2023 to expire on 21 August 2030 with a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 21 August 2032. 
     
      
    224 The effective overall sentence for the counts in this indictment is accordingly one involving a non-parole period of 11 years commencing from 22 August 2019 and expiring on 21 August 2030 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 21 August 2032. 
     
      
    225 The individual sentences have been accumulated to reflect the significant and separate criminality involved in the three separate incidents charged, along with the Form 1 matters, bearing also in mind the offences for which sentences have been imposed in relation to the first indictment, as well as the sentences imposed by Judge Finnane in relation to the offences which (apart from two Form 1 matters) had preceded these offences.  
     
      
       
      THIRD INDICTMENT 
       
       
      The murder of Emad Youssef 
       
      
    226 This is an offence where the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(d), (g), (i), (j), (l), (m) and (n) were present, not being elements of the offence. The only mitigating factor present was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k) which I take into account.  
     
      
    227 It is a standard non-parole period offence. Standing alone, it would not have qualified for a life sentence in accordance with s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as the application of that section was explained in R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409, although the circumstances of its commission, in the light of the Prisoner’s record prior to his last release on parole would have justified a non-parole period of at least twenty years.  
     
      
    228 Its commission is now to be considered in the light of the fact that it followed the very serious offences of armed robbery and aggravated sexual assault which have been dealt with pursuant to the other indictments before me. It also follows the quite appalling offences in reference to which the Prisoner had been sentenced by Judge Finnane. It involved not only an utter recklessness and disregard of human life, but it also occurred in the course of a planned armed robbery. I am of the view that the level of culpability in its commission, even though it was a case of felony murder, combined with my finding of the dangerousness of the Prisoner to the community, and his negligible prospects of rehabilitation, are such that the objectives of punishment spelled out in s 3A, leave me with no alternative other than to impose the maximum sentence of imprisonment for life.  
     
      
    229 Accordingly, in relation to this Count I sentence the Prisoner to imprisonment for life. The commencement date of this sentence is of little moment, but for convenience I will direct that it commence from the time of the Prisoner’s arrest, namely 22 August 2003.  
     
      
       
      FOURTH INDICTMENT 
       
       
      Count 1: Robbery while Armed with a Dangerous Weapon 
       
      
    230 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), (e), (j), (l), (m) and (n) not being elements of it. The only mitigating factor was that mentioned in s 21A(3)(k) which I take into account. It was a case falling within the Henry guideline. 
     
      
    231 I sentence the Prisoner in relation to this offence to a fixed term of 5 years to date from 22 August 2026 to expire 21 August 2031. 
     
      
       
      Count 2: Steal Motor Vehicle 
       
      
    232 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2)(d), (e), (j), (m) and (n) not being elements of it. The only mitigating factors were those referred to in s 21A(3)(a) and (k), which I take into account. It was closely associated with Count 1 and I sentence the Prisoner to a concurrent fixed term of 1 year to date from 22 August 2026, and to expire on 21 August 2027.  
     
      
       
      Count 3: Robbery while Armed with a Dangerous Weapon 
       
      
    233 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors mentioned in s 21A(2), (d), (e), (j), (l) and (m) which were not elements of it. The only mitigating factors were those referred to in s 21A(3)(a) and (k) which I take into account. It was a case within the Henry guideline and it was carried out only 5 days after the offence in Count 1. I sentence the Prisoner for this offence to a fixed term of 5 years from 22 August 2027 to expire on 21 August 2032. 
     
      
       
      Count 4: Robbery while Armed with A Dangerous Weapon 
       
      
    234 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2)(d), (j), (l), and (n), which were not elements of it. There were present the mitigating factors mentioned in s 21A(3)(a) and (k) which I take into account. 
     
      
    235 Although the offence was potentially very serious and frightening for the victims, the actual property stolen was of limited value. It was however a case within the Henry guideline. I sentence the prisoner for this count to a fixed term of 5 years to commence from 22 August 2027 and expiring on 21 August 2032. 
     
      
       
      Count 5: Robbery while Armed with a Dangerous Weapon 
       
      
    236 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2)(d), (g), (j), (l), (m) and (n), which were not elements of it. The only mitigating factor that was present was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k) which I take into account. It was also a case within the Henry guideline and it was committed only one day after the offence in Count 4.  
     
      
    237 I sentence the prisoner for this count to a fixed term of 5 years to commence from 22 August 2028 and to expire on 21 August 2033.  
     
      
       
      Count 6: Robbery while Armed with a Dangerous Weapon 
        
       
      
    238 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2)(d), (e), (j), (m) and (n) which were not elements of it. The mitigating factors present were those referred to in s 21A(3)(a) and (k) which I take into account. 
     
      
    239 It was a case within the Henry guideline. Having regard to its close connection with the offence charged in Count 5, and the trivial amount taken, I sentence the Prisoner to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years to commence from 22 August 2028 and to expire on 21 August 2030, to be served concurrently with the sentence for Count 5. 
     
      
       
      Count 7: Robbery while Armed with a Dangerous Weapon 
       
      
    240 This was an offence where there were present the aggravating features referred to in s 21A(2)(d), (g), (j), (l), (m) and (n) which were not elements of it. The only mitigating factor present was that referred to in s 21A(3)(k) which I take into account.  
     
      
    241 It was a case within the Henry guideline, and it followed close on the heels of the offences otherwise charged in this indictment. Moreover I am to take into account four offences on a Form 1, two of which were closely associated with other offences that were charged. The other two offences were of limited seriousness, although they were part of the ongoing criminal activities of the Prisoner which he had apparently moved from Sydney to the Central Coast.  
     
      
    242 For these offences, taking into account the Form 1 matters, I sentence the Prisoner to a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 22 August 2029 and to expire on 21 August 2036 and to a balance of parole of 8 years, expiring on 21 August 2044. The case is one where, subject to the life sentence surviving any appeal, there is justification, by reason of the special circumstances previously mentioned, to allow for an extended period of supervision on parole, it being the last sentence in a series of accumulated sentences. The period of 8 years is less than that which is contemplated by s 44 of the Act, and represents a lower proportion than is the norm when the overall sentence is taken into account. However, any longer period would not have served any useful purpose.  
     
      
       
      Counts 8 and 9: Steal Motor Vehicle 
       
      
    243 In this case there were present the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2)(d), (j) and (n), which were not elements of it. There were present the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3)(a) and (k), which I take into account. 
     
      
    244 By reason of their close association with the other offences in each case I sentence the Prisoner to fixed terms of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 22 August 2029 and to expire on 21 August 2031 and upon that basis to be wholly concurrent with the sentence for Count 7.  
     
      
    245 The effective overall sentence for the offences charged in this indictment is accordingly one providing for a total non-parole period of 10 years commencing from 22 August 2026 and expiring on 21 August 2036 with a balance of parole of 8 years expiring on 21 August 2044. 
     
      
    246 Leaving aside the life sentence imposed for the murder, the overall effect of all of the determinate sentences imposed is one involving a non-parole period of 28 years commencing on 22 August 2008 and expiring on 21 August 2036 with a balance of term of 8 years expiring on 21 August 2044. They will be wholly absorbed in the life sentence, but the sentences have been formulated in the manner set forth, since they individually indicate the seriousness which attached to this section of the Prisoner’s saga of criminality. As a consequence they form part of my reasons for imposing the life sentence for murder.  
     
      
    247 Other than where fixed terms have been imposed, I have taken the course of setting sentences with non-parole periods and balances of terms since, in imposing the life sentence for the murder count, I have attached considerable weight to the offences of which the Prisoner was convicted after trial before Judge Finnane and a jury, and for which the Prisoner was effectively sentenced to a non-parole period of 30 years and a balance of parole of 10 years. The commission of those offences in a context where they followed the offences charged in the first indictment before me, and preceded the offences charged in the remaining indictments, was of particular significance in my assessment of the Prisoner’s dangerousness to the community and to the weight to be given to each of the s 3A sentencing objectives.  
     
      
    248 I recognise that, in the event of the Appellant successfully appealing against the convictions for the matters dealt with by Finnane DCJ, and being acquitted after retrial or otherwise, then occasion may well arise for the life sentence to be reviewed on appeal.  
     
      
    249 The current case is one where, for similar reasons to those outlined by me in Regina v Harris it would, in my view, have been far preferable for the Court to have retained a capacity to specify a lengthy non-parole period for the murder offence, given the extremely harsh consequences of a life sentence for a 33 year old, with no hope of release, and no incentive for rehabilitation.

      Offences and sentence 
       
      
    3 On 11 December 2003 the applicant was sentenced by Nield DCJ in relation to the following three offences: 
     
      
       
      (i) Robbery in company (subs 97(1) of  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 20 years). 
       
       
      (ii) Malicious damage to property (subs 195(a)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years). 
       
       
      (iii) Stealing (s117  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years). 
       
      
    4 The offence of robbery in company occurred on 2 October 2002. The applicant entered a plea to that count on 10 July 2003 when the matter was listed in the Local Court. On 10 October 2003 Nield DCJ began hearing the sentence proceedings for this offence. On that day a pre-sentence report was tendered along with a psychologist’s report on behalf of the applicant and the applicant gave evidence. The matter did not conclude and the applicant was allowed bail. 
     
      
    5 One day later, 11 October 2003 whilst on bail, the applicant committed the second and third offences of malicious damage to property and stealing.  
     
      
    6 The sentences imposed by his Honour on 11 December 2003 were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Malicious damage to property and stealing – imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months. The non-parole period was set to commence on 11 October 2003 and expire on 10 April 2005 and the parole period was set to commence on 11 October 2003 and expire on 10 October 2005. 
       
       
      (ii) Robbery in company – imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. The non-parole period was set to commence on 11 January 2005 and expire on 10 April 2007. The parole period was set to commence on 11 April 2007 and expire on 10 October 2008. 
       
      
    7 Despite the offences being entirely distinct, his Honour determined that there should be some degree of concurrence. Thus the total term was 5 years and the non-parole period was 3 years and 6 months, commencing from the date on which the applicant was taken into custody. 
     
      
    8 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the above sentences. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
      
     Robbery in company offence – 2 October 2002 
     
      
    9 The applicant attended the Crown Hotel at Surry Hills some time after 8 pm on 2 October 2002. The applicant was in company with four other persons, including two males Joseph Goshn and George Haidar and two females, Vivianne Venuto and another female identified only as Irene. 
     
      
    10 At about 10.30 pm Luke Richards, a barman employed at the Hotel, heard an alarm activated for the poker machines. He approached the group and witnessed Joseph Goshn breaking open machine number 10 and the applicant attempting to break open machine number 21. The two females were standing around that machine. Mr Richards challenged the group. Goshn held a foot long thin object, which was thought to be a screwdriver, towards Mr Richards and said “Get back or I’ll fucking stab ya”. Mr Richards felt threatened and turned away. During this time the four persons (excluding Haidar) were in company with each other. 
     
      
    11 The applicant and the three other persons then ran out of the side door of the Hotel onto Crown Street. Mr Richards and another Hotel employee followed them and observed the group get into a motor vehicle which police later discovered was registered to George Haidar. When Haidar was interviewed by the police he admitted being at the Crown Hotel that night and leaving in the vehicle registered to his name but stated that he was alone when he arrived, whilst he was at the Hotel and when he left. 
     
      
    12 Substantial damage was sustained to the poker machines as a result of the forced entry. The cash box from machine number 10 was stolen and contained $2,880 in cash. The cash box from machine number 21 was not taken. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was arrested on 12 February 2003 and the police interviewed him. During the interview the applicant stated that he had attended Goshn’s house in Dulwich Hill prior to attending the Crown Hotel. He said that Goshn, Haidar, Venuto and another female called Irene all went to the Crown Hotel in George Haidar’s car. The applicant said that Goshn spoke to him prior to leaving Dulwich Hill about stealing the cash boxes from the poker machines at the Hotel and saying that it was easy to do. The applicant stated that he didn’t really want to do it, but was in need of money. The applicant admitted that he and Goshn played on poker machines next to each other for an unknown time and then they both started breaking into the machines with screwdrivers. 
     
      
    14 The applicant stated that a staff member came and asked them what they were doing and that was when Goshn said something threatening to the staff member. The applicant stopped opening the poker machine door and they all ran out to George’s car and went back to Goshn’s house at Dulwich Hill. When the applicant gave evidence in the sentencing hearing on 10 October 2003 in relation to the robbery in company offence he said that it was Joseph Goshn’s idea to commit the offence and that he went along with it because he was under the influence of Rohypnol and he needed some bond money. 
     
      
    15 Joseph Goshn was arrested by police in relation to the matter, but has not been charged with any offence. George Haidar and Vivianne Venuto were charged with the offence of robbery in company and in the alternative, larceny and malicious damage. A joint trial was conducted in October 2003. On 10 October 2003 Venuto was acquitted on all counts and Haidar was convicted only in respect of one count of larceny. Haidar was placed on a good behaviour bond for 2 years in respect of that offence. 
     
      
       
      Offences of malicious damage to property and stealing – 11 October 2003 
       
      
    16 At about 6 pm on 11 October 2003 the applicant attended the Hornsby Railway Hotel in Coronation Street, Hornsby in the company of his co-offender Louis Basic. At 7.24 pm the applicant used a screwdriver to force open a door of a poker machine and remove the cash box. The applicant handed the box to Basic and they ran out of the Hotel. The offence was recorded by the security video and witnessed by an employee of the Hotel. This employee telephoned a member of the Hotel management, who in turn telephoned the police. 
     
      
    17 Police who were patrolling in the vicinity saw two males run to a blue Ford Laser sedan. The police observed the Ford Laser sedan being driven away by Irene Basic. The police activated all warning devices and indicated for the vehicle to stop. The vehicle failed to stop and the police called a pursuit. The vehicle came to a stop at a dead-end and the three occupants were arrested. 
     
      
    18 The police searched the vehicle and located a metal cash box containing $4,295 under the front passenger seat. The applicant declined to participate in an electronically recorded interview. Louis Basic was interviewed and made full admissions to the offence. The applicant pleaded guilty to those offences on 4 November 2003. 
     
      
    19 On 9 December 2003 the applicant gave evidence in relation to the offences of 11 October 2003. The applicant said that it was his co-offender Louis Basic who suggested they commit the offence. He admitted that he took the screwdriver to the Hotel and that he broke open the machine to remove the cash box which he handed to Basic. He agreed to commit the offence because Basic owed him money and he said he would pay him back. 
     
      
       
      Subjective considerations 
       
      
    20 At the time of the offences the applicant was living with his parents in Petersham. He had a de facto partner and a three-year-old daughter. He was employed as an apprentice hairdresser. 
     
      
    21 The applicant has had an ongoing problem with drugs, although he claimed to have substantially overcome this problem at the time of the offences. He did, however, claim to be under the influence of Rohypnol when he committed the robbery in company offence. 
     
      
    22 As of 2 October 2002 when the robbery in company offence was committed, the applicant was on bail in respect of the offences of receiving stolen property, possessing stolen property and travelling in a motor vehicle taken without the consent of the owner. As of 11 October 2003 when the malicious damage and stealing offences were committed, the applicant was not only on bail in respect of the robbery in company offence, but was subject to two bonds pursuant to s9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for 2 years in respect of the receiving and possession offences. He was subject to a community service order in relation to those offences. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis that the robbery offence was planned. 
       
      
    23 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had erred when he noted that the robbery in company offence had been planned whereas it was clear that only the stealing offence had been planned. The fact that this offence had escalated into robbery was entirely unplanned and was due solely to the unexpected behaviour of Ghosn in threatening a member of the Hotel staff with a screwdriver. 
     
      
    24 In order to understand what his Honour did, one needs to appreciate the context in which his Honour referred to the planning of the offence. At ROS 8.6 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first offence that of robbery in company, is a very serious offence. It is one contrary to s97 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . The prescribed punishment for the offence is imprisonment for a maximum of 20 years. The offence cannot be dealt with summarily. The Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment in  
        Henry 
         is applicable by analogy to the offence. Having regard to  
        Henry 
         these features are important: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The offender is a young man just 21 years 6 months when he committed the first offence, and only 22 years 8 months now. 
         
        (2) He has a record of offences involving dishonesty. 
         
        (3) He was on conditional liberty at the time of committing the offence. 
         
        (4) The offence was planned, albeit without much sophistication. 
         
        (5) A threat of the use of violence was made albeit not by the offender. 
         
        (6) No-one was injured. 
         
        (7) A not insignificant amount of money was taken and none of it was recovered by police or has been returned by the offender.”  
        
       
      
    25 In addition to noting similarities with the decision of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 his Honour had specific regard to other matters – aggravating features in that the offence was committed whilst on conditional liberty, assistance to the police, the applicant’s early plea, the absence of contrition, the unlikelihood of successful rehabilitation, general and specific deterrence and the absence of special circumstances. No further reference was made to planning. 
     
      
    26 Looking at the totality of his Honour’s remarks on sentence in relation to the robbery in company offence, it is apparent that the planning element to which his Honour had regard played very little part in his Honour’s reasoning process. In any event it is clear from his Honour’s recital of the facts that his Honour was well aware that the planning element was related to the stealing offence and that this was what he was referring to by analogy with the decision in R v Henry. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion ground 1 has not been made out and no error has been identified such as would justify interference with his Honour’s sentence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in failing to properly discount the applicant’s sentence in relation to the robbery offence as a result of his assistance to the authorities. 
       
      
    28 This ground of appeal was relied upon to support two arguments. 
     
      
       
      (i) That an additional discount should have been given because of the assistance provided by the applicant to police. 
       
       
      (ii) That an additional discount should have been given because the applicant by pleading guilty to the robbery in company offence established his own guilt, a matter which would have been very difficult for the police to otherwise establish. 
       
      
    29 At ROS 11.1 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender pleaded guilty to the offence of 2 October 2002 and the offences of 11 October 2003 at the earliest appropriate opportunity and, therefore, he is entitled to a discount in sentence of twenty five percent for his guilty pleas, they having the greatest utilitarian value. 
         
        
       
       
      Earlier at ROS 10.9 his Honour said: 
       
       
        
        “As to the offence of 2 October 2002, when he was interviewed the offender admitted to police what he had done and he identified his co-offenders, other than the one named “Irene”.” 
        
       
      
    30 The complaint by the applicant was that his Honour’s judgment lacked transparency in that although his Honour had referred to the assistance provided by the applicant, it was not apparent that his Honour had taken it into account when fixing the sentence. Reference was made to decisions of this Court where transparency in the sentencing process was recommended. 
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that the assistance provided by the applicant was minimal. At most it involved the identification of Joseph Goshn. The police already had information which identified George Haidar and Vivianne Venuto. The applicant refused to provide any further information about the second female, other than the name “Irene”. Of considerable significance was the fact that the applicant did not give evidence against his co-offenders, ie Ms Venuto and George Haidar. 
     
      
    32 The Crown submitted that when considering the limited assistance provided by the applicant against the background of what the police already knew, it was not surprising that the police did not provide a “letter of comfort”. 
     
      
    33 In relation to this submission the comments of Levine J in R v Hoskins [2004] NSWCCA 236 are appropriate: 
     
      
       
        
        “[53] Even if I were persuaded that some discrete separate allowance must be made and quantified (see  
        Regina v PPB 
         [1999] NSWCCA 360) any such allowance would be so minimal it could safely be said to be incorporated in the twenty five percent allowed by the judge for a plea on arraignment and with which the Crown does not take issue. It must be borne in mind that s23(3) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         provides that any discount allowed as a result of assistance to the authorities must not result in a penalty which is “unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence”. (Sully J  
        Regina v Armstrong 
         [2000] NSWCCA 14 at [15]-[17])” 
        
       
      
    34 While the assistance offered by the applicant in relation to the robbery in company offence was slightly more than that given by the applicant in Hoskins’ case, the assistance was still very limited. It is to be noted that Goshn has yet to be charged with any offence relating to the 2 October 2002 incident. 
     
      
    35 I can see no error on the part of his Honour in not applying any specific additional discount other than the twenty five percent allowed for the early plea of guilty. This argument fails. 
     
      
    36 The applicant’s second argument was that because the Crown would have had some difficulty in proving the robbery in company offence without the admission of guilt by him, an additional discount beyond the twenty five percent already allowed for the plea should have been made. 
     
      
    37 The strength or weakness of the Crown case is relevant to questions of contrition and remorse but not to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty (R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225, R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383). Because of the circumstances which arose during the sentencing process for this offence (ie the commission of the stealing and malicious damage offences) his Honour found, as he was entitled to do, that the applicant had no contrition or remorse in relation to it. The suggested weakness in the Crown case does not invalidate his Honour’s conclusions as to remorse and contrition. 
     
      
    38 In any event his Honour allowed in the applicant’s favour the maximum discount in the range suggested in R v Thomson and Houlton for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty. This case did not raise one of the exceptions specifically referred to in R v Thomson and Houlton nor did it raise the sort of considerations referred to in R v Ellis (1996) 6 NSWLR 603. Accordingly, there was no requirement for his Honour to increase the discount beyond the twenty five percent already allowed by him.39 No error has been revealed in his Honour’s approach to the applicant’s plea of guilty to the robbery in company offence and the second argument under this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentences imposed upon him in relation to the offences of stealing and malicious damage and those imposed upon his co-offender, Louis Basic 
       
      
    40 Louis Basic pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the offences of malicious damage and stealing committed in company with the applicant on 11 October 2003. He was sentenced in the Local Court to concurrent terms of 3 months imprisonment for those offences. He was also sentenced to concurrent terms of 3 months imprisonment in relation to four other stealing and malicious damage offences which occurred on 2 March 2003. These were unrelated to the applicant. It is the lack of parity between that sentence and the 2 year sentence with a non-parole period of 18 months imposed on the applicant for the offences of 11 October 2003 which is relied upon to support this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    41 The 3 months sentence of imprisonment imposed on Louis Basic was specifically brought to the attention of his Honour. At ROS 12.9 and 13.1 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the offences of 11 October 2003, Louis Basic was charged with the offences of malicious damage to property and stealing and Irene Basic was charged with some driving offences. Louis Basic pleaded guilty to the offences and he was dealt with by a magistrate in the Local Court, being sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed period of 3 months for each offence with the sentences to be served concurrently. I do not know the criminal record, if any, of Louis Basic … and as to the offences of 11 October 2003, the offender must suffer a more severe punishment than Louis Basic, albeit that I do not know of his criminal record, if any, as the offender is being dealt with in the District Court whereas Basic was dealt with in a Local Court.” 
        
       
      
    42 The question of parity was thus specifically raised. His Honour erred in dealing with that issue by simply referring to the different courts before which the offenders appeared. Both offenders were to be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and in particular ss 3A and 21A. The upper limit available to a magistrate is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty (R v Doan [2000] 50 NSWLR 115 at para 35). The sentence imposed on Louis Basic could not be disregarded for the purposes of parity. 
     
      
    43 The question then arises as to whether his Honour’s error in this regard should lead to a reduction in the applicant’s sentence. Can his Honour’s sentence be supported on other grounds? 
     
      
    44 There were a number of distinguishing features between the applicant and Louis Basic. The applicant had a significantly more serious criminal record which included a 6 months period of imprisonment. 
     
      
    45 While both offenders had committed these offences whilst on conditional liberty, the circumstances of the applicant involved significantly more aggravating features than those which applied to Louis Basic. 
     
      
    46 Not only was the applicant on bail for the robbery in company offence, but he was subject to two s9 good behaviour bonds. By far the most aggravating feature was the fact that these offences occurred whilst the applicant was participating in the sentencing procedure in relation to the robbery in company offence. He had in fact given evidence in those proceedings on the day before the offences occurred. The commission of the offences in those circumstances, as his Honour appreciated, demonstrated utter contempt for the criminal justice system. 
     
      
    47 As his Honour also appreciated, the commission of the offences in the circumstances described demonstrated that the applicant was without contrition and remorse and was not motivated towards ceasing his criminal conduct. Successful rehabilitation was unlikely. 
     
      
    48 The circumstances in which these offences occurred required a sentence which included a significant element of both general and personal deterrence. The sentence needed to make it clear to other offenders that court processes are not to be abused in this way. Similarly, the sentence had to be sufficiently heavy to deter the applicant from re-offending. This was particularly so since the circumstances of the offences were almost identical to those associated with the robbery in company except for the aggravating features which converted that offence into a robbery.  
     
      
    49 Those distinguishing features make it clear that the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences by the applicant were significantly more serious than those which applied to Louis Basic. Even without knowing all of the facts, the 3 months sentence of imprisonment imposed on Louis Basic does appear to be unduly lenient. There is certainly no basis for reducing the sentence of imprisonment of the applicant to something similar to that of Mr Basic. 
     
      
    50 Having said that, the principle of parity is an important concept in the sentencing process and is not lightly to be disregarded. 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
        , recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to a “justifiable sense of grievance”. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options. 
        
       
       
        
        Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.” ( 
        Postiglione v The Queen 
         (1997) 189 CLR 295). 
        
       
      
    51 In this case the sentence imposed by his Honour in respect of the malicious damage and stealing offences was appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options. It is only when that sentence is compared to that of Louis Basic that the need for intervention by this Court becomes apparent. The disparity between the sentence of 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months and a sentence of 3 months imprisonment is simply too great to be wholly explained by the distinguishing features surrounding the commission of the offences by the applicant on the one hand and Louis Basic on the other. 
     
      
    52 In my opinion, error has been disclosed in the sentences imposed by his Honour in relation to the malicious damage and stealing offences of 11 October 2003 in that sufficient regard was not had to the principle of parity. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    53 I would reduce the sentence of imprisonment in respect of the malicious damage and stealing offences to 16 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. I would not interfere with the sentence of imprisonment imposed in relation to the robbery in company offence except as required by the reduction in the sentence in respect of the other offences. 
     
      
    54 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed in relation to the malicious damage to property and stealing offences but dismissed in respect of the robbery in company offence. 
       
       
      (3) The sentences in respect of the offences of malicious damage to property and stealing are quashed. In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to a period of imprisonment for 1 year and 4 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and a parole period of 4 months. The non-parole period will commence on 11 October 2003 and will expire on 10 October 2004. The parole period will commence on 11 October 2004 and will expire on 10 February 2005. 
       
       
      (4) The sentence for the offence of robbery in company of imprisonment for 3 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months and a parole period of 1 year and 6 months is confirmed. The non-parole period will commence on 11 July 2004 and will expire on 10 October 2006 on which date the applicant is to be eligible to be released on parole. The parole period will commence on 11 October 2006 and will expire on 10 April 2008. 
       
      
    55 SMART AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben J and generally with his reasons. 
     
      
    56 It appears from the materials before this Court that at the time the Local Court dealt with Basic for the offences of malicious damage to property and stealing of 11 October 2003 that it also dealt with him for two further stealing offences (both involving the removal of cash boxes from machines in an hotel) and another malicious damage to property offence. On each of these further offences he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 3 months, such sentences to be concurrent with those imposed for the offences of 11 October 2003. This highlights the lack of due proportion between the sentences imposed on the applicant and those imposed on Basic and further supports the order proposed as to Ground 3. 
     
      
    57 As to the robbery offence, in the circumstances of this case the applicant was not entitled to any further discount and a lesser sentence could not correctly be imposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The Applicant, who is to be referred to by a synonym, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, that was imposed on her by Judge Solomon, in the District Court on 6 November 2003, following her plea of guilty to one count of importing into Australia prohibited imports to which s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Commonwealth) applied. The substance in question involved heroin of a pure weight of 316.9 gms, being an amount not less than the trafficable quantity, which was estimated to have a street value of AUD $754,000. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 On 4 February 2003 the Applicant, who was of Vietnamese origin, but who had settled in this country in 1989, flew into Sydney from Hong Kong. She was found to be wearing a pair of shoes in which the heroin was concealed.  
     
      
    3 Initially she informed investigators that she had purchased the shoes in a Saigon market eight days previously, that she had visited Saigon for the sole purpose of visiting her father, that she had paid for the travel herself, and that she had no knowledge of anything being concealed in her shoes.  
     
      
    4 Subsequently she admitted to police that she had been approached by a man in a local club and offered $20,000, together with reimbursement of her travel expenses, to commit the offence. She acknowledged that what she had been doing was illegal, but had thought of it as a way to help her family in Vietnam. 
     
      
    5 She provided assistance to the Australian authorities in the terms recorded in a sealed letter which was placed before his Honour, and which we have also read. His Honour accepted that the information provided was “substantial and beneficial”, and the Crown does not challenge that assessment, nor does it seek to question the finding that the Applicant was a courier, acting at the lowest end of this importation.  
     
      
    6 Objectively his Honour correctly noted that this was a serious offence, as is reflected by the maximum available penalty which is one of imprisonment for 25 years, or a fine of $50,000 or both, and that the community will not tolerate persons who bring large quantities of narcotic goods into this country. The need for significantly deterrent sentences in relation to couriers is well established: see R v Muanchukingkan (1990) 52 A Crim R 354, R v Budiman (1998) 102 A Crim R 411, R v Behar NSWCCA 14 October 1998, and R v Klein [2001] NSWCCA 120.  
     
      
    7 The financial reward of $20,000 expected by the Applicant in the present case was substantial, and it is clear, upon her own admission, that she went into the venture with her eyes open. Regrettably, it appears that it is not uncommon for couriers of a Vietnamese background, who have settled in this country, to be used to bring back trafficable quantities of heroin, concealed on their person, or in articles carried in their baggage, after making a short visit to their place of birth. Those who organise such ventures, and those who are tempted to accept such roles for financial reward, need to be deterred by significant sentences imposed by courts in this country. They also need to be acutely aware of the risk of facing capital punishment in Vietnam, if they happen to be intercepted at an airport, in that country, with narcotics in their possession, on their way back to Australia.  
     
      
    8 His Honour somewhat succinctly adverted to the relevant subjective circumstances of the Applicant as specified in s 16A(2) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), including the facts that: 
     
      
       
      (i) the Applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest practical opportunity (because she had not received legal assistance until two days prior to the trial)  
       
      (ii) she was contrite for her actions; 
       
      (iii) she was aged 42 years and had no relevant criminal record; 
       
      (iv) she had experienced “a sad and difficult life”, having been significantly traumatised by events which had occurred to her family during the war in Vietnam, had escaped from that country at the age of 26, and had found it necessary to prostitute herself in order to pay for her escape with the result that she had been subsequently unable to form any personal relationships; 
       
      (v) she had limited English, no family and few friends in Australia; 
       
      (vi) she suffered from a back condition; 
       
      (vii) serving a prison sentence would be more onerous for her than would normally be the case; 
       
      (viii) she had used her time in custody in an attempt to rehabilitate herself by undertaking courses in English and computer skills; and had additionally undertaken voluntary work; 
       
      (ix) she had provided substantial and beneficial information to the Australian Federal Police. 
       
      
    9 There is no suggestion that his Honour overlooked any of the objective or subjective factors that were relevant for sentencing. However it was pointed out that his Honour had not, in the reasons for judgment, quantified the discount that was to be given for the Applicant’s early plea or for her co-operation with the authorities. 
     
      
    10 Attention was drawn to the following exchange which occurred during the submissions on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Would you say that the level of assistance negates the effect of there not being a 16G to be applied. 
        
       
       
        
        McNAUGHTON: Possibly in the end result. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: In the end result, I think it just about balances itself out. 
        
       
       
        
        McNAUGHTON: Yes although the exercise is obviously different in terms of -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m not going to in my mind go through the exercise with that in mind however if I regard the 16G adding about 30 percent to the other sentences and then saying that the level of assistance gives her about a 30 percent discount and the other sentences are appropriate in terms of assistance to me.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    11 It is now submitted that his Honour erred in failing properly to discount the Applicant’s assistance to the authorities, and in his approach to the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
     
      
    12 Transparency in sentencing is necessary in so far as it is expected that Judges will disclose, in their reasons, the process by which a sentence is reached: R v Smith and Jones [2001] NSWCCA 279 at para 5. Exchanges between the Bench and Counsel in the course of the proceedings do not form part of the reasons, and it would not be safe to assume that some observation passed by a Judge, during submissions, necessarily represents a considered or final view as to the basis upon which a particular case is decided: R v Kain [2004] NSWCCA 143 at para 56. 
     
      
    13 When the matter came before his Honour he did not have the benefit of the several decisions which have since been delivered by this Court concerning the way in which the repeal of s 16G should be taken into account, namely R v Studenikin [2004] NSWCCA 164, R v Kevenaar [2004] NSWCCA 210, R v Dujeu [2004] NSWCCA 237, R v Quoc Phang Dang [2004] NSWCCA 269, R v Van Ich Dang [2004] NSWCCA 269 and most recently R v Mas Rivadavia  [2004] NSWCCA 284 and R v Bezan [2004] NSWCCA 342.  
     
      
    14 The effect of the decisions in Studenikin, Dujeu  and Mas Rivadavia is that while the repeal of s 16G is likely to result in an increase in the current and future sentencing pattern over that which is to be discerned by reference to the pre repeal cases, which had been the subject of a s 16G discount, the proper approach is to set a sentence that meets the requirements of s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914, and the relevant objectives of sentencing, without giving a s 16G discount. 
     
      
    15 Moreover, they establish that it would be inappropriate to approach the sentencing exercise upon a broad arithmetic approach that would require the sentencing range referred to, for example, in Regina v Wong and Leung [1999] 48 NSWLR 340 to be adjusted by some bare arithmetic formula, let alone one that would call for its increase by the factor of 50%, in order to restore an equivalence with the pre-repeal range.  
     
      
    16 I am not persuaded that Kevenaar or either of the Dang decisions should be understood as suggesting that there should be an automatic adjustment in the order of 50%, since to do so would be to resort to the mathematical approach which was accepted, in each decision, to be inappropriate. In this regard it needs to be born in mind that the guideline judgment reflected a range, and acknowledged that, in appropriate cases, there could be a departure above or below it.  
     
      
    17 Judges were not unaware, during the period when s 16G was in force, that it was a somewhat beneficial provision, in that it gave an allowance for remissions which were as yet unearned, compared with the position of State offenders, who needed to earn remissions through good conduct, in those jurisdictions where a remission system existed. That was a matter properly taken into account by Judges and it does not follow that the starting points selected in the pre-repeal Federal cases would necessarily have been the same had the section not been in force. So much was recognised by Smart AJ in Dujeu at para 42.  
     
      
    18 What the line of authority mentioned does establish, in my view, is that care needs to be taken when reference is made to individual pre-repeal decisions, or to the pre-repeal range, or to the guideline judgment. That arises from the circumstance that those earlier sentences, and the guidelines which were proposed in Wong and Leung, were predicated respectively upon the basis that there had been, or would be, a discount of the kind referred to in R v El Karhani (1990) 51 A Crim R 123, as being necessary for sentences passed in those States which lacked a remissions system.  
     
      
    19 That discount, as the decision in El-Karhani and subsequent decisions made clear, was never regarded as involving a fixed or arbitrary ratio. Rather, it was considered to be an appropriate reference or starting point, it still being necessary to pass a sentence that properly took into account the prescribed maximum penalty, the gravity of the offence, and the objective and subjective considerations relevant to the particular offender. It cannot therefore be assumed that there has always been a discount given of this magnitude, and to make any assumption to that effect by reference to the statistics, or the prior sentencing pattern, is to invite error.  
     
      
    20 What is now required by s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 is that a sentence be imposed that “is of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the case”, including those that are identified in s 16A(2) and (3). The approach required by this section does not materially differ from that held to be appropriate in R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112, in the context of the introduction into New South Wales of the former Sentencing Act 1989.  
     
      
    21 The observations of his Honour during the submissions did involve something of an arithmetic error if read literally, since the elimination of the s 16G discount would result in a 50% addition to any sentence that had been previously discounted by about one-third for the absence of remissions (not the 30% addition which his Honour mentioned). That is of little moment, and it may be that his Honour expressed himself infelicitously in this exchange.  
     
      
    22 Whatever be the situation in that regard, the present matter is complicated by the fact that his Honour did not articulate, in the reasons, the discount which had been given for the plea or for the assistance. Although, subject to compliance with s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), it is not mandatory for a sentencing judge to specify the precise extent of the discount given for such factors, it does remain desirable for Judges to quantify their effects or to make clear, at least in general terms, the extent to which allowance has been made: see R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at para 60 and R v PPB [1999] NSWCCA 360 at para 29 per Kirby J.  
     
      
    23 The recent observations of Howie J in R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 are apposite in this respect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “16 While there is no obligation on a sentencer to nominate the utilitarian value for the plea, I cannot personally understand why certain judges seek to avoid doing so in simple cases, such as the present. But if judges are not prepared to make the discount clear by quantifying it or indicating the starting point of the sentence before the application of the discount, then with respect, they should carefully and correctly enunciate the factors taken into account and the principles being applied in determining the discount which they are applying. As Dunford J noted in  
        R v Mako 
         [2004] NSWCCA 90 at [21]: 
         
          
           
          In all cases the important consideration is to expose the transparency of the process so that it can be seen that an appropriate discount has been allowed. 
           
          
         
        17 Time and again this Court is left to try to fathom what discount was given, either for pure utilitarian value or in combination with contrition, in cases where the judge has not referred to the fact that a discount was given or the value of it, when a simple statement of the percentage value of the discount or the starting point of the undiscounted sentence would have revealed whether the sentencing discretion miscarried on that account.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    24 In the case of a Federal offender, it is the willingness of that offender to facilitate the course of justice, the acceptance of responsibility and the expression of contrition, that are each conveyed by a plea, which gives rise to an entitlement to a discount for that factor: Cameron v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 382. 
     
      
    25 The availability of a discount for assistance, depending on its worth, in order to foster the interests of law enforcement and to recognise the contrition involved as well as the potential risks to the offender, is well recognised: R v Salameh (1991) 55 A Crim R 384, R v Gallagher  (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, R v Cartright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and  R v Dinic NSWCCA 3 September 1997. It is important, if the purpose for allowing a discount is to be achieved, that the offender standing for sentence be clearly appraised of the fact that a benefit was conferred. That will not be conveyed by a bare statement of the kind that was made in this case that the assistance was judged to have been “substantial and beneficial”.  
     
      
    26 The level of the discount has customarily been accepted as falling within the range of 20 to 50% R v Chu NSWCCA 16 October 1998, R v Pang [1999] 105 A Crim R 474 and R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at para 71. An allowance at the upper end has been reserved for cases where there has been particularly significant assistance, usually involving the offender accepting an obligation to give evidence against other offenders.  
     
      
    27 Where the factors of a plea and assistance are each available, it does not follow that any resulting discount is to be compounded or accumulated: R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 and R v Hameed [2001] NSWCCA 287. Otherwise there is a risk of the sentence becoming one which is not of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the case. In such cases a combined discount will normally be appropriate: Thompson and Houlton at para 129; El-Hani at paras 65 to 70, and R v Zaluaga-Gomez [2002] NSWCCA 358.  
     
      
    28 The absence of any sufficient reference to the discount that was allowed, and the observations of his Honour concerning s 16G, make it appropriate, in my view, for the Court to review for itself whether some sentence other than that imposed should have been passed, in the light of the plea and the assistance, and in the light of what should now be regarded as an appropriate range of sentences for a courier, involved in the importation of heroin in a comparable quantity. In that regard reference to the decision in Wong and Leung continues to be of some assistance, so long as it is recalled that the guideline range of six to nine years there proposed for a mid level trafficable quantity of heroin assumed a s 16G discount. 
     
      
    29 That review has been assisted by an examination of the sealed letter in which the details of the Applicant’s assistance are to be found. I have also made reference to several comparative cases such as R v Chu NSWCCA 16 October 1998, R v Auv [2002] NSWCCA 375, R v Lee and Ng NSWCCA 20 December 1996, R v Karacic (2001) 121 A Crim R 7, R v Elchami NSWCCA 15 December 1995, R v K [2000] NSWCCA 200, R v Huang (2000) 113 A Crim R 386 and R v Olbrich (2000) 117 A Crim R 326, all of which were decided when s 16G was in force; and to post repeal decisions such as R v Dang [2004] NSWCCA 265, and R v Dang [2004] NSWCCA 269. In that regard, I accept that these cases represent only a sample of the cases that make up the range and that there are inevitably differences in their objective and subjective circumstances: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 and  R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43. 
     
      
    30 However, so far as they provide some general guidance as to the range, subject to the discount that was given where it was applicable, they are capable of being taken into account in an attempt to secure some general consistency in sentencing: R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177. 
     
      
    31 Having read the Letter of Assistance and having examined the decisions mentioned, I am not persuaded, allowing for a combined discount in the order of 40 to 50% for the plea and assistance, which I consider to have been appropriate in the present case, that the sentence was outside a permissible sentencing range. In this regard the sentence does not appear to be excessive having regard to the range and the sentencing pattern which existed before the repeal of s 16G. Moreover, as I have already noted, despite the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, this was not the case of an unwitting courier duped into a narcotics run. Rather it involved a cool headed decision to become involved in an illegal and risky venture for a considerable sum of money.  
     
      
    32 I am also not persuaded that a lesser non-parole period should have been fixed. The period of 4 years 6 months represented 64% of the term, and as such it was within the conventional range of 60 to 66.6% referred to in R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44. 
     
      
    33 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    34 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Wood CJ at CL and, subject to the following remarks, with his Honour’s reasons. My principal point of difference lies in his Honour’s remarks concerning the effect of the repeal of Section 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth). 
     
      
    35 I of course accept, it having been laid down by Parliament in Section 16A of that Act that a court, sentencing an offender in this area “must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”. That is the law now. It was the law when Section 16G was in operation albeit the severity appropriate then had to reflect the requirements of that section which was regarded as mandating a significant discount. 
     
      
    36 Furthermore I accept that sentencing is not a simple mathematical exercise. However, in part sentencing deals in figures. Parliament has used them in setting maximum terms of imprisonment and sentences are expressed by reference to them. Factors taken into account in sentencing are not uncommonly expressed in mathematical terms. Thus in R v Thomson and Houlton 2000 49 NSWLR 383 the guideline laid down for the discount to be applied for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty was expressed in percentages. A similar approach, using percentages or fractions, has commonly been adopted in discussions concerning the allowance or discount to be afforded to offenders for assistance to the authorities - see for example El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at [71 – 74]; R v Chu (unreported, CCA, 16 October 1998); R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 255-6. When s16G was in operation, the allowance or reduction in sentence which, in the circumstances of sentencing in New South Wales, was required by the section was commonly expressed in terms of one third or a percentage (not necessarily 33 1/3%). 
     
      
    37 Against this background there can be no sensible criticism of the use of figures or mathematics in expressing the consequences of the repeal of s16G. Furthermore it follows as the night the day that, all other things remaining the same, if one omits from a particular starting point a discount of approximately one-third then, the result will be approximately 50% higher than if the discount had been applied. The fact that such a result is, or can be described as, “mathematical” does not invalidate it.  
     
      
    38 In R v Dang [2004] NSWCCA 269, where the sentencing judge had increased a figure of 8 years to 12 years to reflect the repeal of s16G, Hidden J, with whom the Chief Justice and Buddin J agreed, saw nothing wrong with this approach, providing that mathematics were kept in their proper place. 
     
      
    39 As Howie J, with whom Grove J and Newman AJ agreed, in R v Studenikin [2004] NSWCCA 164 at [43] pointed out, 
     
      
       
        
        “To give effect to the sections (16G and 19AG), the courts in this State proceeded to sentence a Federal offender by determining the appropriate head sentence and non-parole period by the application of normal sentencing principles and the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act (Cth) and then, before pronouncing the sentence reduced it by a period of about a third.” 
        
       
      
    40 At [62 - 63], his Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “62 In any event, it is wrong, in my view, to approach this matter on the basis that it involves a question of whether the courts in this State should increase sentences as a result of the repeal of s 16G. The issue is rather whether the courts in this State have the power to continue to apply the discount authorised by s 16G after the repeal of that provision. If this issue is stated in this way, the answer is obvious. In the absence of a statutory warrant to do so, a court has no power to reduce a sentence that has been determined by a proper application of the sentencing principles laid down by the statute or the common law to the facts and circumstances of the particular case. It seems to me, with respect, to be a matter of common sense and simple logic, that, if the courts of this State have been reducing the sentences imposed upon Federal offenders by reason only of the operation of a specific statutory provision, the courts can no longer reduce sentences in that way once the statutory authority to do so has been withdrawn. 
         
         
        63 As I have already indicated, the normal principled approach taken to sentencing Federal offenders when s 16G was in operation was to apply the relevant discount after the court had determined the appropriate sentence that should be imposed for the offence by the application of the relevant sentencing principles. If the authority to discount the otherwise appropriate sentence is withdrawn, the court has no option but to impose the sentence which it has determined is the appropriate one.” 
         
        
       
      
    41 Against these, if I may say so, accurate statements of how sentencing generally proceeded while s16G was in operation and of the effect of its repeal, it is a matter of elementary logic that, as I said with the concurrence of Simpson and Howie JJ in R v Kevenaar [2004] NSWCCA 210, at [46] and [48]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It follows that the pattern of sentences imposed after the repeal of s16G can be expected to accord with the pattern in earlier cases of the periods determined by the application of normal sentencing principles and the (other) relevant provisions of the Crimes Act prior to the application of the s16G discount rather than in the pattern of the length of the sentences ultimately imposed in the earlier cases. Those pre-discount periods are commonly to be found expressly stated in those cases. 
        
       
       
        
        … The effect of the repeal of the section is that the length of sentences of imprisonment (and non-parole periods) for those offences to which s16G previously applied should, as a necessary and logical consequence of the way the courts implemented s16G, increase by approximately 50%.  
         
        
       
      
    42 My choice of “approximately 50%” depended on the discount applied in consequence of s16G having been, or been approximately, one-third. One-third was the figure referred to by Howie J in R v Studenikin and, as I said in R v Kevenaar, the reduction almost invariably applied.  
     
      
    43 I should acknowledge that in R v Bezan [2004] NSWCCA 342, Wood CJ at CL, with the concurrence of Buddin and Shaw JJ, said, at [19]:- 
     
      
       
        
         “(The decisions in Studenikin [2004] NSWCCA 164, Dujeu [2004] NSWCCA 237 and Mas Rivadavia [2004] NSWCCA 284) establish that it would be inappropriate to approach the sentencing exercise upon a broad arithmetic approach that would require the pre-repeal sentencing range … to be adjusted by some bare arithmetic formula, let alone one that would call for its increase by the factor of 50%, in order to restore an equivalence with the pre-repeal range.”  
        
       
      
    44 However, subject to the recognition that the 50% is an approximate figure, exactly the same result follows whether one looks only at the pre-discount periods expressly identified in many of the pre-repeal case as determined by the application of normal sentencing principles, or looks at the sentences ultimately imposed and increases them by approximately 50%. Unless and until one is prepared to say that the conclusions expressed in those pre-repeal cases as to the appropriate sentences determined by the application of normal sentencing principles are wrong, it is entirely academic in any consideration of pre-repeal cases whether one uses those conclusions or the after-discount sentences imposed and increases the latter “mathematically”. 
     
      
    45 In making these remarks, I do not intend to suggest that the starting point in the determination of a sentence in any particular case is either the sentence imposed in another, or indeed the pattern of sentences imposed in a group of earlier cases – c.f. Howie J in R v Studenikin at [51]. I seek merely to state what seems to me the inevitable consequence of the repeal of a section which, in the way it was implemented, authorised a discount from, to re-quote Howie J, “the appropriate head sentence and non-parole period (determined) by the application of normal sentencing principles and the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act (Cth)”. 
     
      
    46 In R v Kevenaar, at [49], I observed: - 
     
      
       
        
        “That proposition (expressed in paragraph 48 and quoted above) depends on an assumption that the pattern of sentencing operating prior to the repeal of s16G was not excessive. After a thorough investigation of the cases in this area on a number of occasions, including in  
        R v Spiteri 
        ,  
        R v Schofield 
         and  
        R v Bourel 
         (unreported, CCA, 11 December 1998) I am satisfied that it was not. There certainly has been no appellate court indication that it was. 
        
       
      
    47 In R v Dujeu [2004] NSWCCA 237, at [42] Smart AJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… When s16G and s19AG were in force, judges in selecting starting points for calculating sentences were not unaware of the large reduction so often wrought by the application of s16G. Its effect tended to have a subtle and perhaps unconscious influence. Inadequate sentences were avoided.” 
        
       
      
    48 In this case at [17], the Chief Judge has said that the beneficial effect (to offenders):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… was a matter properly taken into account by Judges and it does not follow that the starting points selected in the pre-repeal Federal cases would necessarily have been the same had the section not been in force.” 
        
       
      
    49 If by these statements it is intended to suggest that, within the narrow range of sentences a judge often regards as all possibly appropriate immediately prior to making a final decision in a particular case, knowledge of the discount required by s16G may have influenced a decision towards the top of that range, then I have no difficulty with the first 2 of the sentences just quoted from R v Dujeu and with what the Chief Judge has said. However, for that influence to have been more than very marginal would mean that effect was not being given to the requirements of s16G and the authorities which quantified the entitlement that section gave to an offender. Thus, by way of example, an offender whose sentence determined in accordance with normal sentencing principle would be 9 years but who was entitled to a s16G discount of one third, would not receive it if, because the judge was “not unaware of the large reduction … wrought by the application of s16G” the starting point adopted was 10 years. 
     
      
    50 I do not suggest that matters would generally be as precise as in the example just given but it illustrates the limited scope there is to explain, or justify departure from, previous starting points by reference to the existence of s16G. I do not accept that, during the period when Section 16G was in force and judges were obliged to make the allowance the section dictated, they adopted as a starting point for the determination of the sentences figures calculated – a term, I make clear, I use in contradistinction to “designed” - to deprive offenders of the benefits Parliament had dictated and cases such as El Karhani (1990) 51 A Crim R 123 and others have generally quantified as of the order of one-third.  
     
      
    51 I am also unwilling to accept that a decade of statements by dozens, if not hundreds, of judges as to what, prior to the application of s16G in the particular case were appropriate sentences, were in fact wrong. I have seen no evidence to that effect. The studies of case in this area to which I referred in R v Kevenaar at [49] did not so suggest. Furthermore, the examination of prior Federal cases conducted by the Chief Justice in R v Wong and Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 at [33 – 86] and his Honour’s endorsement of the conclusion that the range of sentences since R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 has tended to be lower than indicated in that case runs contrary to any suggestion that there had been any upward adjustment to, consciously or unconsciously, counter the effect of s16G. 
     
      
    52 Thus it is that I adhere to the view expressed in R v Kevenaar that, as a necessary and logical consequence of the way the courts implemented s16G, its repeal should lead to an increase in sentences to which it would have applied of approximately 50%, and regard statements, such as that in R v Bezan at [18] to the effect that “the repeal of s16G is likely to result in an increase in the current and future sentencing pattern over that which is to be discerned by reference to the pre-repeal cases, which had been the subject of a s16G discount” as very substantially understating what should be the effect of the repeal.  
     
      
    53 I may perhaps add that I have sought to have a thorough search conducted to find any authorities in other states bearing on the effect of the repeal of s16G. No such cases have been found. 
     
      
    54 BELL J:  I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

      INTRODUCTION 
       
      This is an appeal against conviction and, subject to leave, sentence brought by William El Azzi.  
       
      
    2 On 8 October 2002 the appellant was indicted before Armitage DCJ at the Sydney District Court on the following charges:  
     
      
       
      Count 1 
      : That he between 1 December 1995 and 31 January 1996 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity.  
      (s.24(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty: life imprisonment or 5,000 penalty unit fine or both) 
        
       
       
      Count 2 
      : Further that he between 1 January 1996 and 30 April 1996 at Dooralong and elsewhere, in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with Damien Drew, Richard Simpson, Kim Knight, Georgina Phillips and others to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity.  
      (s.26 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty: life imprisonment or 5,000 penalty unit fine or both) 
        
       
       
      Count 3 
      : Further that he between 1 April 1996 and 30 June 1996 at Sylvania Waters and elsewhere, in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with Richard Simpson, Robert Proctor, Rodney Hearne, Trent Brown and others to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity.  
      (s.26 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty: life imprisonment or 5,000 penalty unit fine or both)  
       
      
    3 The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before His Honour and a jury of twelve. The trial was a lengthy one, exceeding the original estimate of eight weeks. The proceedings commenced 8 October 2002 and concluded just before Christmas, on 20 December 2002 with the jury’s conviction on counts 2 and 3 and acquittal on count 1.  
     
      
    4 At the trial Mr B Purves appeared as Crown Prosecutor. Mr C Waterstreet appeared for the appellant.  
     
      
    5 On 19 May 2003 the appellant was sentenced, on each of counts 2 and 3, to imprisonment for a term of seven years to commence from 20 December 2002 and to expire on 19 December 2009 with a non-parole period of five years and three months to expire on 19 March 2008.  
     
      
    6 It is convenient to set out below the dramatis personae, as described uncontroversially by Mr Waterstreet for purposes of this appeal. As to the salient facts I gratefully adopt these from the judgment of Simpson J.

      The November – December 2000 trial time-line 
      
    7 Before referring specifically to the appeal grounds, it should be borne in mind that Mr King in an affidavit of 27 September 2004 at paras 12 to 14 and by reference to Appendix A with its transcript references described what was said to be “the pressure to complete”, before an apparent deadline of 20 December 2002. That had regard to the situation of individual members of the jury who had passed jury notes about their need to attend employment, in the context of Christmas approaching. At para 14, the following is said by Mr King by way of what his trial counsel was supposed to have said to him:  
     
      
       
        
        “14. I was present in Court during the Judge’s summing up to the jury on 17-20 December 2002. I recall a conversation with trial counsel after the conclusion of court proceedings on 19 December 2002 where he said to me words to the effect:  
         
          
           
          ‘ 
          The jury is going out tomorrow and the Judge still hasn’t finished his summing up. I don’t think he has put the evidence on each count to the jury properly and I can’t see how he has put our case at all but at this late hour there is no chance he will give us a redirection, that would take at least another day and its pretty clear the jury are going to be gone tomorrow afternoon 
          ’.  
          
         
        
       
      
    8 To this, the Crown responds by referring to the extracted portion of the transcript of 17 December 2002 where at T, 2663.32 the trial judge said the following: ”Look Mr Waterstreet, there are no restrictions. You can go on for days if you want to. And I mean that seriously”.  
     
      
    9 The trial judge is then quoted as referring to the possibility of discharging the jury before they would have retired to consider their verdicts. That in fact did not happen since the trial was concluded on 20 December 2002 with the jury returning a verdict that day.  
     
      
    10 The relevance of this was said to go to the appeal ground 9 concerning the request by the jury for a transcript of the trial judge’s summing up. This the trial judge declined on the basis that he did not have power to provide it. The appeal ground relates to the trial judge failing to recognise that he was not bound to decline such a request but had a discretion to grant it and contends that he should have done so in the circumstances. I agree with Sperling J’s observations and conclusion concerning that ground (as I do with the rest of his judgment).  
     
      
       
      THE APPEAL GROUNDS  
      
    11 These grounds are described in the terms that they appear after a number of changes were made following the first day of the Appeal hearing by the appellant, that is to say from the appellant’s revised submissions of 20 June 2004.  
     
      
       
      Separation Of Counts  
       
      Ground 1(A) 
      : His Honour erred in not ordering a separate trial of the first count on the indictment (see Judgment dated 26 September 2002).  
       
       
      Ground 1(B) 
      : His Honour erred in ordering that the evidence in each count was admissible in respect of the other two counts pursuant to s98  
      Evidence Act 
       as coincidence evidence (see Judgment dated 26 September 2002).  
       
       
      Ground 1(C) 
      : Further, His Honour did not give sufficient instructions to the jury in the summing up when directing them to consider the three charges separately, and did not properly identify or segregate the admissible evidence in respect of each count.  
       
       
      The evidence of the late Mr Launt  
       
      Ground 2(A) 
      : His Honour erred in failing to exclude the evidence of the late Arthur Launt pursuant to ss65, 135 or 137  
      Evidence Act 
      .  
       
       
      Ground 2(B) 
      : Alternatively, His Honour erred in failing to exclude parts of the evidence of the late Arthur Launt (see SU p142.9 18/12/02 V10 and following on especially at SU p152.5, further at 19/12/02 p1-17 and Reasons for Judgment 19/12/02 V11).  
       
       
      Ground 2(C) 
      : His Honour instructed the jury that the evidence of the late Arthur Launt had ‘some significance’ but failed to properly instruct them concerning his unreliability pursuant to s165  
      Evidence Act 
      : SU 18/12/02, V10, p43.  
       
       
      Sufficiency of evidence on Counts 2 and 3  
       
      His Honour erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence to support counts 2 and 3.  
       
       
      Ground 3(A) 
      : Counts 2 and 3 were each agreements to use ingredients that were incapable of producing methylamphetamine. The object of the conspiracy was in each case impossible.  
       
       
      Ground 3(B) 
      : His Honour failed to properly direct in respect of the pleaded substance.

      , not pressed.  
       
       
      Cross-examination of accused  
       
      Ground 5 
      : His Honour erred in allowing the accused to be cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor as to (see Judgment 6/12/02):  
      (a) A police departmental charge of disobedience relating to a failure to make an occurrence pad entry.  
      (b) A police departmental charge of disobedience or a direction authorising a trip to Bali.  
      (c) Alleged threats made by the accused to Richard Simpson and Katie Ingall.  
      (d) A criminal conviction under s186 Crimes Act. Lie as evidence of guilt Ground 6 not pressed. Unreliability of witnesses Ground 7: The learned judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with questions of the potential unreliability of witnesses, particularly the witness Richard Simpson: Failure to put the defence case and directions on the credibility of Richard Simpson Ground 8 not pressed otherwise than under Ground 7. Failure to provide the jury with transcript Ground 9: His Honour erred in refusing the jury’s request for the transcripts of the closing addresses and summing up (SU 19/12/02 p70, V11). Unreasonable Verdicts Ground 10: The verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 2 and 3 are unreasonable. Total unreliability of Richard Simpson In relation to sentence: Ground 11: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in the circumstances. Ground 12: The sentence imposed on the applicant was so far greater than a number of his co-offenders such that he has a justifiable sense of grievance. CONSIDERATION OF APPEAL GROUNDS 
      
    12 I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Simpson J and Sperling J (as circulated in draft). I agree with their reasons and conclusions concerning each of the appeal grounds dealt with in their respective judgments and do not wish to add anything to their observations on the grounds with which they deal. It remains for me to deal with grounds 3(A) and 3(B) and the appeal against sentence. I note their respective concurrence both with each other and with what I have said on grounds 3(A) and 3(B) and on sentence. I deal at the conclusion of this judgment with the orders of the Court that follow in consequence.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 3(A) and 3(B): 
       
      Ground 3(A): Counts 2 and 3 were each agreements to use ingredients that were incapable of producing methylamphetamines. The object of the conspiracy was in each case impossible.  
       
       
      GROUND 3(B): His Honour failed to properly direct in respect of the pleaded substance. 
       
      
    13 Ground 3(A) in effect complains that Armitage DCJ erred in finding that there was a case to answer in relation to counts 2 and 3, on the basis that the object of the conspiracy in each case was impossible. Ground 3(B) is essentially that the trial judge erred in failing to properly instruct the jury that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the product of the conspiracy was methylamphetamine and not amphetamine.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3(A)  
      
    14 Counts 2 and 3 as earlier observed, concern conspiracy to drug manufacture, prohibited under s26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “A person who conspires with another person or other persons to commit an offence under this Division is guilty of an offence and liable to the same punishment, pecuniary penalties and forfeiture as a person would be if the person had committed the first mentioned offence.”  
        
       
      
    15 This issue arose earlier upon an application for leave to appeal under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. This was against an interlocutory judgment of Hock DCJ refusing to grant a permanent stay of two counts in an indictment upon which the present appellant and then applicant had been arraigned in the District Court. The counts were those the subject of the present appeal. That application gave rise to the judgment in William El Azzi (2001) 125 A Crim R 113 in which the stay sought was refused. Howie J gave the leading judgment concurred in by Mason P and Levine J.  
     
      
    16 The substantial issue as articulated by Howie J is essentially the same issue as underlies the present ground. At 117 [14] Howie J expressed that issue in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “The substantial issue raised before Judge Hock and before this Court is whether it is open to the Crown to charge the applicant with a conspiracy in relation to each of the two incomplete attempts to manufacture methylamphetamine in light of the uncontested evidence that the chemicals being used for the purpose in both cases could not produce that or any other drug.”  
        
       
      
    17 At 118 [19] Howie J elaborated in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the substantial issue in this application is: can the Crown charge the applicant with conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug in circumstances where the chemicals allegedly being used by the applicant in carrying out that conspiracy were, unbeknown to him, of a nature that they could not be used to manufacture a prohibited drug? The applicant relies upon the authority of  
        DPP v Nock 
         [1978] AC 979 and more recently  
        R v Barbouttis 
         (1995) 37 NSWLR 256 to assert that the answer to that question is in the negative.”  
        
       
      
    18 The appellant now contends that in El Azzi, this Court did accept the description of the agreement the object of the conspiracy as stated by the then trial judge, Judge Hock, as: “An agreement in general terms to manufacture methylamphetamine, that when it was made it was obviously not impossible to achieve an objective. In other words, the conspiracy alleged here was not a conspiracy to do something that was impossible.”  
     
      
    19 However, that is not an accurate description of the reasoning of Howie J in El Azzi. After reviewing the status of DPP(UK) v Nock [1978] AC 979 in light of the reasoning of Gleeson CJ and Dunford J in Barbouttis (1995) 37 NSWLR 256 he concluded that “it is clear that the majority of that Court (Gleeson CJ and Dunford J) were of the opinion that DPP(UK) v Nock was no longer persuasive authority...” concluding that “the arguments set forth by the Chief Justice in refusing to apply DPP(UK) v Nock are, in my view, compelling and should be followed by this Court” (at [122] 33). I shall return shortly to the reasoning of Gleeson CJ to which Howie J refers.  
     
      
    20 The appellant in the present proceedings contends that “by the time of trial and in a judgment given at the close of the Crown case the Crown alleged, and the trial judge accepted, that both conspiracies (counts 2 and 3) were specific agreements to use specific ingredients, but most particularly a cache of 100 kilos of ‘phenylacetic acid’ delivered by Launt to Parker and Haeusler”.  
     
      
    21 Thus the appellant would characterise the conspiracies in counts 2 and 3 in those terms contending:  
     
      
       
        
        “28. The first conspiracy (count 2) was the acceptance by the appellant and Simpson of Parker and Haeusler’s offer to use some of the 100 kilos, which was already in the possession of Haeusler and Parker, to commence a process of the manufacture of methylamphetamine. The second conspiracy (count 3) occurred when the appellant and the others agreed to use the remaining 50 kilos of identified items in the possession of Haeusler as the ingredients for a further process of manufacture.” Judgment 5/12/02 p7, V9  
        
       
      
    22 There are a number of difficulties in the way of that submission which I shall refer to first in summary form and then return by way of elaboration. The first is whether the reasoning of Gleeson CJ and Dunford J in Barbouttis, as adopted in El Azzi in the reasons of Howie J renders irrelevant the distinction made by the then trial judge Hock DCJ. That distinction was between an agreement “in general terms to manufacture methylamphetamine” rather than an agreement “to produce methylamphetamine by specific means”. Howie J concluded: “[H]owever I do not believe that the distinction sought to be made by the applicant is a valid one in light of Barbouttis” (at 122 [33]).  
     
      
    23 Howie J then at [35] stated: “Even if I were prepared to follow DPP(UK) v Nock, I would still refuse the application”. This was because “the issue before Her Honour was how each of the conspiracies alleged should be characterised” and so that “the answer to this question will largely depend upon the evidence heard at the trial”. Here, of course, the evidence led at the trial is known. The thrust of the appellant’s submission is that that evidence would lead to the agreement being characterised as “to produce methylamphetamine by specific means”.  
     
      
    24 The question then is whether the reasoning of Gleeson CJ, agreed in by Dunford J in Barbouttis, properly understood, would render that distinction irrelevant. If it be not irrelevant, the question of characterisation of a conspiracy then arises, by reference to the evidence at trial. It will be appreciated that Gleeson CJ, while dissenting in the result in Barbouttis, concluded, with the concurrence of Dunford J, but contrary to the reasoning of Smart J that Nock should not be followed in New South Wales. This is insofar as Nock excluded from the crime of conspiracy situations where an agreement if carried out could not have achieved its object, though that object was to commit a criminal offence.  
     
      
    25 It is convenient to start with the facts in Nock. They provide the springboard for the reasoning of Gleeson CJ in Barbouttis, though applied to a distinct alleged crime. The crime was receiving specific property believed to be stolen, as distinct from in Nock where the conspiracy related to producing cocaine. In Nock, the defendants agreed to produce cocaine by separating it from other substances in the powder which they believe to be a mixture of a certain kind. In fact the powder was a mixture of a different kind, and contained no cocaine. As a result, there were no circumstances in which cocaine could have been produced from it. The House of Lords held that a conviction of conspiracy could not stand. Lord Russell of Killowen said (at 993):  
     
      
       
        
        ""The important point to note is that the agreement that is said to have been an unlawful conspiracy was not an agreement in general terms to produce cocaine, but an agreement in specific terms to produce cocaine from a particular powder which in fact, however treated, would never yield cocaine. In order to see whether there is a criminal conspiracy it is necessary to consider the whole agreement. The specific limits of the agreement cannot be discarded, leaving a general agreement to produce cocaine, for that would be to find an agreement other than that which was made: and that is not a permissible approach to any agreement, conspiracy or other.""  
        
       
      
    26 Gleeson CJ explained in Barbouttis that central to the reasoning of at least Lord Scarman in Nock was the proposition that the then recent decision of the House of Lords in R v Smith (Roger) [1975] AC 476, a case concerning the crime of attempt, applied with equal force to the crime of conspiracy. Subsequent overruling of Smith (supra) in R v Shivpuri [1987] 1 AC 1 removed that underpinning to Nock.  
     
      
    27 In Barbouttis, the Crown case was that the respondents had entered into an agreement to purchase 50 boxes of cigarettes from those that an undercover police officer had in a truck, this being part of a large-scale police operation into persons dealing in stolen cigarettes. Thus the undercover police officer sought out persons who might have been interested in purchasing cheap cigarettes that he then represented as being stolen. The undercover officer made contact with the respondents and, after a number of meetings, they struck a deal as to the price to be paid for the cigarettes. The undercover officer had in his possession a truck with a large number of boxes of cigarettes and the respondents agreed to purchase 50 boxes after they had been inspected by one of the respondents. Contrary to the belief of the respondents, the cigarettes were not stolen but had been lent to the police for the purpose of the operation. Gleeson CJ dissented from the conclusion of the majority that the offence of conspiracy to commit a crime, by receiving specific property believed to be stolen, cannot be established where the property is not in fact stolen. However, there was no dissent on the part of Dunford J, in contrast to Smart J, to the reasoning which led to Gleeson CJ concluding that “subsequent events have discredited the reasoning in Director of Public Prosecutions v Nock” (at 263).  
     
      
    28 There is, however, an important passage in the reasoning of Gleeson CJ that indicates that he did not reject the relevance of the distinction to which earlier reference has been made in the context of conspiracy. That is clear from the following passage (at 265-6):  
     
      
       
        
        “In the context of conspiracy, the matter must depend upon the proper characterisation of the object of the agreement made by the conspirators, or what the Court of Appeal of New Zealand called ""the common design"". In the present case, as particularised by the Crown, was the obtaining of stolen goods part of the common design, or can the agreement, for the purposes of the criminal law, be characterised accurately and adequately as an agreement to acquire fifty particular boxes of cigarettes for a certain price, such agreement being accompanied by a merely incidental belief that the reason the cigarettes were so cheap was that they were stolen?  
         
         
        If the cigarettes had in truth been stolen, then such a characterisation would certainly not have been regarded as either accurate or adequate for the purposes of the criminal law. Far from being incidental, the belief that the cigarettes were stolen would have been of the essence of the agreement. How can that belief cease to be of the essence of the agreement because of an objective fact unknown to the parties to the agreement?  
         
         
        On the facts alleged by the Crown, the common design of the respondents and the other parties to the agreement was to obtain stolen property. The law relating to conspiracy punishes people because of the nature of the agreement they have made. I find it impossible to regard the (alleged) belief on the part of the parties to the agreement that the cigarettes were stolen as a merely incidental matter. For the reasons advanced by Professor Glanville Williams, the motivation theory, which underlies the argument that the belief was incidental, cannot be sustained. If a person intends to receive goods which he knows or believes are stolen, than he intends to receive stolen goods.”  
        
       
      
    29 Gleeson CJ had indeed earlier (at 264) cited that very argument employing that distinction as pressed by the respondents:  
     
      
       
        
        “It was argued on behalf of the respondents that, even if, in the light of later authorities, it must be accepted that the reasoning in  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Nock 
         was flawed, nevertheless that case remains instructive in one important respect. It demonstrates the importance of identifying with precision the nature and scope of the agreement the making of which constitutes the alleged conspiracy. If, in  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Nock 
        , it had been decided that the agreement was to produce cocaine, then the problem in the case would never have arisen. There is nothing impossible about performing an agreement to produce cocaine. If the conspirators are so inept as to set about performing their agreement in a manner that will be incapable of producing cocaine, that is beside the point. It was the characterisation of the agreement as one to produce cocaine from specific chemicals that gave rise to the issue in the case. Similarly, in the present case, there would be no problem of law (as distinct, perhaps, from a problem of proof) if the Crown were alleging that the respondents had agreed between themselves to find and buy some stolen cigarettes. If, for example, the respondents had formed themselves into a buying group to purchase stolen cigarettes and had sought out the person who offered to supply them in the present case, it would not have made a presently relevant difference to their culpability if, unknown to them, he had been an undercover policeman who had no real intention of supplying stolen cigarettes. They would, nevertheless, have made an agreement between themselves to purchase stolen cigarettes. The problem in the present case arises because the agreement alleged by the Crown is limited to an agreement to purchase, from a particular person, particular cigarettes which were mistakenly believed to be stolen.”  
        
       
      
    30 Thus it is clear that not only was Gleeson CJ citing that distinction. It was central to his own reasoning.  
     
      
    31 When, however, one turns to the facts in the present case, contrary to the appellant’s submission, there is nothing in counts 2 and 3, or indeed in the particulars in the Statement of Facts which would lead to the characterisation of the agreement as one to produce methylamphetamine from specific chemicals supplied, as distinct from these being merely the incidental means to that end. Indeed the latter characterisation accords with s26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act earlier quoted. It refers to a person who “conspires with another person … to commit an offence under this division …”. The offence is therefore conspiring by way of an agreement whose common design is, in terms of s24(2) of that Act, the manufacturing or production of an amount of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. The critical distinction between s24(2) and s26 is that the latter fastens upon the agreement that the parties have made. In the words of Gleeson CJ in Barbouttis, the law relating to conspiracy punishes conspirators “because of the nature of the agreement they have made” in the belief that they will manufacture the prohibited drug. It is wholly irrelevant whether that belief is achievable or not in actual manufacture.  
     
      
    32 Indeed one might test that proposition by assuming that instead of the chemicals being incapable of producing the methylamphetamine, some other supervening event frustrated the completion of the common design, such as a police raid. There could be no doubt that the persons who have agreed in advance to the common design of producing methylamphetamine would not escape s26 merely by reason of the intervention of a supervening event that frustrated the achievement of their purpose. To draw a distinction between supervening events, and defective chemicals that preordain the failure of the common design to achieve its end must be artificial in the extreme.  
     
      
    33 Accordingly, the issue becomes whether, accepting the distinction applied, there were specific agreements to use specific ingredients, as distinct from specific agreements simply to produce the methylamphetamine, the means being incidental.  
     
      
    34 The appellants contend that “however by the time of trial and in the judgment given at the close of the Crown case the Crown alleged and the trial judge accepted that both conspiracies (counts 2 and 3) were specific agreements to use specific ingredients, but most particularly a case of 100 kilos of ‘phenylacetic acid’ delivered by Launt to Parker and Haeusler”.  
     
      
    35 To the contrary, the judgment of 5 December 2002, rejecting the application by Mr Waterstreet for a verdict of not guilty by direction in respect of all three counts, characterised the second and third counts in these terms: “… the counts which allege that the accused conspired with certain named persons, and others, to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine” (at p5).  
     
      
    36 What follows is a description of Mr Waterstreet’s submission, namely that the agreement “was to use specific chemicals provided by Haeusler and Parker”. Reference is made to the particulars which are themselves set out in El Azzi at 121 [36] but which do not themselves do more than simply describe particular events alleged to have occurred (such as that the precursor chemicals used by the accused were provided by Launt).  
     
      
    37 The trial judge in his judgment of 5 December 2002 correctly accepted that “it is important to distinguish the terms of the specific conspiracy alleged by the Crown from any historical background and/or preliminary discussions between the conspirators”. He then accepted the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions that the conversation which took place between Simpson, Haeusler and Parker was preliminary negotiation, not an agreement (at 6-7). No error has been shown in that conclusion.  
     
      
    38 When reference is made to the so-called “second cook” following the police raid on Dooralong, while the trial judge appears to accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that “Simpson and the accused agreed with Haeusler to do this other ‘cook’ using ‘phenylacetic acid’, so that ‘this was a conspiracy to manufacture methylamphetamine using the key ingredients”, it is clear that the trial judge saw no merit in the “impossibility” argument raised by Mr Waterstreet in that context. The trial judge was not to be understood as accepting the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions in any other sense. Thus he concluded (at 7) “in my view there were two separate conspiracies, and they have been correctly charged in the present indictment” [emphasis added].  
     
      
    39 Moreover, Mr Simpson gave evidence that the agreement in relation to count 2 was to produce methylamphetamine (T, 640.10-.20) and likewise in relation to count 3 to produce methylamphetamine (T, 658.25-.44). (This evidence is relevant also to ground 3(B) as I later explain.)  
     
      
    40 A careful reading of Mr Simpson’s evidence indicates that he believed he was making methylamphetamine in both the Dooralong and Sylvania Waters’ cooks (see for example T, 1088.32) and the expert evidence of Mr Murtagh the chemist called by the Crown (T, 1203.10-.25). Thus insofar as he used the chemicals provided he did so believing that he was being provided with the necessary chemicals to do so (see T, 645.10-649.28). Thus Mr Simpson believed he had phenylacetic acid, methyl formamide (T, 1017.40) acetic hydrocholoride, sodium acetic solvents (all collected from Crown witness Vocisano’s garage, where he allowed Parker to store drums and bottles and other items (T, 1837.51 ff) and also acetic anhydride (T, 649.21). At T, 656.10 Simpson confirmed that he believed that the “cook” at Dooralong yielded at best 30 kilos of methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    41 This evidence is entirely consistent with the Crown submission that the purpose was to produce methylamphetamine and the chemicals supplied for this purpose were merely incidental to it, and the agreement should be characterised accordingly. I should add that, given this characterisation of the agreement, I do not need to consider whether a differently characterised agreement would fall outside the crime of conspiracy, namely one where it was essential, not incidental, to the parties’ agreement that they use the very chemicals provided. There is much to be said for the view, expressed in R v Sew Hoy [1994] 1 NZLR 257 That even in the latter case, it is irrelevant that it may not be possible to carry out the agreement, as the offence is complete when the agreement is made with its unlawful object. For that is the fundamental difference between conspiracy and attempt; the former focuses on an agreement to commit a crime, itself intrinsically criminal, irrespective of outcome.  
     
      
    42 On this basis ground 3(A) must fail.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3(B) 
      
    43 This ground is essentially that the trial judge erred in failing to properly instruct the jury that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the product of the conspiracy was methylamphetamine and not amphetamine.  
     
      
    44 There is no substance in this contention. It is clear that the trial judge gave correct directions to the jury about the elements of the conspiracy charges; see Summing Up 8.6-11.3 on 18 December 2002. There it was made quite clear that the jury had to be satisfied that the agreement in each case was for the production of methylamphetamine. This was further reinforced by the specific direction on this issue at Summing Up 29.7 10 December 2002. These last directions were given after discussion in the absence of the jury during a break in the Summing Up (T, 18 ff 19 December 2002) when the trial judge read to the defence counsel the directions he proposed to give about the matter. No objection of the kind now being taken was taken at that time.  
     
      
    45 Moreover, the evidence from Mr Simpson referred to above amply substantiates that the jury were entitled to come to the conclusion that the drug proposed to be manufactured was methylamphetamine. That aside, to put this matter in proper perspective, consistent with the expert evidence of Mr Judd (Exhibit 33) and of Mr Murtagh (Exhibit 34) and the dictionary meaning of “amphetamine”, the latter is simply a generic term for a family of synthetic drugs with similar chemical properties whose members fall into a class of drugs known as stimulants. Methylamphetamine is one member of that family. Thus while, for example, the expert Mr Judd said at T, 1145.48 “I saw labelled containers and solvents containing solvents which could be used in the manufacture of amphetamines” it is clear from the context Mr Judd does not expressly exclude the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Thus, it is not correct for the appellants to say that “the expert Judd gave evidence that the labels on the containers were consistent with amphetamine, not methylamphetamine” (see appellant’s written submissions at (34)).  
     
      
    46 Nor is it correct to say, as do the appellants in their written submissions at (35), that Mr Knight’s evidence at T, 1255 was to the effect that the presence of formic acid at Dooralong suggested amphetamine. In fact his evidence at T, 1255.25 confirmed that Simpson believed he had phenylacetic acid. Although Knight does say that Simpson said he was trying to make this into amphetamine, phenylacetic acid is a chemical that is included in the recipe for methylamphetamine (see Mr Murtagh’s recipe in exhibit 36).  
     
      
    47 In the appellant’s written submissions various other contentions are made. In particular is said that Simpson pleaded guilty to manufacturing amphetamine not methylamphetamine at Dooralong and Sylvania Waters and this was being relied on to substantiate a submission that the trial judge’s directions were inadequate in failing to give appropriate emphasis to that fact. To the contrary, the trial judge did remind the jury that Simpson had given evidence in Hearne’s trial that he had been attempting to make amphetamine (Summing Up 29.9-30.3 of 19 December 2002).  
     
      
    48 In any event, as explained above, the distinction between amphetamine and methylamphetamine is of no particular significance when their related properties are properly understood.  
     
      
    49 Finally, the appellant’s contention (at 39) that the expert Murtagh’s evidence depends upon advance evidence is not correct. It is clear that Mr Murtagh relied upon the analysis of analyst Judd at Dooralong; see Judd’s certificate Exhibit 33.  
     
      
    50 There is no substance in appeal ground 3(B).  
     
      
       
      Appeal Against Sentence  
       
      Grounds 11 and 12 
      
    51 The appellant contends that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in the circumstances. Further that the sentence imposed on the applicant was so far greater than a number of his co-offenders such that he has a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    52 For the reasons which follow, while I would grant leave to the appeal against sentence I would disallow that appeal.  
     
      
    53 The appellant was sentenced on 19 May 2003 to a term of imprisonment of seven years, with a non-parole period of five years and three months. The trial judge gave detailed reasons on 19 May 2003 in his Remarks on Sentence for the sentence he imposed.  
     
      
    54 The first contention by the appellant is that “the evidence at trial did not support His Honour’s finding ‘that Simpson and this present offender were in fact partners and that the degree of criminality of each was virtually identical’.” It is then said that evidence in relation to El Azzi from all witnesses including Simpson disclosed:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) El-Azzi had no prior knowledge or experience of the manufacture of prohibited drugs.  
         
         
        (b) El-Azzi had no experience or knowledge in relation to chemical processing of any kind.  
         
         
        (c) El-Azzi did not have access to chemicals necessary for the production of amphetamines.  
         
         
        (d) Without El-Azzi, the manufacturers could have proceeded precisely as they did, in contrast, without Simpson the offences undoubtedly would not have occurred. His Honour’s findings in relation to El-Azzi’s involvement support this contention.  
         
         
        …… 
         
         
        His Honour proceeded on the basis that Simpson was not a principal although the evidence at trial disclosed that he was. Clearly:  
         
         
        (a) Without Simpson, the offences with which this accused was charged could not have occurred.  
         
         
        (b) Simpson was the only participant with the requisite chemical knowledge to manufacture a prohibited drug.  
         
         
        (c) Simpson procured the chemicals from Brown and Heausler [sic].  
         
         
        (d) In his evidence Simpson claimed to have been pressured to manufacture on these occasions, however on Simpson’s own evidence the first arrangements towards the manufacture was the agreement with Heausler [sic] in relation to the chemicals supplied by Launt. In his own evidence of that meeting, Simpson did not disclose any reluctance to manufacture or any pressure by others. In fact Simpson met Heausler [sic] without El-Azzi.  
         
         
        (e) Simpson gave evidence as to his own extensive history in manufacturing prohibited drugs spanning over 15 years and on many occasions with the assistance of other co-accused’s including Proctor, Knight and Phillips, Ingall. Brown and Haeusler but  
        not 
         El Azzi.  
         
         
        (f) His Honour acknowledged that caution must be exercised in relation to Simpson’s evidence. In the circumstances there was no basis for believing that Simpson’s role was anything other than as principal.  
         
         
        (g) His Honour referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment in respect of the sentence of Simpson and his level of criminality and applied this to the sentence of El-Azzi. However the Court of Criminal Appeal noted: ‘it may be that this finding was unduly favourable to the Respondent’. The Court of Criminal Appeal proceeded only on the basis of that finding because it had not been challenged by the Crown.”  
        
       
      
    55 In quoting the above contentions I put to one side for the moment the appellant’s further contention that “the appellant’s involvement was better described as being on a par with that of Knight, McCoy, Phillips, Proctor, Ingall and Hearne rather than Simpson”. I shall return to that contention later. It should be noted that the trial judge found no assistance to be derived from the judgments in those matters; RoS 19 May 2003 at 6.  
     
      
    56 As to comparison with Simpson, the trial judge in his Remarks on Sentence first records the evidence summarised by the Crown Prosecutor in his written submissions on sentence. The Crown Prosecutor sets out what the evidence disclosed as to the specifics of the appellant’s involvement in the “cooks”, first at Dooralong and then at Sylvania Waters. Overall this can fairly be summarised as saying that the appellant “helped organise the premises, the transport of chemicals to the sites, and he was actively involved in supervising and setting up the process, and visiting the sites when the reaction was in progress”; RoS, 5.  
     
      
    57 While it was Simpson not the appellant that had the technical ability to carry out each “cook”, the trial judge understandably had no hesitation “in accepting the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that Simpson and this present offender were in fact partners and that the degree of criminality of each was virtually identical”; RoS, 6.  
     
      
    58 Earlier, the trial judge referred to Simpson’s sentence as dealt with in an appeal on sentence in the case of R v “S” [2000] NSWCCA 13. The trial judge (RoS, 5) quotes Hulme J at [18-19]:  
     
      
       
        
        “18 Had the Respondent been a principal, these factors would have led me to the conclusion that the Respondent's criminality was probably of, or close to that of a ""worst case"" category of manufacturing a commercial quantity, for which imprisonment of 20 years was appropriate.  
         
         
        19 However although very actively involved, he seems not to have been principal [sic]. This and the fact that his offence was committed under pressure, means that the proper penalty would have had to be significantly less than that figure.”  
        
       
      
    59 The trial judge in his Remarks on Sentencing observed that had it not been for this guidance he would have come to the view that Mr Simpson was indeed a principal. He proceeded on the basis that he was not.  
     
      
    60 Thus consistently with Hulme J’s qualified proposition that “he seems not to have been a principal” though “very actively involved” the sentencing judge with his greater familiarity with the detailed circumstances was highly justified in describing the degree of criminality of each as “virtually identical”.  
     
      
    61 There were also significant differences in the circumstances of their pleas and willingness to give assistance as reflected in the discounts Simpson was given resulting in his lower sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeal had nonetheless allowed the sentencing appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, re-sentencing him for a minimum term of three years and an additional term of one year. The one offence with which he was charged was “knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug”. That encompassed activities at both Dooralong and Sylvania Waters. Simpson shared with the appellant the need to spend his time in custody in strict protection, so justifying a sentence lighter than otherwise would be the case (Hulme J at [19]. But unlike the appellant Simpson pleaded guilty, receiving an appropriate discount for that. Moreover, he then was allowed a further discount of 50% by the original sentencing judge, Dodd DCJ, for assistance provided to the authorities. Hulme J accepted that. A further distinguishing factor was that in Simpson’s case but not the appellant, Hulme J recognised that the offence was committed under pressure. All of these factors adequately explain a substantially lower sentence for Simpson as against the appellant.  
     
      
    62 The trial judge was entitled on the evidence to reject the contention that the appellant was no more than an assistant to Simpson. The cases of Messrs Knight, McCoy, Phillips, Proctor, Ingall and Hearn, with their substantially lesser involvement, meant that, as the trial judge found, there could be no assistance from the judgments in those matters; RoS, 6. The Crown in its written submissions fairly summarised that substantially lesser involvement of each of those mentioned. So far as any parity argument is concerned, there could be no sense of grievance either in the case of Simpson, or in the case of those others mentioned, as would justify any reduction in the appellant’s sentence under the parity principle.  
     
      
    63 There was indeed ample reason for a substantial sentence in the case of the appellant. The maximum penalty fixed by the legislation for each of the two offences of which the appellant was found guilty was life imprisonment, or a fine of 5,000 penalty units or both.  
     
      
    64 The “large commercial quantity” the subject of the charge is only one kilogram or more. While it is true that the chemicals were incapable of producing any amphetamine, as the trial judge pointed out the appellant and his accomplices were expecting, or at least hoping, that the “cooks” would produce 30 kilograms of methylamphetamine. That is not altered by the fact that these expectations were unrealistic, given that the most that could have been expected was 12½ kilograms had the chemicals been efficacious; RoS, 7. The fact that the “cooks” were doomed to failure was pressed upon the trial judge at the time of sentence. He properly concluded that “this is not a feature of the case that is of any real significance from the offender’s point of view. Nevertheless I take it into account” (RoS, 8).  
     
      
    65 Insofar as the present challenge is based upon that feature it does not affect the intrinsic criminality of the enterprise insofar as the conspiracy charges were concerned. The trial judge’s approach in imposing a substantial sentence was fully justified.  
     
      
    66 In that regard, the trial judge was clearly aware of the consideration that serving a sentence in protection justifies a discount. That is clear from his Remarks on Sentence concerning Simpson. There is nothing to indicate that the appellant’s sentence failed to take that factor into account, insofar as the appellant’s custody would be onerous as a former police officer. The trial judge expressly regarded this as “a very important consideration”; (RoS, 9). It is likewise clear that the trial judge did take into account the appellant’s subjective features. The trial judge, properly, paid particular regard to the seriousness of the offences, the need for general and specific deterrence, delay in coming to trial, the prospects of rehabilitation of the appellant and the need to ensure adequate punishment (RoS, 11).  
     
      
    67 I would agree with the trial judge that “anything less than the sentences [imposed]… would not be adequate punishment” (RoS, 11).  
     
      
    68 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence and disallow the appeal.  
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
      
    69 I propose orders as follows:  
     
      
      (1) Appeal against conviction disallowed.  
      (2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted.  
      (3) Appeal against sentence disallowed.  
      
    70 SIMPSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Santow JA and Sperling J. For the reasons given by Santow JA I agree that grounds 3(A) and 3(B) should be rejected. I agree also that grounds 11 and 12 (appeal against sentence) should be rejected and that leave to appeal against the sentences should be granted, and the appeal dismissed. I agree, for the reasons given by Sperling J that grounds 6, 7, 8 and 9 should be rejected. I also agree with his Honour’s conclusions in relation to ground 5, although, in respect only of the cross-examination concerning the appellant’s criminal conviction, I prefer to state my own reasons. I will come to those in due course. 
     
      
       
      background 
       
      
    71 On 8 October 2002 the appellant was presented for trial on an indictment containing three counts, each alleging an offence against the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The final count alleged an offence against s24(2) of that Act, of knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The second and third counts, brought under s26 of the same Act, each alleged conspiracy to manufacture not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    72 The offence the subject of count 1 was alleged to have been committed between 1 December 1995 and 31 January 1996 at Dee Why in an apartment rented by Peter Dinham and Andrew Stenz, the rental of which had been arranged by the appellant. (On this count the appellant was acquitted.) 
     
      
    73 The offence the subject of the second count was alleged to have been committed between 1 January 1996 and 30 April 1996, at Dooralong, on the Central Coast, in premises arranged by Damien Drew, an acquaintance of the appellant. The appellant was convicted of this offence. 
     
      
    74 The offence the subject of count 3 was alleged to have been committed between 1 April 1996 and 30 June 1996, at Sylvania Waters, at premises occupied by Rodney Hearne, who was a friend of Robert Proctor, himself a friend of the appellant. The appellant was convicted on this count. 
     
      
    75 On each of the two convictions, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, to commence on 26 December 2002, with a non-parole period of five years and three months. 
     
      
    76 The appellant now appeals against the two convictions, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    77 Each count involved an allegation that the appellant in some way participated in an enterprise of manufacturing methylamphetamine. Also involved, on the Crown case, in each instance, was Richard James Simpson, who was, it seems, put forward as the lynchpin of the venture. 
     
      
    78 Evidence was given in the trial directly implicating the appellant in each venture. Simpson was the principal Crown witness. On the prosecution case, and on his own admission, Simpson had been involved in illegal drug manufacturing from the early 1980s until 1996. He was highly experienced in the techniques. He received supplies of chemicals from a man called Craig Haeusler. Simpson met the appellant late in 1995. This was in the context of a charge (of manufacturing amphetamines) that Simpson then faced. The appellant, a former police officer, was retained by Simpson to advise and assist him in defending that charge. 
     
      
    79 Before giving evidence Simpson received indemnity against prosecution from the Attorney-General of NSW. That indemnity does not appear to have gone into evidence, and the extent of the indemnity, its precise terms and the offences to which it related, are not clear on the evidence. In any event, Simpson gave evidence that, having pleaded guilty to an (unidentified) offence, his sentence was reduced by 20% as a consequence of his undertaking to give evidence against the appellant. 
     
      
    80 Simpson gave evidence of a developing friendship between himself and the appellant during the preparation for and the course of the trial in which the appellant assisted and advised him. Simpson said that the appellant had expressed interest in learning how to manufacture drugs and had offered a partnership in which his contribution would be an understanding of police and police surveillance techniques, and the provision of protection against exploitation. As a consequence they agreed to form a partnership in which they would divide the proceeds of manufacture, after allocating a share to Haeusler in return for his supplying the raw materials. Simpson’s trial began in about February 1996. The first task allocated to the appellant was to locate suitable venues for the manufacture. 
     
      
    81 Simpson gave evidence that the appellant secured the premises at Dee Why, located and purchased chemicals, artefacts and other items required for the manufacture, gave assistance in the manufacturing process itself, transported Simpson to and from the premises, and instructed Simpson in anti-surveillance techniques in order to avoid detection. He gave detailed evidence, which it is unnecessary here to recount, of the manufacturing enterprise at Dee Why. This included evidence of the appellant’s presence, on more than one occasion, at the Dee Why apartment, and of his participation in what was referred to as “the cook”. 
     
      
    82 Simpson also gave evidence concerning the Dooralong allegations. He said that he first went to the Dooralong address with the appellant in the beginning of 1996. From February 1996, while Simpson was on trial in the Downing Centre District Court on the charge mentioned above, and the appellant had been assisting him, the two men had regular contact for the dual purposes of Simpson’s defence and the pursuit of their then current manufacturing venture. During that time Simpson was given the opportunity of obtaining chemicals that would enable him to manufacture a batch of amphetamine. The appellant undertook to locate suitable premises for that purpose. He did so with the assistance of Damien Drew. This was a country house in Dooralong. Simpson gave evidence of the drug manufacturing process there, of the appellant’s presence there and of his involvement in the organisation.  
     
      
    83 Police raided the Dooralong premises on 15 April 1996. Neither the appellant nor Simpson was present at the time. 
     
      
    84 Simpson also gave evidence about the Sylvania Waters allegations. He said that he and appellant went to those premises, on the recommendation of a friend of his (Simpson’s), and discussed with the occupier (Hearne) the use of the premises for the processing of methylamphetamine. He gave evidence that the appellant arranged for raw materials and equipment to be delivered to Sylvania Waters.  
     
      
    85 Other witnesses gave evidence implicating the appellant in each of the manufactures. A number of these witnesses were, like Simpson, individuals who had themselves been involved in one or more of the three manufactures. For example, Ken Knight and Georgina Phillips, both of whom participated in the Dee Why manufacture, gave evidence of having seen the appellant at those premises, while manufacturing was in process. (Knight agreed, in cross-examination, that he had not seen the appellant do anything in relation to the processing. The evidence of his presence was, however, of added significance because the appellant denied ever having been to the Dee Why address.) These witnesses also gave evidence of having seen the appellant at Dooralong, Phillips of having observed the appellant with Simpson, setting up the process in a shower recess. (In cross-examination, Phillips agreed that she may have been mistaken in saying that the appellant was present when Simpson set up a reaction flask.) Kathleen Simpson gave evidence of the appellant’s presence at Dee Why and Sylvania, and of conversations between the appellant and Simpson about the organisation of the enterprise, and the manufacturing process. 
     
      
    86 Besides Simpson, six witnesses were in receipt of indemnities against prosecution from the Attorney-General of NSW in respect of their involvement in drug manufacturing. As with Simpson, neither the full extent of, nor the terms of the indemnities was disclosed on the appeal. 
     
      
    87 There was also evidence from another man, Arthur Launt. Launt had given evidence in committal proceedings, but had died before the trial. Two statements were (in part) read to the jury, as was part of the transcript of his cross-examination at the committal proceedings. The most significant aspect of Launt’s evidence was that he had been a supplier of chemicals for illegal drug manufacture, but that he had adulterated the chemicals, either by adding water or by substituting one chemical for another. The consequence of the adulteration was that any attempt to manufacture methylamphetamine from raw materials supplied by Launt would fail. The materials were not capable of producing the drug. In an interview with Detective Inspector Willingham, Launt identified chemicals seized at the Sylvania Waters premises as having originated from his property in Queensland. 
     
      
    88 There was also evidence of police officers who had, for some time, maintained surveillance of Simpson and the appellant. This related only to the Sylvania Waters charge. On 13 June 1996 police entered the Sylvania Waters premises. Simpson and the appellant were present. They were arrested. There was evidence of some conversation overheard between the appellant and others prior to their arrest. This conversation was incriminatory. There was also evidence of police having observed the appellant actively involved in the manufacturing process. 
     
      
    89 The appellant gave and called evidence. The defence case was, essentially, a denial of complicity in any of the manufactures. He confirmed his association with Simpson in the context of Simpson’s trial and his providing assistance from the vantage point of being a former police officer. He denied any discussion of drug manufacture at any location. He denied having been either to the Dee Why or the Dooralong premises. He claimed that 13 June 1996, when he was arrested at Sylvania Waters, was the first time he had been at those premises and that he had been there only for twenty minutes or half an hour. He said he had agreed to drive Simpson there so he could collect some materials Simpson needed for the trial which was still proceeding. 
     
      
    90 It is unnecessary here to refer further to the evidence of the witnesses called in the appellant’s case. 
     
      
       
      ground 1: separation of counts 
       
      
    91 Ground 1 consists of three components. As finally presented, the ground was framed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1(A) 
         
        His Honour erred in not ordering a separate trial of the first count on the indictment. 
         
         
        Ground 1(B) 
         
        His Honour erred in ordering that the evidence in each count was admissible in respect of the other two counts pursuant to s98  
        Evidence Act  
        as coincidence evidence. 
         
         
        Ground 1(C) 
         
        Further, his Honour did not give sufficient instructions to the jury in the summing-up when directing them to consider the three charges separately, and did not properly identify or segregate the admissible evidence in respect of each count.” 
        
       
      
    92 Initially it was contended that each count ought to have been the subject of a separate indictment and separate trial. That position was abandoned. What was ultimately pressed on appeal was that there ought to have been two trials, the first a trial of the first count alone, and the second a joint trial of counts 2 and 3. 
     
      
    93 The Crown proposed to present an indictment charging the appellant with all three counts. On or about 26 September 2002 counsel for the appellant sought an order that each count be tried separately from the others – that is, for an order that three trials take place. On the same day Armitage DCJ rejected the application. It seems that an earlier application in similar terms had been made to and rejected by Stewart ADCJ in 2001 and early 2002. In giving reasons for rejecting the application before him Armitage DCJ noted that the evidence before him was, by consent, the evidence given in the application before Stewart ADCJ. That evidence was not put before this Court. 
     
      
    94 Armitage DCJ gave reasons for his decision to refuse the application. He recorded the submissions by the parties to him. It seems that the Crown proposed to proceed on a joint trial of the three counts on the basis that it proposed to rely upon evidence specifically relevant to any individual count in support of each other count. In doing so, the Crown relied upon s98 of the Evidence Act 1995. S98 is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if:  
         
         
          
          (a) ...  
          
         
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         
         
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
         
         
          
          (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and  
          
         
         
          
          (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.  
          
         
         
        (3) ...” 
         
        
       
      
    95 Counsel then appearing for the appellant argued that the events the subject of the charges were not “related events” in that they were not substantially and relevantly similar, and the circumstances in which they occurred were not substantially similar. His Honour rejected that submission and held that the events were plainly “related events”. He accepted that the evidence to be led by the Crown did amount to coincidence evidence within the terms of s98, and that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have had upon the appellant. In doing this he reminded himself of s101 of the Evidence Act which relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution  
         
         
        (1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.  
         
         
        (2) ... coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.  
         
         
        (3) ....  
         
         
        (4) ....” 
        
       
       
      His Honour also referred to s137 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . 
       
      
    96 His Honour referred to an argument put to him concerning the possibility of collusion between the various witnesses. He referred to the decision of the High Court in Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292. 
     
      
    97 He rejected the proposition that the evidence challenged should be seen as the product of collusion. He then held that “the other matters” relied upon by the Crown in support of joint trials were sufficient to entitle the Crown to a joint trial of all three counts. 
     
      
    98 As I have indicated above, the ground of appeal finally advanced challenged the decision to refuse the application for a separate trial of count 1. In my opinion that ground is properly construed as asserting error in the decision at the time at, and in the circumstances in, which it was made. It is for that reason that I have commented on the absence of the evidentiary material that was before Armitage DCJ. It is impossible to assess the correctness of the decision without that evidence. However, the appellant’s submissions on this ground were directed to, and drew support from, what took place in the trial. I will return to this.  
     
      
    99 Notwithstanding his Honour’s stated view on 26 September that the evidence tendered by the Crown could be used as coincidence evidence within the meaning of s98, at the conclusion of the trial (which continued over a more than two month period) when he came to summing up to the jury, he declined to give any directions in accordance with that earlier conclusion.  
     
      
    100 This gave rise to a factual dispute on the appeal. The transcript records: 
     
      
       
        
        “As far as I am concerned Mr Crown, I don’t know whether you intend leading coincidence evidence for the jury ...” 
        
       
       
      He then went on to discuss circumstantial evidence. 
       
      
    101 Counsel for the appellant submits that this represents a transcription error, and the transcript should read: 
     
      
       
        
        “As far as I am concerned Mr Crown, I won’t allow you to lead/argue coincidence evidence for the jury ...” 
        
       
       
      The Crown disputes this. 
       
      
    102 In the course of the discussion with counsel about circumstantial evidence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For example, I formed the view in relation to coincidence evidence, and you, Mr Waterstreet [trial counsel for the appellant], want me to direct on matters which are to be looked at completely independently ...” 
        
       
       
      This does not assist in the determination of the accuracy of the earlier quoted transcript. 
       
      
    103 To the extent that it is necessary to do so, I think this issue must be resolved, in favour of the appellant’s proposed version, by reference to an affidavit sworn by the solicitor, Mr King, who represented the appellant both at trial and on appeal. Mr King deposed that he was present in the court during most days of the trial, including 16 December when the disputed remark was made. He deposed to a specific recollection of hearing Armitage DCJ saying to the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “I won’t be letting you put coincidence evidence to the jury” 
        
       
       
      or words to that effect. 
       
      
    104 Mr King supported this recollection by reference to other circumstances, including the fact that use of coincidence evidence had been the subject of competing submissions made by the Crown and defence counsel. On balance, I think Mr King’s recollection should be accepted as accurate. He was not required for cross-examination, and the accuracy of his recollections was not challenged. 
     
      
    105 In any event, neither the Crown, in his closing address, nor the trial judge in his summing up, adverted to coincidence evidence and I would infer from this that, whatever was said in that part of the discussion as to which the transcript is disputed, Armitage DCJ had, by the end of the trial, taken a different view of the availability of evidence to be used as permitted by s98. In taking this course he acceded to the submission of counsel for the appellant, who strenuously opposed any direction on coincidence evidence being given to the jury. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          * * * 
          
         
        
       
      
    106 In the judgment of 26 September, Armitage DCJ identified six features of the evidence on which the Crown relied as coincidence evidence. These were: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. In each case there was an agreement that Haeusler supply Simpson with the raw materials. 
        
       
       
        
        2. In each case Simpson was to use his expertise to produce methylamphetamine and Haeusler was to take a share of the product; the balance was to be shared between Simpson and others who were accomplices. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In each case the premises used for ‘the cook’ were bathrooms in residential premises and in each case those premises were leased or occupied by a friend or acquaintance of the accused or Simpson. 
        
       
       
        
        4. In each case Simpson was the cook. 
        
       
       
        
        5. In each case the accused assisted the enterprise by arranging the premises to be used, by helping to transport chemicals and equipment, by being present and helping to supervise ‘the cook’ on site and by advising Simpson on anti-surveillance techniques. 
        
       
       
        
        6. In each case the method of manufacture was a heating process and in each case it was substantially the same.” 
        
       
      
    107 His Honour also noted that the Crown relied upon other matters in support of his contention that all three counts should be tried together. These were: 
     
      
       
      (i) “the obvious similarity of circumstances alleged”; 
       
       
      (ii) “the time span over which the offences were alleged to have been committed, that is of a period of six or seven months”; 
       
       
      (iii) “that ‘a significant evidentiary overlap’ existed between the three counts”.  
       
      
    108 His Honour then referred to a number of witnesses who would give evidence in relation to all counts (such as Simpson) or to two of the three counts. 
     
      
    109 On appeal, counsel for the appellant has taken issue with certain of the factual matters upon which Armitage DCJ relied. I do not find it necessary to resolve the question of any factual error in his Honour’s approach to the question of separate trials. Although, as is common ground, the availability of coincidence evidence was a significant basis for his Honour’s rejection of the appellant’s separate trials application, at the close of the evidence he determined that he would not permit coincidence reasoning to be put to the jury. Coincidence evidence was not, ultimately, an issue. 
     
      
    110 No complaint was made in this Court that his Honour did not direct the jury against coincidence reasoning: nor could it, counsel for the appellant at the trial having strenuously resisted any such direction being given to the jury. Of course, it was open to counsel to seek an explicit direction cautioning against coincidence reasoning. This counsel did not do, no doubt for considered reasons. 
     
      
    111 At the time of the trial s64 of the Criminal Procedure Act provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “64 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
      
    (2) If of the opinion: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        ...” 
        
       
       
      This provision has been renumbered as s21(2) but is otherwise in identical terms. 
       
      
    112 S29 of the Criminal Procedure Act now provides further for an order for separate trials, but it was not in force at the time Armitage DCJ made his decision. I see no error in the approach taken by Armitage DCJ at the time the application was made and decided. No real argument was directed to the correctness or otherwise of the decision at the time it was made. 
     
      
    113 As I have mentioned above, the argument on this ground proceeded on the basis, not of the evidence that was before his Honour at the time he made the decision, but of the evidence as it emerged in the trial. The ground was advanced, not as one focussing upon error in the decision at the time it was made, but as one to the effect that the trial subsequently miscarried by reason of the refusal to order separate trials. 
     
      
    114 In support of this ground counsel argued, in written submissions, that no common factual origin in the three counts existed. This they sought to support by noting that the first count represented a statutory offence, and the second and third counts separate and distinct conspiracies with different participants, premises and methods. 
     
      
    115 I would reject the argument. The Crown allegations were that the appellant became involved in the drug manufacturing business as a result of his association with Simpson. That alone is sufficient common factual origin. That count 1 represented a statutory offence and the other counts conspiracies makes not the slightest difference. There were many additional common elements. 
     
      
    116 There was a great deal of evidence common to two or more counts in the indictment. The jury was properly directed of the need to consider each count separately. In my opinion no miscarriage of justice has been seen to arise as a result of the trial judge’s decision to refuse the separate trials application. If further support for this conclusion were needed, it is to be found in the acquittal of the appellant on the first count. This demonstrates, to my mind conclusively, that the jury properly approached the task committed to them. 
     
      
       
      ground 1(B) 
       
      
    117 There is little more to be said about this ground, the issue of coincidence evidence having evaporated by the end of the trial. I should, however, mention one argument that was advanced on behalf of the appellant. This arose out of the decision of the High Court in Hoch. Hoch was relied upon as authority for the proposition that the possibility of concoction among witnesses constituted a basis for the separation of trials; on that basis, it was argued, separate trials should have been ordered because of the opportunity that plainly existed for the indemnified witnesses to collaborate and produce a consistent story. What this submission overlooks is that the possibility of concoction referred to in Hoch was the possibility of concoction among complainants – that is, the initiators of the charges faced by the accused person. To my knowledge it has never been the case that the possibility of concoction amongst other witnesses is a potential basis for an order for separate trials. The possibility of concoction, where it exists, remains present whether the evidence is given in separate trials or a joint trial. 
     
      
    118 It is of some importance to focus upon what emerged as the real factual issues in this trial. A great deal was not in dispute. It was not in dispute, for example, that Simpson was involved in the manufacture, or attempted manufacture, of amphetamines at the three laboratories. It was not in dispute that Knight and Phillips assisted in the process at Dee Why and at Dooralong. The significant factual matter that was in dispute was simply whether the appellant was involved in any one or more of the manufacturing enterprises. Resolution of that factual dispute did not depend upon coincidence evidence, but upon the direct evidence of Simpson and the other indemnified witnesses. Some further evidence (“circumstantial evidence”) was called in which it was suggested the jury might draw inferences supportive of the direct evidence. 
     
      
    119 The decision in Hoch was, fundamentally, a decision about the admissibility of what was then called similar fact evidence. The possibility of concoction there considered went to the probative value, as assessed by the trial judge, of that evidence. In this case, the possibility of concoction was relevant, but it was possible concoction amongst direct evidence witnesses, not “similar fact” (or coincidence) evidence witnesses. 
     
      
    120 As I have said earlier, it is unnecessary to consider further whether Armitage DCJ was in error at the outset of the trial in refusing the application on the basis that the evidence in each count would be admissible in respect of each other count as coincidence evidence, since he acceded to the submission by counsel for the appellant that no coincidence reasoning direction should be given. The question for determination is whether any miscarriage of justice has been shown to have resulted from the refusal. In my opinion it has not. 
     
      
       
      ground 1(C) 
       
      
    121 By ground 1(C) complaint is made of the directions given to the jury; specifically, it is asserted that the directions did not sufficiently identify the evidence relative to each individual count. At the outset – p1 – of the summing up his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I emphasise that there are three separate charges and that it is your duty to weigh up the evidence in respect of each of those charges quite separately. In effect, those three charges are being dealt with together as a matter of convenience. They are completely and utterly separate charges and you must weigh up the evidence in respect of the charges. Obviously, in due course, you will be required to return a separate verdict in respect of each of those charges.” 
        
       
      
    122 Later – much later – in the context of reminding the jury of the arguments that had been put to them by the Crown Prosecutor, his Honour made detailed reference to what had been said by him in relation to the evidence going to each count. 
     
      
    123 His Honour gave a careful direction to the jury about the caution with which they should treat Simpson’s evidence. This was done particularly in the context of count 1 as to which, his Honour said, Simpson was the only witness who could depose to the identity of the substance being manufactured. 
     
      
    124 A little later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this case the Crown seeks to prove the participation of the accused by the direct evidence of Mr Simpson and Gina Phillips, that is in relation to Dooralong. I will remind you later of what that evidence is. In relation to Sylvania Waters, the Crown relies on the direct evidence of Mr Simpson, Kathleen Simpson, formerly Ingall, and the police evidence as to the events of the evening of 13 June 1996. In relation to both conspiracy charges, the Crown relies on inferences to be drawn from the surveillance evidence and the telephone intercepts ...” 
        
       
       
      It was accepted on appeal that the evidence of surveillance and telephone intercepts related only to the Sylvania Waters count. His Honour was therefore in error to the extent that he thought the surveillance and telephone intercept evidence also related to Dooralong. 
       
      
    125 As I have noted, Armitage DCJ concisely summed up the Crown submissions as to the evidence relevant to each count. The Crown’s address, which has been transcribed, was in fact very detailed as to this, and extends, on this issue, over a number of pages of transcript. In this case, it was sufficient, in my view, for his Honour to endorse, as he did, the manner in which the Crown had identified the evidence relevant to each count. This is not one of those aspects of a summing up, such as a direction of law or a matter of caution, in which the authority of the court is required to be put behind the proposition stated, and it is insufficient for a judge merely to restate arguments that have been put by one counsel or the other. What the jury needed was to be reminded of the evidence relevant to each count. This jury was so reminded. 
     
      
    126 A specific complaint was made that no direction was given in terms outlined in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82. The reference is to a proposed direction, in a trial involving multiple counts, as to caution that might be exercised by a jury in the event that they doubt the credibility of a witness sufficiently to acquit the accused in relation to one count, on the remaining counts. The specific passages in Markuleski on which reliance was placed are to be found at [186], [257] – [266], and [279]. 
     
      
    127 The reliance on Markuleski is misplaced. Markuleski is concerned with the trial of multiple counts where, to use the words of the Chief Justice at [186], the case is one of “word against word”. Although, in the present appeal, issues about corroboration have been raised (to which it will be necessary to come) given the number of witnesses who were to be regarded as “accomplices”, this was certainly not a case of “word against word”. 
     
      
    128 On the appellant’s argument, the asserted inadequacies in the directions had an unfair consequence upon the trial in a number of respects. Counsel pointed, for example, to a submission made to the trial judge on behalf of the appellant that, in relation to count 2, concerning the Dooralong premises, there was no evidence involving the appellant in manufacturing other than that of Simpson; and argued that the absence of a direction by the judge isolating the relevant evidence on each count: 
     
      
       
        
        “did not enable the jury to consider the arguments and submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    129 Two responses might be made to this. Firstly, the factual basis for the submission is incorrect. Phillips gave evidence of seeing the appellant, with Simpson, setting up the process in the shower recess, and of hearing Knight speaking to the appellant, Simpson and Drew about a problem in the process (although she agreed in cross-examination that she may have been mistaken about the former assertion). Further, as the Crown pointed out in its written submissions, there was a good deal of evidence showing the appellant’s presence at Dooralong on several occasions, and of the circumstance that the premises were occupied by an acquaintance of the appellant. Secondly, it does not follow that, even if the judge had not isolated the relevant evidence on each count, the jury were unable to consider the arguments and submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant. 
     
      
    130 A criminal trial involves the interaction of a number of parties, including Crown and defence counsel and the judge. It is not necessary for the judge to repeat everything that has been put to the jury by either counsel. Juries can be and are trusted to consider the arguments put to them by counsel. That is the essence of the process on which the criminal justice system has relied for generations. Armitage DCJ was at pains to remind the jury, and did so comprehensively, of the arguments put to them by counsel. 
     
      
    131 A further matter to which counsel for the appellant referred concerned an asserted misdirection as to the evidence supporting the two conspiracy counts. The particular complaint concerned the passage in the summing up as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “... The Crown seeks to prove the agreement, or the nature of the agreement, by direct evidence from Mr Simpson, and also by inferences from the evidence of Kim Knight, Georgina Phillips, Kathleen Simpson (formerly Ingall), Robert Proctor and also the telephone intercepts.” 
        
       
      
    132 This, it was contended, was in error in that two of the witnesses named (Proctor and Kathleen Simpson) gave no evidence as to count 2, and two (Knight and Phillips) gave no evidence as to count 3; and the telephone intercepts related only to the Sylvania Waters charge. The direction, it was argued, was capable of confusing the jury by leading them to believe that they could use evidence generally to support inferences of agreement. 
     
      
    133 If the passage stood alone, there may be some substance to the appellant’s complaint. However, on the very next page of the transcript of the summing up, the trial judge is recorded as having referred to the direct evidence relating to Dooralong and Sylvania Waters. The complaint is, accordingly, without foundation. 
     
      
    134 Another complaint made under this head, although seemingly only peripherally related to it when regard is had to the terms in which it is framed, concerned a direction given, at the request of counsel for the appellant, on circumstantial evidence. In order to give the directions sought, the trial judge obtained from the Crown Prosecutor a list of items of circumstantial evidence on which the Crown relied. The Crown Prosecutor provided to the judge a list. The judge, in effect, adopted the list and read it to the jury. The list consisted of items such as the appellant’s contact with a rented motor vehicle, the surveillance officers’ observations of the appellant and nobody else driving this vehicle, the content of conversations between the appellant and another man which were the subject of interception and a white drum found at the house of another person. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In addition to those three matters, as circumstantial evidence the Crown relies upon the accused’s contact with Peter Dinham, Pauline Dinham, Damien Drew and Tony Brizzi.” 
        
       
      
    135 The complaint now made is that, in giving the jury these directions, the trial judge failed to identify to which count each matter related, and ran together evidence relevant only in relation to one count or another without differentiation. In respect of the white drum to which his Honour referred, he did in fact note that that drum was connected with the third count; but otherwise what is said on behalf of the appellant is substantially correct. 
     
      
    136 One thing that makes this ground difficult for the appellant is that, two days before the direction was given, the Crown Prosecutor had handed his proposed list to the judge, who read it onto the transcript for the benefit of counsel for the appellant. Neither then, nor in the following two days, did counsel for the appellant complain that to direct the jury in accordance with the Crown Prosecutor’s suggestions would be confusing or misleading. 
     
      
    137 Just why his Honour was persuaded to give any direction concerning circumstantial evidence is not apparent. This was not primarily a circumstantial evidence case. The principal evidence, and there was a great bulk of it, was direct evidence of various aspects of the appellant’s involvement in each of the drug manufactures. There is a distinction between a trial that depends entirely or substantially upon circumstantial evidence, and a trial in which inferences might be sought to be drawn from pieces of evidence of themselves not probative of any issue. It is true, of course, that by the second and third counts the appellant was charged with conspiracy and this entailed the drawing of inferences about his state of mind (bearing in mind that Simpson gave detailed evidence of actual agreements) but the evidence of what the appellant did by way of participation and furtherance of the conspiracy was largely direct evidence. When the matter was raised by his Honour, counsel for the appellant submitted that, for example, the surveillance evidence:  
     
      
       
        
        “... must be circumstantial in a conspiracy case such as this, namely, that it is a circumstance that leads to the inference of agreement, not to the inference of the fact of the sighting or whatever the matter be.” 
        
       
       
      He went on to submit that such circumstances had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
      
    138 In Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 the High Court clarified a misunderstanding about the directions required in a criminal trial that depends upon circumstantial evidence. It recognised that, in some cases, “an indispensable intermediate step” is required before guilt can be inferred beyond reasonable doubt. Such a fact must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. There is no such fact here; as I have said the Crown case depended primarily upon direct evidence supported by indirect evidence from which the Crown sought to have inferences drawn. 
     
      
    139 In my opinion, the jury could not have been confused about the evidence that was called circumstantial. Although his Honour was, in another place, in error in suggesting that the surveillance evidence was relevant to count 2, it was clearly only relevant to count 3. There was no suggestion in the evidence that there had been any surveillance at Dooralong or Dee Why. The same applies to telephone intercept evidence. 
     
      
    140 The diversion into circumstantial evidence considerations was, in my view, a red herring, but one which occupied a miniscule part in the overall trial and summing up and could not be thought to have given rise to any miscarriage of justice. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      ground 2: evidence of Arthur Launt 
       
      
    141 Ground 2 is concerned with the admission of evidence of Arthur Launt. Launt had, from Queensland, provided chemicals for drug manufacturing. When he was interviewed by police he gave induced statements on 1 August 1998, and 17 November 1998. He was interviewed by police on 3 September 1998, and this interview was recorded on video tape. He gave evidence in committal proceedings against the appellant in 1999. He died before the appellant’s trial commenced. 
     
      
    142 After hearing argument, Armitage DCJ permitted the Crown to read onto the trial record parts of the statements of 1 August and 17 December, and relevant portions of his cross-examination in the committal proceedings. The videotape of the interview of 3 September 1998 was played to the jury. 
     
      
    143 Ground 2, like ground 1, is a composite of three matters. It is as well to set them out. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 2(A) 
         
        His Honour erred in failing to exclude the evidence of the late Arthur Launt pursuant to ss65, 135 or 137  
        Evidence Act 
         
         
        Ground 2(B) 
         
        Alternatively, his Honour erred in failing to exclude parts of the evidence of the late Arthur Launt ... 
         
         
        Ground 2(C) 
         
        His Honour instructed the jury that the evidence of the late Arthur Launt had ‘ 
        some significance’ 
         but failed to properly instruct them concerning his unreliability pursuant to s165  
        Evidence Act 
         ...” 
        
       
       
      grounds 2(A) and 2(B) 
       
      
    144 These grounds can be dealt with together. 
     
      
    145 The Crown gave notice of its intention to tender the statements of 1 August and 17 December 1998, relying on s65 of the Evidence Act, which relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available  
         
         
        (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.  
         
         
        (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was:  
         
         
          
          (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or  
          
         
         
          
          (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or  
          
         
         
          
          (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made.  
          
         
         
        (3) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:  
         
         
          
          (a) cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or  
          
         
         
          
          (b) had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it.  
          
         
         
        (4) ...  
         
         
        (5) ...  
         
         
        (6) ...  
         
         
        (7) ...  
         
         
        (8) ...  
         
         
        (9) ... “ 
        
       
      
    146 As was the case in relation to the application for separate trials, a similar issue had arisen earlier in 2002 and was dealt with by Stewart ADCJ. Again, in ruling upon the admissibility of the evidence, Armitage DCJ noted that the evidence before him was, by consent, the evidence given before Stewart ADCJ. Notwithstanding this, that evidence was not placed before this Court. This Court has had access to the judgment of Stewart ADCJ of 25 January 2002, and the transcripts of the evidence. His Honour held that parts of the statements were admissible under s65(2)(c) and (d) but not s65(2) (a) or (b). It appears that he ruled in this way over the contrary submission of then counsel for the appellant. He also rejected an argument that the evidence should be excluded under either s135 or s137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    147 Before Armitage DCJ the issue appears to have been approached differently. The first attack made upon the admissibility of the evidence, as recorded by Armitage DCJ in his judgment, was on the ground of relevance. His Honour also recorded a submission that the evidence should be rejected in accordance with s137 of the Evidence Act. Armitage DCJ held that the evidence was admissible under s65: 
     
      
       
        
        “for the purposes stated by the Crown Prosecutor” 
        
       
       
      and added: 
       
       
        
        “It was not suggested by Mr McGrath [who apparently appeared for the appellant on this application] that if I rejected his submissions as to why the challenged evidence would be excluded, I should nevertheless exclude it on the basis that it did not come within s65(2)(c) or s65(2)(d).” 
        
       
      
    148 His Honour declared his concurrence in the analysis of Stewart ADCJ and his Honour’s conclusion and stated that he could: 
     
      
       
        
        “... detect no reason why I should reject it pursuant to s137.” 
        
       
      
    149 In written submissions counsel for the appellant complained of a number of aspects of Armitage DCJ’s judgment. These were put as: 
     
      
       
      (i) that Mr Launt was an indemnified witness, but that neither judge (i.e. Armitage DCJ, and Stewart ADCJ) alluded to the fact that he had been indemnified, or to the consequent unreliability of his statements. 
       
       
      (ii) that Launt, when giving evidence at committal, received a certificate under s128 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      ; 
       
       
      (iii) that Launt had not finally been dealt with at the time of giving evidence in the committal proceedings; 
       
       
      (iv) Launt’s asserted “admitted unreliability”; 
       
       
      (v) “the inability of the defence to properly cross-examine [Launt] at committal”; 
       
       
      (vi) “the bizarre preparation of Mr Launt’s statements”; 
       
       
      (vii) “the prejudice of the evidence”. 
       
      
    150 The factual assertion contained in the first complaint is untenable. Stewart ADCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “These representations were made in a series of induced statements. Launt was aware that he could not be prosecuted for what he said and, according to [the police officer through whom Launt’s statements were tendered], Launt was well aware, having been made aware by [the police officer], that he was required to tell the truth because, if he did not, he would be in serious trouble. This is acknowledged in the preamble, at least on the face of it, in at least some of the statement.” 
        
       
      
    151 In each of Launt’s statements that were ultimately read, the first paragraph is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am making this statement after a promise held out to me by Detective Inspector Michael Drury and Detective Sergeant Paul Willingham that no information given in this will be used in any criminal proceedings against me in any court of law of New South Wales except in respect of the falsity of my statement or for the purpose of establishing falsity of evidence given by me as a witness.” 
        
       
      
    152 Thus, Stewart ADCJ, whose reasons Armitage DCJ adopted, expressly alluded to Launt’s indemnified status, and the fact of the indemnity was plain on the face of the statements tendered. 
     
      
    153 As to the second matter of complaint, concerning the s128 certificate, it is true that neither judge expressly referred to it. However, that certificate adds nothing to the indemnities which were known to their Honours. 
     
      
    154 As to the third matter, it was asserted in written submissions that Launt was sentenced on 17 August 1999 after giving evidence in the committal proceedings involving the appellant. The argument appears to be that the incentive for Launt to give fabricated evidence was so great as to render it suspect so that it should not have been admitted.  
     
      
    155 In relation to Launt’s asserted “admitted unreliability” and the lack of opportunity of defence counsel to cross-examine him, it was stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Launt was not available at committal for general cross-examination by the appellant’s counsel ...” 
        
       
      
    156 The committal transcript does not suggest at all that any restriction was placed upon the cross-examination of Launt. Counsel for the Crown on appeal has conceded that there may have been some such restriction. He did this by reference to a passage in the judgment of Stewart ADCJ. The passage reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the Local Court the whole of the statement of 17 December was apparently tendered but the Magistrate rejected some parts. Cross-examination was conducted in relation to some parts of that statement on behalf of the accused by counsel then appearing for him ... It is quite vague which parts were allowed and which were not and no real attempt was made by the Prosecutor to make it clear.” 
        
       
      
    157 I am not satisfied that the concession made by the Crown was properly made. I do not read that passage in the judgment of Stewart ADCJ as denoting any restriction on cross-examination of Launt by counsel: I read the reference to “which parts were allowed and which were not” as relating back to the observation that some parts of the statements had been rejected. 
     
      
    158 As to the characterisation of the preparation of Launt’s statements as “bizarre”, and of his evidence as prejudicial, it seems that the major complaint made in this respect is that, in admitting the evidence, Armitage DCJ regarded it as part of the coincidence evidence – a notion on which he later turned his back. Indeed, Launt’s evidence may well have been seen as powerful coincidence evidence – it was his evidence that established that the chemicals provided for the operations at Dooralong and Sylvania Waters had been adulterated, rendering achievement of the purpose of the conspiracies impossible: but, in the process, showing a connection between the two that tended to exclude coincidence. 
     
      
    159 It is unfair to say that Armitage DCJ failed to have regard to the prejudice of the evidence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This prejudice arises, in Mr McGrath’s submission, because of the impossibility of cross-examining Mr Launt about that purported identification.” 
        
       
      
    160 He then outlined in some detail the basis on which the Crown sought to tender the evidence. The trouble for the appellant is that his Honour also found the evidence was “highly probative” and saw, with one reservation, no reason to reject it under s137. The reservation concerned identification made by Launt. His Honour held that there was no danger of unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    161 As to Launt’s reliability, counsel for the appellant relied upon a number of passages of evidence given by Detective Inspector Willingham in the proceedings before Stewart ADCJ. Launt had been an informant of both NSW and Queensland police but, it appeared, an unsatisfactory one. Detective Inspector Willingham described him as “uncontrollable”. It was also put that Queensland police regarded Launt as “unreliable”; however, this has to be seen in the terms of the evidence given by Inspector Willingham which was that NSW police had terminated one investigation in which Launt had been involved, and one of the main reasons for this was Luant’s unreliability. However, Inspector Willingham went on to say that that unreliability was: 
     
      
       
        
        “... as far as following instructions in a controlled operation environment.” 
        
       
      
    162 It is unnecessary to go on with the complaints made about Launt’s reliability. It was open to counsel to put all this to Inspector Willingham at the trial, and, indeed, he did so. Inspector Willingham was asked if he was aware that Launt “was a very reliable informer” to which he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Very difficult to manage, yes.” 
        
       
       
      He agreed that Launt was “a very strange customer”, and that he had been “an induced witness”.  
       
      
    163 There could be no doubt that doubts about Launt’s reliability and veracity were before the jury. 
     
      
    164 In oral argument an additional criticism was made of the judgment. That concerned this passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was not submitted by Mr McGrath that if I rejected his submissions as to why the challenged evidence should be excluded, I should nevertheless exclude it on the basis that it did not come within 62(2)(c) or 65(2)(d).” 
        
       
      
    165 Counsel for the appellant argued that this was incorrect and that such a submission had been made to Stewart ADCJ. That may be so. But the observation made by Armitage DCJ at the outset of his judgment was that the evidence before him was the evidence given before Judge Stewart. There is no reason to believe that counsel also sought to rely on the argument before Stewart ADCJ and the fact that fresh argument was put before Armitage DCJ in relation to other matters suggests to the contrary. 
     
      
    166 I would reject grounds 2(A) and 2(B). 
     
      
       
      ground 2(C) 
       
      
    167 By this ground complaint is made that Armitage DCJ failed properly to instruct the jury, in accordance with s165 of the Evidence Act, concerning the asserted unreliability of Launt’s evidence, given by the reading of his statement. 
     
      
    168 This ground has been fully dealt with in a general ground raising s165 under ground 7. 
     
      
    169 It is, however, necessary to mention specific complaint made under this ground. Counsel submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The failure to mention the experience of the courts in dealing with accomplices was crucial in the case of Mr Launt because his statement was unable to be the subject of any real testing.” 
        
       
      
    170 As the reasons given for rejecting ground 7 make abundantly plain, the direction given concerning witnesses criminally involved in the offence giving rise to the charges was adequately dealt with in the summing up; the second part of the complaint now made, that Launt’s statement was unable to be the subject of any real testing, simply disregards the specific passage in the summing up in which it was pointed out to the jury that the defence was at a significant disadvantage because of the absence of cross-examination. 
     
      
    171 In addition, the judge directed the jury that his evidence had been given in a Local Court and was given before he was sentenced: it was pointed out that this created incentive for him to say what he thought would suit prosecuting authorities. This direction was said to be “out of context”. 
     
      
    172 There is absolutely no merit in this complaint. The directions given in relation to Launt’s evidence were complete, detailed and accurate. I would reject ground 2(C). 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: cross-examination of the appellant in relation to a criminal conviction 
       
      
    173 What follows are my reasons for concurring in the conclusion of Sperling J in relation to that part of ground 5 which concerns the leave given to the prosecution to cross-examine the appellant in relation to the prior criminal conviction for corruption. 
     
      
    174 I should note that I agree with Sperling J that the cross-examination of the appellant concerning the two departmental disciplinary matters ought not to have been permitted. It had no probative value whatsoever, and was, as Sperling J has characterised it, “utterly irrelevant” to the applicant’s credibility. I also agree with Sperling J that no harm was done by the permitted cross-examination in relation to threats alleged to have been made by the appellant to Simpson and Ingalls. I agree that, in relation to the evidence concerning the disciplinary matters, no substantial miscarriage of justice could have been caused by the admission of the evidence, and that the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied. 
     
      
    175 I take a different approach, but leading to the same result, to Sperling J, however, in relation to the cross-examination that elicited from the appellant an admission of a previous conviction for a corruption offence. My analysis is as follows. 
     
      
    176 At the conclusion of the Crown case the Crown Prosecutor sought leave, pursuant to s104(2) of the Evidence Act to cross-examine the appellant about a series of matters that were acknowledged to be relevant only because they were relevant to his credibility. On 6 December 2002 Armitage DCJ gave leave in relation to the four matters identified in ground 5, and set out in the judgment of Sperling J. Armitage DCJ rejected the leave sought in relation to certain other matters, to which it is not necessary to go. Armitage DCJ published two judgments on 6 December, which should, in my opinion, be read together. In the first he dealt at some length with the principles applicable to the determination of such an application, and ruled on most of the matters in respect to which the Crown had sought leave. The second judgment appears to have been made necessary as the result of a misunderstanding or oversight and dealt only with the matter the subject of the present ground, which had not been included in the first judgment: that is, the appellant’s prior criminal conviction. 
     
      
    177 As is evident from the fact that the application was made under s104(2), the evidence was, and could have been (and it was so acknowledged) relevant in respect of no issue other than the appellant’s credibility. It was therefore made inadmissible by s102, unless, in accordance with s103(1), it was held to have “substantial probative value”, and, under s104(2), leave was given to the prosecution to cross-examine the appellant on that subject matter, such leave to be given in the light of the s192 considerations. I emphasise the conjunction in the previous sentence: for the Crown to be entitled to cross-examine the appellant on this subject matter, it was necessary that it get over two hurdles, the first that created by s103(1) and the second that created by s104(2). In my opinion, rather than being the subject of separate determination, ss135(a) and 137, on which reliance was also placed, raised considerations relevant to the grant of leave: that is, if, in terms of s135(a), the trial judge were of the view that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to such an extent as to outweigh its probative value, then leave under s104(2) ought to have been refused; similarly, if, in terms of s137, he came to the view that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, then he was obliged to refuse leave. 
     
      
    178 A common theme, expressed in slightly different ways and prescribing slightly different tests, runs through s135(a), s137, and s192(2)(b). That theme is unfairness. 
     
      
    179 The first question for determination was the question raised by s103(1): did the evidence have “substantial probative value”? That raises a further question: “substantial probative value” of what? 
     
      
    180 “Probative value” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as: 
     
      
       
        
        “... the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    181 That definition, however, does not apply to the use of the term “(substantial) probative value” as it is used in s103(1). In R v RPS, unreported, NSWCCA, 13 August 1997, Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Gleeson CJ and Hidden J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 103 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         limits cross-examination as to credit to adducing evidence which has ‘substantial probative value’. The ‘probative value’ of evidence is defined in the s3 Dictionary as meaning ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’, but both the context in which that phrase appears and the subject matter of s103 indicate that that definition does  
        not  
        apply. That is made clear by the terms of subs(2), which demonstrate that the evidence must have probative value in relation to the credit of the witness.  
        Evidence adduced in cross-examination must therefore have substantial probative value in the sense that it could rationally affect the assessment of the credit of the witness. 
         Such an interpretation accords with the intention of the Law Reform Commission. The addition of the word ‘substantial’ nevertheless imposes a limitation upon the common law, when almost anything was allowed upon the issue of credit unless it clearly had no material weight whatsoever upon that issue. That limitation is an important one.” (‘not’ in the second sentence is italicised in the original; the emphasis placed on the fourth sentence is added; internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    182 That view of the meaning of the term was endorsed by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886; 106 FCR 51, per Sackville J, with whom Whitlam and Mansfield JJ agreed. (RPS was the subject of a successful appeal to the High Court: RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620, but on matters unrelated to the present question.) 
     
      
    183 In my opinion, for this evidence to have had substantial probative value within the meaning of s103(1), it must have had the potential to have a real bearing upon the assessment of the appellant’s credibility – and, particularly, to the appellant’s credibility in relation to the evidence he had given, or would give, at the trial. It cannot have had substantial probative value for the purposes of s103(1) unless it was capable, in a significant way, of bearing upon that assessment. 
     
      
    184 The trial judge’s reasons for admitting this evidence were brief. In the first judgment he had already referred to the authorities mentioned by Sperling J. In the second judgment, specifically related to the conviction evidence, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view the matter is of substantial probative value which is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.” 
        
       
      
    185 This was an application of the tests prescribed by ss135(a) and 137, and was a finding specifically made in response to submissions put to him by counsel. It was not, in terms, a finding made under s103(1), and, as it did not recognise the different, and more limited, meaning of “probative value” as it appears in that subsection, it cannot be construed as a finding that, for the limited purposes of s103(1), the evidence had substantial probative value. 
     
      
    186 No ground of appeal here raised, however, contends that his Honour erred in this respect. Indeed, in counsel’s written submission in relation to this ground (but referring globally to all four matters to which the ground relates) it was argued: 
     
      
       
        
        “42. It is submitted that his Honour erred in finding that these matters had ‘significant (sic) probative value’ ... This finding indicates the impact on the accused’s credit that the trial judge formed. In the circumstances it inappropriately painted the accused as a ‘bent copper’ from 1985. The argument took some time ... The accused was cross-examined ... and its impact in the context of credibility was significant. Cross-examination of an accused person on prior criminality is an exceptional course which was not justified by the circumstances of the appellant’s case.” 
        
       
       
      I have difficulty reconciling the first sentence of this submission with the balance of the paragraph. The essence of the complaint appears to be that the evidence did indeed have substantial probative value. 
       
      
    187 The appellant’s submissions on appeal focussed, as they did at trial, upon the prejudicial effect of the evidence relative to its probative value.  
     
      
    188 In relation to the conviction evidence, only one substantial question was put to the appellant in cross-examination. It is reproduced in the judgment of Sperling J and identified the 1994 conviction of the appellant as having been in respect of a charge of corruptly taking a sum of money ($4,500) for helping named persons to recover stolen property and not using due diligence to cause those who stole the property to be brought to trial. 
     
      
    189 I have come to the view that evidence of a conviction for corruption as a police officer (that is, a conviction for serious dishonesty) had substantial probative value in relation to the appellant’s credibility and/or reliability, and specifically so in relation to the jury’s assessment of the evidence he gave in the trial. 
     
      
    190 Thus, although the trial judge did not specifically address the correct question under s103(1), no error in this respect is disclosed in the outcome. 
     
      
    191 The next question is whether cross-examination of Crown witnesses on behalf of the appellant had opened the gateway to s104(2) provided by s104(4)(b). Again, no issue is raised in this respect in the written submissions. On this question I agree with Sperling J. The gate was thrown wide open. That this is so will appear more graphically when regard is had to the nature of the cross-examination of Crown witnesses which appears below. 
     
      
    192 The final question is whether, having regard to s192, s135(a) and s137, it was open to his Honour to grant the leave that he did. That is essentially a question of fairness, the answer to which is arrived at by balancing unfair prejudice against probative value. It is also essentially a question of the exercise of discretion, or of a balancing process, subject to the interference of this Court only on the principles stated in the well-known passage in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. One relevant consideration in the equation is the conduct of the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. The matters on which the Crown witnesses had been cross-examined were set out in the first judgment of Armitage DCJ of 6 December: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Questions put to Robert Proctor in an effort to establish that he was a ‘career fraudster’ and other questions put to him in relation to conviction for carnal knowledge.

    193 In R v Lumsden [2003] NSWCCA 83 the CCA divided over whether evidence of a prior conviction of a defence witness had substantial probative value. Smart AJ held that it did not; Hulme J, with whom Mason P agreed, held that it did. 
     
      
    194 The critical Crown witness was Simpson. He was the witness subjected to the lengthiest and most sustained attack in cross-examination. Cross-examination on issues of credit alone extended over at least 194 pages of transcript. It covered a diverse range of topics, from allegations of rape of the appellant’s eighteen month old stepdaughter, sexual molestation of the appellant’s son, and the use of firearms, to making false representations to a real estate agency in connection with an application for the lease of residential premises. Besides those matters, Simpson was cross-examined about: 
     
      
    - his honesty generally;- specific instances of lying to various courts and tribunals;- bribery of police officers;- indemnity against prosecution for a variety of offences;- instances of perverting or attempting to pervert or conspiring to pervert the course of justice;- conspiracy to commit tax offences;- tax evasion;- assaults on various women with whom the appellant had had a relationship;- the sentencing discount as a result of the appellant’s cooperation with authorities;- engaging in drug business with “bikies’ gangs”;- the extent of the appellant’s past drug manufacturing;- the appellant’s criminal record;- the appellant’s participation in a witness protection programme;- alleged bigamy;- a custody application in relation to the appellant’s son (with suggested perjury);- procuring Proctor to make a false affidavit;- drug use;- threats to a former de facto;- domestic violence;- association with an armed robber;- avoiding service of court process;- apprehended violence orders in relation to one of the appellant’s wives and children;- deceiving officers of the Probation and Parole Service with respect to marital status, accommodation, employment;- supplying drugs to young people at rock concerts. 
     
      
    195 The cross-examination of Proctor commenced with a suggestion that he was a “career fraudster” and proceeded to his criminal history (which was extensive). 
     
      
    196 It would be altogether too time consuming to attempt to refer to all of the matters raised in cross-examination of other Crown witnesses. It is obvious from the outline given above, and that given by Armitage DCJ, that the areas of cross-examination ranged from the serious to the relatively trivial. 
     
      
    197 The question is whether the conduct of the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, alone or in conjunction with other circumstances, warranted a grant of leave under s104(2). 
     
      
    198 In this context reference should also be made to s112 of the Evidence Act which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “A defendant is not to be cross-examined about matters arising out of evidence of a kind referred to in this Part unless the court gives leave.” 
        
       
      
    199 The “Part” is Part 3.8 of the Evidence Act, concerned with character. A question arises as to the meaning of “matters arising out of evidence of a kind referred to in this Part”; in Stanoevski v The Queen [2001] HCA 4; 202 CLR 115, the High Court declined to attempt to “harmonise” Part 3.8 with Part 3.7 (concerned with credibility, in which s104 appears). S110, also in Part 3.8, is concerned with evidence adduced on behalf of a defendant intended to establish good character, either generally or in a particular respect. One construction, probably the most obvious construction, of s112 is that it only prohibits cross-examination of a defendant about matters arising out of evidence called on his or her behalf to establish good character. Thus the discretion to grant leave to cross-examine a defendant about character does not exist and is not triggered, unless and until a defendant gives or adduces evidence of good character, either generally or in a particular respect. The alternative construction is that “evidence of a kind referred to in this Part” is character evidence, in which case leave could be given (subject to s192 considerations and ss135 and 137) whether or not the defendant has raised good character. If the latter is the correct construction, then s112 prohibits cross-examination on character whether or not the defendant has raised character, subject to leave being granted. If the former is the correct construction, then there is nothing (other than s102) that expressly prohibits cross-examination of an accused person in relation to previous criminal history. However, even on this construction, s112 is relevant, in my view, to show that the common law resistance to allowing evidence of prior criminal history is still relevant in guiding the exercise of the s104(2) discretion: see R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700; 144 A Crim R 1: Kevin William Phillips v The Queen [1985] HCA 79; 159 CLR 45. 
     
      
    200 After considerable hesitation I have come to the view that it was open to his Honour to exercise his discretion (in which I include performing the relevant balancing exercises) in the manner in which he did. In my opinion, the exercise involved a fine balancing of competing considerations. The evidence of the prior conviction was, in my opinion, likely to have been highly prejudicial to the appellant. (That prejudice was somewhat diminished by reason of the very different nature of the corruption offence from the offences with which the appellant was charged. It could not, therefore, have led the jury mistakenly to treat it as tendency evidence.) The evidence was also highly probative in relation to his credibility. In the ordinary course, it would seem to me that the danger of unfair prejudice created by evidence of a serious criminal conviction would substantially outweigh its probative value. However, that assessment has to be made in the light of the fairness considerations. I emphasise that it would not be every case where an attack is made upon the credibility of the Crown witnesses that would warrant the exercise of the 104(2) discretion to grant leave to cross-examine in relation to such a serious matter. Caution would have to be exercised in assessing overall fairness, and in the balancing exercises. Legal representatives of persons charged with serious criminal offences must have substantial flexibility in their approach to cross-examining prosecution witnesses, without fear that attacks on those witnesses, if made within proper limits, will expose their clients to the potential disclosure of their criminal histories, or alternatively, operate as a disincentive to their exercising the option to give evidence.  
     
      
    201 In this case a different judicial mind may have reached a different result. But this Court will not substitute its own discretion for that of the trial judge unless error in the exercise has been shown. Having regard to the nature of the attack, made particularly upon Simpson, but also upon each of the other indemnified witnesses, it seems to me that it was open to his Honour to come to the view that he did.  
     
      
    202 For these reasons I agree that ground 5 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      ground 8 
       
      
    203 As pleaded, ground 8 attacked the directions given in relation to the credibility of Simpson and a failure to put the defence case. In the written submissions filed on 21 June 2004 this ground was said to be not pressed and incorporated into ground 7. 
     
      
       
      ground 10: “unreasonable verdicts” 
       
      
    204 Before proceeding to a consideration of the matters raised in support of this ground, it is as well to repeat, yet again, the much quoted passage from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at [493]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard those witnesses. On the contrary, the court must give full regard to those considerations.” (internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    205 The attack upon the sustainability of the two verdicts of guilty was based upon the asserted unreliability as a witness of Simpson. Considerable weight was placed upon his acquittal on count 1, it being suggested that this should be read as a rejection by the jury of his credibility; it then being argued that that rejection should have translated to his reliability in his evidence on the two other counts. 
     
      
    206 The argument was put that Simpson’s evidence as to the Dooralong premises was uncorroborated but that this was not properly drawn to the attention of the jury. There was other evidence that the appellant had been present at the Dooralong house, including evidence that the appellant, with Simpson, was setting up the manufacturing process; but this evidence was given by witnesses who themselves had been involved and were therefore accomplices. It could not, therefore, it was argued, properly amount to corroboration. Indeed, a great deal was made of the question of corroboration. 
     
      
    207 Armitage DCJ gave these directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “I warn you specifically that the evidence of the person himself or herself involved in a criminal enterprise cannot be relied upon by the Crown to strengthen the evidence of another person himself or herself involved in that same enterprise. By way of one example only, the fact that Richard Simpson has given evidence that the accused was at the premises at Dee Why cannot be used to strengthen Georgina Phillip’s evidence that the accused was at Dee Why. ... I warn you that, where the evidence of a person or persons involved in the same crime or crimes as that alleged against the accused is relied upon by the Crown, it is dangerous to convict in the absence of strengthening evidence which confirms or tends to confirm the involvement of the accused. As I have said, the Crown submits that such evidence is before you in relation to the Sylvania Waters matter.” 
        
       
      
    208 In my opinion, the reference to the absence of corroboration, and the inability of accomplices to corroborate one another, is apt to mislead. By s164 of the Evidence Act common law rules that required corroboration in respect of certain offences (excepting perjury or similar or related offences) are abolished. The common law rule that an accomplice could not corroborate the evidence of another accomplice was directed to those cases in which corroboration was required. If, in relation to a charge in respect of which corroboration was required, the only evidence available to support the evidence of one participant in the crime was that of another participant, then, as a matter of law, the evidence would not sustain the charge. Notwithstanding the provisions of s164(3), this Court has held that:  
     
      
       
        
        “ ... the power and duty to [give an accomplice warning] in appropriate circumstances survives: see also s165(5): [ 
        R v Chen & Ors 
         [2002] NSWCCA 174; 130 A Crim R 300 at [57]].” 
        
       
      
    209 In a case in which a principal Crown witness was an accomplice the Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        “It became, therefore, incumbent upon the learned presiding judge to give the jury clear direction to the effect that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant, and his other co-accused, upon the uncorroborated evidence of that accomplice.” 
        
       
      
    210 In this case Armitage DCJ gave precisely the kind of direction that Chen mandates is still required. 
     
      
    211 It was not strictly necessary that Simpson’s evidence be corroborated. The evidence of the indemnified accomplices was evidence that supported his evidence in some respects. Their evidence was, of course, suspect, but this was adequately drawn to the jury’s attention, and there was no reason why the jury could not, if it saw fit, act upon that evidence. I do not accept that Simpson’s evidence in respect of the Dooralong count was uncorroborated, or that, even if it were, that is anything more than one consideration in relation to the sufficiency of the evidence in the Crown case. The direction given was unduly favourable to the appellant. There was no reason why the evidence of the indemnified witnesses should not have been used to support Simpson’s evidence, provided proper warnings were given (as was done) about the reliability of the witnesses. 
     
      
    212 The next point made in relation to the unreasonable verdict ground concerned the asserted “total unreliability” of Simpson. A number of factors were pointed to as affecting his reliability. These were put in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... He was an admitted serial perjurer, bigamist, lifetime criminal, and career illegal chemist with a tendency to lie.” 
        
       
      
    213 Also relied upon was an issue which had arisen concerning allegations that had been made against him many years in the past concerning sexual abuse of a stepdaughter. 
     
      
    214 Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in R v Ralph and George (1988) 37 A Crim R 202. There the Court allowed an appeal against conviction and entered verdicts of acquittal in a case in which essentially the entire Crown case was given through a witness who was an accomplice, a convicted criminal, involved in the importation and trafficking of narcotics, an admitted liar and one who was capable of clever deception. The majority of the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The conclusion which we have reached is that, because the quality of the evidence of Smith must necessarily be unacceptable unless corroborated in material respects (which it was not), it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of either of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    215 This is not a proposition of law, but a reason given by the Court as then constituted for finding a conviction, in the language then used, to be unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
     
      
    216 It cannot be used as a statement of general application. In the present case there were obvious questions relating to the credibility of Simpson and other witnesses. But these were all adequately dealt with and the jury was fully entitled, after giving due consideration to the evidence, to rely on the totality of the evidence to convict. 
     
      
    217 Another matter argued on behalf of the appellant was what was said to be “an inherent inconsistency and hence unreasonableness” in the verdict on count 2 in the light of the acquittal on count 1. The acquittal on count 1 was attributed to the jury’s apparent rejection of Simpson’s evidence. (It was conceded that count 3 was in a different position, presumably because the appellant was arrested at the location and the surveillance and telephone intercept evidence.) 
     
      
    218 I do not see any such “inherent inconsistency”. The first count alleged participation in the manufacture of a prohibited drug; the second and third counts alleged conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug. The first count thus depended on the Crown establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the drug was in fact manufactured. The second and third counts did not. Conspiracy was complete when the agreement was made and established when the agreement was proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    219 As will be apparent from the reasons given in relation to ground 3, there was a real issue about whether, at Dooralong or Sylvania Waters, the drug methylamphetamine had been manufactured out of the materials available. That, in my opinion, does not affect the proof of a conspiracy, even though the conspiracy was doomed to failure, but a question about the adequacy of the materials to produce methylamphetamine certainly affected proof of the elements of the first count. 
     
      
    220 Only the evidence of Simpson established that methylamphetamine was produced at Dee Why. That in itself is sufficient to explain the different verdict on count 1. 
     
      
    221 Applying the test in M, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury, upon the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. 
     
      
    222 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    223 I agree with the orders proposed by Santow JA. 
     
      
       
      
    224 SPERLING J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Santow JA and Simpson J. 
     
      
    225 I agree with Santow JA that grounds 3(A) and 3(B) should be rejected and with Simpson J that grounds 1(A), 1(B), 1(C), 2(A), 2(B), 2(C) and 10 should be rejected. I also agree with Santow JA in relation to sentence. 
     
      
    226 For the purpose of dealing with grounds 5, 7 and 9, I gratefully adopt the introductory observations of Santow JA and the resume of the evidence provided by Simpson J. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: His Honour erred in allowing the accused to be cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor as to: 
       
       
      (a) A police departmental charge of disobedience relating to a failure to make an occurrence pad entry. 
       
       
      (b) A police departmental charge of disobedience or a direction authorising a trip to Bali. 
       
       
      (c) Alleged threats made by the accused to Richard Simpson and Katie Ingall. 
       
       
      (d) A criminal conviction under section 186 Crimes Act. 
       
      
    227 In two judgments given on 6 December 2002, Armitage DCJ ruled, over objection by counsel for the appellant, that the Crown Prosecutor should have leave to cross-examine the appellant in relation to the matters referred to in ground 5 in the event that the appellant gave evidence.  
     
      
    228 The relevant provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 are, so far as is material, as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        102 The credibility rule 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Evidence that is relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not admissible. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        103 Exception: cross-examination as to credibility 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence has substantial probative value. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard in deciding whether the evidence has substantial probative value, it is to have regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        104 Further protections: cross-examination of accused 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section 103. 
         
         
        (2) A defendant must not be cross-examined about a matter that is relevant only because it is relevant to the defendant’s credibility, unless the court gives leave. 
         
         
        (3) …. 
         
         
        (4) Leave must not be given for cross-examination by the prosecutor about any matter that is relevant only because it is relevant to the defendant’s credibility unless: 
         
         
          
          (a) evidence has been adduced by the defendant that tends to prove that the defendant is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) evidence adduced by the defendant has been admitted that tends to prove that a witness called by the prosecutor has a tendency to be untruthful, and that is relevant solely or mainly to the witness’s credibility. 
          
         
         
        (5) A reference in subsection (4) (b) to evidence does not include a reference to evidence of conduct in relation to:  
         
          
           
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the events in relation to which the defendant is being prosecuted, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the investigation of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (6) …. 
        
       
       
        
        135 General discretion to exclude evidence 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        136 General discretion to limit use of evidence 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The court may limit the use to be made of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) be misleading or confusing. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
         
         
          
          In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
         
          
         
          
          (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the nature of the proceeding … 
          
         
        
       
      
    229 As at 6 December 2002, when his Honour made the relevant ruling, Crown witnesses had been extensively cross-examined. Many of those witnesses had received an indemnity against prosecution for extensive and serious criminal conduct, much of which was unrelated to the events in relation to which the appellant was being prosecuted. The cross-examination emphasised and, in some cases, brought out the criminal histories of these witnesses. It was important evidence tending to establish that the relevant witnesses had a motive to give evidence which would support the Crown’s case against the appellant. 
     
      
    230 In the first judgment of 6 December 2002, his Honour listed the instances of cross-examination of Crown witnesses relied on by the Crown Prosecutor in support of the application for leave to cross-examine the appellant. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        In support of his application pursuant to s104(4)(b), the Crown Prosecutor relies upon cross-examination of various Crown witnesses eliciting evidence which, he submits, does not fall within s104(5). The cross-examination upon which he specifically relies is as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Questions put to Robert Proctor in an effort to establish that he was a “career fraudster”, and other questions put to him in relation to a conviction for carnal knowledge. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Question put to Georgina Phillips, in response to which she conceded that she had forged documents for the purpose of obtaining a carer’s pension for her deceased mother. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Questions put to Trent Brown in relation to convictions he has for offences including break, enter and steal, escaping from lawful custody, assault, stealing, and receiving. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The tendering in evidence by the accused of the criminal records of Richard Simpson, Robert Proctor, Trent Brown and Georgina Phillips. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Questions put to Georgina Phillips concerning a shoplifting offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Questions put to Mario Marsh, a former detective, to prove that he was removed from the Police Force earlier this year because he had lost the confidence of the Commissioner. 
        
       
      
    231 In one other respect, it is necessary to record some of what had transpired in the trial prior to the ruling.  
     
      
    232 The Crown says there was an issue at the trial as to whether the police were “out to get” the appellant. In his opening statement to the jury which immediately followed the Crown’s opening address, counsel for the appellant is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        Why are the police so intent on prosecuting Mr El Azzi. You might think that he they want to silence him. As a Crown opened to you it was said that he was a cop. Knows too much, must be silenced. The police eat their own. 
        
       
       
      Counsel for the appellant was mistaken. Nothing of the kind had been said by the Crown Prosecutor in his opening address. Some such comment had been made in the opening address at a previously aborted trial. 
       
      
    233 The issue was in fact introduced by counsel for the appellant in the opening statement to which I have referred. It was then pursued by counsel in the cross-examination of Detective Willingham. The witness was asked by counsel whether he had a wish to silence the appellant by investigating and charging him. 
     
      
    234 I return to the judgments of 6 December 2002. The first judgment related to the two misconduct matters and the alleged threats. The second related to the criminal conviction. 
     
      
    235 In the first judgment, his Honour recorded submissions by counsel for the appellant (1) that the evidence sought to be led in cross-examination was not of substantial probative value as required by s103 of the Act, (2) that leave should not be given because it would be unfair if the relevant Crown witnesses could not be cross-examined for the purpose of revealing a motive to lie and (3) that, if the Crown was entitled to leave, the evidence should be rejected pursuant to s137 or s135. 
     
      
    236 As to the second of these submissions, the witnesses had, of course, already been cross-examined. The gist of the submission was that it would be unfair, in the circumstances of the case, to subject the appellant to the penalty of cross-examination as to credit on the ground that his counsel had undertaken a proper cross-examination of Crown witnesses as to credit. 
     
      
    237 His Honour was alert to the question of unfair prejudice arising from the evidence being allowed. He quoted the following passage from the decision of the High Court in Phillips (1985) 159 CLR 45, at 57-58. 
     
      
       
        
        It is right to stress the exceptional character of a case in which the credibility of an accused person is open to be attacked by reference to his bad character or previous convictions and it is undoubtedly right that the discretion of a trial judge to permit such an attack be sparingly and cautiously exercised. Although the purpose for which such evidence is admitted is confined to questions touching the credibility of an accused person and is not to be accepted by the jury as persuasive of his guilt of the offence charged and notwithstanding that the trial judge will direct the jury clearly as to the use to which the evidence may be put and the use to which it may not be put (cf.  
        Reg. v Beech 
         (1978) 20 SASR 410, at pp 420-423) there will always be a keen appreciation that the admission of the evidence may in the absence of countervailing considerations operate unfairly to his prejudice. The operation of the statute as construed in  
        Curwood  
        and confirmed in  
        Dawson 
         (1961) 106 CLR 1 will determine when the statutory discretion arises. When that occurs, the sole criterion governing its exercise is what fairness requires in the circumstances of the particular case. 
        
       
      
    238 His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        I am satisfied that the leave sought should be granted. The attack on all the important Crown witnesses was substantial and sustained, and it strayed into areas remote from the matters in issue. I am satisfied that evidence adduced by the accused has been admitted that tends to prove that witnesses called by the prosecutor have a tendency to be untruthful, and that is relevant solely or mainly to the credibility of those witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that in view of the defence contention that, in effect, the police were out to get the accused, it is appropriate that there be evidence before the jury of some incidents in the accused’s career. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the threats allegedly made by Mr Simpson and Miss Ingall, evidence of those matters is already before the jury. In my view, it is appropriate that the accused, if he gives evidence, be questioned by the Crown Prosecutor about those matters. 
        
       
       
        
        In coming to the view that leave should be granted in relation to certain areas of the proposed cross-examination, I have considered s192 of the Act. I do not consider that the proposed cross-examination would be likely to add unduly to the length of the hearing. It does not appear to me that the granting of leave is unfair to the accused. The evidence proposed is in my view important. I am fully cognizant of the nature of the proceedings, and I take that into account. 
        
       
      
    239 I do not read the first of the paragraphs quoted above as being critical of trial counsel for the appellant. In particular, I do not read the passage as a finding by his Honour that Crown witnesses had been cross-examined more extensively than was reasonably necessary or otherwise improperly. I read the reference to cross-examination straying into areas remote from the matters in issue as going to the inapplicability of subsection (5) of s104 and not as a finding of over-zealous cross-examination. 
     
      
    240 His Honour’s reasons for decision in the second judgment of 6 December 2002 (which related to the criminal conviction) were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Waterstreet submits I should not allow the cross-examination. It is his submission that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. I reject that submission. In my view the matter is of substantial probative value which is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        If the offence in question had in any way been drug related, the situation may well have been different. In my view I am not required to reject the proposed cross-examination pursuant to s317. In my view I should not reject it in the exercise of my discretion pursuant to s135. 
        
       
       
        
        In reaching the view I have about the matter I take into account the matters referred to in s192 of the Evidence Act. In particular, the extent to which, if I give leave, the cross-examination will be likely to add unduly to, or shorten, the length of the hearing; as to 192(2)(b), in my view there is no unfairness to the accused involved in the decision that I have made. Sub-paragraph 2(c), in my view the evidence is important. Again, I have regard to the nature of these proceedings. I take all those matters into account. 
        
       
      
    241 In the judgment, as recorded, there is a full-stop after “sub-paragraph 2(c)” in the passage quoted above. I have substituted a comma to convey the sense of the passage. 
     
      
    242 I will return to consider his Honour’s reasons for decision. It is first necessary to record how the trial then proceeded.  
     
      
    243 The appellant elected to give evidence. In his evidence in chief, the appellant said he had been a police officer. Relevantly, cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor was as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. And when you said you were once a police officer, you didn’t mean to convey that you had ceased to be a police officer? 
         
        A. Pretty much so. There was no hope of me returning to the service. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that was because you had been convicted for a certain offence, correct? 
         
        A. Not at that time. Not at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry? 
         
        A. Not at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You had been charged with a certain offence-- 
         
        A. Yes. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- of which you were subsequently convicted? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were charged that on 7 April 1994 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales you, William El-Azzi, did corruptly take a sum of money, to wit $4,500, upon account of helping Phillip Kenneth Cullen, Peter Farris and Matthew Klein to recover a quantity of sound and lighting equipment, which was stolen from the said Phillip Kenneth Cullen, Peter Farris and Matthew Klein, the said William El-Azzi not having used all diligence to cause the person or persons who stole the property, namely a quantity of sound and lighting equipment, to be brought to trial for the offence? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That was the charge? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were convicted? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you were ordered to serve a term of community service? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And while you were a police officer you were also subject to a couple of departmental charges which were sustained against you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. One being in December 1996, that departmental charge was disobedience and failing to make a -- 
         
        A. The incorrect year there. It was 86. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Apparently you may a mistake in the year. 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: What was the year? 
         
        A. 86 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry. That was a hearing before whom? 
         
        A. Before the Police Tribunal. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There was another departmental charge, wasn’t there, of disobeying a direction not to go on a holiday to Bali? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What year was that? 
         
        A. 1987. The allegation was in 87. The hearing was 89. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when did you finally leave the police force? 
         
        A. I resigned on 18 October 1996. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have heard evidence in this court firstly from Richard Simpson through his cross-examination alleging that you made certain threats against him? 
         
        A. I have heard this evidence, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that’s what happened isn’t it? 
         
        A. No it isn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You deny it? 
         
        A. I deny it emphatically. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have heard evidence from Katie Ingall in this court that when she was living in Granville with Mr Simpson you and Helen Simpson had come to the house and attempted to remove the fly screens? 
         
        A. What, sorry? Remove the fly screens? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you deny that? 
         
        A. Yes absolutely and I’m rejecting it, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Then you rang Miss Ingall and told her that you had rung her ex-husband and made certain threats there in that telephone call, didn’t you? 
         
        A. No that’s not true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you never threatened Richard Simpson with any physical harm? 
         
        A. Never him or Katie Ingall. Never threatened any of them. 
        
       
      
    244 The appellant was, so far as is relevant, re-examined as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        Waterstreet: Do you remember a question if not more about a trip that you took to Bali in 1986? 
         
        A. I think it was 87, April 87. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You recall that there was a question that you were charged departmentally, that is within your employer’s services, is that correct? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. With going to Bali without permission? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Had you in fact sought permission first of all from the appropriate medical authority in the police service, the police medical officer? 
         
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is this a photocopy – what is this document (shown)? 
         
        A. This is a report from the police medical officer Stewart G Anderson, Dr Stewart G Anderson addressed to the assistant commissioner of personnel dated 24 April 1987. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it a support for your application to go to Bali? 
         
        A. It is. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is this a document-- were you seeing a Dr O Thomas Stanley at the time? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did he make a recommendation that you have a vacation for two weeks? 
         
        A. Yes, away from my environment. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you take that advice? 
         
        A. Yes, I did, and I sought the consent of the police medical officer who was entrusted with our welfare and well being. 
        
       
       
        
        Waterstreet: I tender that. 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: I object to the tender. The question is whether he breached an instruction, an order. 
        
       
       
        
        EXHIBIT #AA REPORT BY THE POLICE MEDICAL OFFICER ADMITTED 
        
       
       
        
        Waterstreet: Were you in fact on sick report at the time you went to Bali? 
         
        A. I was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The second matter was a charge of not putting an occurrence pad entry in an occurrence pad when directed to do so by someone? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What year was that, do you recall? 
         
        A. The incident occurred on, form recollection, 6 or 7 May 1995. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that in respect of putting an occurrence pad entry in relation to a subpoena that had been served upon you? 
         
        A. Yes, sir, I was subpoenaed to go to court and take some documents with me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you in fact write a report about that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On or about the same day? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The next matter was that you were convicted of a s186 matter the gravamen of which was put to you, do you recall that? 
         
        A. Yes, I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That line of questioning, what were, in short, the circumstances? 
         
        A. I was helping recover some goods that were stolen. We though we had a lead to retrieve those goods back and in the process of doing so 41 police turned up and arrested me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you going to be paid if you were successful? 
         
        A. If at the end of the day if I got results I’d have got 500. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was it alleged or not that you had anything to do with them being stolen? 
         
        A. No, it had nothing to do with that at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you if fact you present the stolen goods to the police? 
         
        A. Once we discovered they were stolen we went down and reported them to the police station. 
        
       
       
        
        Waterstreet: Q. Would you have appealed that conviction - 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: I object you Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: I’ll listen to the question. 
        
       
       
        
        Waterstreet: Would you have appealed that decision had you any funds? 
         
        A. Of course I would have - 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: I object. 
        
       
      
    245 At the conclusion of the cross-examination of the appellant, his Honour gave the following instruction to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        Members of the jury, I think it is appropriate that I give you a very brief direction about the use you are entitled to make of certain evidence put before you before the lunch adjournment. 
        
       
       
        
        As you heard, the accused was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor about a conviction he has for a certain offence committed by him in 1994 to which he was sentenced for a period of community service. He was also questioned about two departmental charges, one in 1986, one in 1987; the first offence of alleged disobedience relating to his failure to make a note in an occurrence pad, the second relating to a holiday in Bali that he took without permission. 
        
       
       
        
        It is very important that you understand that that cross-examination was directed to the accused’s credibility only. I emphasise that the evidence is not to be accepted by you as in any way persuasive of the accused’s guilt of any one of the three charges that you are now considering, or as evidence the accused was likely to commit these particular offences. The evidence is there solely for the purpose of permitting you to assess the accused’s credibility if you think it is in fact relevant to his credibility. That is all I need say about it at this stage. 
        
       
      
    246 In his closing address to the jury, counsel for the appellant, pursuing the theme that the police were out to “get” the appellant, said of some of the surveillance police officers: 
     
      
       
        
        These are the men of the Drug Enforcement Agency. They are ruthless verbally, cops intent on promoting the Crown case at all costs, even to fabrication. 
        
       
       
      He also said: 
       
       
        
        The crusade to stamp out Mr El-Azzi has reached gothic and absurd proportions, you might think. It is, you might think, unfair to hand out undertaking after undertaking. It’s the purchase price of testimony by the biggest manufacturer in two decades, to a heavy criminal who established someone in the face without a care in the world, to fraudsters to drug sellers, to Social Security fraudsters, to conmen and conwomen in return for what? For perjury, you might think, self interest definitely. 
        
       
      
    247 In the course of his summing up to the jury, his Honour referred to the cross-examination of the appellant on matters going to his credit. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        Now the other matter in respect of which I am required to give you a direction is a matter that I referred to during the course of the evidence, but it is important that I repeat it. And that is a direction as to the use that you are entitled to make of certain evidence put before you relating to cross-examination of the accused. As you recall the accused was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor about a conviction that he has for a certain offence  
        [mistyped “defence”]  
        committed by him in 1994 for which he was sentenced to a period of community service. He was also questioned about two departmental charges, one in 1986, one in 1987. The first an offence of alleged disobedience relating to his failure to make a note in an occurrence pad. The second in relation to a holiday in Bali that he took without permission. It is very important that you understand that that cross-examination was directed at the accused’s credibility only. I emphasises that the evidence is not to be accepted by you as in any way persuasive of the accused’s guilt of any one of the three charges that you are now considering, or as evidence the accused was likely to commit these particular offences. The evidence is there solely for the purpose of permitting you to assess the accused’s credibility, if you think it is in fact relevant to his credibility.. 
        
       
      
    248 I can disregard the cross-examination in relation to threats allegedly made by the appellant. The cross-examination went no further than putting to the appellant matters which had been given in evidence by Crown witnesses. Nothing was established in the cross-examination in that regard which advanced the Crown case. The cross-examination cannot have caused or contributed to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    249 I return now to consider his Honour’s reasons for decision of 6 December 2002. 
     
      
    250 His Honour held, in effect, that the evidence intended, at that time, to be adduced in cross-examination satisfied the requirements of s103 and s104(4). On the appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted that it did not. 
     
      
    251 As for s103, a distinction needs to be made between the two misconduct matters, on the one hand, and the criminal conviction, on the other. The criminal offence was one involving serious dishonesty. It went to the appellant’s credit. As such, the evidence had substantive probative value. It satisfied s103.  
     
      
    252 His Honour appears to have allowed the misconduct matters to be brought out in cross-examination on a different basis. As quoted earlier, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        I accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that in view of the defence contention that, in effect, the police were out to get the accused, it is appropriate that there be evidence before the jury of some incidents in the accused’s career. 
        
       
      
    253 This approach was unsustainable. The evidence of misconduct did not go to answer the allegation that the police were “out to get” the appellant. The evidence did not detract from the appellant’s case (such as it was) on that issue. Involving no element of dishonesty, it did not go to the appellant’s credit. It was of no other probative value.  
     
      
    254 The evidence of prior misconduct did not satisfy the requirement of s103 and adducing that evidence ought not to have been allowed.  
     
      
    255 The criminal conviction is in a different class. As I have said, that evidence satisfied s103 as evidence going to the appellant’s credit. Counsel for the appellant on the appeal submitted, however, that the precondition for leave in s104(4) in relation to the criminal conviction was not satisfied.  
     
      
    256 I reject that submission. His Honour was correct in holding that s104(4) was satisfied in view of the cross-examination of Crown witnesses as to credit to which I have referred. 
     
      
    257 The only serious questions arising on appeal in relation to this evidence are, then, whether leave should have been granted to bring out the appellant’s prior conviction in cross-examination and whether the evidence should have been excluded pursuant to s135 and / or s137. 
     
      
    258 Did his Honour err in the exercise of his discretion in those respects? 
     
      
    259 The leading case is the decision of the High Court in Phillips (1985) 159 CLR 45. The appellant was charged with rape. He was tried in Queensland. At the trial, questions were asked which, it was held, impugned the character of the complainant. During the cross-examination of the appellant, the prosecutor applied for permission under s 15(2) of the Evidence Act 1977 (Qld) to ask the appellant about a number of previous convictions for offences involving dishonesty. Permission was granted. Previous convictions were brought out. The appellant was convicted. The Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal. That decision was upheld by the High Court. 
     
      
    260 So far as is relevant, the provisions of the Queensland statute were, in relevant respects, substantially the same as s 104.  
     
      
    261 On the hearing of the appeal in the High Court, counsel for the appellant advanced the proposition that the discretion under the statute to allow cross-examination of an accused as to credit should be exercised adversely to the accused only in exceptional circumstances. The High Court rejected that proposition, holding that the discretion was unfettered.  
     
      
    262 In so holding, however, the Court emphasised the importance of the consideration that allowing such cross-examination was an exception to the general rule that evidence of an accused person’s criminal history should not be adduced in a criminal trial. 
     
      
    263 In Brown [1960] VR 382, a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Smith J had said that, in the exercise of the statutory discretion, it was necessary for the trial judge to take into account considerations which included that the legislation was not intended to make the introduction of a prisoner’s previous convictions other than exceptional. In the joint judgment of the majority in Phillips (at 53) it was said that, notwithstanding that the discretion was unfettered, the considerations mentioned by Smith J provided a valuable guide which was likely to be relevant in most cases. 
     
      
    264 Their Honours also referred to a decision of the High Court in Matusevich 91977) 137 CLR 633. They said (at 54) that Brown and Matusevich rightly emphasised that, although the nature or conduct of the defence attracted the discretion, the primary exclusionary rule remained of importance in determining the manner of its exercise.  
     
      
    265 Victorian decisions which supported the general proposition advanced by counsel for the appellant on the appeal to the High Court were criticised as imposing a fetter on the exercise of the Court’s discretion (at 56). 
     
      
    266 Their Honours went on the say (at 57 – 58):  
     
      
       
        
        It is right to stress the exceptional character of a case in which the credibility of an accused person is open to be attacked by reference to his bad character or previous convictions and it is undoubtedly right that the discretion of a trial judge to permit such an attack be sparingly and cautiously exercised. Although the purpose for which such evidence is admitted is confined to questions touching the credibility of an accused person and is not to be accepted by the jury as persuasive of his guilt of the offence charged and notwithstanding that the trial judge will direct the jury clearly as to the use to which the evidence may be put and the use to which it may not be put, there will always be a keen appreciation that the admission of the evidence may in the absence of countervailing considerations operate unfairly to his prejudice. The operation of the statute as construed in  
        Curwood 
         and confirmed in  
        Dawson 
         will determine when the statutory discretion arises. When that occurs, the sole criterion governing its exercise is what fairness requires in the circumstances of the particular case.  
        (citations omitted.) 
        
       
       
      This passage, as we have mentioned, was quoted by Armitage DCJ in the course of his first judgment on 6 December 2002. 
       
      
    267 It was said by Gibbs J in Gramanatz [1962] QWN No 41 that, if the accused makes quite gratuitous imputations, accusations that are not necessarily involved in the proper conduct of the defence, the court will be more ready to exercise its discretion in favour of allowing cross-examination as to previous convictions or bad character than it would in a case where the accused, in making imputations against prosecution witnesses, is not doing anything more than presenting his defence in a proper way.  
     
      
    268 In the present case, there was no finding of impropriety in the way Crown witnesses were cross-examined and there is nothing in his Honour’s judgments to suggest that he was actuated by any such consideration. But nor was this a case where evidence of the previous conviction was especially prejudicial, as evidence of previous convictions goes; in particular, the offence charged was quite different from the earlier offence.  
     
      
    269 Relevantly, there was no special feature of the case which ought to have tipped the balance one way rather than the other. The trial judge appreciated that the essential question was one of fairness, that the prospect of prejudice to the accused was a critical consideration and that the exceptional circumstance which permitted an accused’s criminal history to be admitted into evidence was itself a relevant consideration.  
     
      
    270 In exercising his discretion pursuant to s104(2), his Honour was bound to take into account the considerations mentioned in s192. His Honour did not mention, in that connection, two of the matters he was required to take into account pursuant to the section, namely, prospective unfairness and the nature of the proceedings. However, it is apparent that his Honour was alert to those considerations. 
     
      
    271 The question for this court is not how it would have exercised the discretion to grant leave but whether the trial judge erred in the exercise of the discretion. I am not satisfied that he did err. 
     
      
    272 Although stated as a separate question, the considerations which arose in relation to s135 and s137 were not materially different from those which applied in relation to the grant of leave pursuant to s104(2). Again, minds may differ as to the appropriate course, but I am satisfied that his Honour did not err in declining to exclude the evidence of the prior conviction pursuant to either of those sections in the exercise of his discretion.  
     
      
    273 In summary, of the four matters as to which cross-examination was allowed, cross-examination in relation to the two instances of misconduct in the police service should not have been allowed, cross-examination on the alleged threats was innocuous and allowing cross-examination in relation to the prior criminal conviction did not involve an error in the exercise of the judge’s discretion. 
     
      
    274 In view of the error in granting leave to cross-examine in relation to the two instances of misconduct, the appeal against conviction should be allowed subject to the application of the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    275 I am satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice as a result of the error in allowing evidence of the two instances of misconduct to be brought out in cross-examination. These were not matters involving dishonesty. They involved no serious moral culpability. The trial judge instructed the jury immediately after the evidence was led and again in the summing-up that these and the other matters brought out in cross-examination were relevant only if the jury thought they were relevant to the appellant’s credibility. The two matters were not relevant to the appellant’s credibility, and so obviously not that I do not believe the jury would have accorded them any significance in that regard. Nor do I think there was any serious risk that the jury might have seen these episodes of misconduct as being of significance in any other impermissible way. In the broad view of the case, they were far too unimportant to be seen as significant in any way.  
     
      
    276 I would, for these reasons, apply the proviso to s6. 
     
      
    277 In the result, the appeal should not be allowed on this ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 6: His Honour erred in allowing the Crown to argue, and instructing the jury that they could find that the statement of the accused, that it was his first time at the premises, was capable of amounting to a lie. 
       
      
    278 This ground was not pressed. 
     
     
      
      Ground 7: The learned judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with questions of the potential unreliability of witnesses, particularly the witness Richard Simpson. 
       
       
      Ground 8: Failure to put the defence case and directions on the credibility of Richard Simpson. 
       
      
    279 As I have mentioned, ground 8 was not pressed otherwise than under ground 7.  
     
      
    280 It is necessary to have regard to s165 of the Evidence Act 1995 in relation to these grounds of appeal. The section provides as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        165 Unreliable evidence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) identification evidence, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person—evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
      
    281 The trial judge commenced his summing up on 17 December 2002. Prior to the summing up, there was discussion with counsel about the directions to be given to the jury. It appears from Tr 2661 that counsel for the appellant had handed up to the trial judge a draft of the directions sought on behalf of the appellant. (By agreement, I have been provided with a copy of that document.) So far as is material, it included the following. 
     
      
       
       8. Identification evidence direction. 
       
        
         
        9. In the circumstances, the full direction akin to prison informers (Pollit (1992) 174 CLR 558, Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 386). 
         
         
        10. In respect of the deceased Arthur Launt, the evidence is further unreliable for substantial reasons including the fact that he is deceased and unable to be cross-examined, he cannot be assessed by the jury and he gave his brief evidence at committal before he was dealt with by the Court. These circumstances are highly irregular and undermine his reliability. 
        
       
      
    282 Referring to that document, counsel said (Tr 2661): 
     
      
       
        
        I will be asking your Honour to give directions, strong, if not the strongest possible directions in relation to s165 in relation to each of these accomplices. 
        
       
       
      His Honour’s response was as follows. 
       
       
        
        I will give that direction. However, I should not be using the word “accomplices”. There is authority from the Court of Crimina Appeal that that word should not be used… You will have to wait and hear it, Mr Waterstreet. “The other people involved in the same criminal activity”, that’s what I will be doing, Mr Waterstreet.  
        
       
      
    283 It appears, therefore, that his Honour indicated, at that stage, that he would, so far as is now material, give the directions which were sought, subject only to a minor qualification which had arisen in discussion with counsel rather than from the document itself.  
     
      
    284 Early in the summing up, his Honour said (17 December 2002, pp8-9) 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown witnesses, those in particular who speak as to the alleged facts of the matter, have been attacked, quite properly so, by Mr Waterstreet on the basis that they have all been given undertakings not to be prosecuted. They all have an axe to grind, all had reductions in sentences, haven't been charged with certain matters, and so on. Broadly speaking, at this stage, that is what is involved there. As I indicated, in a short time I will give you much more detailed directions in relation to the evidence of those persons. 
        
       
      
    285 Before adjourning for the day, there was a break in the summing up during which the following exchange took place between counsel for the appellant and the trial judge (17 December 2002 at p19). 
     
      
       
        
        WATERSTREET: Your Honour, we have requested a warning under section 165 in relation to co-offenders. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You are going to get that warning in great detail, Mr Waterstreet. ... 
         
         
        WATERSTREET: Your Honour, I will wait. 
        
       
      
    286 On the following day, there was further discussion with counsel before his Honour resumed the summing up. The following is an extract (18 December 2002, p1), 
     
      
       
        
        WATERSTREET: Your Honour, arising out of what your Honour said yesterday, there’s just a couple of brief matters. Your Honour, one is your Honour’s statement that witnesses should not be put into categories was followed by your Honour’s suggestion that the Crown would say that the witnesses with an undertaking would be reliable, and I use “would be reliable” as my words, but your Honour’s words- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Waterstreet, you know as well as I do that I’m going to give them a very full direction in relation to that.  
        
       
      
    287 A warning relating to Crown witnesses who had received an indemnity came in the summing up on that day (18 December 2002, p20 – 27). 
     
      
       
        
        Members of the jury, at this stage it’s necessary that I give you a warning in relation to the fact that evidence was given in the Crown case by many witnesses criminally concerned in the very same crimes with which the accused is charged. This is a very important direction. You have heard evidence from many witnesses, all called by the Crown, who were themselves deeply involved in the criminal activities, the subject of the three charges in the present indictment. Many of those witnesses have extensive criminal records, the substance of which you have had pointed out to you in detail and many of them have admitted freely not only to lying about very many matters, including their own involvement in criminal enterprises, but they have admitted to lying on oath in court. Some of them admit to a great deal of criminal activity in relation to drug manufacture prior to the events with which we are here concerned, for which they have never been charged and for which they never will be charged. All of them have been granted immunity from prosecution if they tell the truth in these proceedings. I warn you as a matter of law that the evidence of those witnesses may be unreliable. The general reasons for concluding that such evidence may be unreliable include, first, such witnesses may try to exculpate themselves or minimise their part by fabricating or exaggerating the role of the accused. Second, such witnesses may fabricate evidence out of motives of revenge or antipathy towards the accused. 
        
       
       
        
         I warn you that particular concerns arise if the witness has received an immunity against prosecution. These considerations, combined with the fact that the witness will often be peculiarly equipped by reason of inside knowledge of the crime or crimes, to provide a convincing account implicating the accused, thereby necessitates considerable caution on your part. 
        
       
       
        
         Further, you must bear in mind that the reliability of evidence given by a witness in this category is affected if he or she has been given a discount on sentence as a result of an undertaking to give evidence against the accused and, if there is a failure to fulfil that undertaking, the sentence might be increased, and you’ve heard reference made to that. You’ve heard some of the witnesses in any event agree that they were given discounts and that they understand that if they don’t fulfil their part of the bargain, it may well be that the Crown would appeal and that their sentences might be increased. That would obviously be an incentive for the witness to give a version of the facts that he or she considers would meet the prosecuting authority’s approval. 
        
       
       
        
         Now I remind you of the position of each witness to whom this present warning applies. Mr Simpson was charged with certain offences. His evidence is that he was given a 20 percent discount for assisting the police. He has been granted an immunity from prosecution for any other offences previously committed by him. He has a criminal record and he agrees he has committed very many offences that do not appear on that record. He admits that he has lied on many occasions. 
        
       
       
        
         Kim Knight was convicted of an offence relating to Dooralong and served two years in gaol. He agreed that in 1999 he was approached by police who made him an offer he could not refuse. He said he has given evidence against various people including Mr El-Azzi. He said he was told by police that if he co-operated his girlfriend would not be charged with an offence relating to Dee Why and the police would help him in court. He said he was in fact fined $5,000 for his part in the Dee Why enterprise. He has been given an immunity from prosecution by the Attorney General. 
        
       
       
        
         Georgina Phillips. You will recall, she is still in a relationship with Kim Knight. She was given an undertaking by the Attorney General on 23 August 2000. She has made statements relating to Dooralong and Dee Why. She agreed the police told her that if she helped them she would not be prosecuted, and she agreed that in fact she has not been prosecuted. 
        
       
       
        
         Trent Brown was given an undertaking by the Attorney General that he would not be prosecuted for any offence if he gave truthful evidence against ten named persons, including Mr El-Azzi. It is fair to say that Trent Brown has an appalling criminal record, including firearm offences. He admitted his unknown criminal record consisted of about 30 drug manufacturing offences involving thousands of kilograms of prohibited drugs for which he has not been charged and does not expect to be charged. 
        
       
       
        
         Kathleen Simpson, formerly Ingall. Her position is that on 23 August 2000 she was given an undertaking by the Attorney General. She agrees she was involved in Dee Why and Sylvania Waters and she also agrees that she has not been charged with any offence. She conceded she has been involved in other criminal activity, including the leasing of a drug house. 
        
       
       
        
         Robert Proctor’s position is that on 23 August 2000 he was given an undertaking by the Attorney General. He conceded he was involved with Richard Simpson for about 11 years in manufacturing prohibited drugs at various premises. He said he was the one who bought the chemicals and he said he assisted Mr Simpson. He has a criminal record for offences such as larceny, embezzlement and false pretences. He agreed that when he was approached by the Crime Commission in March 1999 he was in a precarious position, being on bail for eight counts of embezzlement. He agreed that, after having a cigarette with Detective Seery, he was transformed from a defendant into a witness. 
        
       
       
        
         Members of the jury, those are the witnesses primarily relied upon by the Crown, apart of course from the police witnesses, and that is the position that each witness is in in regard to the granting of immunity. 
        
       
       
        
         I should say that Mr Launt falls into the same category. He was given immunity. His evidence may be unreliable and it’s necessary really that I emphasise this; this is important, very important in respect to Mr Launt. It’s a matter emphasised by Mr Waterstreet in the course of his address, quite properly. The defence of course was at a significant disadvantage in so far as Mr Launt’s evidence is concerned because he was not here to be cross-examined. Not only was he not here to be cross-examined, but you have had absolutely no opportunity at all of assessing his credibility … 
        
       
       
        
        … Now coming back to the warning that I was giving you a few moments ago in relation to the dangers associated with evidence given by persons themselves involved in the offence or offences with which the accused is charged. I indicate of course that that warning applies to the evidence of each of the witnesses that I have named. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
         It is of course open to you to look elsewhere in the evidence to see if there is something that strengthens the evidence of the seven witnesses to whom I have just referred by confirming or tending to confirm the involvement of Mr El-Azzi in the events as related by them. …. 
        
       
       
        
        … I warn you specifically that the evidence of a person himself or herself involved in a criminal enterprise cannot be relied upon by the Crown to strengthen the evidence of another person himself or herself involved in that same enterprise. By way of one example only, the fact that Richard Simpson has given evidence that the accused was at the premises at Dee Why cannot be used to strengthen Georgina Phillips’ evidence that the accused was at Dee Why. 
        
       
       
        
         That rule is based in large part on the common interest of such people, in minimising their involvement in the offence charged. That common interest raises the possibility that they may have conspired to give an identical but false account. 
        
       
       
        
         I warn you that, where the evidence of a person or persons involved in the same crime or crimes as that alleged against the accused is relied upon by the Crown, it is dangerous to convict in the absence of strengthening evidence which confirms or tends to confirm the involvement of the accused. As I have said, the Crown submits that such evidence is before you in relation to the Sylvania Waters matter. 
        
       
       
        
         Having said all that, bearing in mind the warning I have given, you are entitled to find the accused guilty of any one or more of the three charges if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you should accept the evidence and that the accused is guilty of the charge or charges. 
        
       
       
        
         This too is important, members of the jury. There is one further matter in relation to the evidence given by the six Crown witnesses who have each been granted immunity from prosecution. A moment ago of course I referred to seven. That was including Mr Launt. Mr Launt of course is no longer with us so I am back now to the evidence of the six Crown witnesses. As to each of them, there is evidence before you as to his or her character, reputation and conduct, in particular criminal conduct in which they have engaged and lies they have told, sometimes lies on oath. I direct you that you are entitled to use that evidence, if you see fit to do so, as proving that each of those persons does in fact have a tendency to lie. 
        
       
      
    288 This direction included a global warning in relation to the named Crown witnesses concerning the following factors: being an accomplice, immunity against prosecution and discount on sentence. In relation to each witness one or more of those factors was instanced. 
     
      
    289 Of the three factors mentioned by his Honour only one of them, namely, that the witnesses were a",2004-12-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 17 of August 2004 the prisoner, Richard Cleverly was convicted by a jury of murdering Susan Smith. The offence took place on the evening of the 3 July 2002. Susan Smith, then aged 42, was the prisoner's aunt, his mother's sister. She lived with another sister, Margaret, in a house at Mons Avenue West Ryde. The third sister, Helen Cleverly, lived not far away with her two younger sons, Michael and David. The prisoner, Helen Cleverly's oldest son, was at that stage living with his girlfriend Beth, again not far from his mother's home or from that of his two aunts. 
     
      
    2 Neither Susan nor Margaret Smith had ever married. They had lived together in the Mons Avenue house for about 20 years at the time of the killing. They were very self-sufficient and did little outside socialising except with family members. They both worked: Susan as an Administrative Assistant with Coles Myer at Chullora and Margaret as a Legal Secretary in a city law firm. They tended to be creatures of habit. Every morning Susan left for work at about 6.30 and Margaret about an hour later. Susan generally returned home at about 6 in the evening and Margaret at about 7. By the time Margaret arrived, Susan had generally had a shower, changed into her night clothes and commenced to prepare dinner for the two of them. They were both extremely security conscious, and kept the house thoroughly secured at all times. 
     
      
    3 On the evening of 3 July 2002, Margaret Smith arrived home at her normal time. The back door was ajar, and the house was in blackness. Both of these findings were most unusual. As it turned out, the power had been turned off at an outside electrical box, which had been forcibly broken open. Margaret went into the house and located a torch. She then found her sister's body, in her night clothes, lying face down on the loungeroom floor. She had no pulse. Margaret called triple-0 and in due course both the ambulance and the police arrived. A post-mortem examination conducted the next day showed that Susan Smith had died through ligature strangulation. The precise nature of the ligature has never been established. Presumably it was taken away by the killer. 
     
      
    4 The following day, 4 July, the police conducted a recorded interview with various family members including the prisoner, Richard Cleverly. In his interview, the prisoner gave a version of his movements the previous day which did not place him at or near his aunts’ home at Mons Avenue. At the conclusion of the interview the police sought and obtained his permission to take a DNA sample from him by way of a saliva swab. 
     
      
    5 Three days later, on Sunday 7 July, the prisoner asked to be re-interviewed by the police. A further recorded interview took place that evening. On this occasion the prisoner told the police that he had gone to his aunts' home at Mons Avenue early on in the evening of 3 July, before Margaret's return home, and had found his Aunt Susan's body lying on the loungeroom floor. He was not sure whether she was dead, he said, and he unravelled the fingers of her clenched hands and felt her fingertips which were cold. At about that point he said he heard a gate closing. He took fright and ran out of the house and back to his car. He said that he thought of calling the ambulance or the police, but was scared that he would be held to blame for the killing. He therefore went home and told no one about what had happened. 
     
      
    6 There were various aspects of the prisoner's account on this occasion which could not be reconciled with the objective evidence, particularly as to the timing of the killing and also as to the state of the house when Margaret Smith came home. In addition, forensic tests showed that fibres from a jacket which the prisoner had with him that evening were found on numerous parts of Susan Smith's clothing, and also on the electrical box, which had been broken into so that the power could be turned off. Even more significantly, DNA which could only realistically have come from the prisoner was found under the deceased's fingernails. Evidence given at the trial indicated that the prisoner's unclenching of the deceased's fingers would be most unlikely to explain this finding.  
     
      
    7 On 22 August 2002 the prisoner was charged with murdering Susan Smith. 
     
      
    8 In the meantime, some strange events had occurred. On the evening of 24 July, three weeks after the killing of Susan Smith, Margaret Smith was attacked from behind as she arrived home from work, and an apparent attempt made to strangle her. This was thwarted by the arrival of a neighbour, and the assailant ran away. He has never been identified. The prisoner has always denied being implicated in this assault, and he has never been charged with it. I mention it now only because it featured prominently in the evidence. I am certainly not taking this incident into account in any way in the sentencing of the prisoner. Three days later the prisoner himself was the subject of an apparent attack at his mother's home when petrol was poured over him. 
     
      
    9 In mid August 2002 the prisoner's mother received the first of a number of communications to herself or her family from an individual who ultimately identified himself exclusively as 'I2'. In fact, some strange correspondence had previously emanated from the same person, in connection with a problem the prisoner had experienced earlier that year with his then employer, Coles Myer. In the communications received after Susan Smith's killing, I2 clearly identified himself as the killer, and made various threats against the Cleverly family, particularly Richard. 
     
      
    10 Between August 2002 and March 2003 the prisoner was in custody. He was allowed bail in March 2003 and returned to live with his mother at Constitution Road, West Ryde. Whilst he was there, some strange events again occurred in and around the house, apparently the work of I2. 
     
      
    11 On 6 August 2003 when the prisoner was alone at home at Constitution Road with his youngest brother, David, a home invasion occurred. Various men wearing balaclavas and apparently carrying firearms broke into the house. They tied David up, and put a pillowslip over his head. They then proceeded to take a large number of items out of the house and put them into the two family cars, which were then driven off. In due course the prisoner also was left tied up with a pillowslip over his head. The letters I2 were painted on at least one of the walls of the house. A computer disk was left at the scene with a message from I2 saying: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The last laugh belongs to us. You have suffered dearly. Do not make it so more must be collected or more lives will perish. Watch your back we are watching.” 
        
       
      
    12 The two brothers Richard and David in due course extricated themselves, and the police were called. Somewhat surprisingly, David thought he could identify one of the culprits, even through the balaclava. It was a friend of the prisoner's, called Khalid Morton. The police then approached Mr Morton, and he admitted that the whole enterprise had been devised by the prisoner and himself. Mr Morton and one of the other intruders gave evidence for the Crown in the present case as to the prisoner's active involvement both in the planning and the execution of this crime. 
     
      
    13 Following this incident the prisoner was again taken into custody. As at today, he has been in custody for a total of 22 months and eight days. 
     
      
    14 The prisoner has always denied killing Susan Smith. He gave evidence at his trial in which he again asserted that he found the body of the deceased before Margaret Smith came home. He denied that any of the I2 correspondence emanated from himself with the exception of the letter left after the home invasion on 6 August 2003. He admitted his involvement in that invasion, saying that he was panicking because of a forthcoming bail review, and he was concerned to prove to the authorities that there really was a person calling himself I2 who was hostile to the Cleverly family. 
     
      
    15 On 17 August 2004, as already indicated, the jury found the prisoner guilty of murder. Subsequently he signed a form under section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in which he admitted to two offences relating to the home invasion on 6 August 2003, and asked that they be taken into account in sentencing him for the offence of murder. Those offences are: 
     
      
    16 First, an offence pursuant to s.319 of the Crimes Act 1900 that he did an act, to wit plan, organise and take part in an aggravated break, enter and steal at 112 Constitution Road intending to pervert the course of justice. 
     
      
    17 Secondly, an offence pursuant to s.86 (2)(a) of the Crimes Act that he, without consent, detained David Cleverly with the intention of obtaining an advantage, to wit, to legitimatise fabricated evidence to assist Richard Cleverly in a judicial proceeding, while he, Richard Cleverly, was in the company of Khalid Morton. 
     
      
    18 With this background, I turn to look at the prisoner's subjective features. He is still very young - not yet 21 years old, having been born on 12 January 1984. He was only 18 when he killed his aunt. His adult life had barely begun. The prisoner is the eldest of three boys. His parents separated when he was about 10 years old. His father moved to Queensland, and he lost contact with him for a number of years. He was brought up primarily by his mother. As she worked full time in a legal office in the City, much of his care was apparently undertaken by his maternal grandparents, with whom he was apparently very close. Both these grandparents died earlier in 2002; his grandmother in January, and his grandfather on 25 June, only eight days before the murder of Susan Smith. 
     
      
    19 The prisoner's childhood was fairly uneventful, although one incident occurred when he was twelve in which he displayed such extreme physical violence to a garage on his mother's property that she apparently reported the matter to the police and sought an apprehended violence order against him. He studied at West Ryde Public School and then at Epping Boys High School. His schooling was unremarkable. He was a reasonably good student and performed in the average to above average category. He was planning to complete his High School Certificate in 2001 and then undertake a Computer Engineering course at the University of Western Sydney. He had a longstanding relationship with his girlfriend, Beth, and got on extremely well with her parents. He and Beth had been living together for about 15 months before the murder of Susan Smith. 
     
      
    20 In May 2001, the prisoner sustained a severe closed head injury when he fell from a ladder at work. An MRI scan showed only very minor abnormalities, so he was discharged from hospital. However, it later became clear that he had suffered serious deficits as a result of this accident. His Year 12 results were disastrous. He was given special consideration for his HSC because of the accident, but was unable to complete the first semester of his university course. Psychological tests administered later in 2001 showed him performing at a level significantly lower than his pre-accident level in virtually all respects. His girlfriend, Beth, described him as having an explosive temper after the accident. 
     
      
    21 The prisoner has undergone further psychological testing over recent times for the purpose of this sentencing. 
     
      
    22 In summary, these tests show that his functioning has improved since the immediate aftermath of the head injury but he still suffers real intellectual, cognitive and memory deficits. These are, on all accounts, attributable to frontal lobe damage sustained in the accident of May 2001. 
     
      
    23 No personality disorder has been discerned in the prisoner, nor is there any finding of psychiatric illness, although it has to be said that no psychiatric report has been tendered. Dr Christopher Lemmings, a clinical psychologist, who saw him on 7 November 2004 noted that the prisoner's cognitive impairments were not such as to account for his behaviour. However he thought it likely that his cognitive impairments were also reflective of an impairment in emotional functioning. Such impairment may or may not have contributed to the offence, according to Dr Lemmings. He continued in his report and I quote: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “What is certain, however, is that Mr Cleverly would have been experiencing significant disruption of judgment at the time even if he had not been under stress.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     24 The prisoner continues to deny his responsibility for this offence, despite the very considerable strength of the Crown case. This effects his sentencing in two respects: First, it means that he cannot call upon remorse as mitigating the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    25 Secondly, it makes it very difficult to discern what it was that led him to commit this extreme act. On all accounts, he got on well with his two aunts. Indeed, on his own account, he related much better with Susan than he did with Margaret. The only possible motive which arose from the evidence was the suggestion that the prisoner might make an indirect financial gain from the death of Susan Smith. Indeed, given that the only things missing from the house after the killing were the two wills of Susan and Margaret Smith, and that the prisoner's palm print was found on the tin in which they had previously been contained, this hypothesis emerges as the only realistic explanation for this killing. It presents an extremely chilling picture, particularly as any financial benefit the prisoner might have hoped to gain through his aunt's death could only have been, at best, indirect, through his mother. 
     
      
    26 There are no mitigating features in the objective circumstances of this offence. This was, as the Crown submitted, a senseless killing of a vulnerable family member in what should have been the security of her own home. It was clearly premeditated; the prisoner took with him the necessary tools to break open the electricity box, so that he could attack his aunt in darkness. Nor was it a botched attempt to commit a lesser offence. The prisoner's intention when he strangled his aunt could have been nothing less than to kill her. Moreover, the prisoner displayed no apparent signs of distress or disturbance after the event. According to the evidence of his girlfriend, he returned home immediately after the killing, had a shower, and generally presented in a calm, normal manner, as he did any other evening of the week. 
     
      
    27 When questioned by the police he denied being anywhere near his aunt's home that day. One can only infer that the account he gave several days later, namely that it was he who had first found his aunt's body, was manufactured in an attempt to explain the forensic links between himself and the scene. 
     
      
    28 In the end, I must agree with the learned Crown prosecutor's submission that this offence falls at the higher end of the range of objective seriousness for murder. 
     
      
    29 There is no suggestion, however, that this is a case which calls for the maximum penalty of life imprisonment within the terms of s.61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown prosecutor did not seek such a penalty, and it is clearly not called for here, serious as this case is. 
     
      
    30 I have considered the terms of section 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and indeed of section 21A(2). There are few mitigating features in relation to this prisoner. His youth is clearly a matter to be taken into account on his behalf. So is the fact that he had no prior criminal record; although this cannot be afforded any major significance, given his youth and the extreme seriousness of this offence. I also take into account on his behalf the effects of the brain injury that he sustained the previous year. I have already referred to this matter. I accept that at the very least, it affected his judgment when he committed this offence. However, given the seriousness of the objective features of the offence, this cannot be regarded as a major ameliorating feature according to the evidence. 
     
      
    31 I cannot say, within the terms of section 21A(3)(h) that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation, notwithstanding that he is still very young. In this regard, the Crown prosecutor referred to the prisoner's attempts to lay a false trail by means of the mythical I2 culminating in the home invasion 13 months after the killing. The home invasion, of course, will be taken into account under section 32. The Crown rightly concedes that the prisoner's other attempts to deflect attention away from himself cannot be used as an aggravating feature. However the fact that he embarked on a lengthy and calculated plan to lay a false trail is, as the Crown prosecutor submits, and in my view correctly, relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    32 Given the absence of any apparent remorse on the part of the prisoner, combined with the essentially senseless nature of this killing, and the absence of anything in the psychological reports to explain how he could have deliberately and cold-bloodedly set out to kill his aunt, it is very difficult to assess the extent, if any, to which this man will pose a danger to the community upon his release from prison. There must be some fears in this regard. However, given the many unknowns in the circumstances of this crime, I cannot treat the possibility of his re-offending as a major feature in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    33 The victim's sister, Margaret Smith, read a very moving victim impact statement to the court during the sentencing process. The sequence of events surrounding the murder of her sister Susan has changed her life fundamentally and permanently. This is a tragic side effect of the prisoner's actions. However it, is not a matter which I am entitled to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence in this case, and I do not do so. 
     
      
    34 It is obvious that the prisoner must face a very long term of imprisonment. The joint requirements of protection of the community, retribution and deterrence demand nothing less in the circumstances of this case. In addition, in sentencing him for the murder of Susan Smith, I take into account the two offences relating to the home invasion on the 6 August 2003 which I have already detailed. Given the seriousness of these offences they must have some impact - although not relatively speaking, a major one upon the final sentence.  
     
      
    35 The offence having been committed in 2002, the recent amendments to the sentencing legislation have no effect. As at today, the prisoner has been in custody for a total of 22 months and eight days. This is obviously to be taken into account as part of his total sentence, and I propose to accommodate to it by backdating the commencement of his sentence to the 9 February 2003. No special circumstances have been shown which would warrant a departure from the normal non-parole period. 
     
      
    36 Richard Cleverly, I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of 24 years commencing on the 9th of February 2003. I set a non-parole period of 18 years from that date. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be the 8th of February 2021.

      70085/03 Regina v Richard CLEVERLY 
       
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 17 of August 2004 the prisoner, Richard Cleverly was convicted by a jury of murdering Susan Smith. The offence took place on the evening of the 3 July 2002. Susan Smith, then aged 42, was the prisoner's aunt, his mother's sister. She lived with another sister, Margaret, in a house at Mons Avenue West Ryde. The third sister, Helen Cleverly, lived not far away with her two younger sons, Michael and David. The prisoner, Helen Cleverly's oldest son, was at that stage living with his girlfriend Beth, again not far from his mother's home or from that of his two aunts. 
     
      
    2 Neither Susan nor Margaret Smith had ever married. They had lived together in the Mons Avenue house for about 20 years at the time of the killing. They were very self-sufficient and did little outside socialising except with family members. They both worked: Susan as an Administrative Assistant with Coles Myer at Chullora and Margaret as a Legal Secretary in a city law firm. They tended to be creatures of habit. Every morning Susan left for work at about 6.30 and Margaret about an hour later. Susan generally returned home at about 6 in the evening and Margaret at about 7. By the time Margaret arrived, Susan had generally had a shower, changed into her night clothes and commenced to prepare dinner for the two of them. They were both extremely security conscious, and kept the house thoroughly secured at all times. 
     
      
    3 On the evening of 3 July 2002, Margaret Smith arrived home at her normal time. The back door was ajar, and the house was in blackness. Both of these findings were most unusual. As it turned out, the power had been turned off at an outside electrical box, which had been forcibly broken open. Margaret went into the house and located a torch. She then found her sister's body, in her night clothes, lying face down on the loungeroom floor. She had no pulse. Margaret called triple-0 and in due course both the ambulance and the police arrived. A post-mortem examination conducted the next day showed that Susan Smith had died through ligature strangulation. The precise nature of the ligature has never been established. Presumably it was taken away by the killer. 
     
      
    4 The following day, 4 July, the police conducted a recorded interview with various family members including the prisoner, Richard Cleverly. In his interview, the prisoner gave a version of his movements the previous day which did not place him at or near his aunts’ home at Mons Avenue. At the conclusion of the interview the police sought and obtained his permission to take a DNA sample from him by way of a saliva swab. 
     
      
    5 Three days later, on Sunday 7 July, the prisoner asked to be re-interviewed by the police. A further recorded interview took place that evening. On this occasion the prisoner told the police that he had gone to his aunts' home at Mons Avenue early on in the evening of 3 July, before Margaret's return home, and had found his Aunt Susan's body lying on the loungeroom floor. He was not sure whether she was dead, he said, and he unravelled the fingers of her clenched hands and felt her fingertips which were cold. At about that point he said he heard a gate closing. He took fright and ran out of the house and back to his car. He said that he thought of calling the ambulance or the police, but was scared that he would be held to blame for the killing. He therefore went home and told no one about what had happened. 
     
      
    6 There were various aspects of the prisoner's account on this occasion which could not be reconciled with the objective evidence, particularly as to the timing of the killing and also as to the state of the house when Margaret Smith came home. In addition, forensic tests showed that fibres from a jacket which the prisoner had with him that evening were found on numerous parts of Susan Smith's clothing, and also on the electrical box, which had been broken into so that the power could be turned off. Even more significantly, DNA which could only realistically have come from the prisoner was found under the deceased's fingernails. Evidence given at the trial indicated that the prisoner's unclenching of the deceased's fingers would be most unlikely to explain this finding.  
     
      
    7 On 22 August 2002 the prisoner was charged with murdering Susan Smith. 
     
      
    8 In the meantime, some strange events had occurred. On the evening of 24 July, three weeks after the killing of Susan Smith, Margaret Smith was attacked from behind as she arrived home from work, and an apparent attempt made to strangle her. This was thwarted by the arrival of a neighbour, and the assailant ran away. He has never been identified. The prisoner has always denied being implicated in this assault, and he has never been charged with it. I mention it now only because it featured prominently in the evidence. I am certainly not taking this incident into account in any way in the sentencing of the prisoner. Three days later the prisoner himself was the subject of an apparent attack at his mother's home when petrol was poured over him. 
     
      
    9 In mid August 2002 the prisoner's mother received the first of a number of communications to herself or her family from an individual who ultimately identified himself exclusively as 'I2'. In fact, some strange correspondence had previously emanated from the same person, in connection with a problem the prisoner had experienced earlier that year with his then employer, Coles Myer. In the communications received after Susan Smith's killing, I2 clearly identified himself as the killer, and made various threats against the Cleverly family, particularly Richard. 
     
      
    10 Between August 2002 and March 2003 the prisoner was in custody. He was allowed bail in March 2003 and returned to live with his mother at Constitution Road, West Ryde. Whilst he was there, some strange events again occurred in and around the house, apparently the work of I2. 
     
      
    11 On 6 August 2003 when the prisoner was alone at home at Constitution Road with his youngest brother, David, a home invasion occurred. Various men wearing balaclavas and apparently carrying firearms broke into the house. They tied David up, and put a pillowslip over his head. They then proceeded to take a large number of items out of the house and put them into the two family cars, which were then driven off. In due course the prisoner also was left tied up with a pillowslip over his head. The letters I2 were painted on at least one of the walls of the house. A computer disk was left at the scene with a message from I2 saying: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The last laugh belongs to us. You have suffered dearly. Do not make it so more must be collected or more lives will perish. Watch your back we are watching.” 
        
       
      
    12 The two brothers Richard and David in due course extricated themselves, and the police were called. Somewhat surprisingly, David thought he could identify one of the culprits, even through the balaclava. It was a friend of the prisoner's, called Khalid Morton. The police then approached Mr Morton, and he admitted that the whole enterprise had been devised by the prisoner and himself. Mr Morton and one of the other intruders gave evidence for the Crown in the present case as to the prisoner's active involvement both in the planning and the execution of this crime. 
     
      
    13 Following this incident the prisoner was again taken into custody. As at today, he has been in custody for a total of 22 months and eight days. 
     
      
    14 The prisoner has always denied killing Susan Smith. He gave evidence at his trial in which he again asserted that he found the body of the deceased before Margaret Smith came home. He denied that any of the I2 correspondence emanated from himself with the exception of the letter left after the home invasion on 6 August 2003. He admitted his involvement in that invasion, saying that he was panicking because of a forthcoming bail review, and he was concerned to prove to the authorities that there really was a person calling himself I2 who was hostile to the Cleverly family. 
     
      
    15 On 17 August 2004, as already indicated, the jury found the prisoner guilty of murder. Subsequently he signed a form under section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in which he admitted to two offences relating to the home invasion on 6 August 2003, and asked that they be taken into account in sentencing him for the offence of murder. Those offences are: 
     
      
    16 First, an offence pursuant to s.319 of the Crimes Act 1900 that he did an act, to wit plan, organise and take part in an aggravated break, enter and steal at 112 Constitution Road intending to pervert the course of justice. 
     
      
    17 Secondly, an offence pursuant to s.86 (2)(a) of the Crimes Act that he, without consent, detained David Cleverly with the intention of obtaining an advantage, to wit, to legitimatise fabricated evidence to assist Richard Cleverly in a judicial proceeding, while he, Richard Cleverly, was in the company of Khalid Morton. 
     
      
    18 With this background, I turn to look at the prisoner's subjective features. He is still very young - not yet 21 years old, having been born on 12 January 1984. He was only 18 when he killed his aunt. His adult life had barely begun. The prisoner is the eldest of three boys. His parents separated when he was about 10 years old. His father moved to Queensland, and he lost contact with him for a number of years. He was brought up primarily by his mother. As she worked full time in a legal office in the City, much of his care was apparently undertaken by his maternal grandparents, with whom he was apparently very close. Both these grandparents died earlier in 2002; his grandmother in January, and his grandfather on 25 June, only eight days before the murder of Susan Smith. 
     
      
    19 The prisoner's childhood was fairly uneventful, although one incident occurred when he was twelve in which he displayed such extreme physical violence to a garage on his mother's property that she apparently reported the matter to the police and sought an apprehended violence order against him. He studied at West Ryde Public School and then at Epping Boys High School. His schooling was unremarkable. He was a reasonably good student and performed in the average to above average category. He was planning to complete his High School Certificate in 2001 and then undertake a Computer Engineering course at the University of Western Sydney. He had a longstanding relationship with his girlfriend, Beth, and got on extremely well with her parents. He and Beth had been living together for about 15 months before the murder of Susan Smith. 
     
      
    20 In May 2001, the prisoner sustained a severe closed head injury when he fell from a ladder at work. An MRI scan showed only very minor abnormalities, so he was discharged from hospital. However, it later became clear that he had suffered serious deficits as a result of this accident. His Year 12 results were disastrous. He was given special consideration for his HSC because of the accident, but was unable to complete the first semester of his university course. Psychological tests administered later in 2001 showed him performing at a level significantly lower than his pre-accident level in virtually all respects. His girlfriend, Beth, described him as having an explosive temper after the accident. 
     
      
    21 The prisoner has undergone further psychological testing over recent times for the purpose of this sentencing. 
     
      
    22 In summary, these tests show that his functioning has improved since the immediate aftermath of the head injury but he still suffers real intellectual, cognitive and memory deficits. These are, on all accounts, attributable to frontal lobe damage sustained in the accident of May 2001. 
     
      
    23 No personality disorder has been discerned in the prisoner, nor is there any finding of psychiatric illness, although it has to be said that no psychiatric report has been tendered. Dr Christopher Lemmings, a clinical psychologist, who saw him on 7 November 2004 noted that the prisoner's cognitive impairments were not such as to account for his behaviour. However he thought it likely that his cognitive impairments were also reflective of an impairment in emotional functioning. Such impairment may or may not have contributed to the offence, according to Dr Lemmings. He continued in his report and I quote: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “What is certain, however, is that Mr Cleverly would have been experiencing significant disruption of judgment at the time even if he had not been under stress.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     24 The prisoner continues to deny his responsibility for this offence, despite the very considerable strength of the Crown case. This effects his sentencing in two respects: First, it means that he cannot call upon remorse as mitigating the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    25 Secondly, it makes it very difficult to discern what it was that led him to commit this extreme act. On all accounts, he got on well with his two aunts. Indeed, on his own account, he related much better with Susan than he did with Margaret. The only possible motive which arose from the evidence was the suggestion that the prisoner might make an indirect financial gain from the death of Susan Smith. Indeed, given that the only things missing from the house after the killing were the two wills of Susan and Margaret Smith, and that the prisoner's palm print was found on the tin in which they had previously been contained, this hypothesis emerges as the only realistic explanation for this killing. It presents an extremely chilling picture, particularly as any financial benefit the prisoner might have hoped to gain through his aunt's death could only have been, at best, indirect, through his mother. 
     
      
    26 There are no mitigating features in the objective circumstances of this offence. This was, as the Crown submitted, a senseless killing of a vulnerable family member in what should have been the security of her own home. It was clearly premeditated; the prisoner took with him the necessary tools to break open the electricity box, so that he could attack his aunt in darkness. Nor was it a botched attempt to commit a lesser offence. The prisoner's intention when he strangled his aunt could have been nothing less than to kill her. Moreover, the prisoner displayed no apparent signs of distress or disturbance after the event. According to the evidence of his girlfriend, he returned home immediately after the killing, had a shower, and generally presented in a calm, normal manner, as he did any other evening of the week. 
     
      
    27 When questioned by the police he denied being anywhere near his aunt's home that day. One can only infer that the account he gave several days later, namely that it was he who had first found his aunt's body, was manufactured in an attempt to explain the forensic links between himself and the scene. 
     
      
    28 In the end, I must agree with the learned Crown prosecutor's submission that this offence falls at the higher end of the range of objective seriousness for murder. 
     
      
    29 There is no suggestion, however, that this is a case which calls for the maximum penalty of life imprisonment within the terms of s.61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown prosecutor did not seek such a penalty, and it is clearly not called for here, serious as this case is.

    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal pursuant to provisions of s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 2 The applicant has been indicted on two charges. First, that he did break and enter a building and did steal certain property, contrary to the provisions of s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Secondly, that he did maliciously damage property by fire, contrary to s 195(6) of the Crimes Act 1900. 3 In an interlocutory application to the District Court, the applicant raised the topic of intoxication and particularly sought the court to consider whether he was entitled to the benefit of Pt 11A of the Crimes Act, on the basis that each of the offences with which he stood charged was an offence involving specific intent, within the meaning of that Part. If that were the case, then he would be entitled to the benefit of s 428C of the Crimes Act 1900 to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence that a person was intoxicated (whether by reason of self-induced intoxication or otherwise) at the time of the relevant conduct may be taken into account in determining whether the person had the intention to cause the specific result necessary for an offence of specific intent.” 
        
       
      
    4 Blackmore DCJ heard argument on this matter and rejected the proposition for which the applicant contended before his Honour and for which the applicant continues to contend in this court. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having considered the submissions of the accused in my view no basis has been shown for him to rely on intoxication as a defence to either of the charges in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    5 His Honour made no order. The submission in this court is that his Honour's reasons for decision constituted a judgment within the meaning of s 5F of the Act. Mr G Wendler, who appeared for the applicant, submitted that his Honour's judgment involved a final legal ruling on a discrete legal controversy which had arisen in the proceedings. Mr Wendler submitted that, in effect, what his Honour had done was to make a declaration that s 428C does not apply to ss 195(6) or 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 6 There is no such declaration. In my view, what Blackmore DCJ did on the application of the applicant was no more than to indicate what he would do, if he were the trial judge, if evidence of intoxication were sought to be adduced over objection, or if such evidence was otherwise before the court, what direction he would give to the Jury on the issue of intention. It is clear that if his Honour was the trial judge that he would, in the latter case, direct the Jury that intoxication was not able to be taken into account on the issue of intention, on the basis that neither of the offences with which the applicant was charged was an offence of specific intent. 7 This, in my opinion, is not a judgment or order within s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. It does not have the requisite element of finality in terms of resolving an issue in the proceedings in a binding manner. It is closely analogous, in my opinion, to the admission of evidence. Indeed one of the two ways in which the conclusion to which Blackmore DCJ came could, in fact, be applied would be on a ruling relating to evidence of intoxication, if it were sought to be adduced over objection. 8 It is now well established that evidential rulings are not interlocutory judgments or orders within the meaning of s 5F. (See the list of authorities set out and considered in R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633, especially at 636 to 639.) 9 In my opinion, the application for leave should be dismissed.10 DUNFORD J: I agree.11 HIDDEN J: I agree.12 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the court is as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The Court is in a position to give judgment and I ask Mr Justice James to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Anthony Denholm has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 21 November 2003 by his Honour Judge Urquhart for an offence, that on or about 12 October 2001 he supplied a prohibited drug being not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine, of which the applicant had been found guilty at a trial before Judge Urquhart and a jury. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for six years commencing on 22 October 2003, when the jury returned its verdict of guilty, with a non-parole period of four years. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for twenty years and/or a fine of $385,000. Having regard to the date of the offence, the standard non-parole period for an offence of that kind was not applicable. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was one of three co-offenders who were sentenced by Judge Urquhart. Another offender Matthew Glen Keller had stood trial in the same trial as the applicant and had been found guilty of the same offence. The other offender Shannon Leslie Purdie, who was to have stood trial in the same trial, did not appear at the trial and was subsequently sentenced for an offence, to which he pleaded guilty, of knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine. 
     
      
    4 For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug being not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine, Judge Urquhart sentenced Keller to imprisonment for eight and a half years, commencing 22 October 2003, with a non-parole period of five years four months. For the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine, Judge Urquhart sentenced Purdie to imprisonment for five years nine months, with a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 24 October 2003, the day on which Purdie was arrested, after returning to Australia. In sentencing Purdie Judge Urquhart took into account a discrete period of pre-sentence custody which Purdie had served between 20 June 2002 and 20 December 2002. 
     
      
    5 Earlier today the Court heard and determined an application by Purdie for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him. The Court granted Purdie leave to appeal and allowed his appeal against sentence, to the extent of quashing the non-parole period set by Judge Urquhart of four years and substituting therefor a non-parole period of three years three months. In arriving at its decision on the application by Purdie the Court decided that the non-parole period which should be set was 60 percent of the total sentence. 
     
      
    6 In his remarks on sentence in sentencing the applicant Denholm Judge Urquhart summarised the objective facts in a way which has not been the subject of any criticism on this application. At pages 2 to 4 of his Honour’s remarks his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the afternoon of 12 October 2001 the offender Denholm was arrested by the Australian Federal police officers at Sydney central railway station. He had with him a back pack within which was found in one packaged lot 505.5 grams of cocaine of a 67.4 percent purity. The offender had been the subject of some surveillance by Australian officers of the Australian Federal Police earlier that day although that surveillance was not constant. Apart from the surveillance on 12 October the investigation established that the offender had travelled from Melbourne to Sydney the day before by aeroplane and had been in contact with the offender Keller by phone on 11 and 12 October. The investigation also established that the offender Keller had been in contact prior to that with a Shannon Purdie and that such phone contact continued into 11 and 12 October. The investigations included phone conversations lawfully intercepted and recorded. 
        
       
       
        
        All of that being said, however, it is important to note that the offender Denholm is to be sentenced for the offence of which he has been found guilty and that may better be understood and appreciated by briefly stating the criminal enterprise as to which the 505.5 grams of cocaine related. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender Keller and the man Shannon Purdie discussed and negotiated the purchase of a kilogram of cocaine. Purdie was to find a seller. Those discussions and negotiations reached a station where a seller was found and the handing over of cocaine and money therefore was necessary. It was within that handing over aspect that the offender Denholm had a role. He and Keller had been friends for many years and although Denholm had secure employment and a good trade in the printing industry he had taken some leave and during that leave period assisted Keller in some jobs around Keller’s home. He accepted another job from Keller, however, and that was to travel to Sydney taking with him cash and to bring back to Melbourne from Sydney, for Keller, cocaine”.  
        
       
      
    7 In his remarks on sentence Judge Urquhart noted that when Denholm left Melbourne he had more than $40,000 in cash and that when arrested in Sydney he had a backpack which in fact contained the cocaine. His Honour remarked that the jury must have rejected Denholm’s case at the trial that he had the cash for a purpose other than a drug transaction and that he had not been aware that the cocaine had been put into the backpack. 
     
      
    8 His Honour commented at p 6 of his remarks on sentence that: 
     
      
       
        
        ”Clearly the jury had no reasonable doubt that Denholm had come from Melbourne to Sydney on a job for Keller to hand over $40,000.00 and to collect not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. He, in fact, collected 505.5 grams of cocaine. The commercial quantity for cocaine is 250 grams”. 
        
       
      
    9 In his remarks on sentence Judge Urquhart addressed the question of the role played in the criminal enterprise by the applicant. His Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the offender Denholm I am not satisfied that he had much more of a role than that of courier. His role did include the delivery of cash, the waiting around and the intended return. It was not restricted to collecting the backpack”. 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour noted that there was no evidence before him of what the applicant received or was to receive for his participation in the enterprise. However, his Honour said that in his view there was to be some benefit to the applicant but his Honour said that he did not propose to say any more than that any such benefit should be regarded as having been “quite small”. 
     
      
    11 As regards the subjective circumstances of the applicant, his Honour noted that the applicant was born on 13 November 1964 and had just turned 39 at the time of sentence; that apart from a minor offence committed many years before he had no criminal antecedents; that he resided in Victoria; that he had considerable family support; that he was in a stable relationship with a woman; that he had completed an apprenticeship and had been continuously employed as a lithographer and that his last employer had regarded him as a trusted employee; that in the proceedings on sentence there were many testimonials to the applicant’s good character; and that the applicant was not a user of prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    12 His Honour concluded that all the material before him confirmed that the applicant’s participation in the criminal venture had been a one-off involvement and the benefit to the applicant had been quite small. His Honour observed that the absence of criminal antecedents, the applicant’s previous good character and the applicant’s good employment history were to be taken into account in his favour. 
     
      
    13 On the other hand, having stood trial, the applicant was not entitled to any discount such as he would have received if he had pleaded guilty, and, not having shown any contrition, he was not entitled to any discount on the grounds of having shown contrition. On the basis of the applicant’s age, his strong support network of family and friends, the absence of criminal antecedents and the appellant’s previous good character, his Honour found that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation; and also found that the same circumstances amounted to special circumstances within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    14 On this application two grounds of appeal were relied on, namely, (1), that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance, given the penalties imposed on the co-offenders and (2) the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    15 In support of both grounds of appeal counsel for the applicant relied on the sentencing judge’s findings about the role of the applicant, that the applicant was not much more than a courier and that any benefit that he received from his participation in the criminal venture was quite small. 
     
      
    16 In sentencing Keller Judge Urquhart found that Keller was the principal, that Keller had discussed with Purdie the purchase of one kilogram of cocaine for the price of $140,000, that Keller’s motive was monetary gain for himself, that Keller had provided $40,000 of the purchase price and that Keller had had discussions about the on-sale of the cocaine. In sentencing Purdie his Honour found that his role was to find a vendor of cocaine, to negotiate the financial aspect of the sale, to receive the purchase money from the applicant and to pass the purchase money on to the vendor, who was to hand the drugs over to the applicant, who was then to deliver the drugs to Keller for on-supply by Keller. Purdie himself had contributed $20,000 of the purchase price. 
     
      
    17 His Honour found that the criminality of the applicant was less than the criminality of Purdie, which in turn was less than the criminality of Keller. 
     
      
    18 It was submitted that the applicant had strong subjective circumstances and that there was no real distinction between the subjective circumstances of the applicant and those of Keller. They were of similar ages, had minor or negligible criminal records and both had been found by Judge Urquhart to have good prospects of rehabilitation and to be unlikely to re-offend. Keller had a past history of successfully carrying on legitimate businesses and the applicant had a good employment record. 
     
      
    19 It was submitted that Purdie’s subjective features were different. He was younger and had a history of alcohol and drug abuse and had a criminal history, although all of his offences had been dealt with by fines or bonds and his criminal history did not include any drug offences. 
     
      
    20 As regards ground 1, it was submitted that, although the sentences passed by his Honour did to some extent reflect the differences in the objective criminality of the offenders, the sentences did not properly reflect those differences and a greater disparity was required between the sentence passed on Keller and the sentence passed on the applicant, in order that the sentences should be properly proportional to the different degrees of criminality.  
     
      
    21 As regards ground 2, it was submitted that, having regard to his Honour’s findings about the objective criminality of the applicant and the applicant’s strong subjective case and sentencing statistics kept by the Judicial Commission, the sentence passed on the applicant should be regarded as manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    22 I do not consider that these submissions should be upheld. 
     
      
    23 As regards the second ground of appeal, that is, that the sentence passed was manifestly excessive, the criminal enterprise in which the applicant participated was serious, being the intended purchase of one kilogram of cocaine for a price of $140,000. The role of the applicant was taking a sum of $40,000 from Melbourne to Sydney, handing over the money to Purdie, receiving the cocaine and transporting the cocaine to Melbourne. Even allowing for the applicant’s subjective case, I do not consider that the sentence passed by Judge Urquhart on the applicant exceeded the upper limit of a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    24 It is to be recalled that the applicant pleaded not guilty and stood trial, and the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission for sentences passed on offenders who had pleaded not guilty to this kind of offence were limited to three instances. The sentence passed on the applicant was in the middle of the sentences passed in those instances. 
     
      
    25 As regards the first ground of appeal, his Honour was clearly mindful of the need to impose sentences on the various offenders which reflected the differences in their objective criminality and any differences in their subjective features. The sentences imposed by his Honour on the applicant, Purdie and Keller correctly reflected the need to impose a less severe sentence on the applicant than on either Keller or Purdie. His Honour had a wide discretion in determining what would be the extent of the difference between the sentence passed on the applicant and the sentence passed on Keller. 
     
      
    26 As I indicated previously, the Court earlier to-day heard and allowed to a limited extent the appeal by Purdie against the sentence passed on him. Naturally, counsel for the present applicant sought to derive some advantage from the success of a co-offender. However, a comparison between the sentence passed on the applicant and the sentence passed on Purdie, and particularly a comparison of the non-parole periods of the two sentences, is made more difficult by the circumstances that Purdie, unlike the applicant, pleaded guilty, albeit belatedly, and received a discount for his plea of guilty; and that Purdie, unlike the applicant, was found by his Honour to have demonstrated contrition for his wrongdoing, and received a discount for the contrition he had shown. In his remarks on sentence in sentencing the applicant his Honour expressly noted that the applicant was not entitled to any discount on either of those grounds. Furthermore, unlike the applicant, who was released on bail almost immediately after being arrested and remained at liberty on bail until he was found guilty by the jury, Purdie served a discrete period of pre-sentence custody of six months, which had to be taken into account in determining both the head sentence and the non-parole period set for Purdie. In accordance with what the Court considers to be the correct procedure, the Court, when setting a non-parole period in re-sentencing Purdie, deducted the full term of the pre-sentence custody from the putative non-parole period, in order to arrive at the non-parole period which was ultimately set. 
     
      
    27 I have come to the conclusion that, although the applicant’s application for leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the applicant’s appeal against sentence should, except in one respect, be dismissed. The respect in which I consider that the applicant’s appeal against sentence should succeed, lies in the setting of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    28 As I have stated earlier in this judgment, the Court decided that in re-sentencing Purdie the Court should set a non-parole period equivalent to 60 percent of the head sentence. The non-parole period set by his Honour Judge Urquhart in sentencing the present applicant was 662/3 percent of the head sentence. Although it could be argued that a proportionally greater parole period should be set for Purdie, because of his greater need for a period of supervised liberty in which to overcome his addiction to alcohol and drugs, I consider that the present applicant Denholm would have a justifiable sense of grievance, if the non-parole period of his sentence remains at 662/3 percent of the head sentence. 
     
      
    29 I would accordingly allow the appeal against sentence by the present applicant, to the extent of quashing the non-parole period set by Judge Urquhart and substituting a non-parole period equivalent to 60 percent of the head sentence. 
     
      
    30 Accordingly, I consider that the application for leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be allowed to the extent of quashing the non-parole period set by Judge Urquhart of four years and substituting a non-parole period of three years seven months, being approximately 60 percent of the head sentence. Otherwise, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed. The earliest date on which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole would be three years and seven months from 22 October 2003, which is 21 May 2007. 
     
      
    31 GROVE J: I agree with Mr Justice James and the orders of the Court will be as proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: The applicants, Aaron John Lee Maher, Dwayne Eric Welsh, Craig Vincent Lardner and Ronald Priestly each seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on them by his Honour Judge Shadbolt in the District Court at Sydney on 12 and 17 December 2003 following their pleas of guilty to riot contrary to s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900; and in the case of the applicant Priestly, a further charge of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the same Act. 2 The applicants were all prisoners involved in a riot at Goulburn Gaol on 16 April 2002. The applicants Lardner, Maher and Welsh were each sentenced to imprisonment expressed by his Honour as “one year’s imprisonment of a total of 4 years” cumulative on the sentences they were then currently serving, whilst the applicant Priestly was sentenced to imprisonment for “two years with a total sentence of four” for riot and “12 years of a total of 16 years” for maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, such sentences also cumulative on those he was already serving and cumulative on each other. When I say cumulative on other sentences, I mean cumulative on the non-parole periods of the other sentences. 3 The applicant Priestly was sentenced along with a co-offender, James Sonny Paulson, on 12 December 2003 and the others along with co-offenders Barker and Mansfield on 17 December 2003. 4 His Honour’s extensive Remarks on Sentence on each occasion, insofar as they dealt with the circumstances of the offences, approach to sentencing generally and in respect of riot in particular, were virtually identical and only varied when dealing with the additional charges laid against Priestly and also Paulson. 5 Before proceeding further, it should be noted that in expressing the sentences in the way in which he did, his Honour appears to have had in mind s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in its current form as introduced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, No 90 but the amendments to s 44 effected by that Act only apply in respect of offences committed after 1 February 2003 although the amendments to s 21A apply to sentencing after that date irrespective of when the offence was committed. 6 In the circumstances of this case his Honour should therefore have first fixed the term of the sentence (the head or total sentence) and then the non-parole period. In each case his Honour summarised the facts as follows. 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The circumstances giving rise to these offences were that at 3:30pm on Wednesday 16 April 2002 the prisoners, with 29 other inmates of unit 4 at Goulburn Prison, were mustered. They were to enter the unit where they were to receive their food and be locked in their cells. The unit comprises two floors with a walkway on the first with a single staircase leading from the ground floor to that walkway. Mesh extended across the void and there was a central walkway at the head of the stairs which went from one side of the cell block to the other.  
         
         
        There had been a general practice not to require inmates to enter their cells immediately on arriving at them, but to permit them five minute’s grace to wander from cell to cell, making final arrangements before locking them down for the afternoon and night. Officer Madden recalls a different tone to the behaviour of the inmates and more noise than usual as they entered the cell block that afternoon and ascended the staircase. 
         
         
        All officers were present on the walkway to supervise the prisoners. They were Sharon Madden and Robert Hursey who took up their posts at one end and Timothy Swain and Anthony Marks who took up their position at the other. 
         
         
        The situation had then been engineered that the four officers in pairs, separated by the length of the cell block, were together separated from all other officers by a narrow staircase with a metal sliding gate at its head, with a total muster of prisoners now commanding that staircase. 
         
         
        At this stage the prisoner Paulson ran across the wire mesh and, arriving at the position where Officers Hursey and Madden stood, assaulted them with a didgeridoo. In this assault, Mr Hursey was knocked unconscious. Officer Madden lay on top of him to protect him but was also hit by Paulson with the didgeridoo, which had now become in his hands an offensive weapon, which he wielded in a pile-driving fashion. 
         
         
        Other inmates joined in this attack and kicked both officers but one prisoner, Severn, pulled Ms Madden into a cell telling her to hide under the bed. He told her he was not going to hurt her and left the cell and locked her in. It was here that she remained for the rest of the riot. 
         
         
        Immediately the riot commenced, Officers Marks and Swain ran down the landing towards their injured colleagues. Inmates emerged from several cells and Mr Swain was knocked to the floor. As he lay there he was struck by a number of inmates who were armed with weapons. Officer Marks tried to assist Mr Swain but he himself was struck on the head and fell to the ground. Paulson, who had by this time travelled form one end of the cell block to approximately the middle, struck Mr Swain with his didgeridoo and the prisoner Davis struck him with a wooden table leg. The prisoner Priestly jumped from the railing on to his head and repeatedly kicked him and stomped on him. These blows to the head rendered him unconscious. Officer Marks who was doing his best to protect Mr Swain was struck on the back of the head with a table leg wielded by Davis. 
         
         
        The prisoner Davis was not alone in his efforts. Other inmates were joining in this attack, but Davis was seen to kick both officers in what was described as a frenzy. 
         
         
        Prison officers including the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) had by this time arrived and were attempting to climb the only flight of stairs. They were opposed by prisoners who threw tables, liquid bleach, mops and other items on top of them and drove them back. Officers had, however, grabbed one inmate whom they brought down the stairs with them in their retreat.  
         
         
        At this stage other better armed officers arrived. One of the officers, Mr Preston, described the use by gas by Officer Simpson and almost immediately the rioters backed off to cells where they were immediately locked down. 
         
         
        The riot had lasted five or six minutes but it sequel was disastrous for the four officers who had been trapped. Officer Swain suffered severe brain damage which has left him dysphasic and suffering from dyspraxia. He has been rendered totally incapable of reading and writing. He can speak only in the most limited manner and then, hesitatingly. His intelligence has been severely reduced. He is capable now of little more than minor domestic tasks. Never more clearly has the effect on collateral victims of crime been demonstrated. Not only is his life utterly shattered but also the lives of those around him who must care for him in the coming years. 
         
         
        Sharon Madden has suffered from deep depression and post-traumatic stress disorder to a particularly grave degree. Officer Marks was severely wounded and concussed and he too has suffered grave psychological injury.  
         
         
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the events that day were planned. A lock in a gate leading from the cell block to the riot gear store had been spiked with a piece of wood. Weapons in the form of table legs were to hand and there was no particular incident which might have been regarded as the spark which ignited smouldering discontent.” 
         
        
       
      
    7 His Honour then referred to the underlying causes of the riot by way of background and the parts played by each of the offenders in the riot, a subject to which I shall return in due course. He also considered their past records which he found in each case disentitled them to any leniency and provided little hope of rehabilitation, and took into account their personal backgrounds and circumstances, including their aboriginality in each case. 8 At p 19 of his Remarks on Sentence on 17 December his Honour noted that since the riot all the applicants had been kept in the Special Purposes Unit at Goulburn Gaol or on strict protection with consequent loss of privileges, and that after the riot occurred the inmates were left in their cells naked for 18 hours.9 Whilst I can appreciate the necessity for their clothes to be taken for forensic examination as part of the investigation into the riot, and whilst I can have some understanding of the annoyance, anger and frustration of the prison officers occasioned by the riot and the serious physical attacks on some of their members, there is no reason why they could not have been supplied with other clothes, and to keep persons, even prisoners serving lengthy gaol sentences, in their cells naked for eighteen hours cannot be justified on any basis.10 It is reminiscent of barbaric medieval forms of torture and such vindictive, inhuman, non-curial punishment was totally illegal. I record my utter horror that such conduct occurs in this community, in this day and age, even in a place such as Goulburn Gaol. 11 In relation to the offence of riot, his Honour concluded that excluding the actual injuries sustained by Officers Swain, Hursey and Madden, because those assaults sounded in other charges, the riot should be regarded in comparison to other prison riots and riots generally as toward the lower end of the scale. 12 Having regard to this, that is the objective seriousness of the riot, and allowing a twenty per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, he concluded that the offence sounded in a total sentence of four years.13 In dealing with the applicants who were sentenced on 17 December, his Honour then went on at p 17 of his Remarks on Sentence as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “In saying this, I have had regard to the fact that riot is an offence quite distinct from others and certainly distinct from offences in which a prisoner has become involved by way of common purpose. Riot only becomes an offence because there are twelve or more people and in consequence of which must be looked at as an entity in itself for which all participants must bear the total responsibility for the disturbance of the peace and the fear engendered.  
         
         
        The part each played can be distinguished in the non-parole period. In this respect it is ill fitting to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I gain some support for this view from  
        R v McCormack & Ors 
         [1981] VR 104.”  
         
        
       
      
    14 He gave effect to this approach by sentencing each of the applicants to a total sentence of four years for riot, fixing a non-parole period for the applicant Priestly, whom he regarded as one of the principal offenders, of two years, and for the other three applicants a non-parole period of one year. Then in the case of the applicant Priestly and his co-offender Paulson, he dealt with the malicious inflict grievous bodily harm with intent offences.15 It is convenient to first deal with the appeal of the applicant Priestly who was sentenced, as I say, at the same time as Paulson. Both pleaded guilty to maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent in respect of Mr Swain, and Paulson also pleaded guilty to maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent of Robert Hursey and malicious wounding of Ms Madden.16 For maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent of Mr Swain, they each received sentences which, though differently expressed, amounted to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years, whilst for maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to Robert Hursey, Paulson received an effective sentence of twelve years with a non-parole period of nine years, and for malicious wounding of Ms Madden a sentence of five years three months with a non-parole period of four years. All these sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with each other but cumulatively on the non-parole period for the riot. 17 His Honour found (pp 14 to 15 of 12 December): 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of both these men (that is Priestly and Paulson), the damage they inflicted on Mr Swain and Mr Hursey was extreme, the ferocity of the attacks could be seen from the descriptions which have been given of it; Paulson attacking the recumbent figure of the officer with maniacal force and, in relation to Priestly, his jumping on the head and thorax of Mr Swain and then his kicking of the unconscious officer as he lay on the walkway.  
         
         
        These were not the only two men who attacked Mr Swain…..and there appeared absolutely no doubt that these offenders intended the damage which they did in fact cause. 
         
         
        In all the circumstances, having regard to what was said in  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2)  
        (1988) 164 CLR 465, this, by the damage alone, has to be seen as a crime in the band of the most serious. The fact that it was a custodial officer in an exposed situation taken utterly by surprise by the turn of events and who had been in no sense provoking the attack made upon him, confirms me in this view.  
         
         
        The assault by Paulson on Robert Hursey was grave but not as grave as that on Swain. One can only say that Mr Hursey was extraordinarily lucky in receiving injuries which did not leave him permanently injured. Such was the ferocity of the attack that, whilst not of a view that the assault upon him lies at the top band, it nevertheless lies towards the top of any scale constructed for it.  
         
         
        The malicious wounding of Ms Madden had for her a particularly bad outcome. Whilst her wounds are healed, she remains considerably injured in her psychological make-up which appears to be a permanent state of affairs.”  
        
       
      
    18 It is conceded that a head sentence of four years with a non-parole period of two years was within the range for the riot, but the applicant Priestly seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:  
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentencing judge erred in law in accumulating the sentences imposed on the two counts with each other (accumulation). 
         
        2. The sentencing judge erred in law in imposing a sentence on count 2 (GBH with intent) which was such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when compared with the sentence imposed on the co-offender James Sonny Paulson (parity).  
         
        3. The sentencing judge erred in law in accumulating both sentences with each other and on the sentence being served by the appellant thereby failing to give any or sufficient weight to the principle of totality (totality).  
        
       
      
    19 The applicant is aged twenty-nine years and presents a pathetic case. He comes from a deprived aboriginal background (see pp 10-11 of the Remarks on Sentence) and has an extensive record dating back to 1992 with a number of property offences and also a number of crimes of personal violence, including assault, assault police, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assault prison officer, malicious wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm and murder. For this last matter he was sentenced on 26 June 2000 to fifteen years from 15 August 1999 with a non-parole period of twelve years, to expire on 14 August 2011. 20 Since then he was sentenced on 11 April 2003 to a further concurrent sentence of six months from 15 August 2011 to 14 February 2012 for assaulting a prison officer in the execution of his duty and affray.21 Since the age of ten he has only spent about a year out of prison and it is said he can be considered institutionalised. 22 It was submitted on his behalf that the learned sentencing judge failed to make any allowance for contrition on his part and that some contrition should be gleaned from the plea in the face of Mr Swain’s cognitive difficulties, which were hardly tested when he gave evidence. 23 However, his Honour observed that the terms of the remarks attributed to the applicant by the author of the Pre-Sentence Report suggested an absence of remorse, an attempt to justify his conduct and an apparent lack of appreciation for the seriousness of his conduct. 24 There was no expressed evidence of remorse and, as to the timing of the pleas, there is much force in the Crown’s submission that the presentation of Mr Swain in the witness box in his disabled state must surely have been a matter that weighed heavily upon the decision of the applicant to plead guilty.25 The timing of the pleas is open to the observation that he accepted the inevitability of conviction in the face of an overwhelming Crown case and that the sight of Mr Swain in the witness box at his trial would inevitably have led to conviction and a heavier sentence in the light of that poor man’s condition.26 On the subject of accumulation, s 56 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that sentences for offences involving assaults or any other offence against the person committed by an offender whilst a convicted inmate of a correctional centre, are to be served consecutively with the sentence or sentences being or to be served unless the sentencing judge gives a direction that it be served concurrently or partly concurrently with that other sentence. 
     
      
    27 Subs 3(A) introduced by Act No 13 of 2002, s 3, sch 5[4] now provides that such a direction may not be given unless the Court is satisfied there are special circumstances justifying such a direction. However, that amendment only applies to offences committed after 13 January 2003 and was not applicable in the present case. It was, therefore, open to his Honour to give a direction irrespective of whether special circumstances were shown.  
     
      
    28 In any event, I would have thought that the two offences, that is, the riot and maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, arising substantially out of the same incident, would have constituted special circumstances within the meaning of the subsection, at least in respect of those two offences vis a vis each other. The issue in the present case is whether the sentences for riot and malicious wound with intent should have been made wholly or partly concurrent.29 There is no fixed rule about accumulation or concurrency of sentences. Generally sentences in respect of offences arising out of separate unrelated incidents are made cumulative whilst sentences arising out of the same incident are often made concurrent or partly concurrent: R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at 67 per Simpson J (Mason P agreeing). 30 The matter was given attention by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 where the appellant had been sentenced in respect of two offences committed as part of a single episode of criminality but where there were some elements common to both offences but also some which were peculiar to one or other of the offences. In that case, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [49] observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “To make the sentences imposed on the two counts wholly concurrent may also be said to reveal error in that to do so failed to take account of differences in the conduct which was the subject of punishment on each count.” 
        
       
      
    31 In the present case, the offences of 16 April were totally separate and unrelated to the murder charge in respect of which he was serving the sentence and the assault prison officer and affray, which sentence is cumulative on the non-parole period for murder, and absolutely no reason has been shown why the concurrent sentences should not be wholly cumulative on those sentences.32 As to the sentences for riot and maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, both arose out of the same incident but the elements of the offences were different. Section 93B (riot) involves:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) 12 or more persons present together, 
         
        (b) the use or threat of unlawful violence, 
         
        (c) a common purpose, and 
         
        (d) conduct such as to cause a person of reasonable firmness to fear for his personal safety,  
        
       
       
      whilst s 33 (maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent) involves:  
       
        
        (a) malice, 
         
        (b) the infliction of grievous bodily harm, and 
         
        (c) an intent to do grievous bodily harm 
        
       
      
    33 It can thus be seen that the elements are quite disparate, but in discussing the aggravating features of grievous bodily harm, his Honour (Remarks on Sentence at p 15), included that the offenders were acting in company and accordingly it was submitted that the riot was, in the case of the applicant Priestly, entirely subsumed by the maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm offence.34 I do not agree. In considering the riot, his Honour was vigilant to ensure that he did not take into account the injuries inflicted, and although the s 30 offence was aggravated by the fact that this applicant was acting in company and as part of a common purpose, those features were not elements of the offence of riot. Moreover, the participation of Priestly in the riot extended beyond his assault on Mr Swain. 35 There were, however, some common features in the combination of persons for a common purpose and the use or threat of violence and I would, accordingly, make the sentence for maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm partly concurrent and partly cumulative on the non-parole period for the riot to the extent of one year. 36 Parity. The applicant Priestly complains that he has a justifiable sense of grievance as explained in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 in that whereas both he and Paulson received sentences of sixteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years for the assault on Mr Swain, Paulson was at the same time sentenced to wholly concurrent terms for serious assaults on officers Hursey and Madden with the result that Paulson received for three serious assaults the same sentence as Priestly received for one serious assault.37 Unlike in Lowe and Postiglione v The Queen (1998) 189 CLR 295, the complaint here is not that different sentences were imposed for the same offence, but that in effect the same sentence was imposed for a different number of serious offences. Nevertheless the relevant principles are similar, but one must bear in mind what Brennan J said in Lowe at 617:  
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing of co-offenders always requires a comparison of their conduct and antecedents. The imposition of comparable sentences upon co-offenders whose respective conduct and antecedents warrant disparate sentences is unjust. Similarly the imposition of disparate sentences upon co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable is unjust. A justifiable sense of unfair treatment is produced in either case ... as regard must be had to the comparative gravity of the conduct of co-offenders and to their respective antecedents, an appealable error is not shown by an offender who merely points to a lesser sentence imposed upon his co-offender.” 
         
        
       
      In  
      Postiglione 
       at 309, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, with whom Kirby J agreed, approved what had been said by the South Australian Full Court in  
      R v Tiddy 
       (1969) SASR 575 at 577: 
       
       
        
        “Where other things are equal, persons concerned in the same crime should receive the same punishment and where other things are not equal a due discrimination should be made.” 
        
       
      
    38 The principle of parity is a manifestation of a consideration of justice that points to the imposition of comparable sentences on co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable. It requires a comparison by the court of the criminal conduct and antecedents of the co-offenders. If they are comparable the principle applies. If they are not, it does not: R v Canino [2002] NSWCCA 76 at [20]. 39 His Honour’s Remarks on Sentence at pp 9-10 noted that Paulson’s record was less extensive than Priestly’s, but considered the part he played in the riot and assaults exceeded that of Priestly. In particular, his Honour noted that although they both had extensive records, Priestly’s record included a number of crimes of personal violence, whereas such was not a feature of Paulson’s record.40 He considered that each of them should be treated as having played a leading and vicious part in the disturbance and therefore imposed the same sentences on them. In other words, he balanced the greater part played by Paulson against the considerably worse record of Priestly so as to result in them receiving the same effective sentences. 41 Not only was Priestly currently serving a sentence for murder, but the learned sentencing judge also made a finding that he was “a very dangerous offender”. No such finding was made in relation to Paulson. In addition, Paulson had positively evidenced some remorse for the present offences, a finding which his Honour did not make in relation to the present applicant other than in a most perfunctory manner. 42 The Crown, therefore, submitted that such distinctions provided for the similarity of sentence which the applicant received compared with the greater number of serious offences on the part of Paulson. There is much to be said for the submissions of the Crown in this regard. 43 It was appropriate to take into account the more serious criminal record of the applicant Priestly compared with that of Paulson although Paulson was being sentenced for a greater number of offences; but after some consideration I have come to the conclusion that notwithstanding those features to which I have referred the imposition of identical sentences did not sufficiently reflect the fact that Paulson was being sentenced for three serious assaults compared with one by the applicant. 44 I have already referred to partial concurrency of the malicious inflict grievous bodily harm with intent offence with the riot. In order to reflect what I perceive to be the justifiable sense of grievance which the applicant Priestly may perceive, I would consider it appropriate to reduce his sentence for maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm by a further year. In effect, that will give him a two-year reduction compared with the sentences imposed on Paulson and, allowing for the other matters to which I referred, this I consider would be a better reflection of the criminality involved by them respectively in light of their prior records.45 Totality. Finally, it is submitted on behalf of the applicant Priestly that the injustice claimed by reference to the parity issue is further emphasised when one considers totality and the effectively crushing sentence that sees the applicant Priestly’s earliest release date as 2026 and that of Paulson as 2017. In the light of what I propose, Priestly’s earliest release date would now become 2024.  
     
      
    46 The principle of totality is designed to ensure that when multiple offences are involved a total aggregate sentence is not excessive, having regard to the criminality involved: R v Close (1992) 65 A Crim R 55 at 59.47 However, it is also necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice and a person who commits a series of deliberate discrete offences must not be left with the idea that he or she can escape effective punishment for successive offences, each of which contributed to a whole course of deliberate criminal behaviour: R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37] or that such person has some form of quasi or partial immunity to commit further offences because the appropriate accumulation of sentences will be crushing. 48 In the case of the present applicant, he has continued to commit further discrete offences, both inside and outside gaol, notwithstanding the sentences imposed on him from time to time. He should not in these circumstances receive any leniency by reason of the principle of totality just because the appropriate accumulation of sentences results in a very long period of continuous incarceration. Personal as well as general deterrence and protection of the community remain important components in the sentencing calculus and it is not here suggested that a shorter overall sentence or a shorter overall non-parole period will facilitate his rehabilitation. 49 As regards his specific complaint that the sentences imposed would result in Paulson being possibly released in 2017 and him not being released before 2026, now 2024, it is to be borne in mind that the applicant has been convicted of, and is serving a sentence for, murder whilst Paulson is not. In those circumstances, a difference of seven years does not strike me as out of proportion. 50 I turn now to the applications for leave to appeal by the applicants Maher, Welsh and Lardner. Although the grounds of appeal are not expressed in identical terms and relate only to the head sentence, no complaint being made in respect of the non-parole period, they are essentially the same in each case and are that his Honour assessed the head sentence, which he expressed as a “total”, by reference only to the objective seriousness of the riot in itself and the pleas of guilty, and disregarded the roles of the particular applicants in the offence, the aggravating and mitigating factors relevant to each applicant under s 21A and the circumstances in which each applicant was detained whilst in custody. His Honour took those matters into account only in fixing the non-parole period. 51 It is contended that this error resulted in the fixing of manifestly excessive head sentences which were unfair on parity principles in that they were equal to the head sentences imposed on the co-offenders Paulson and Priestly, who were the ringleaders and planners of the riot. 52 It is not necessary to set out in detail the subjective circumstances of these applicants. They were all aborigines from deprived and usually violent backgrounds, addicted to alcohol and/or drugs, of low intelligence with only limited education and each with extensive criminal records, though not as extensive as those of Paulson or Priestly.53 In sentencing these applicants and others on 17 December 2003, his Honour noted their respective parts in the riot. Welsh admitted placing chairs across the top of the stairs and a table at the top of the stairs to stop the officers coming up, Lardner threw objects down the stairs at Prison Officer Preston and others, and Maher poured liquid (unspecified) from buckets down the stairs. It was not suggested by the Crown that any of these applicants injured anybody. 54 I am satisfied that in not taking into account in fixing the head sentence the parts played by the individual offenders, the aggravating and mitigating matters under s 21A and the individual subjective circumstances, including the nature of their incarceration, but limiting consideration of these matters to the fixing of the non-parole period, his Honour was in error. 55 The degree of objective criminality in an offence has always been relevant in fixing the head sentence while s 21A expressly requires that the matters specified therein be taken into account in determining the appropriate “sentence”. “Sentence” is a reference to the total sentence, not only to the non-parole period: R v Mailes [2004] NSWCCA 394 at [21].56 As to the degree of participation of each offender in the riot, in R v McCormack [1981] VR 104, the case referred to by his Honour, after observing that in the case of a riot each offender is not sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but is sentenced for having, by deed or encouragement, been one of a number engaged in a crime against the peace, the Court at 109 went on to say:  
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst this is the basic approach, it is open to the sentencing judge at his discretion to take into account the actual conduct of an offender in the riot, by way of aggravation.” 
        
       
       
      and at 112 it was pointed out that it was inappropriate to allow leniency only on the non-parole period, and not also on the head sentence. See also  
      R v Fajka 
       [2004] NSWCCA 166 at [27]-[29].  
       
      
    57 Moreover, in Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 513, Mason CJ and McHugh J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “... the considerations which the sentencing judge must take into account when fixing a minimum term will be the same as those applicable to the setting of the head sentence. Obviously, the weight to be attached to these factors and the way in which they are relevant will differ due to the different purposes behind each function.”  
        
       
      
    58 The Crown, correctly in my view, concedes that his Honour was in error in the approach that he took. As a result of this error, I am satisfied that his Honour imposed head sentences which were manifestly excessive in the circumstances which give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when compared with the head sentences imposed on Paulson and Priestly on the count of riot and that this Court should intervene.59 Bearing in mind the head sentences imposed on Paulson and Priestly, which already reflect a discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, I consider that those sentences should be taken as a reference point, and I would sentence the applicants to head sentences of two years in the case of the applicants Maher and Lardner, but in respect of the applicant Welsh, who appears to have played an even lesser role in that he was not throwing objects at anyone and did not directly confront correctional officers, and that the case against him depended entirely on his own admissions, I would sentence him to a head sentence of eighteen months. 60 I would not interfere with the finding of special circumstances within s 44(2) nor with the non-parole period of one year in the case of these three applicants. 61 I therefore propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      In respect of the applicant Priestly, I would grant an extension of time for filing of the application for leave to appeal. I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentences imposed by the District Court and in lieu thereof I would sentence the applicant as follows:  
       
        
        (a) On the count of riot, a sentence of imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years, such sentence to commence on 15 February 2012 with a non-parole period to expire on 14 February 2014.  
         
        (b) On the count of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for fifteen years with a non-parole period of eleven years, such sentence to be served partly concurrent with the sentence for riot and to commence on 15 February 2013 and expire on 14 February 2028. The non-parole period would expire on 14 February 2024.  
        
       
       
        
        I find special circumstances within s 44(2) in the accumulation of sentences. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 14 February 2024.  
        
       
      
    62 In respect of the applicant Maher, I would grant an extension of time for the filing of an application for leave to appeal. I would grant leave to appeal. I would allow the appeal, quash the sentence imposed by the District Court and in lieu thereof I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year, such sentence to be deemed to have commenced on 5 February 2002.  
     
      
       
        
        I note that the non-parole period expired on 4 February 2003 and that the head sentence expired on 4 February 2004. 
         
        I find special circumstances within s 44(2) on account of the applicant’s age, parity with other offenders and his deprived background. 
        
       
      
    63 In relation to the applicant Welsh, I would grant an extension of time for the filing of an application for leave to appeal. I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence imposed by the District Court and in lieu thereof I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for eighteen months, such sentence would be deemed to have commenced on 15 September 2003 and to expire on 14 March 2005. 
     
      
       
        
         
        I would fix a non-parole period of 12 months and note that such non-parole period expired on 14 September 2004 and that the head sentence will expire on 14 March 2005.  
         
        I find special circumstances on account of the applicant’s age, parity with other offenders and his deprived background. 
         
        Pursuant to s 50 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , I would order that the applicant be released on parole subject to the conditions contained in the Regulations and note that he has already been admitted to parole.  
        
       
      
    64 In respect of the applicant Lardner, I would grant an extension of time for the filing of an application for leave to appeal. I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence imposed by the District Court and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year, such sentence to be deemed to have commenced on 30 June 2003.  
     
      
       
        
        I note that the non-parole period expired on 29 June 2004 and that the head sentence will expire on 29 June 2005. I would order that the applicant be released on parole, subject to the conditions contained in the Regulations.  
         
        I find special circumstances on account of the applicant’s age, parity with other offenders and his deprived background. 
        
       
      
    65 KIRBY J: I agree with each of the orders and with the reasons provided.66 DUNFORD J: The orders will, accordingly, be as I have indicated.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, Rodney Stephen Adler, is charged with offences against ss 997 and 999 of the Corporations Act 2001.2 On 2 April 2004, his trial was set down to commence yesterday but, at a directions hearing on 28 October last, it was decided that this week would be reserved for legal argument and the jury panel would not be called until next Monday, 14 February.3 Yesterday, an adjournment and temporary stay of proceedings was sought on account of what was alleged to be adverse publicity which had the potential to prevent the accused receiving a fair trial.4 Before proceeding to the material relied on and its nature, I note that there were formerly civil proceedings brought by ASIC against the accused for breaches of his duties as a director of HIH Insurance Ltd (HIH), as a result of which he was fined and banned from acting as a director of a company for 20 years.5 He then sought a stay of these criminal proceedings on the grounds that they related to the same matter as the civil proceedings and were a breach of the principles of double jeopardy. That application was dismissed by James J.6 An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was unsuccessful: Adler v Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] NSWCCA 352 and special leave to appeal from such judgment was refused by the High Court of Australia on 10 December last. The nature of the civil proceedings are summarised in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal at paras [9] to [12].7 In support of the application, a variety of material was tendered, consisting of copies of newspaper reports and Media Monitors reports of radio and television broadcasts.8 Exhibit 1 on the voir dire, which related to material published yesterday morning, generally referred to the fact that the trial was to start yesterday, the nature of the charges, the fact that the accused has previously been disqualified from acting as a company director and fined for breaching his duties as a director, and that he has sought to stay the present prosecution on the ground of double jeopardy. Some of the material directly links his breach of duty as a director with the payment of $10 million of HIH funds to the accused's company which was used for the purchase of HIH shares, the subject of the current criminal charges. There are other passing references to HIH collapsing in 2001 with debts of $5.3 billion, and the former chairman and chief executive of HIH, Ray Williams, pleading guilty to breaches of Corporations law. Some of the material states that Mr Williams is expected to give evidence against the present accused, which is in fact not the case.9 Exhibit 2 on the voir dire is generally more remote in point of time. One article refers to an application by the accused and one Jodie Rich to have a civil suit arising out of the collapse of One Tell dismissed. Another article refers to the accused going skiing overseas over the Christmas holiday period. A number of articles relate to his application to have this prosecution stayed on the ground of double jeopardy and one, dated July 2004, relates to the accused pursuing business ventures in Lebanon. Other material relates to his unsuccessful application for special leave to appeal in civil proceedings against him and two items relate to him being seen on Bondi Beach and using a pay telephone.  
     
      
    10 It is not necessary to go through the other material in exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the voir dire. They can be summarised as being further material which was broadcast yesterday, some of it on talk back radio and similar programs, to material on the Internet, and two reports in Exhibit 5 on the voir dire from today's Sydney Morning Herald, including a photograph of the accused.11 The principles on which a trial will be adjourned and a stay of proceedings, permanent or temporary, granted on account of pre-trial publicity are set out in Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94, particularly at 99 in the joint judgment of Mason CJ and Toohey J. Their Honours there point out that it is misleading to think that simply because a juror has heard something of the circumstances giving rise to the trial an accused has lost the opportunity of an indifferent jury. They stressed that the importance of a fair trial to an accused must not be underestimated, but it is not the only consideration, that anyone charged with a criminal offence be brought to trial expeditiously, and that it is inimicable to the orderly disposition of the work of the courts that trials be adjourned unnecessarily.  
     
      
    12 Brennan J agreed with their Honours on this point, as did Deane J, who pointed out at 125 that sometimes it may be impossible to ensure that one or more jurors are not aware of some factor prejudicial to an accused and, even if a trial is adjourned, the juror may still remember the matter complained of. See also John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v the District Court of New South Wales (2004) 50 ACSR 80, particularly at [104] to [110].  
     
      
    13 I also refer to R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450, a case of particular relevance to the present, because it, unlike Murphy and some of the other cases referred to, relates to what is commonly referred to as “white collar crime”. In that case Kirby ACJ, with whom Handley JA and Sully J agreed at 452 to 454 set out the principles governing an application such as the present. I find that statement of principle particularly helpful in the present case because, as I say, this is not a murder or multiple rape trial where public passions and the feelings of the victims and their immediate families thereof are aroused in the same way.14 The collapse of HIH was a major financial event in 2001 and affected directly or indirectly a number of members of the public in a number of different ways. It was such a major collapse and created such public concern in the commercial and general community that the Federal Government appointed a Royal Commission whose proceedings and findings, including its recommendations that certain civil and/or criminal proceedings be taken against various directors, including the accused, were widely reported in the media, and properly so. It is to be expected that a large number of potential jurors to be called will have a passing knowledge and recall of these matters, although in many cases their recollection of the details will be incomplete.15 The public are entitled to have an interest in knowing whether the recommendations of the Royal Commission as to possible proceedings against certain directors have been carried out, and there has also previously been media reporting of the civil proceedings against the accused and the application for the stay of proceedings and appeals arising therefrom.  
     
      
    16 In these circumstances, it is not surprising or inappropriate that the media sought fit to report yesterday that this trial was about to start and what it was about. It is claimed, however, that the currency, cogency and content of the reporting were such that the accused may not receive a fair trial. Particular attention was directed to the reference to the accused as a “disgraced businessman”.17 In my view, a company director who has been banned from acting as such and fined for breaches of his duties as a director can fairly be described as “disgraced”. Most people who follow these matters, including, I anticipate, a number of potential jurors, would be aware of the civil proceedings and their result and, in my opinion, the epithet “disgraced” would not add to their recall of such matters.18 It was submitted that references to the civil case were irrelevant and therefore prejudicial to the accused, particularly where the civil case was described as it was in some cases, being “in respect of the same matter” as the current criminal charges. There is in fact some overlap (see the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment referred to above at [35]), but, as held by that Court, the civil cases and the current criminal charges are not identical. They require proof of different matters and to a different onus. Moreover, it cannot be inferred that any potential jurors who have heard or read these reports will have analysed them in the same minute detail as Ms Fullerton SC has done in her submissions.  
     
      
    19 The jury can be told to disregard what, if anything, they have heard or read about the civil proceedings and that the issues in this trial are different; and there is no reason to infer that they would disregard such directions simply because a number of news reporters, usually in what might be called the “transient” media, such as radio or television, have referred to the two sets of proceedings as relating to “the same matter”.  
     
      
    20 Of course, there is no evidence as to how many of the potential jurors have heard or read or seen the particular reports, nor which potential jurors have heard, seen or read which reports. It can, however, be assumed that a number of such potential jurors have read or heard one or more of them; but against this must be borne in mind that some of the reports give no details at all but simply state the nature of the present proceedings, and contain none of the references to “disgraced businessman” or “the same matter” as were particularly objected to. The main thrust of most of the material is simply that the accused is charged with stock market manipulation and making false statements, matters which I assume that the jury, when empanelled, will be told at the very beginning of the Crown Prosecutor's opening address.21 Although material prior to yesterday has been tendered on the voir dire, the main objection appears to have been to yesterday's reporting, and in view of the fact that the jury trial will not start until next week, it may reasonably be expected that the immediate effect of yesterday's reporting will be dissipated to a degree by the time the jury is empanelled.22 Moreover, I made a plea yesterday to the media generally to be very circumspect with their reporting of the proceedings (see yesterday's transcript at pp 5-6) and it is, hopefully, unlikely that there will be anymore reporting of material which may be claimed to be prejudicial, a fact acknowledged in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald (see Document 3 in Exhibit 5 on the voir dire).23 In my view, in accordance with the cases to which I have referred, this is a case where, particularly as the trial is not starting until next week, strong directions can be given to the jury to secure a fair trial. They will, of course, be directed to confine their deliberations to the evidence in accordance with the oath or affirmation which they will take, and to exclude any other material from their minds. They will be directed in strong terms not to attempt to access other material, such as the Internet. I will also invite those who either, because they have read the material complained of, or any other material relating to the accused, or have any particular other reason to feel that they cannot bring a totally unprejudiced mind to the trial, to stand aside. I will also take what steps I can to have the earlier judgments referred to in Exhibit 7 on the voir dire removed from the Supreme Court website.24 There have already been a number of delays in bringing these matters to trial. The summons was issued on 5 November 2002, the accused was committed for trial on 11 July 2003 and arraigned in this Court on 5 September 2003. The trial has been delayed, primarily by the accused's application for a stay of proceedings. He was, of course, perfectly entitled to make this application, and I am not suggesting otherwise; but the time has now come when the trial should not be delayed any further unless it is necessary.25 Finally, there is no guarantee, or indeed likelihood, that the position will be any better in three months time or six months time. People that have read or heard material such as is complained of, will probably still recall it, or the substance of it, in three months’ time or six months’ time. I believe that the giving of directions, as I have indicated, and the other steps that I have indicated will, I believe, remove any potential for unfair prejudice and ensure a fair trial for the accused.26 The application for an adjournment and a temporary stay of proceedings is accordingly refused.

     REGINA v LUKE SHERIDAN WILLIAMS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court by Judge Phelan (the Judge) for an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act. This is an offence for which a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment is prescribed. The applicant pleaded guilty to that charge when arraigned on an indictment for an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm and the Crown accepted the plea to the lesser offence in full satisfaction of the indictment. The Judge sentenced the applicant to an overall sentence of 3 years imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment with a balance of the sentence of 18 months. 
     
      
    4 There were two grounds of appeal filed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. His Honour erred in his assessment of the evidence relating to the applicant’s mental and psychiatric condition at the time of the offence. 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in his assessment of the culpability of the applicant. 
        
       
       
      The two grounds are associated and Mr Winch, who appeared for the applicant before this Court, dealt with them as one complaint. In effect the argument is that, because his Honour disregarded the opinion of the psychiatrist as to the applicant’s mental state at the time of the commission of the offence, his Honour imposed a sentence that was too harsh to reflect the applicant’s culpability. 
       
      
    5 The offence occurred on 26 January 2002 when the applicant was at Kalang with members of his family for the purposes of attending a wedding. The applicant confronted his stepfather in relation to an allegation that he had sexually assaulted the applicant’s sister when she was 9 years of age. His sister had apparently told the applicant of these allegations about a week earlier. During the course of the confrontation the applicant was at one time armed with a mattock and at another time with an axe. Members of the family intervened and disarmed the applicant but he punched and kicked the victim. The victim attempted to flee from the applicant, but he pursued him arming himself with piece of dead branch. The applicant struck the victim to the back of the head twice with this weapon at a time when the victim had his back to the applicant. 
     
      
    6 The victim suffered very serious injuries including a skull fracture with bleeding and swelling to the brain. He was hospitalised for the period from 27 January to 18 February 2002 and underwent surgery for the reconstruction of his skull including the insertion of metal plates. There was no evidence before the sentencing judge of the permanent effect of those injuries upon the victim. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was aged 32 at the date of sentencing. He has no prior criminal record. There was a brief Pre-Sentence Report in evidence. It contained the following statement: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The applicant] states that he is sorry for his actions and accepts that he handled this situation badly. 
        
       
       
      The applicant had been studying Naturopathy at university at the time of the offence and was said to have “unconfirmed plans to also pursue further tertiary education if released”. He had no fixed place of abode at the time and was receiving financial benefits as a student. The applicant was found to be unsuitable for either periodic detention or community service. 
       
      
    8 There were two reports before the Judge from a psychiatrist, Dr Petroff, who had examined the applicant on two occasions following the commission of the offence. The first report was dated 27 August 2001. It contains an account of the facts and circumstances leading up to the offence including the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The applicant] told me that on the day before the wedding he was swimming in a pool of water and that the water spoke to him and told him that somebody had already been (sic) and had already swum in that water. This was then followed by a dog on the property talking to him and telling him that someone was a ‘mongrel’. He knew that the dog was referring to his stepfather. 
        
       
      
    9 After recounting a version of the assault upon the stepfather that the psychiatrist had apparently obtained from some source other than the applicant, the report continues: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When I asked [the applicant] his account of the offence he gave a disjointed story, made no mention of the axe and stated something to the effect that if he had known that his stepfather had fragile bones he would not have hit him so hard. When asked about the axe he stated that he poked the (sic) stepfather in the chest with the handle of the axe. He had a bizarre smile on his face as he said so. 
         
         
        The patient told me that at this time he was completely out of control and felt as if he was seeing himself on video performing. He told me that he had smoked some marijuana that day but was vague as to the amount. He told me that after the assault ”he left the scene”. 
         
         
        The patient told me that he was a vegan for six years when this happened and that someone had told him that vegans can have Vitamin B12 deficiency. He wondered whether that might have caused him to attack his stepfather. He then related that he had no emotions ”either way”. 
        
       
      
    10 In that part of his report concerning his examination of the applicant the following is stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The patient reported bizarre perception including visions where everything “just splits”. He stated that all that was like “amplified thoughts”. He reported hearing music in his head but then stated in fact they were voices, which were not intelligible. He reported seeing colours emanating from people. His thinking at times was very distorted, disjointed and tangential. If I hadn’t had the statement of fact (sic) I would not have been able to obtain a comprehensible story. 
         
         
        The patient’s affect was blunted. At other times it was frankly bizarre and inappropriate such as when he talked about the axe with a smile on his face. At the time that I saw the patient clearly he had a lot more insight than he would have had at the time of the incident. However, he saw no need for treatment and was intent on experimenting with drugs which he thought was going to improve his self-awareness. 
         
        
       
      
    11 Dr Petroff gave his opinion of the psychiatric state of the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The applicant] is suffering from chronic schizophrenia. In days prior to DSM 4 a diagnosis of ambulatory schizophrenia would be an apt description for [the applicant]. This was described as being fluctuating in severity with the patient being always bizarre and odd and at other times frankly psychotic. 
         
         
        His condition will certainly be made worse by the use of drugs and from my examination of the patient today there was no indication that he had any intention of avoiding them. 
         
         
        In the light of his past history of violence, his psychotic illness and his abuse of psychoactive drugs he remains a danger in the community. This patient needs treatment and this could only be guaranteed in a forensic psychiatric setting. 
        
       
      
    12 The second report of Dr Petroff was dated 9 December 2003, the date on which he next interviewed the applicant. In the meantime the applicant had absconded on bail and was rearrested in the Northern Territory. Dr Petroff noted that “there was a remarkable difference in the way that he presented today” from when he was interviewed on 24 August 2001. In respect of the applicant’s account of the offence, the doctor reported: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The patient gave me a clear story of being “unbalanced” for about six months at the time he assaulted his stepfather. He wasn’t sure what was the cause of his lack of balance, but thought the major factor may have been his exaggerated use of cannabis. He had used DMT, but in small amounts and it was not of the synthetic kind. On direct questioning he admitted to sleeping little at the time and having excess energy. 
        
       
      
    13 His opinion of the applicant’s mental state on this occasion was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In the light of the applicant’s remarkable recovery from the way he appeared he could not be suffering from a schizophrenic illness. A diagnosis has to be altered to Bipolar Disorder, particularly as there’s a clear report of him being elevated in mood and energy and he revealed a family history of recurrent depression on his mother’s side. 
         
         
        His marijuana smoking would not have helped his condition, but would be seen as more of a symptom and an attempt to self- medicate rather than the cause of his problem. 
         
         
        This man is suffering from a Bipolar Disorder or a Schizoaffective Disorder and at the time of the offence he would have been in a manic state with marijuana use giving him a superficial appearance of schizophrenia. 
         
         
        This man is now euthymic, in no way dangerous and somewhat shocked by his level of psychosis. 
         
         
        My recommendation would be that he be placed on a bond and, as part of that bond, be made to attend a series of appointments with Mental Health services. These would not be for the purpose of treatment, which is unnecessary at the moment, but for reasons of psycho education and to increase his self-awareness and knowledge into his condition. That would go a long way to preventing recurrences of similar behaviour should he relapse again. 
        
       
      
    14 Although the two reports of Dr Petroff were received in evidence without objection and the doctor was not called to give evidence before the Judge, there was a lively dispute between the Crown and the applicant as to the finding the Judge should make about the mental state of the applicant at the time of the commission of the offence. The Crown argued that, on the basis of the account given by the applicant in his record of interview with police which appeared to be rational and lucid, the Judge would not be satisfied that the applicant was suffering from any mental illness at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    15 Although the applicant did not give evidence, and, therefore, the accounts he gave to the psychiatrist of his mental state at the time of the offence were untested, there was evidence within the Crown brief that supported the psychiatrist’s findings. These were statements of members of the applicant’s family as to his appearance on the day of the offence. As would be expected these were unscientific observations of the applicant and contained comments such as that the applicant was “really stressed” and that he was “pretty psycho and fired up”. There was reference to the fact that the applicant was having “mood swings”. Perhaps of more significance was the fact that there was an account of the applicant saying that he had been talking to the dog that afternoon. 
     
      
    16 The Judge in the course of his sentencing remarks referred to both reports of Dr Petroff in detail and quoted from them in depth. He also referred to the material in the evidence relating to the mental state of the applicant as observed by friends or members of his family before and after the attack upon his stepfather. The Judge then quoted at length from the record of interview including the following passages:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “My plans were not to kill him, I was thinking in my mind I do not want to, I feel sorry for this guy, I do not want to do this, I do not want to kill him, I just want to knock him out, and that is what I was thinking.” 
        
       
       
        
        “I wanted vengeance man, this is a vendetta thing you know. I am sorry but it runs pretty deep you know and I cannot deal with it in a standard way.” 
        
       
       
        
        “I do not know what he (the victim) was going to do but I was – I was very angry mainly. I was in a really angry state of mind and it is probably wrong. Everyone tells me that it is not the answer you know but I am just a human being. People have fights over less things than this.” 
        
       
       
        
        “The dog was sitting next to me, Richard’s dog. I don’t really like dogs but anyway I had this thing going on in my mind you know and I was thinking how angry I was with this step-father. 
         
         
        Q97: Mm? A: And yeah and I just looked at this dog and it was just like the dog looked back at me and said yeah he didn’t like him either and he thought he was a real mongrel and I was just thinking this at the time, you know, humorously to myself. This is not a serious thing like it was my attempt at humour in a dark situation when I said that and yeah, anyway he asked me what I was thinking and I said ‘Oh the dog just told me something’ but I was joking, it’s just a joke you know. 
         
         
        Q: Right you don’t believe that the dog was actually talking to you? A: Well you know sometimes dogs can you know, they’re very intuitive creatures. He might’ve been, I don’t know man, I live in a dream world most of the time.” 
        
       
      
    17 At the conclusion of his remarks and just before he passed sentence on the applicant, the Judge stated:  
     
      
       
        
         
        So that the explanation given by the offender within a couple of days of the offence demonstrated that he was fully aware of what had happened, he gave an accurate description of what he had done, reflective of the many witnesses’ statements, all of which correspond down to a very fine level of detail. He expressed regret, there were no examples of irrational thinking or bizarre explanation as to what he had done, and it seems remarkable that Doctor Petroff was not asked to comment upon it, because in my conclusion it shows a perfectly rational response. However, I do accept on the other hand that he was genuine in his feelings of anger at the molestation of his sister who has provided a detailed statement of that molestation and which would have been very troubling to her as she claims. So while it is no excuse for what he did, it is perhaps understandable that he felt aggressive at a perceived lack of justice, and it particularly got to him that this man was at the wedding, and if it was a choice about him leaving or the offender leaving, the offender had to leave. 
         
         
        I seem to think that if Doctor Petroff had had the benefit of that document, his opinion would have been quite different. 
         
         
        In those circumstances the level of the culpability of the offender is higher……………… 
         
        
       
      
    18 The complaint before this Court is that his Honour ought not to have rejected the evidence of Dr Petroff based only upon the contents of the record of interview. As I have noted Dr Petroff was not called to give evidence and, therefore, was never in a position to comment upon the significance or otherwise of the statements made by the applicant to police as to his opinion as to the mental state of the applicant at the time of the commission of the offence. His Honour seems to have come to his view that he should reject the psychiatrist’s opinions on the basis that they were inconsistent with the record of interview and expressed the conclusion that had the psychiatrist been aware of the contents of the interview he would not have formed the opinion that he did. But it was accepted by the parties that Dr Petroff had been in possession of the Crown brief, which included a transcript of the interview, on both occasions when he examined the applicant. 
     
      
    19 The applicant had the onus of proof in relation to the issue of his mental state at the time of the commission of the offence. Neither the psychiatrist nor the applicant was called to give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Yet I do not believe that the Judge was entitled to reject the psychiatric opinion for the reason that he did: that it was made without knowledge of the contents of the record of interview. I doubt that, without hearing from the psychiatrist, it was open for his Honour to find that the applicant’s statements to police were necessarily inconsistent with his suffering from some abnormal mental condition, such as a Bipolar Disorder, at the time of the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    20 The record of interview was conducted four days after the commission of the offence. It was never suggested by the psychiatrist or the representative of the applicant at the sentencing hearing that the applicant did not appreciate what he was doing when he attacked his stepfather nor that he did not attack him as an act of revenge for the sexual assaults upon his sister. The submission was simply that because of his mental state at the time the applicant was less able to control himself, less able to think rationally about his conduct and, therefore, less culpable than might otherwise have been the case had he not been suffering a mental disorder. The fact that the applicant tried to make a joke about the dog having spoken to him might simply indicate that he was trying to mask his mental condition from the police. Dr Petroff noted in his second report that the applicant was reluctant to accept that he had a mental illness. 
     
      
    21 The Judge’s rejection of the psychiatric evidence was a question of fact and this Court does not generally review such findings. But in this case it seems to me, with respect, that his Honour was not entitled to come to the conclusion that he did for the reason that he gave. Although this Court has also not heard from the psychiatrist, on all of the material, including the statements made by persons who had seen the applicant at the relevant time, I would find that it was more likely that the applicant was suffering from a mental condition that affected his culpability. 
     
      
    22 Although I believe the Judge was in error in his approach to the psychiatric evidence I would not intervene in light of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. A sentence of 3 years with a non-parole of 18 months was in my view the most lenient sentence that the applicant could expect in light of the seriousness of the offence and even taking into account the fact that he was suffering from a mental condition at the time that no doubt affected his thinking and behaviour. The offence was a very serious example of conduct falling under s 35 both by reason of the nature of the assault and the injuries inflicted. 
     
      
    23 The Judge took into account that the applicant felt genuine anger against his stepfather for the alleged offences against his sister and that “while it is no excuse for what he did, it is perhaps understandable that he felt aggressive at a perceived lack of justice”. In my view a Court cannot allow for any significant mitigation of the applicant’s culpability because the offence was committed to punish the stepfather for allegedly interfering with the applicant’s sister in light of the seriousness of the assault. Denunciation and general deterrence are very much to the fore when sentencing an offender who has taken the law into his own hands and inflicted serious injuries as retribution for wrongs allegedly committed by the victim. This approach must be taken in the present case notwithstanding that the applicant might have been suffering from a mental condition that influenced his conduct. It is not a case where in my view much weight can be given to the psychiatric condition to reduce the importance of general deterrence. 
     
      
    24 The Judge indicated that he was giving the applicant “full discount” for the plea of guilty. If he meant by that a discount in the order of 25 per cent, it was overly generous. The indictment is dated 11 October 2002, yet the applicant did not plead guilty to the lesser offence, a course that was always open to him whether the Crown would accept the plea or not, until 19 December 2003. 
     
      
    25 Notwithstanding the evidence placed before the Court for the purposes of re-sentencing the applicant, I do not believe that any lesser sentence than that imposed upon the applicant is warranted. The non-parole period in particular was a very lenient minimum period to be served and it is impossible to see how any lesser period of custody could reflect the seriousness of the offence committed. 
     
      
    26 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Chung Pong Tae has applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Nield on 23 April 2004, after he had pleaded guilty to an offence of bribery of a Commonwealth public official, being an offence under s141.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Commonwealth), for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for ten years. In sentencing the applicant Judge Nield took into account an additional offence, that, not being a registered migration agent, the applicant asked for or received a fee or reward for giving immigration assistance. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a term of two years two months, to date from 20 April 2004, and ordered that the applicant be released on recognisance on 19 August 2005, after serving one year four months of the sentence.  
     
      
    2 The facts of the offences are set out in a facts sheet prepared by an Australian Federal Police Agent, which was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence. The facts were briefly summarised by his Honour in his remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    3 Having regard to the grounds sought to be relied on by the applicant on this application, it is unnecessary to refer to the facts of the offences in much detail. It is sufficient to say that on twenty-two occasions between 11 March 2003 and 30 May 2003 the applicant paid a sum of money as a bribe to Commonwealth public officials, being officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, to obtain a visa or an extension of a visa for some other person. The applicant, not being a registered migration agent, received a reward for his services from the person seeking the visa or the extension of the visa.  
     
      
    4 As his Honour remarked in his remarks on sentence, the applicant had not committed simply a single, isolated offence; rather he had engaged in a course of criminal conduct extending over two and a half months. In his remarks on sentence his Honour found that the applicant’s motive for committing the offences was simply greed. 
     
      
    5 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge noted some of the subjective features of the applicant. He was born in South Korea on 20 October 1971. His mother still lives in South Korea and is in poor health. The applicant first entered Australia in 1998 on a tourist visa and left Australia when the visa expired. The applicant re-entered Australia with his newly married wife in 1999, after obtaining a short stay business visa. He worked for a time in educational institutions but was unemployed at the time he was sentenced. After the applicant was arrested, his wife returned to South Korea. 
     
      
    6 The applicant had no previous criminal convictions in South Korea or Australia.  
     
      
    7 In his remarks on sentence Judge Nield referred to the applicant’s plea of guilty and to assistance provided and undertaken to be provided by the applicant to the authorities.  
     
      
    8 The applicant had been arrested and charged on 1 July 2003. After the Crown brief of evidence was served on the applicant, on or about 25 November 2003, he offered to assist the Australian Federal Police in its investigation of his co-offenders, including a Mr Bruce who was one of the corrupt Commonwealth immigration officials. On 9 February 2004 the applicant made a long statement to the Australian Federal Police of the evidence he would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. In the statement he gave details of the conduct of himself, of the co-offender Bruce and of a co-offender named Ong, who had been the source of many of the clients. The applicant also provided information about some unrelated criminal matters. On 24 March 2004 the applicant made a supplementary statement. On 9 March 2004 the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the offence under s141.1 of the Criminal Code. 
     
      
    9 In the proceedings on sentence Judge Nield was provided with a sealed letter of the usual kind from an Australian Federal Police officer, in which the officer assessed the applicant’s assistance. On the hearing of this application this Court has been able itself to inspect this letter. Judge Nield found that the applicant’s assistance in the investigation of his co-offenders had been significant and valuable and that the applicant had also provided information about offences committed by persons other than the co-offenders. His Honour noted that the applicant had given an undertaking to give evidence for the Crown on the prosecution of his co-offenders and found that the applicant’s evidence in those prosecutions would be important to the Crown. His Honour also found that, by giving assistance, the applicant had put himself at risk of retaliation from the co-offenders and from other persons.  
     
      
    10 In his remarks on sentence his Honour explained how he had arrived at the sentence he imposed. His Honour had decided, leaving aside the applicant’s plea of guilty and the applicant’s assistance, that a starting point of imprisonment for four years would be appropriate. His Honour then continued: 
     
      
        
       
        
        “I intend to discount the period of four years by twenty percent on account of the offender’s guilty plea which, for ease of calculation, is nine months, thereby reducing four years to three years three months. I intend to further discount the period of three years three months by one-third on account of the offender’s assistance to police and the Crown, including promised evidence for the Crown on the prosecution of his co-offenders, thereby reducing three years three months to two years two months. I intend to order the release of the offender on recognisance after serving one year four months.” 
        
       
      
    11 On this application, counsel for the applicant relied on three grounds of appeal, which I will deal with in turn.  
     
      
       
      Ground One: The sentencing judge erred when his Honour purported to discount the period of four years imprisonment by twenty percent, thus arriving at the figure of nine months discount. 
       
      
    12 I have already referred to the part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence in which his Honour, in explaining how he had arrived at the sentence he imposed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I intend to discount the period of four years by twenty percent on account of the offender’s guilty plea which, for ease of calculation, is nine months, thereby reducing four years to three years three months.” 
        
       
      
    13 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that his Honour had made a mathematical error, in that, if a period of four years is to be discounted by twenty percent, the amount of the discount would be 9.6 months and not nine months. 
     
      
    14 In my opinion, this submission depends on an excessively pedantic reading of this part of the remarks on sentence. A fair reading of his Honour’s remarks, which is supported by his Honour’s use of the expression “for ease of calculation”, is that his Honour intended to allow a discount of about twenty percent, producing as the amount of the discount a round figure of nine months. 
     
      
    15 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two: The sentencing judge erred by failing to sentence the applicant in accordance with s21E of the Crimes Act (1914) 
        
      Commonwealth, having regard to the fact that the applicant had rendered assistance to law enforcement authorities. 
       
      
    16 Section 21E of the Crimes Act provides (in part): 
     
      
       
        
        1) Where a federal sentence, or a federal non-parole period, is reduced by the court imposing the sentence or fixing the non-parole period because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies in proceedings, including confiscation proceedings, relating to any offence, the court must:  
         
         
        (a) if the sentence imposed is reduced—specify that the sentence is being reduced for that reason and state the sentence that would have been imposed but for that reduction; and 
         
         
        (b) if the non-parole period is reduced—specify that the non-parole period is being reduced for that reason and state what the period would have been but for that reduction. 
         
         
        (2) Where:  
         
         
        (a) a federal sentence is imposed or a federal non-parole period is fixed; and 
         
         
        (b) the sentence or non-parole period is reduced because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies as described in subsection (1); and 
         
         
        (c) after sentence, the offender, without reasonable excuse, does not co-operate in accordance with the undertaking; the Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time while the offender is under sentence, if the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so, appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence or of the non-parole period. 
         
         
        (3) Where an appeal is begun under this section against the inadequacy of a sentence, or of a non-parole period, that was reduced because of a person's undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement agencies, the court hearing the appeal:  
         
         
        (a) if it is satisfied that the person has failed entirely to co-operate in accordance with the undertaking—must substitute for the reduced sentence or reduced non-parole period the sentence, or non-parole period, that would have been imposed on, or fixed in respect of, the person but for that reduction; and 
         
         
        (b) if it is satisfied that the person has failed in part to co-operate in accordance with the undertaking—may substitute for the reduced sentence or reduced non-parole period such a sentence, or such a non-parole period, not exceeding in length the sentence that could be imposed, or the non-parole period that could be fixed, under paragraph (a), as it thinks appropriate. 
        
       
      
    17 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that his Honour was mandated by s21E to identify the sentence he would otherwise have imposed, had there not been assistance to the law enforcement authorities.  
     
      
    18 I consider that this ground of appeal should be upheld, but only to a limited extent. 
     
      
    19 In his remarks on sentence his Honour did say that the sentence he was about to impose was reduced by reason of the applicant’s assistance. His Honour did say that, apart from the reduction for the applicant’s assistance, the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed would have been three years three months. However, I accept that there was a breach of s21E of the Crimes Act, in that s 21E requires that, if a sentence is reduced because the offender has undertaken to co-operate (that is, has undertaken to provide future assistance) the court must state the sentence that would have been imposed but for that reduction. In the present case his Honour specified the amount by which the sentence was being reduced for assistance generally, both past assistance provided (for example, in making the two statements to the Federal Police) and future assistance undertaken to be provided (for example, in giving evidence at a trial of a co-offender) His Honour did not separately specify, as required by s21E, the amount the sentence was being reduced because of the future assistance undertaken to be provided.  
     
      
    20 I do not consider that this failure to comply with s21E, of itself, invalidates the sentence imposed by his Honour. However, this court should itself fix an amount for the reduction in sentence by reason of the future assistance undertaken to be provided by the applicant. I will return to this subject after I have dealt with the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three: The sentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate value to the applicant’s high level of assistance to law enforcement authorities.  
       
      
    21 It was submitted that the discount of thirty-three and a third percent for assistance allowed by his Honour was inadequate. I do not consider that this submission should be accepted. In Regina v Pang (1999) 105 A Crim R 474, Wood CJ at CL, with the concurrence of the other members of the court, said at paras 13 and 15, omitting citation of authority: 
     
      
       
        
        “(13) There is no fixed tariff for the reduction that should be given for assistance and so far no guideline judgment has been delivered in this area, however, the discount customarily given in this State for assistance has ranged between twenty and fifty percent of the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. 
         
         
        (15) Whatever discount is given, the imperative remains that the end result must not be so far out of touch with the circumstances of the particular offence and of the particular offender so as to constitute an affront to community standards.” 
        
       
      
    22 In Pang the Court of Criminal Appeal decided that a discount of twenty-five percent, which had been allowed by the sentencing judge, was insufficient and the Court of Criminal Appeal increased the amount of the discount to fifty percent. It is noteworthy that in Pang the offender had pleaded guilty and no separate discount had been allowed for the plea of guilty.  
     
      
    23 In Regina v El Hani, unreported [2004] NSWCCA 162, Howie J, with the concurrence of the other members of the court, said at paragraph 66: 
     
      
       
        
        “Prior to  
        Regina v Thomson and Houlton,  
        (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, it was the almost invariable practice for a sentencing judge to indicate that a single discount was being given for both the plea and the assistance. This was because there is a significant overlap between the factors reflected by the plea, contrition, rehabilitation and assistance.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour referred to Regina v Gallagher, (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 227-228 per Gleeson CJ. 
     
      
    25 At paragraphs 69 and 71 of his judgment in El Hani Howie J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(69) The guideline judgment in  
        Thomson and Houlton 
         was not intended to change the established practice in that regard. The guidelines specifically recognised at paragraph 160 that, in cases involving assistance to the authorities, a single combined quantification of a discount for both the plea and assistance will often be appropriate.” 
        
       
       
       … 
       
       
        
        “(71) The range of discount normally appropriate for assistance has been held to be twenty percent to fifty percent. The cases usually cited for support for such a range include  
        Cartwright  
        (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and  
        Regina V Chu 
         (NSWCCA unreported 16 October 1998). In  
        Chu,  
        the Chief Justice noted that English authorities, supporting a range up to two-thirds, had not apparently been followed in the State. It should be noted that  
        Cartwright 
         and  
        Chu 
         were both decided before  
        Thomson and Houlton  
        and were cases where the discount for assistance included the benefit to be received for a plea of guilty”. 
        
       
      
    26 In the present case the sentencing judge allowed a discount of about twenty percent for the plea of guilty and a separate discount of thirty-three and a third percent for the assistance from the applicant, making a combined discount for the plea of guilty and the assistance of more than fifty percent. In the light of the authorities I have referred to, I am unable to accept that the sentencing judge in sentencing the applicant failed to make an adequate allowance for the applicant’s assistance. 
     
      
    27 I would reject the third ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    28 Having rejected all of the three grounds of appeal, I would propose that, while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed, apart from the matter of apportioning the allowance for assistance between past assistance and future assistance undertaken to be provided. 
     
      
    29 There is necessarily some degree of arbitrariness in apportioning between past and future assistance the period of thirteen months allowed by his Honour for assistance generally. 
     
      
    30 As I have already indicated, the applicant made two statements to the Federal Police and we were informed on the hearing of this application that the applicant has already given evidence at a trial of the alleged co-offender Ong. However, at that trial the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on three counts and the jury was unable to agree on the remaining four counts in the indictment. We were informed that there is to be a new trial of Ong, at which it is anticipated that the applicant will give evidence.  
     
      
    31 The applicant provided information in relation to a man named Wickson. Wickson has not yet been charged and it is not known whether the applicant will be required to give evidence at a trial of Wickson.  
     
      
    32 Both counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Crown submitted that the total allowance for assistance should be apportioned, so that the greater part of the amount allowed was attributed to past assistance. It seems to me that a period of three months should be apportioned to future assistance. If a period of three months is apportioned to future assistance, then the sentence that would have been imposed but for the reduction for future assistance would have been two years five months.  
     
      
    33 The orders that I would propose are that leave to appeal should be granted, however, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed, subject to this court holding that the sentence that would have been imposed on the applicant, but for the future assistance which the applicant has undertaken to provide, would have been two years five months.  
     
      
    34 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by James J and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    35 BELL J: I also agree.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused has been charged, upon indictment, with offences that: 
     
      
       
      1. Between about 2 June 2003 and about 29 September 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did an act, namely, he acquired a Sterling brand 0.22 calibre rifle, in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act, namely, he threatened to kill officers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: s 101.6(1)  
      Criminal Code  
      1995 (Cth); 
       
       
      2. Between about 28 November 2003 and 3 December 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did an act, namely, he sold to an undercover police operative a video tape recording, six photographs depicting the accused and a three page typed statement for the sum of $3,000, in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act, namely, he threatened to kill officers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: s 101.6(1)  
      Criminal Code 
       1995 (Cth); 
       
       
      3. Between about 28 November 2003 and 3 December 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales: 
       
       
        
        (a) made to another person, namely, to undercover officer using an assumed name “Greg” (the second person) a threat to cause serious harm to a third person, namely, he threatened to kill unidentified officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; and  
        
       
       
       (b) the third person is a public official; and 
       
       
        
        (c) he was reckless as to causing the second person to fear that the threat will be carried out; and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) he made the threat because of the official’s status as a public official; and 
        
       
       
       (e) the official is a Commonwealth public official. 
       
      
    2 Three pre trial motions have been brought on for hearing before me. 
     
      
      THE NEW SOUTH WALES POLICE SERVICE MOTION  
       
      [Paragraphs formerly numbered 3 - 27 not for publication] 
       
      MOTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
       
      [Paragraphs formerly numbered 3 - 27 not for publication] 
       
       
       
       
      NOTICE OF MOTION OF THE ACCUSED 
       
      
    3 The substantial argument in this preliminary hearing concerned the motion of the accused to disallow the tender of the evidence relating to “Greg’s” dealings with the accused between 27 November 2003 and 3 December 2003, including the recordings of their conversations which were intercepted pursuant to listening device or telephone interception warrants. Additionally the motion seeks exclusion of the video tape and other items which were handed to “Greg” by the accused on 3 December. The submission which is advanced in support of the exclusion depends upon contentions that at the relevant times: 
     
      
       
      (a) Greg was engaged in conduct that was unlawful involving offences by him under ss 11.2 and 11.4 of the Criminal Code, in so far as his conduct was not covered by a Controlled Operations Certificate issued pursuant to the  
      Crimes Act 
       1914; 
       
       
      (b) Greg was engaged in improper conduct in so far as he made misrepresentations concerning himself in his conversations with the accused, which led to the offending by the accused, to the admissions which were obtained, and to the handing over of the videotape.  
       
      
    4 As a consequence, exclusion of the evidence was sought under ss 90 and 138 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
       
      BACKGROUND 
       
      
    5 A consideration of this motion requires some elaboration of the background to the case, and an understanding of what occurred in the course of the undercover operation. 
     
      
    6 The brief, which was tendered along with some additional exhibits, discloses the following matters, in summary. 
     
      
    7 On 7 June 2002 DFAT advised the accused that the Minister had refused his application for a passport, following an adverse security assessment supplied by ASIO, on the grounds that the Minister was of the opinion that “he was likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice the security of Australia or of a foreign country”. 
     
      
    8 On 12 June 2002 New South Wales Police conducted an informal interview with the accused during which he expressed views about becoming a martyr, of bringing Jihad to Australia, and of becoming a suicide bomber. 
     
      
    9 Between 2 June 2003 and 28 September 2003 telephone interception recorded the accused engaging in various conversations and text messages which, on the Crown case, are capable of being understood as involving inquiries about the obtaining of a weapon. 
     
      
    10 On 28 September 2003, acting on information that the accused had acquired a rifle from a man “Charlie” on 27 September 2003, a search warrant was executed by members of the NSW Police Service at the home of the accused. In the course of the search police found and took into their possession, amongst other things, a 0.22 calibre Sterling brand rifle, a magazine for that rifle containing three rounds, a quantity of 0.22 ammunition, a balaclava, a videotape, and a number of documents. 
     
      
    11 These documents included a handwritten message for ASIO concealed in the battery compartment of a tape recorder, referring to his complaints about being wronged by ASIO in denying him a passport, indicating an intention to “take ASIO building hostage”, and to “take the life of every ASIO officer I get my hands on”, and referring to the need for the government to “change, stop harassing Muslims, and stop spying on them, and stop supporting America and its government”. 
     
      
    12 In another document located in the same place there were statements to the effect that his target was ASIO and that he was declaring a personal Jihad against his oppressors “to please Allah” for the “weak or helpless Australian citizens who have had their rights abused, or their freedom taken away from them, or their privacy invaded”. It went on to note that he had chosen “to die to divert the attention of the government and its various organisations to a certain degree away from this blasphemy of certain individuals…” 
     
      
    13 Various other documents were seized, including one entitled “How can I train myself for Jihad” and one entitled “statements made by fone” apparently comprising explanations for various claims such as “I want to be a suicide bomber”, “I feel like hijacking a plane and hitting Canberra” and so on. Additionally, there was a copy of a transcript of an interview in which he had participated with Alan Jones on 15 October 2002, and a transcript of the Sunday Program on Channel 9 in which he had also participated.  
     
      
    14 Further documents seized included correspondence, apparently addressed to ASIO. Images were taken of documents purporting to be his last will, which was not, however, seized. 
     
      
    15 When the accused was taken to Bankstown Police Station, he declined the request of police that he be interviewed in relation to the location of the firearm at his premises.  
     
      
    16 After being charged in relation to the firearms offences he was, on 30 October 2003, convicted of those offences and was fined $1400. A Crown appeal was brought against that sentence which was listed for hearing in the District Court in March 2004. 
     
      
    17 An appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which the accused had lodged in relation to the refusal of his passport application, was listed for a resumption of the hearing on 9 December 2003. 
     
      
    18 Between 28 September 2003 and 17 October 2003, further telephone conversations were intercepted which, on the Crown case, could be consistent with the accused making further inquiries for the acquisition of a weapon. 
     
      
    19 Further information was obtained which led to concerns on the part of police, particularly the Counter Terrorist Command of the NSW Police Service, that the accused might be planning a terrorist act, as a consequence of which a decision was made to conduct an undercover operation. It was known by that stage that the accused had been in contact with the media, particularly “The Australian”. 
     
      
    20 To that end, the services of the Undercover Branch of the NSW Police Services were engaged, and, at a briefing attended by Detective Inspector Schagen and Detective Sergeant Abeyasekara on 27 November 2003, “Greg” was supplied with certain information, including the fact of the prior arrest of the accused on the firearms offences, and the recovery of documents in his home, that were suggestive of a plan to kill ASIO operatives.  
     
      
    21 He was given instructions to endeavour to meet the accused, posing as a journalist, and to engage him in discussion.  
     
      
    22 It was the evidence of Greg, on the voir dire, that as he understood the operation and his instructions, at that stage, it was to speak to Greg and to establish whether he had a plan to cause serious injury or death to an officer attached to ASIO or DFAT. He also accepted that he understood that, if the existence of this plan was confirmed, the conversations with him would be likely to be used as evidence against the accused in a criminal prosecution. He also accepted that if the earlier possession by the accused of a rifle and the location by police of his papers came up in conversation, they could be addressed.  
     
      
    23 Following the briefing, Greg made a telephone call to the accused on 27 November introducing himself as a journalist who had read a recent article about him in the Australian newspaper and who was inquiring as to whether he could do another story on him. The accused volunteered that he had sold something to The Australian and had something else up for sale. The call culminated in the arrangement of a meeting with the accused for 28 November. 
     
      
       
      The 28 November Meeting 
       
      
    24 To that meeting Greg took a hand held recorder, an act that was consistent with his assumed role as a journalist. He also wore a listening device, pursuant to warrant, so as to secretly record their conversations. 
     
      
    25 It is pertinent to refer to some segments of this first conversation, so far as they are relevant for the objection, and for the consideration of any discretion that might exist, at common law, or under the Evidence Act, concerning the admissibility of the conversation, or any part of it.  
     
      
    26 Without being exhaustive, since there is a degree of repetition, relevant segments include the following exchanges, which occurred after the accused indicated that he wanted to check whether Greg or his car were wired (V1: Greg; V2: Accused): 
     
      
       
        
        “V2: Well what kind of questions are you going to ask me? So that I know. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Ah, well really I’m lookin’ at um, um, what’s happened with your passport and… 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Mm him. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: ..and the sort of problems you’re facing there. And I’m looking at um, ASIO in particular. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Mm him. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Um, you know, ‘cause they’re tryin’ to get more powers and all the rest of it… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: All right. Ah, I just want to know what paper do you work for? You told me, so you’re an individual.. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah, freelance. Freelance…” 
        
       
       
      
    27 The conversation continued after an inquiry by Greg as to what had occurred, in relation to his passport application, in the course of which the accused mentioned having been “interrogated” by ASIO officers as follows (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V1: Do you know why, do you know why they picked you, though? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Nuh, don’t have a clue. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Like, have you done anything.. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: No. I’ve got a clear record except for that, the armed rifle that I had in my house.” 
        
       
       
      
    28 He then said in relation to his concerns with ASIO and the Tribunal (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V1: But in your own mind why do you think, why do you think… 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I’ve got a very good clue. It’s, they’ve intercepted some of my phone calls. Um, I’ve said things over the phone, that, “I wish to become a suicide bomber, I will die for my religion, um, um, I will die for any cause that’s worthy of living, worthy of life.” 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: But they take it literally instead of taking it metaphorically…” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29 The conversation moved on, after further discussions in relation to the Tribunal appeal, to the police search on 28 September, after which Greg asked him some questions about the rifle charges, in the course of which the accused made reference to their outcome and to the Crown appeal. The conversation then returned to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of which the accused volunteered that he did not know if he should go on with it because of the “paperworks” that were taken out of his house. 
     
      
    30 The conversation continued in relation to the “Paperworks” (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V1: Paperwork? What, what sort of paperwork are you talking about? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Similar stuff to what The Australian had on the paper.” 
        
       
       
      
    31 Greg then asked him a number of further questions about the documents and what he intended to do with the letter (V1: Greg; V2: Accused): 
     
      
       
        
        “V2: Mm. Um, the thing is if I tell you then you might put it in the papers or you might give it up. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Well.. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: ‘Cause The Australian um, didn’t make a contract but I assured them that, “If you keep that a secret then I’ll give you something else that will be very useful in the future for your um, industry and your (unintelligible)”. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay. Well like I said to you last night mate, that’s where I’m different. I’m not actually affiliated to any group. So um, you know, anything that’s confidence between us is confidence between us. I don’t have to disclose everything because I don’t have to report to anybody ‘cause I work for myself and try to sell my story.” 
        
       
       
      
    32 It was at this point that the accused asked that the recording of the conversation by the hand held recorder cease. Permission to restart it was not given. 
     
      
    33 The conversation continued in relation to the paperwork after Greg’s observation that “I want to know what you’re talking about” (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V2: That’s the thing. Should I um, let you know? ‘Cause I’m – look, I’m not trying to say I don’t trust ya, but then again you have to understand where I’m coming from. Know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. So what are you, what are you saying to me? That something you’ve got written in these notes is going to cause you some trouble? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Not so much cause me trouble. It’s more like of a, of a revenge thing to what ASIO’s done to me in the past two years. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Revenge against ASIO? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: All right. Well like I said to you before, um, I’m sort of trying to do some sort of story expose on the power that they’re trying to gain. It’s just getting out of hand. So um, bear that in mind. Um.. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: …is your problem with that that you talk about things that you, you want to do or talk about things that have happened to you, or? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: No. It’s more like what I’m about to do. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: So you have all that spelled out there, what, what you intend to do? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yep.” 
        
       
       
      
    34 After some further discussions concerning the accused’s grievance and notes, the conversation continued (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V1: And is that what’s outlined in your notes there? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: And when you say “take ‘em down with me” (stutters) who is that you’re talking about? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: ASIO.” 
        
       
       
      
    35 Then followed some conversations about what had appeared in the article in the Australian newspaper, what it was that the accused had given to the journalist for that newspaper, and why he had done so. Greg then returned to his cover story, and to the recently expanded powers of ASIO, commencing with the observation:  
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah. Well that’s basically what I’m doing is to try and support what’s happened to you because I’m looking at everything that’s happening with the powers that ASIO are getting. You know they’re going through um, through the government at the moment to try and increase their powers.” 
        
       
      
    36 After this he made inquiries as to whether the accused had “anything else at home” to which there was the following reply (V1: Greg; V2: Accused): 
     
      
       
        
        “V2: Just pictures. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: But they’re up for sale. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Are they? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yeah. It’s how I work.. All the reporters know this is the only way Zak Mallah does business is you can take the story down but when it comes to pictures he ends up charging ‘em.” 
        
       
      
    37 Greg asked whether he had anything else or kept anything on computer, after which the accused volunteered that he was thinking of “dropping off the Tribunal case”, and offered the reason for that. The conversation continued in relation to what he had for sale and the asking price for it (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V1: So what do I do? It’s up to them. It’s just that I know (unintelligible) do. I want to get my life together or there’s gunna be dramas. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: And that’s why I sold the pictures, you know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: Just to pay off my bills, pay off that fourteen hundred dollar fine whatever.” 
        
       
       
      
    38 After identifying from the amount of the debts which the accused mentioned, that he was looking for about $3000, “depending on what Greg wanted”, the conversation continued (V1: Greg; V2: Accused): 
     
      
       
        
        “V1: What about photos? Things like the photos that The Australian printed.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: Like really we’ll go back to my house now, I can show ‘em to you. Um, we’ll make a price. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: And do you have anything else? You know is there anything else that I could make some money out of and you can make some money out of? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I’d love to speak to you on so many things but they’re not – I don’t really know you yet… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: ‘Cause one day I’ll click, it’s gunna be breaking news. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: That’s when I need youse around… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: My lawyer gives me advice, don’t talk to journalists, don’t talk to reporters, but he doesn’t know really what I’m up to. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: That’s why I need you guys, and him, for one day for that day. Um, ‘cause then I don’t know you yet, that’s the thing, that’s the only thing stopping me.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Now we can work together in a sense that when it comes to stories we can work together on that. When it comes to what I’m likely to do whatever, I need you out because I don’t want you to take my place. I don’t want the government think that this guy’s either (a) working for him or working with him, you know what I mean?” 
        
       
      
    39 After the accused referred to having “something you can make so much money from”, and to the Australian paper being “this close from getting it, I’m just waiting for a phone call”, the conversation continued (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V2: How much money do you make for pictures and all that when you do sell ‘em out? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Well that’s hard to say because it depends on who you sell ‘em to. If I was to sell – if I can get a good enough story together for say Time Magazine, then I make a lot of money. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Well whatever I’ve got will hit Time Magazine and I’m telling you that (unintelligible) channel will be here too. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: The um, if it’s worth television time well then that’s worth a lot more too, you know. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: It’s worth television. I tell you that.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    40 The accused mentioned having sold some pictures to The Australian and to having said to its reporters that he had something else to give to them, and of waiting for a call, after which the conversation continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “V1: All right. So you are expecting to hear about that today? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yep. I said it better be today or then I’m gunna pass it onto someone else. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. So if I uses what you’re talking about, if you’re saying it’s value for TV, I’m guessing it’s a video. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: How much money can you make for a video? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Well if it’s – it depends what’s on it, Zak, it depends what’s on it because if there’s something that, for want of a better term, if there’s something that’s shocking… 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Mm him. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: …that is going to shock the public, then the TV channels will pay more for that to get that impact. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: It’s like my final message, you know what I mean?… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Is it um, do you talk about, is it like um, I don’t know, a will or is it explaining what happened or why it happened or? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yeah it’s explaining the reasons and actions on my – the reasons and um, apparently the reasons why I’m likely to conduct this action.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    41 After Greg asked whether he could see the video, the conversation continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “V2: It’s not with me to set up. It’s at a mate’s house I got to go get it off him.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: Oh right. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Just in case my house gets raided again. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Um, this video’s extreme, it’s my final message. That day when it comes it’s gunna be breaking news hopefully. I’ll make sure it is and in the media I’m gunna die, I’ve got footage of anything of… 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: ..as my last and final will. No-one’s got it at the moment.” 
        
       
      
    42 Arrangements were then discussed for there to be a further meeting at which Greg could view the video using some form of video equipment, after which there was some further conversation concerning Greg acquiring the tape and the amount to be paid for it (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V2: Um, if you keep this um private and confidential (unintelligible) the thing is if you’re gunna sell it everyone’s gunna know who you are. You know what I mean? And you (stutters) have to prepare yourself for so much shit from the police. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: And if you’re up for that you’re more than welcome as long as you just say yes or no, if it’s no then you’ll call me up tonight and…” 
        
       
      
    43 After some further discussions the accused confirmed that “Three grand’s the mark”. The meeting concluded with the accused indicating, as he had to The Australian, that he was willing to do business, subject to putting Greg to a test, namely, that if he found police in front of his house in the next couple of hours then he would know that he had been betrayed. Although it was not said, the clear inference was that there would be no further discussions, if that occurred.  
     
      
       
      The 1 December Meeting 
       
      
    44 Greg then arranged a second meeting with the accused for 1 December. The objective, he said, was “firstly to view the videotape and then, depending on what was on it, to try to make arrangements to obtain it”. The overall operational objective, he said, was still to find out more information about any plan that the accused had. For that reason he took equipment to view and listen to the tape, some of the contents of which became incorporated in the transcript of the conversation which was again recorded by way of a listening device, on 1 December 2003. 
     
      
    45 He accepted that when questioning the accused about his intentions, he had done so in an endeavour to get him to provide answers that he expected would be used in evidence against him. He also accepted that he had indicated to the accused, in the course of the conversation, that he was not going to tell others anything about their discussions, and that he could remain of the belief that their conversations were “completely confidential.” 
     
      
    46 Again, without being exhaustive, there was an extended conversation during which the videotape was played, reference was made by the accused to his discussions with journalists from Channels 7 and 9, and the Daily Telegraph, and some questions were asked in relation to what appeared on the tape, and as to what was intended. 
     
      
    47 The following excerpts are of relevance (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V2: Right, this is the deal, if – when you know this, the Australian newspaper knows this and um, um, Charles has got a bit of a hint, but I’m going to let you in on what’s going to happen. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm him.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: The night that I was raided, I had a rifle as you know. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I was raided on Monday night, Thursday morning, I was meant to take the rifle to a building in the city and take the building hostage. Okay? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: That building, I won’t tell you what it is, later on I’ll tell you exactly what it is, but I’ve got three buildings in mind. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: They’re all in the city. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Now I’m gunna be in the building, I told the Australian that I want youse to be in the building for a live exclusive interview. Now that they’ve rejected to buy this, it looks like I’m gunna give you permission to enter the building.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: For an exclusive interview between me and you. The police have no choice but to let you in, or then otherwise I’m gunna shoot someone in the building, you know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Um, so whoever purchases this, this tape, number one it’s got something that the media is gunna look up to. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Number two, um, exclusive interview between me and you. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm him. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Which this gives you more money, once you give it up. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Number three, I got four demands. Number one, Alexander Downer gets down from power, number two, Denis Richardson, the head um officer, whatever from ASIO gets down. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm him, mm him. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: My freedom is given back to me. And number four is I want my name – my file, Zak MALLAH to be cleared. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Now I know the first two I won’t get – it’s automatically, that’s enough. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Then the – the squads are gunna come in, the counter-terrorism command, they’re gunna come in the whole streets gunna be closed. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: The reporters are gunna be there. Now you’ve got an advantage that they don’t have. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: You’re the only one that’s gunna be in the building. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: “Eye for an eye, freedom for freedom. I will free my freedom by death and take them hostage.” Cause once I’m in the building, it’s an automatic licence to kill, you know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: They’re gunna get up there and they’re gunna shoot me, you know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay. (Pause) Mate um, that’s – that’s very heavy stuff. When we were talking about you selling this video, right, now I – I don’t know how to say this without making it sound as though its pushy, but like the video of itself isn’t worth much unless something happens, and I’m not saying go and do it. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: It’s not a problem, all I’m trying to say is I can take this with me to the building, you know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Right. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: And so whoever is willing to come up and give me three grand for it.. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I’m willing to take it. That way the three grand’s with me so that when I die I’ll leave a message that this three grand is passed on to my family, you know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay. You said to me before that you were thinking of three buildings. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yep.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: What are you thinking of? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Well I’ve mentioned two, there’s one I won’t mention at the moment. ASIO and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: They’re the three main – ASIO is a bit of a problem, it’s a top secret location, but I can get access to it. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Department for Foreign Affairs I need to check it out and see how many – just police are in there or not, ‘cause I want to last there for at least a couple of hours. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: To send my strong message out there before I get shot.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Um, and there’s one that’s even easier than those two but I won’t mention it yet. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Have you got yourself a weapon or something like that mate? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: It’s waiting for me, but I can’t – Islamically I cannot do anything or die as a martyr, unless all my bills are paid off. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay, and so is that the reason that you’re putting prices… 
        
       
       
        
        V2: That’s the reason, that’s the reason. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: ..on the things that you have? So.. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Now you, I can make a deal with you. For three grand you can take everything pictures, that statement that’s worth one and these two together for three. It’s enough for me to pay off all my debt, okay? Say bye to family and friends, get myself a suit, fix myself up because I can ‘t just walk in there looking like a tragic junk. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I’m telling you that though when that day comes, the whole street is going to be closed (unintelligible) the police surrounding us, the ambulance, the police, the counter terrorism command, the helicopters.. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: ..it’s gunna be breaking news, Channel Ten, Channel Nine, I’ll make sure you break the news, and everyone wants to go up there, well they’ll want a live exclusive interview, they’ve got to call in negotiators. I’m like, sorry mate, the only one I want up there is you.. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: For a strong message and this is gunna be with you, I don’t know how, once it’s with you I don’t care how you do it, but as long as in a couple of days time this also hits the TV. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: So the choice is yours and if you decide to withdraw from this and I’ve got other reporters as well. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        V1: So in effect I think what you’re saying to me is if I don’t take it and somebody else does take it, and you pay off your debts then it’s all systems go. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yeah, it’s all go. Green lights. If I get the three grand today, I’m off tomorrow. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I want breaking news in less than two minutes, all right, the negotiator said, “All right we can’t have breaking news in two minutes, you have to give us at least twenty minutes, half an hour.” “Beautiful sweet. Half an hour, or I’m gunna take one down. I want to hit breaking news and then that’s when you come in.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Look, it’s a licence to kill. I’m gunna be shot, I’m gunna be killed, that’s the way the squad works. You know what I mean? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: It’s very heavy stuff mate. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: That’s the way they work mate, I’m really, I’ve come to a point where I’m gunna sacrifice my blood for myself, for my freedom for the Australian way of life ‘case they are a threat, you know what I mean? Few years ago I never had this thought of taking people hostage, killing people um, you know taking, it’s just – all this, all these pictures that I’ve made, this… 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
      
    48 Arrangements were then made for Greg to ring him back on the following day.  
     
      
       
      The 3 December Meeting 
       
      
    49 On the afternoon of 3 December 2003 at 4:30 PM a Controlled Operations Certificate was obtained pursuant to the Crimes Act. Evidence concerning the obtaining of this certificate was given by Detective Sergeant Abeyasekara, Detective Inspector Schagen and Detective Sergeant Gawel, the latter two of whom were attached to the Counter Terrorism Coordination Command. 
     
      
    50 Detective Sergeant Abeyasekara who was Greg’s supervisor in the Undercover Unit confirmed that, by 27 November, police had some information suggestive of the accused having a videotape that had been offered for sale, and that one objective of the operation was to discover if it did exist and if so to acquire it. He said that he had not personally considered the option of the accused being invited to speak to police or to surrender himself if he had a videotape and a plan in connection with it.  
     
      
    51 He said that, when he was first informed of the operation, he spoke to his coordinator, Inspector Mark Jones, about the possibility of obtaining a Controlled Operations Certificate, and was informed by him that he had mentioned the matter to Detective Inspector Schagen who was going to make some inquiries in relation to it.  
     
      
    52 He acknowledged that he had not been familiar with Part 1AB of the Crimes Act (Cth) dealing with Controlled Operations and had not read the relevant sections. He left it to Detective Inspector Schagen to make the necessary inquiries. He also acknowledged not being familiar, other than generally, with the Commonwealth legislation that criminalises conduct associated with acts of terrorism. 
     
      
    53 He confirmed that by the morning of 28 November, he had known of the recovery of the rifle, and of papers indicating the existence of a plan to kill ASIO operatives, and that Greg had on the preceding day posed as a journalist when speaking to the accused in order to arrange a meeting. While he had no specific recollection of discussing with Greg the topic of a Controlled Operations Certificate, it seems that his reconstruction, based upon usual practice, led him to a “vague memory” that it had been mentioned on 27 November. 
     
      
    54 He had no memory of whether or not Inspector Schagen had informed him of his opinion as to the need for a certificate on 28 November, but said he had a vague memory of a conversation concerning that matter after the second meeting on 1 December.  
     
      
    55 This followed, on his account, a discussion within the Undercover Unit involving its Commander, Chief Inspector Ian Bown, and other members, to the effect that it might be prudent to obtain a certificate before the third meeting and the purchase of the videotape. He did not give consideration himself to whether or not Greg’s acts might constitute offences under the terrorism laws, nor did he give consideration, prior to the third meeting, to whether his conduct might have involved inciting, or counselling, or procuring a crime.  
     
      
    56 Detective Inspector Schagen gave evidence of becoming involved in investigations in relation to the accused, he thought, on the night of 28 September 2003, shortly before execution of the search warrant. He said that he had been involved in the subsequent investigation concerning him. By 27 November, he said, he had reached the view that the inquiry would be assisted by an undercover operative posing as a journalist, in an endeavour to engage the accused in conversation. He acknowledged that the operation would involve the use of listening devices and that if evidence was obtained through their use it would be used in a criminal prosecution of the accused.  
     
      
    57 It was his recollection that he had discussed with Detective Sergeant Abeyasekara the possible need for a Controlled Operations Certificate before the first meeting, at which time he had decided there was no need for one as he did not consider that any unlawful activity was being undertaken by Greg. He did not do anything to check whether this was correct. It would appear that, in this regard, he relied upon the fact that there would be no commitment to acquire the videotape until it was known what was on it, as distinct from encouragement being given to the accused to produce it for viewing. 
     
      
    58 He confirmed that, on the night of 1 December, Detective Sergeant Abeyasekara had advised him of the Undercover Branch’s opinion that a Certificate may be required.  
     
      
    59 He rejected the feasibility of any alternative options to the use of an undercover operative, such as calling in the accused for interview under caution; securing his interrogation and production of documents or objects under the ASIO legislation; or obtaining the videotape by means of a search warrant, pointing out in the latter regard that there was no certainty as to its location, a somewhat accurate response having regard to the accused’s observation, during the discussions with Greg, that it was kept at a “mate’s house” to avoid being found by police.  
     
      
    60 Detective Sergeant Gawel who was seconded to the Joint Counter Terrorism Command and who, for that purpose, was sworn as a special member of the Australian Federal Police, gave evidence of being responsible, together with Detective O’Neil for the application for the Controlled Operations Certificate on 3 December. He confirmed being aware of the September arrest of the accused on the firearm charges, and of the belief that was held that the rifle had been associated with an attempt on the life of ASIO officers or Government officials. He said, however, that he had been unaware that the accused had declined to answer questions, at the time of his arrest, in relation to the firearm. The Certificate which he prepared disclosed that the offences which might be committed by the undercover officer, absent a Certificate, were those arising under the Commonwealth Criminal Code under s 101.5(1) of knowingly collecting or making documents likely to facilitate a terrorist act, under section 101.5(1) acts done in preparation for or planning terrorist acts; and under s 103.1(1) financing terrorism.  
     
      
    61 After the certificate was obtained (that is, at 1656 hours), Greg made arrangements by telephone to meet the accused in order to obtain the tape. He took with him $3000 to the meeting for the purpose of purchasing the videotape. 
     
      
    62 He agreed that his intention had been both to acquire the videotape and “to try and ascertain from [the accused] what his intention was and how serious it was”. Additionally he acknowledged knowing that the tape of the conversation was likely to be used as evidence against the accused in a criminal prosecution. He said that, consistently with instructions given to him by Detective Inspector Schagen the questioning also had the purpose of giving the accused the opportunity of saying that he “wasn’t serious” about the matters discussed. He accepted that he understood that the accused may well have already committed a number of serious offences and that any answers elicited could be used against him in the prosecution of those offences. 
     
      
    63 In the course of this meeting, Greg paid over the $3000, and in return obtained the videotape after checking it and confirming that it was the only one, in existence along with some photographs and some notes. During these discussions, the accused disclosed having withdrawn his appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because “its not worth it”. Without being exhaustive in relation to all of the relevant excerpts, having regard to the repetition of the message conveyed, that conversation included the following passage (V1: Greg; V2: Accused):  
     
      
       
        
        “V2: What’s your plans on how you’re going to sell (unintelligible) hit TV? 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Well that’s what I need to sort of work out with you, is we’re talking about this exclusive ah, exclusive – I’ll just put that in there. Um, the exclusive um, story… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: …you said um, that there were three places that you had in mind.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: It’s gone down, it’s gone down to two now. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Down to two? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I withdrawed, you know, the Tribunal. So that can’t be much of a (unintelligible) any more. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: All right. You’ve taken the Tribunal out? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: So who are you looking at, mate? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Number one, it’s the ASIO building, but to get there is pretty hard. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: So I’m not going to lie to you. Most probably it’s going to be the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trading. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: So that’s why I’m, I’m sort of saying you know, having given you the money for this video um, you know, I just want to make sure that… 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Nuh.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: ..you mean, you mean what you’re talkin’ about. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: (Stutters) If anything, it could be even tomorrow. Honestly. The problem is I might need three days to, three to four days to get access to that. Now, if it’s couple of boys are willing to give it to me. Know what I mean?  
        
       
       
        
        V1: They wouldn’t give it to you? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Willing to give it to me. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Oh, willing to give the gun? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: To give it to me, yep. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: What are you talking about, mate? A, a rifle or a hand gun? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Oh, just a hand gun. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: All right. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: I don’t need a rifle any more, you know? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Um, if I get one tonight… 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: …I’m going to give you the – you, you must leave your phone on as well… 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: …tonight at midnight. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Oh fuck. Sorry. Yeah, keep going. I’ll leave my phone on tonight, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: If the gun, if the gun’s in my hand by tonight you’re going to receive a message by me saying um, the game is on.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Tomorrow, be in the city. Um, I’ll give you an exact time. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: ‘Cause first thing in the morning I’m going to go down there, check out the building. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: (Stutters) It’s the Department of Foreign Affairs where the passports come out from. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Okay. Is there somebody that, in particular there that… 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Oh mate, they’re all guilty of the same things, mate. They’re all run by Alexander Downer, mate. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: So you’re going to try to get hold of a hand gun tonight? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yep. Most probably I should have one by tonight. Most probably. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: You should have it by tonight? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Most probably. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: And that’s the message you’re going to give me? Are you going to let me know either way? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Um, look, once it’s in my hand… 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Right. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: …you’re going to cop a message by me saying, “It’s Zak. The game is on.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: My plan is to last in there for a long period of time. I don’t know how long the stand off will be. Could be up to two, three hours. Four hours. Could be even up to nine hours. There was a scene in America, a youth took a school hostage. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: He was in there for nine hours. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Now, if I can make it to nine hours, that’s sweet.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: It’s enough time for you, to get you in and um – ‘cause another thing as well, you know, you see, there’s a problem. Like, I can get you in. I haven’t got a problem with that, ‘cause I want you to get in ‘cause… 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: …it’s an exclusive between me and you now. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: The thing is I want a camera there as well. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mate, I can carry a, a, a handycam or a video camera. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: That’s what I need. I don’t want to get Channel Seven and all that involved because it’s just for you. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: And um, are you going to want to make something like a political statement? Or what’s it going to be? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Mainly what I’ve told you. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: And, and you want to say on that who you’re… 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        V1: …particularly targeting? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: ASIO, Alexander Downer. Um, Alexander Downer, Dennis Richardson from ASIO. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Um, the Government of Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: So do you intend to die? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Well I’ve got nothing to live for. I mean, death is the, probably death is the best thing out now. Know what I mean?  
        
       
       
        
        V1: Do you intend to kill any ah, hostages? 
        
       
       
        
        V2: My first aim is to walk in and take two down automatically. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: So look, I, I’m the type of person that takes the first step first. Number one, is to get into the building, take them hostage… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: The police call me, the negotiators. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yep. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: And the, the squad, the streets close, the (unintelligible) I’m going to call all the media. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Get them running things. This is, I want this breaking news. I’m going to take another hostage down. Then they’re going to say, “Could we go up there and have an interview with you?” I’m going to refuse. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: That’s when I tell police to call you up.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: When I say the game’s on, in other words, get ready for tomorrow. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: See, it has to be in the afternoon, not in the morning. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: No.  
        
       
       
        
        V2: The morning is the time when I examine and investigate the building.” 
        
       
      
    64 Shortly after this discussion concluded the accused was arrested and a search warrant was executed. In the course thereof the $3000 paid over by Greg was recovered and a number of other documents were seized or obtained, including a document entitled “Court”, a copy of his will, a plastic toy pistol, a document headed “Jihad”, a videotape entitled “Palestine Interfada and Suicide Bomber”, and a statement referring to the accused’s target being ASIO. 
     
      
    65 The accused declined to be interviewed and also declined to have the services of a lawyer, although he did answer certain questions put to him in the course of the search of his premises which were electronically recorded.  
     
      
       
      Committal Evidence 
       
      
    66 In addition to the evidence which was led on the voir dire concerning the undercover activities involving Greg, and the issue of the Controlled Operations Certificate, the committal transcript was tendered which included the cross-examination of Greg, Detective Inspector Schagen, and Detective Sergeant Gawel. 
     
      
    67 This evidence does not materially add to the evidence led before me, save to a limited extent. For example “Greg” admitted having said a number of things to the accused, on 28 November that were deliberately false in order to win his confidence, and to make it more likely that he would disclose information to him. He said that, while the possible need for a Controlled Operation Certificate had been discussed with him before 3 December, he had not seen the certificate until that day, and had not previously thought that one was needed; 
     
      
    68 Detective Inspector Schagen gave some additional evidence to the effect that he had never considered that a Certificate was needed; that it was only following the expression of an opinion by members of the Undercover Branch, after the 1 December meeting, that one may be required, that he spoke to Federal Agent Hurst; and that it was as a matter of prudence that he asked for a certificate to be obtained. It was his recollection that Detective Sergeant Gawel had shared his view that no certificate was required, but confirmed that he had not sought legal advice on the issue, and had not specifically read the provisions contained in Part 1AB of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Detective Sergeant Gawel confirmed that it was in the course of discussions with Detective Inspector Schagen after the second meeting that they considered that the prudent thing to do was to obtain a certificate since Greg may be committing an offence in buying the videotape from the accused. He confirmed that he was aware of the provisions of Part 1AB of the Commonwealth legislation.  
     
      
       
      The Relevant Legislation 
       
      
    69 The substantive sections of the Criminal Code Act under which the accused was charged are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        101.6 Other acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A person commits an offence if the person does any act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act. 
         
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for life. 
         
         
        (2) A person commits an offence under subsection (1) even if the terrorist act does not occur. 
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        147.2 Threatening to cause harm to a Commonwealth public official etc.

        (5) A person may be found guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence even if the principal offender has not been prosecuted or has not been found guilty.

        (1) A person who urges the commission of an offence is guilty of the offence of incitement.  
         
         
        (2) For the person to be guilty, the person must intend that the offence incited be committed… 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
       
        
       
      
    74 In arguing for the exclusion of the intercepted conversations involving Greg, and of the videotape and other items received by him on 3 December, the defence relies on ss 90 and 138 of the Evidence Act. Those provisions are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        90 
        . In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a Defendant to use the evidence. 
         
        
       
       
        
        138 
         (1) Evidence that was obtained: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to be taken into account: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the probative value of the evidence, and  
        
       
       (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
       
        
         
          
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
           
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
           
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognized by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
           
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and  
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. 
          
         
        
       
       
       
      WAS THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED IMPROPERLY OR IN CONTRAVENTION OF AN AUSTRALIAN LAW, OR IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN IMPROPRIETY? 
       
      
    75 The submission needs to be considered in the light of the strong suspicions, which the police had by 27 November, based upon the items found during the 28 September search, the telephone intercepts preceding and following that event, and the media disclosures, that the accused had a plan involving a threat to kill or seriously injure some ASIO employees, and perhaps others. 
     
      
    76 It seems not to have been known, or even suspected by police, before the disclosures made during the 1 December meeting, that the accused intended to have a journalist present who could witness whatever he had in mind, and then release the videotape to the public, via an appropriate media outlet, together with whatever article that journalist might prepare.  
     
      
    77 Mr Boulten accepted, as he obviously must, that it was never intended by police that the accused should proceed with his hostage taking plan, or that he should cause harm, or kill, any ASIO or DFAT official. The undercover operation at all times was designed to ascertain precisely what the plan was and to prevent it being carried into execution.  
     
      
    78 It was the defence submission, however, that what Greg did, from 27 November onwards, amounted to an aiding, abetting, counselling, or procuring the accused to commit the act charged in Count 2, in so far as he made inquiries about the videotape, and engaged in discussions encouraging the accused to sell it to him.  
     
      
    79 It was that sale which was the actus reus charged for Count 2. It followed, so it was submitted, that Greg’s conduct constituted an offence under s 11.2 of the Criminal Code Act.  
     
      
    80 Alternatively, it was submitted, Greg’s act involved an aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring in so far as he encouraged the accused to come to another meeting, any such attendance being a step in the preparation or planning for the act of terrorism. 
     
      
    81 As was pointed out, the s 101.6(1) offence is made out if the accused does an act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act, and in that respect extends criminal culpability beyond the kind of conduct that is required, at law, to constitute an offence of attempt, that is, something which involves more than mere preparation: R v MAI and Anor (1992) 26 NSWLR 371.  
     
      
    82 While the statutory definition of a “terrorist act” is less than happy, read in context it must be understood as including a threat of action, which: 
     
      
       
      (i) if carried out, would have one or other of the consequences mentioned in subs(2) of the definition; and 
       
       
      (ii) was made with the intention of advancing one or other of the causes, or of having one or other of the results, referred to in paras (b) and (c) of subs(1); and  
       
       
      (ii) does not fall within the ambit of subs(3). 
       
      
    83 For the purposes of the present submission, no argument is advanced by the accused as to whether the threats which were identified as “terrorist acts” in Counts 1 and 2 would fall within the definition of a “terrorist act”, that is, whether they would have possessed the necessary intention required in subs (1)(b) and (c) and would not have been excepted by reason of subs (3). The argument proceeds upon the basis that if what the accused had in mind constituted a threat of action within the meaning of the section, then Greg’s conduct amounted to an aiding or abetting, or counselling, or procuring, of the offence arising from the act which the accused did in the preparation for, or in the planning of, that terrorist act, that is, in acquiring a rifle (Count 1) and in selling the videotape, photographs and notes (Count 2).  
     
      
    84 It is important, in the analysis of this argument, to recognise that the Count 1 and 2 offences of the accused which Greg is argued to have aided, abetted, counselled and procured are not the making by the accused of a threat to kill the relevant officials, but rather the doing by him of an act in the preparation or planning for the making of that threat. This is perhaps not perfectly expressed in the indictment, as presently framed, although the intention is clear enough, and an amendment may be required, it being unnecessary for a s 101.6(1) offence that the terrorist act actually occur (s 101.6(2)). 
     
      
    85 While the Crown did not go so far as to concede formally that Greg’s conduct, from 28 November onwards, would have constituted offences, considered in the way identified, it invited me to approach the motion upon the basis that at least some of the conduct of Greg amounted to an aiding and abetting, or counselling or procuring of the offence charged in Count 2. I will proceed upon that basis, not only because of that concession, but also because I consider that Mr Boulten’s submissions in this regard are correct. 
     
      
    86 The position is considerably less certain in so far as Mr Boulten also contended that Greg aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of the offence charged in Count 3. This does depend upon a fair reading of the transcripts, and an assessment of whether or not, in some way, Greg encouraged the accused to enunciate or to repeat the threats which he had already made or flagged.  
     
      
    87 I do not consider it necessary to decide this question, since other considerations referable to impropriety arise, in so far as any evidence obtained between 27 November 2003 and 1 December 2003 is to be tendered in relation to this Count, or in relation to Count 1.  
     
      
    88 While the possible commission by Greg of an offence of incitement, under s 11.4 was also identified, the argument concerning it is somewhat less strong, also being dependent upon a factual determination of whether his conduct amounted to an “urging” of the accused to commit the offences charged. That is the case because there is a strong argument available that the accused was always ready and willing to supply the videotape to a cooperative journalist, and had already made similar threats without any urging on the part of the undercover operative. It is not, however, necessary to decide this question, since anything done by that operative would be caught up in the s 11.2 offence.  
     
      
    89 A submission was initially raised, but not pressed that the conduct of Greg fell foul of s 101.4 or s 101.5 or s 103.1 of the Criminal Code Act. However by the time that he received the videotape, photographs and notes, he had the benefit of a Controlled Operations Certificate. Had that Certificate not been obtained then it is likely that Greg’s activities on 3 December 2003 would have fallen foul of these provisions.  
     
      
    90 It was established that the offences with which the accused is charged are “serious Commonwealth offences”, by reason of Clause 4A of the Crimes Regulations 1990 which came into effect on and from 10 October 2003. As a consequence it was properly within the power conferred by the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) for a Certificate to be issued under s 15M, on 3 December 2003. The following provisions of Part 1AB of the Crimes Act were consequently applicable, in respect of anything done by Greg after the issue of the certificate: 
     
      
       
        
        15H What is a controlled operation? 
         
        A  
        controlled operation 
         is an operation that: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) involves the participation of law enforcement officers; and 
         
        (b) is carried out for the purpose of obtaining evidence that may lead to the prosecution of a person for a serious Commonwealth offence; and 
         
        (c) may involve a law enforcement officer or other person in acts, or omissions to act, that would, apart from subsection 151(1) or (2), constitute a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory. 
        
       
       
        
        15I Law enforcement officers etc. not liable for offences committed for purposes of authorised controlled operation 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A law enforcement officer who engages in conduct that, apart from this subsection, would constitute a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory is not criminally responsible for that offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) he or she engages in that conduct in the course of duty for the purposes of a controlled operation; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the conduct meets the requirements of subsection 15IB(1). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
        15IB Requirements that must be met for the purposes of sections 15I and 15IA 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A law enforcement officer’s conduct relating to a controlled operation meets the requirements of this subsection if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) at the time when he or she engages in that conduct there is in force a certificate given under section 15M that authorises the operation; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the conduct is within the nature of the activities covered by the certificate; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the conduct does not breach any conditions to which the certificate is subject; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the conduct does not involve intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence, or an offence against a law of a State or Territory, if that person would not otherwise have intended to commit: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (i) that offence; or 
        
       
       (ii) an offence of that kind; and 
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (e) the conduct does not involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person or an offence involving the death of or serious injury to any person… 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    91 There is no basis for a finding in the present case that the undercover agent intentionally induced the accused to do anything (whether it amounted to an offence, or not, being a matter for a jury) that he would not otherwise have intended to commit, which would attract an application of s 15I1B(1)(d). Any argument to the contrary needs to be considered in the full context of the discussions between 27 November 2003 and 3 December 2003, and in the light of the discussions, in which the accused had earlier been involved, or claimed to have been involved, with other journalists. 
     
      
    92 Clearly, on the basis of the material placed before me, the accused had formulated his plan before Greg made contact with him, and was actively and wholeheartedly looking for a journalist to whom he could sell the video, and who he could enlist for his plan.  
     
      
    93 Accordingly, the defence submission in relation to the 3 December meeting cannot, in the face of the Controlled Operations Certificate, be advanced on the basis of any illegal conduct of Greg occurring on that day. Rather, it is submitted, as I understand it, that any evidence gathered from this meeting, whether in the form of admissions arising from words or conduct, or in the obtaining of the videotape, photographs and statement, which the Crown seeks to tender, was poisoned by the preceding illegality.  
     
      
    94 As I have noted the defence also relies on what was said to amount to an impropriety, or to give rise to an unfairness, if the evidence is tendered, in so far as Greg had, from 27 November onwards, misrepresented his true identity; had posed as a journalist who was interested in assisting the accused (initially as a person who might write an article critical of ASIO); had untruthfully asserted that their discussions would remain confidential; had secretly, and contrary to the accused’s wishes, recorded their conversations, and had later, at least implicitly, gone along with the accused’s plan of using him on the occasion of the hostage taking.  
     
      
    95 The impropriety involved, and the unfairness in the Crown tendering the admissions and the videotape and other materials which were obtained, is said to have stemmed from the circumstance that, without those representations and encouragement, the relevant admissions, (which included any representations, by words or conduct that would be adverse to the interest of the accused in relation to the proceedings (R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442)) and the handing over of the potential exhibits, would not have occurred.  
     
      
    96 This impropriety or unfairness submission extends to all three conversations, and embraces, so far as relevant, any illegality that occurred as well as the making of false statements or conduct amounting to a form of entrapment. 
     
      
    97 Particular reliance is placed on s 138(2)(b) in so far as it deems evidence of admissions made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of such admissions, to have been obtained improperly, where the person conducting the questioning made a false statement in the course thereof, knew of its falseness, and knew that the making of it was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make the admissions. 
     
      
    98 Clearly, in the present case, these elements were present. The adoption by the undercover agent, and the making of the various false statements concerning himself, and his intentions, which are identified in the excerpts previously set out, were known to be false. They were also obviously known to be likely to cause the accused to make admissions concerning his plan, or concerning any relevant documents or items that he had in his possession, and to encourage him to hand them over. That was the whole purpose of and motivation for the undercover operation.  
     
      
    99 This submission directly relates to the evidence concerning Count 2 in so far as the words spoken by the accused, and the delivery of the proposed exhibits, which constituted the offence charged, followed upon the false statements. It was also submitted that any evidence that was obtained consequent upon (that is, caused by) the false statements, which the Crown seeks to use additionally in proof of Count 1 or Count 3, should similarly be excluded. 
     
      
    100 There would not seem to be any practical significance, in this case, in drawing a distinction between the potential exclusion of evidence on the ground that it was procured by unlawful conduct, and its exclusion on the basis that the commission of the offence was itself procured by that conduct: see Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 at 31. I do not consider it necessary in the circumstances of this case, where clearly occasion arises for consideration of the discretion arising under s 138(1) to attempt to resolve any difference which might emerge from the observations of Smart AJ in DPP v Carr (2002) 127 A Crim R 151 and of Adams J in DPP v Coe [2003] NSWSC 363, concerning that question. 
     
      
    101 I am satisfied that s 138(2) of the Evidence Act applies in this case to deem the evidence, which was obtained by Greg in the three meetings, to have been improperly obtained. This arises from the illegality previously mentioned, and from the misleading statements which were made, which were causally connected with the admissions that were made, and with the handing over of the videotape and other items. While the Controlled Operations Certificate saved Greg’s conduct on 3 December from being unlawful in receiving the videotape and other items, that does not of itself render the evidence admissible, in circumstances where the meetings and admissions occurred as a result of the various misleading statements that were made. It follows that its tender depends upon an exercise of the discretion reserved by s 138(1), taking into account the matters which are listed, although not exhaustively, in s 138(3). To the exercise of that discretion and the s 90 discretion I now turn. 
     
      
       
      SHOULD THE EVIDENCE BE EXCLUDED UNDER s 90 OR s 138 OF THE EVIDENCE ACT?  
       
      
    102 As I have earlier observed reliance was also placed by the defence on s 90 of the Evidence Act in so far as it was asserted that the evidence of the admissions, and the evidence which would be available through the tender of the videotape and the other items, should be excluded since such evidence was obtained in circumstances that would make it unfair to the accused for it to be used.  
     
      
    103 The interrelationship between ss 90 and 138 was considered in R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 where Howie J, with whom Ipp JA and Hulme J agreed, said at [74] and [75]: 
     
      
       
        
        “74. The discretion under s 138 is similar to that which was described in  
        Swaffield 
         [ 
        Swaffield v The  
        Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159] as the public policy discretion at common law. Of course, there is a significant difference between the discretion under s 138 and that at common law: the section requires that the Crown persuade the court to admit evidence that was improperly or unlawfully obtained. But just as at common law, the public policy discretion was distinct and separate from the unfairness discretion, so the discretion to admit evidence under s 138 is a distinct and separate discretion from that arising under s 90. The two discretions may overlap but they are not synonymous. Section 138 is not, in its terms at least, concerned with the court ensuring a fair trial for the accused. Certainly that is not a paramount consideration when exercising the discretion. The discretion exercised under s 138(1) seeks to balance two competing public interests, neither of which directly involves securing a fair trial for the accused. 
         
         
        75. In the joint judgment in  
        Swaffield 
         at [52] their Honours discuss the four bases at common law for rejecting evidence of admissions. The second of those was the discretion to reject evidence because its admission would be unfair to the accused, a discretion now found in s 90. The third was the public policy discretion, now found in s 138. Their Honours said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The third basis focuses, not on unfairness to the accused, but on considerations of public policy which make it unacceptable to admit the statement into evidence, notwithstanding that the statement was made voluntary and that its admission would work no particular unfairness to the accused. The purpose of the discretion which is brought to bear with that emphasis is the protection of the public interest. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Foster v The Queen 
         (1993) 67 ALJR 550 at 540 it was stated that, although the unfairness discretion and the public policy discretion may overlap, their focus is different: in the former the focus is on the effect of the unlawful conduct on the particular accused and in the latter the focus is on ‘large matters of public policy’.” 
        
       
      
    104 It is convenient to give consideration first to s 90, although to some extent the observations which I make in relation to it are also of relevance for the s 138 discretion. 
     
      
    105 Howie J noted in R v Em in respect of the s 90 discretion, that the defence had, at [99]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…relied upon judgments of the High Court which, in effect, state that it would be unfair to admit evidence in a situation where the confession might not have been made had proper procedures been conducted or where the accused’s freedom to choose to speak to the police had been impugned;

    106 His Honour continued at [104]: 
     
      
       
        
        “104. Section 90 in effect confers on the trial judge a discretion to reject evidence of admissions where to admit them would result in an unfair trial for the accused. It is unfairness arising from the use of the admissions by the prosecution that is central to the discretion under the section and not whether the police unfairly treated the accused. The purpose of the discretion is the protection of the rights and privileges of the accused. It is concerned with the right of an accused to a fair trial and includes a consideration of whether any forensic advantage has been obtained unfairly by the Crown from the way the accused was treated;

         at [78]. There may be an overlap between issues of voluntariness, reliability, fairness to the accused and the public policy discretion; ibid at [74]. 
        
       
       
        
        105. In the joint judgment of Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in  
        Swaffield 
        , and relying upon  
        Van der Meer v The Queen 
         (1988) 62 ALJR 656 at 662, and  
        Duke v The Queen 
         (1989) 180 CLR 508 at 513, their Honours stated at [54] (footnotes not reproduced): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Unfairness then relates to the right of an accused to a fair trial; in that situation the unfairness discretion overlaps with the power or discretion to reject evidence which is more prejudicial than probative, each looking to the risk that an accused may be improperly convicted. While unreliability may be a touchstone of unfairness, it has been said not to be the sole touchstone. It may be, for instance, that no confession might have been made at all, had the police investigation been properly conducted. And once considerations other than unreliability are introduced, the line between unfairness and policy may become blurred.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        106. Having later considered decisions in both Australian and Canadian jurisdictions concerned with the exercise of discretion in cases where the police had secretly taped conversations between the accused and another person, their Honours stated at [91]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In the light of recent decisions of this Court, it is no great step to recognise, as the Canadian Supreme Court has done, an approach which looks to the accused's freedom to choose to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned. Where the freedom has been impugned the court has a discretion to reject the evidence. In deciding whether to exercise that discretion, which is a discretion to exclude not to admit, the court will look at all the circumstances. Those circumstances may point to unfairness to the accused if the confession is admitted. There may be no unfairness involved but the court may consider that, having regard to the means by which the confession was elicited, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable having regard to prevailing community standards. This invests a broad discretion in the court but it does not prevent the development of rules to meet particular situations. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        107. Although there is no longer, in this State, a common law discretion to reject admissions on the basis of unfairness, there is no relevant distinction between the scope and purpose of a discretion to reject evidence of an admission under s 90 and that which exists under the common law as declared in  
        Swaffield 
        , see ibid at [91].” 
        
       
      
    107 Subsequently his Honour made it clear that in so far as the s 90 discretion is concerned, the seriousness of the offence charged is not a relevant consideration, observing at [113]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have indicated, the question arising under this section is whether the admission of the evidence would give rise to an unfair trial. With respect, I do not see how the seriousness of the offence, for which the accused is to stand trial, can have any relevance to an assessment of whether the trial would be unfair as a result of the admission of the evidence obtained by police misconduct. In my view, it simply cannot make any difference to the outcome of that assessment whether the accused is standing trial for murder or whether the trial relates to a charge of stealing from a shop. If the reception of the evidence leads to an unfair trial and it results in a conviction, there must be a miscarriage of justice regardless of the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates.” 
        
       
      
    108 The present case is not one where any question could reasonably arise in relation to the reliability of the evidence, that might have affected its probative value. Upon the face of the conversations the accused was willingly volunteering the information which constituted the admissions, and was actively looking to sell the items which the police obtained and which the Crown seeks to tender. Nothing was said by Greg which, upon a fair reading, urged him to embark on a course of conduct which he did not already have in mind.  
     
      
    109 It was, however, only because of the misstatements that Greg made in relation to his own role, his assurances that their conversations were not being secretly recorded and would remain confidential, and his expressions of interest in continuing to meet him and to see the videotape, that the accused was drawn out as to what his plan was, and that he later decided to sell the videotape and other items.  
     
      
    110 Had he known Greg’s true role and intentions, he would inevitably have remained silent. Moreover, had he been invited to participate in a formal interview at a police station, it may be confidently assumed that he would have exercised his right to silence. While he could not have resisted being questioned pursuant to the powers exercisable under Part III, Division 3, Subdivision B, of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, or lawfully refused to produce items called for under those provisions, there could be no guarantee that he would have answered such questioning truthfully, or that he would have produced any item, albeit at pain of prosecution for any breach of the obligations arising.  
     
      
    111 In this regard the further observations of Howie J in R v Em, although obiter dicta, at [127] to [128] and [133] have a relevance. 
     
      
       
        
        “127. In my opinion it is too simplistic to reason that, because the respondent may not have made admissions had he known his conversation was being recorded, it was unfair to use the admissions against him. The fact that the respondent was tricked into believing that the conversation was not being recorded might enliven the discretion to reject the evidence, but in my view a relevant factor in deciding whether it would be unfair to admit the evidence is the reason why the respondent would not have spoken had he known the true situation. This is a matter touched on by Shaw J and those arguing the matter before him, but was not apparently examined in any depth. 
        
       
       
        
        128. As his Honour accepted in paragraph [80] of his judgment set out above, it was not unfair to admit the evidence simply because it was being surreptitiously recorded by police. Nor, in my view, was it necessarily unfair to admit the conversation simply because the respondent would not have spoken had he known that his conversation was being recorded. For example, if his objection to the police recording the conversation was that he did not want the police to have a reliable record of what he was prepared to say to them, I find it difficult to understand how it would be unfair to the respondent to have admitted against him a reliable account of what he freely and voluntarily said to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        133. In my opinion there is a very significant difference, for the purposes of the admission of evidence of confessional statements, between, on the one hand, subterfuge by the police which is aimed merely at inducing a suspect to believe that what he said to them was not being recorded, and, on the other hand, subterfuge which is aimed at inducing in a suspect the belief that what he said would not be used in evidence against him. I do not believe that conduct of the first type necessarily requires that the admissions obtained as a result of the subterfuge be rejected under s 90 or otherwise. On the other hand conduct of the second type would clearly enliven the discretion to reject the evidence under s 90 and it may be the case that, generally speaking, any admission resulting from such a representation would be rejected in the exercise of discretion.” 
        
       
      
    112 The unfairness with which this section is concerned relates to the accused’s right to a fair trial. As the majority observed in Swaffield at [66-68], the fairness concept is somewhat vague, and remains undefined in the Evidence Act. It does call for a value judgment. 
     
      
    113 In circumstances where the accused appears to have formulated his plan before speaking to the undercover operative, and to have sounded out others with a view to its implementation, without the slightest encouragement from police, I am of the view that the balance which is required, by way of a value judgment as to the conduct of the police, and its effect on the accused, falls on the side of admission of the evidence. Among other considerations, the objective of the police was not simply to gather evidence about offences already committed. An important additional objective, if not the primary objective, was to obtain information concerning any plan, or plans, which the accused had for ongoing or future offences, and to nip them in the bud. Had the conduct of the undercover officer been such as to encourage, or to lead the accused to engage in a course of conduct on which he had not already embarked, or had the conversation been essentially fashioned by the officer so as to commit him to that course, then that degree of unfairness in the use of the evidence at trial, which would justify a discretionary exclusion, might well have been made out.  
     
      
    114 The difference in the position of an accused who is involved in conversations in the course of the commission of a crime, and that of an accused post arrest, while not conclusive, also has, in my view, some significance. A particular concern exists in relation to post arrest trickery or subterfuge that is designed to derogate from the fundamental right of silence, and from the privilege against self-incrimination. Somewhat different considerations apply, in my view, in relation to covert investigations occurring before arrest, and which are an almost inevitable feature of the kind of controlled operations which are now permitted by statute, in response to the decision in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19.  
     
      
    115 Necessarily those operations impinge on the private rights of an accused, yet a balance is maintained by the careful regime for their approval, for their implementation and for their review, which is reflected in the legislation. Almost inevitably such operations involve a measure of duplicity, that allows the accused to say and do things, in the presence of the undercover operative, which would not have occurred had he known of that operative’s true identity and purpose.  
     
      
    116 I am of the view that the circumstances which arise in such a case, and which arise here, place it in a somewhat different position from that considered in Swaffield and in the cases there noted. That is not to abandon or to derogate from the preservation of a requirement for fairness for the accused, or automatically to exclude the operation of s 90 in the case of a covert or controlled operation pre-arrest.  
     
      
    117 A balance needs to be struck in the exercise of the s 90 discretion, in which the considerations I have mentioned need to be respected.  
     
      
    118 In the present case, I am not persuaded that there was any reckless disregard of the rights of the accused, or that the evidence was obtained at a price which was unacceptable to prevailing community standards, as that concept was explained in Swaffield and applied, for example, in R v Juric [2002] 4 VR 411. 
     
      
    119 In this regard it may be noted that in R v Suckling [1999] NSWCCA 36, the Court (McInerney, Ireland and Adams JJ) in upholding the admission of post arrest confessional statements made to other prisoners, emphasised at [40] that the community standards in question are not those determined by reference to “any notion of populist public opinion”, but relate to “community standards concerning the maintenance of the rule of law in a liberal democracy, the elements of the proper administration of justice and the due requirements of law enforcement.” 
     
      
    120 I am of the view that the decisions in R v Roba [2000] VSC 96, R v Dewhurst [2001] VSC 172 and R v Chimirri [2002] VSC 555 where admissions which had been obtained by means of the secret recording of conversations with undercover operatives, or police agents, or Crown witnesses, following arrest and an exercise of the right to silence, were rejected, are distinguishable from the present case, which was one involving a covert operation before arrest.  
     
      
    121 In the exercise of my discretion I decline to exclude the evidence of the admissions pursuant to s 90. 
     
      
    122 I turn next to the s 138(2) discretion. 
     
      
    123 In considering the application of s 138, it is, to a degree, helpful to recall what was said by Mason CJ and Deane and Dawson JJ in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 at 35-39, in relation to conduct of an accused which is brought about by unlawful or improper conduct on the part of law enforcement officers: 
     
      
       
        
        “..At this stage, it suffices to say that, for the reasons given above, it should be accepted that a trial judge possesses a discretion to exclude, on public policy grounds, evidence of an offence or of an element of an offence in circumstances where its commission has been brought about by unlawful conduct on the part of law enforcement officers. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Conduct which is not unlawful but is improper 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        22. Strictly speaking, it is unnecessary for the purposes of the present case to determine whether the discretion to exclude evidence extends to circumstances where a criminal offence has been induced by improper, though not unlawful, conduct on the part of the authorities. It does, however, seem desirable that we indicate that we are of the view that it does. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        23. In a context where ancillary offences - such as counselling, being knowingly concerned in, inducing, aiding, abetting and procuring - exist, in one form or another, in all Australian jurisdictions and where no laws exist authorizing law enforcement officers to encourage or participate in the commission of criminal offences in order to enable the apprehension and procure the conviction of those whom they believe to be involved in criminal activity, it is likely that conduct which intentionally procures the commission of a criminal offence by another will itself be criminal. Nonetheless, circumstances can conceivably exist in which a law enforcement officer intentionally brings about the opportunity for the commission of a criminal offence by conduct which is not criminal but which is quite inconsistent with the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        25. The effective investigation by the police of some types of criminal activity may necessarily involve subterfuge, deceit and the intentional creation of opportunities for the commission by a suspect of a criminal offence. When those tactics do not involve illegal conduct, their use will ordinarily be legitimate notwithstanding that they are conducive to the commission of a criminal offence by a person believed to be engaged in criminal activity. It is neither practicable nor desirable to seek to define with precision the borderline between what is acceptable and what is improper in relation to such conduct. The most that can be said is that the stage of impropriety will be reached in the case of conduct which is not illegal only in cases involving a degree of harassment or manipulation which is clearly inconsistent with minimum standards of acceptable police conduct in all the circumstances, including, amongst other things, the nature and extent of any known or suspected existing or threatened criminal activity, the basis and justification of any suspicion, the difficulty of effective investigation or prevention and any imminent danger to the community. A finding that law enforcement officers have engaged in such clearly improper conduct will not, of course, suffice of itself to give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence of the alleged offences or of an element of it. As with the case of illegal conduct, the discretion will only arise if the conduct has procured the commission of the offence with which the accused is charged. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        28. References in this judgment to an offence being ""procured"" by illegal conduct on the part of law enforcement officers are intended to refer to two distinct, but possibly overlapping, categories of case. The first category consists of cases in which the police conduct has induced an accused person to commit the offence which he or she has committed. In that category of case, the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime is likely to prevail over other considerations except in what we would hope to be the rare and exceptional case where the illegality or impropriety of the police conduct is grave and either so calculated or so entrenched that it is clear that considerations of public policy relating to the administration of criminal justice require exclusion of the evidence. The other category of case is where illegal police conduct is itself the principal offence to which the charged offence is ancillary or creates or itself constitutes an essential ingredient of the charged offence. An example of that category is a case where a person is charged with receipt or possession of stolen property in circumstances where not only the supply, but the actual theft, of the stolen property had been organized by the police for the purpose of obtaining the conviction of the person to whom it is supplied (60). In that category of case, the police illegality and the threat to the rule of law which it involves assume a particularly malignant aspect. Even in such a case, if the police conduct is disowned by those in higher authority and criminal proceedings have been instituted against the police as well as the accused, it is unlikely that considerations of public policy relating to the integrity of the administration of criminal justice would require the exclusion of evidence either of the accused's offence or of the particular element of it created by the police illegality. If, however, the illegal police conduct would appear to be condoned by those in higher authority and it does not appear that criminal proceedings have been brought against the police, those considerations of public policy will be so strong that an extremely formidable case for exclusion will be raised.” 
        
       
      
    124 It is not to be overlooked that their Honours also observed at p 43 – 44, in a passage which led to the kind of legislative intervention which now permits Controlled Operations:  
     
      
       
        
        “…the fact that deceit and infiltration are of particular importance to the effective investigation and punishment of trafficking in illegal drugs such as heroin, it is arguable that a strict requirement of observance of the criminal law by those entrusted with its enforcement undesirably hinders law enforcement. Such an argument must, however, be addressed to the Legislature and not to the courts. If it be desired that those responsible for the investigation of crime should be freed from the restraints of some provisions of the criminal law, a legislative regime should be introduced exempting them from those requirements. In the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen. To do otherwise would be to undermine the rule of law itself.” 
        
       
      
    125 I have already indicated that the conduct of Greg and indirectly the Police who were directing the operation, involved some impropriety and/or illegality, in so far as it involved the making of misstatements of fact to the accused, and in so far as it involved an offence under s 11.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. 
     
      
    126 The illegal conduct involved falls more readily, in my view, within the first category of conduct that was mentioned by the majority in Ridgeway (at 39), a conclusion which has support in the analysis made by this Court in R v Cummins NSWCCA 23 November 1998 and in R v Ladocki [2004] NSWCCA 336. 
     
      
    127 A consideration of the matters referred to in s 138(3) including, in particular, the effect of the illegality or impropriety on the accused: R v Helmhout [2001] NSWCCA 372; the gravity of the offence with which the accused is charged: R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284; and the nature and extent of the police illegality or impropriety viewed realistically; R v Phan [2003] NSWCCA 205, lead me to the view that the discretions should be exercised in favour of admission of the evidence. 
     
      
    128 It is unarguable that its probative value is exceedingly high, and that it would be important in the proceedings since, without it, the prosecution would almost certainly fail. It is equally unarguable that the offences charged are particularly serious, being offences which carry potentially significant sentences, and which involve as elements, threats of action to occasion serious harm to Commonwealth Officials.  
     
      
    129 The impropriety and contravention of the law involved on the part of Greg occurred, in the course of an operation, which, I am satisfied, was conducted in good faith. While the decision to proceed in the way chosen was deliberate, any contravention of the law that was involved was at worst negligent, having regard to the failure of Police to peruse the legislation and to seek formal legal advice. More appropriately I would regard it as having been inadvertent, and as flowing from a lack of an appreciation that arranging a meeting with the accused, and discussing his plans, in an attempt to discover what he had in mind, and what he possessed, and to then take steps towards procuring any relevant item which he might have obtained, might constitute an offence. In that regard the newly created terrorist laws do extend criminality well beyond the traditionally recognised offence of attempt, and it is understandable that there was not an appreciation of the fact that conduct, of the kind which occurred between 27 November and 1 December, might fall foul of s 11.2 of the Criminal Code Act when considered in conjunction with the other relevant sections of that Act.  
     
      
    130 It is not immaterial that there was an urgency to act, in view of the perceived threat to Commonwealth officials and the suspicion that the accused was making inquiries directed towards obtaining a replacement weapon. It was absolutely essential in those circumstances for steps to be taken to determine whether the threat was real, and how far any plan might have proceeded. For the police not to have acted in the light of what was known or suspected, would have involved a gross neglect of duty on their part. That any breach of the law was inadvertent is also indicated by the fact that police sought and obtained a Controlled Operations Certificate as a matter of prudence, following discussions within the Undercover Branch, before proceeding to the third meeting and before obtaining the videotape and the other items in exchange for moneys which were, in accordance with the operation, immediately recovered and which were never likely to be passed on or used for any terrorist act. 
     
      
    131 There was no infringement of any right of the accused recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
     
      
    132 While no proceedings have been taken, or are likely to be taken against Greg, or against his controllers, that is not, in the light of the foregoing, a consideration that would weigh in favour of the exclusion of the evidence in this case. That follows from the inadvertent nature of the illegality, the acquisition of a Controlled Operations Certificate, and the implicit approval or authorisation of any continuation of the deception or misstatement, which had occurred to that point.  
     
      
    133 While it would have almost certainly been possible for a certificate to have been obtained from the outset, the success of a covert operation inevitably depended upon the use of precisely the same kind of deception and misstatements that were employed between 27 November and 1 December, and continued on 3 December.  
     
      
    134 As I have already observed, a simple request to the accused to participate in a police interview, under caution, would inevitably have been met with a refusal (as had occurred on 28 September and as also occurred on 3 December). 
     
      
    135 A search warrant would only have been successful if the videotape was still located at the home of the accused or in his car.  
     
      
    136 Detention for interrogation and directions for production pursuant to ASIO’s powers, even assuming that it’s cooperation (which was not within the power of the Counter Terrorism Command to direct) was secured, could not be guaranteed, with any certainty to have been productive. In any event any information elicited or object produced in response to the exercise of those powers could not have been used in aid of a prosecution of the accused for any offence already committed by reason of s 34G(9) of the ASIO Act. 
     
      
    137 The police were not to know whether others were involved in any plan that the accused had in mind. Premature action, involving any of the three courses suggested would have risked alerting the accused, and any potential accomplice to police interest, and might have driven those involved underground. The fact that the s 34G(9) immunity under the ASIO Act does not extend to derivative use immunity, is therefore of less significance.  
     
      
    138 In summary, it is my assessment that the police acted in good faith, in circumstances where they had legitimate concerns as to a pending terrorist act of considerable magnitude. That threat needed to be appreciated and weighed in the current international climate of increasing and serious terrorist violence. While it may be that the actions of the accused will turn out to have been foolish chatter, or mere bravado designed to air his grievances to journalists, without any intention of his threats being taken seriously, let alone carried into effect, the police were not to know that. Nor am I in a position, or entitled, to determine such an issue, it being a jury question. 
     
      
    139 I am however satisfied that Greg did nothing to encourage the accused to do anything which he was not already minded to do, that he fairly gave him a chance to indicate that he was not seriously intending to go ahead with the ultimate plan, and that throughout he acted reasonably and professionally. I am also satisfied that the operation with which he was involved was not confined to the objective of gathering evidence. It also included the important, if not primary, objective of preventing an incident that could have possibly led to a loss of life or serious physical harm, and that could have occasioned great public concern, if it was seriously in contemplation. 
     
      
    140 For these reasons I am persuaded that the s 138 discretion should be exercised in favour of the admission of the evidence.  
     
      
    141 Although counsel did not expressly refer to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act, I am satisfied that neither required the evidence to be excluded. In this regard the following passages from the judgment of Howie J in R v EM at [120] and [121] are pertinent: 
     
      
       
        
        “120. Section 137 is only engaged where the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect. Unfair prejudice under the section arises where there exists the probability that the jury might misuse the evidence in some way other than for the purpose for which it was placed before them

         (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at [31];  
        Papakosmas v The Queen 
         (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [91]-[93]. If the evidence is relevant and if there is no likelihood of the jury misusing the evidence in some way, then its probative value, or its lack of probative value, is a matter for the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        121. I accept that the section also applies where the jury may give more weight to a particular piece of the evidence than it deserves:  
        R v Yates 
         [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252]. But that consideration is not based simply upon the assessment of the probative value of the evidence. There must be some prejudice emanating from the evidence that will be likely to cause the jury to over-react to it in an illogical or irrational manner:  
        Papakosmas 
         at [92] or to rely upon it on a basis that was logically unconnected to the issues in the case:  
        R v Taylor 
         [2003] NSWCCA 194 at [93]. In exercising the power contained in the section, the trial judge should have regard to what warnings or directions might be given to the jury to ensure that such prejudice does not arise.” 
        
       
       
      
    142 Reference may also be made to R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364, R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 and R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 182 which are decisions to similar effect. 
     
      
    143 This is not a case where there is any danger of the evidence being misused in any of the ways referred to in these cases.  
     
      
       
      FALLBACK SUBMISSIONS 
       
      
    144 Two fallback submissions were advanced. The first involved an argument for exclusion of the several passages, which were identified in the transcripts as having involved a questioning of the accused in relation the rifle and “Paperworks”, that had been seized on 28 September. This arose, on the defence case, from the fact that it was known to police that the accused had been earlier charged with firearms offences, and had declined to be interviewed by police.  
     
      
    145 In those circumstances, it was submitted that there was an impropriety in police subsequently engaging in a subterfuge, which allowed them to secretly record conversations with him, that were designed to secure admissions concerning the rifle and “Paperworks” and an unfairness in allowing their tender.  
     
      
    146 There would be merit in this submission if the accused had been facing trial on the firearms offences. To these offences he has already pleaded guilty and no genuine issue could arise in relation to his possession of the rifle and ammunition as at 28 September, or in relation to the fact that the “Paperworks” were found, at his home, on that date. The Crown is in a position to prove their seizure independently of the intercepted conversations.  
     
      
    147 It is true that the police could have interviewed the accused in relation to the documents, and as to the reason why he had the firearm and ammunition, had he not refused to be interviewed, in September 2003. I am not however persuaded that this has the effect that the tender of evidence of the admissions obtained in the intercepted conversations would constitute an unfairness, within the meaning of s 90, such as to justify its exclusion. 
     
      
    148 Clearly the purpose of the covert operation went well beyond gathering evidence in order to charge the accused with a terrorist offence in relation to the period covered by Count 1. There was no deliberate plan to circumvent the accused’s right of silence which the accused had previously exercised. To the extent that it may have done so, and embraced discussion in relation to the “Paperworks” or the accused’s purpose in acquiring a rifle, that was entirely incidental to the main objective, of ascertaining the present intention of the accused, and to nip in the bud any plan which he may have had to occasion harm to others.  
     
      
    149 So considered, all of these passages were also directly relevant to the matters charged in Counts 2 and 3, and it would be a somewhat meaningless exercise to confine their admission to those counts, or to excise them generally, since to do so would be to remove an important part of the context of what was otherwise said and done.  
     
      
    150 The second fall back submission related to the application of s 138. It was contended that, having regard to the difference which arguably exists between the tender of admissions concerning past events (Count 1) and that relating to prospective or current offences (Counts 2 and 3) there may be occasion to reject the former and to allow the latter.  
     
      
    151 For the reasons already addressed the present does not seem to me to be a case where that course should be followed. The admissions are closely interconnected, and those falling within the second category derive their context from those falling within the first.  
     
      
    152 I am unpersuaded of the merit of this submission. 
     
      
    153 It follows that, subject to any additional submission, which may be subsequently addressed in relation to individual passages, I rule the evidence to be admissible notwithstanding the contravention of law or impropriety that was involved in the way in which it was obtained. The motion of the accused is accordingly dismissed.

     Judgment [N 
     o 2] 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: Judgment was handed down in this matter on 4 February 2005. The orders made at the time included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""3. That the appeal be allowed and that the sentence imposed on 3 May 2003 in respect of Count 1 be quashed, the sentence on Count 2 being confirmed. 
        
       
       
        
        4. That in lieu of the sentence in respect of Count 1, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 February 2007, with a non parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 February 2005, at which time the applicant will be eligible for release on parole."" 
        
       
      
    2 However, it was overlooked that the term fixed in respect of Count 2 was 3 years concurrent from 15 August 2002 to 14 August 2005. That term should also have been adjusted to coincide with the non parole period in respect of Count 1, that is, from 15 August 2002 to 14 February 2005. 
     
      
    3 By this order the Court now makes that adjustment so that the amended order of the Court in respect of the appeal by the applicant will be as follows: Orders: 
     
      
       
      1. That the time for filing the Notice Seeking Leave to Appeal be extended. 
       
       
      2. That leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      3. That the appeal be allowed and that the sentence imposed on 3 May 2003 be quashed. 
       
       
      4. That in lieu of the sentence in respect of Count 1, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 February 2007, with a non parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 February 2005, at which time the applicant will be eligible for release on parole. 
       
       
      5. In respect of Count 2, the applicant be sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years 6 months commencing on 15 August 2002 and expiring on 14 February 2005.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: At the conclusion of hearing the Court ordered that this appeal be allowed, the conviction and sentence quashed, and a verdict and judgment of acquittal entered.  
     
      
    2 The appellant was indicted on a single count of supplying a commercial quantity of cannabis leaf. No actual supply was alleged and the prosecution relied upon a relevant possession by the appellant of not less than a traffickable quantity of the drug: see Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, s 29. The indictment specified the date of offence as “between 5 September 2000 and 4 September 2001.” Upon trial before Ducker ADCJ and a jury he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months with a non parole period of one year ten and half months. His parole release date is 11 October 2005. He appeals against conviction, and, alternatively, seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    3 On 4 September 2001 police searched a property owned by the appellant’s mother, which was located in the Mooball Range near Burringbar. She was aged 78 years and resided in a house on one side of a road dividing the hundred acre property which had been at one time a banana plantation. Over a period of time about twenty acres was leased to a Mr Sharp who also operated a sawmill on the plantation. The appellant’s residence was on the other side of the road from that of his mother and consisted of several buildings and outbuildings, attached and unattached to the residence, and rural sheds. 
     
      
    4 At trial it was a formally agreed fact that the appellant departed from Australia on 15 May 2001 and returned on 15 October 2001. He had been visiting the Philippines where he had a son aged about 11 years. He had made frequent visits to that country over the years. Upon return to Australia he was arrested at Brisbane Airport. 
     
      
    5 The search of the premises by police was therefore conducted during the appellant’s absence overseas. They located cannabis in three principal locations, first, within a refrigerator which was chained and locked and standing in a workshop, second, in an out shed within a cupboard which had been nailed shut and, third, in a dresser also nailed shut and a drum adjacent to this dresser, both of which were in a pumping shed. Two very dry stalks of marijuana plant were discovered hanging from a roof rafter and police also found growing plants in two locations on the property. None of these growing plants was the subject of charges against the appellant and it was acknowledged by police and others who conducted the search on 4 September that those plants at that time appeared to be recently irrigated and tended. At that point the appellant had been overseas for nearly four months. 
     
      
    6 Upon questioning after arrest the appellant denied any knowledge about any drug in any form and suggested that someone might be “setting him up.” Upon being apprised of more detail, he acknowledged that this was unlikely and he concluded, as he later testified, that someone must have been using his property for storage and cultivation whilst he was away. There was evidence that it was said to be common knowledge in the district that he frequently spent the winter in the Philippines. 
     
      
    7 Five grounds of appeal against conviction were presented, namely: 
     
      
       
      1. The learned trial judge erred by admitting evidence by Gregory Wassell as to the age of the cannabis. 
       
      2. The verdict of the jury was not open on the evidence because the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Wassell’s evidence as to the age of the cannabis.  
       
      3. His Honour failed to give a correct circumstantial direction in relation to the age of the cannabis. 
       
      4. The trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury in relation to the use that could be made of the tendency evidence of Sharp. 
       
      5. That his Honour erred in failing to withdraw the evidence of Mr Wassell at the conclusion of Mr Wassell’s evidence at the trial. 
       
      
    8 Grounds 1 to 3 and ground 5 all relate to the evidence of Mr Gregory Wassell and although they raise different points it is convenient to examine them together. Mr Wassell’s evidence became critical to the Crown case.  
     
      
    9 Mr Wassell testified that he was an officer of the Department of Agriculture. He accompanied police to the property on the raid on 4 September and whilst there identified plants and vegetable matter as cannabis. He had done work of this nature for 14 years. In order to qualify himself to identify these things he had done a course at the Royal Botanic Gardens and received a certificate to that effect. The course extended over a single day. There was no dispute that Mr Wassell was appropriately qualified to identify cannabis. What was in dispute was his qualification to give evidence from viewing the various parcels of drug on 4 September as to how long beforehand the drug had been harvested. As the Crown case was dependent upon the deemed supply by the appellant, it was necessary to show that he was in relevant possession of drug prior to his departure on 15 May. The Crown sought to do this by calling evidence from Mr Wassell that the various parcels of drugs must have been harvested before that date. 
     
      
    10 Objection was taken to Mr Wassell giving this evidence. A voir dire hearing was undertaken. Mr Wassell had made two statements (described as expert’s certificates) the first of which was dated 29 October 2001. The second was dated 19 March 2003. The statements were not in evidence but it was acknowledged that the first statement dealt with identification and quantification of the plants located and there was no mention of any estimates of time of harvest. Those estimates appeared in the second statement and it was intended he would give evidence along the lines of that statement which was the subject of explicit objection. 
     
      
    11 On the voir dire Mr Wassell testified as to his qualifications and experience in identifying plants and was asked this question about the “aging” of the plants.  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. With respect to cannabis that has been harvested for whatever purposes is there anything that you can tell from your experience as to age of when or how long since a plant has been harvested? 
         
        A. Newly harvested plants are still bright green. After about six months they’re usually an olive greenish colour. After about 12 months from my experience they go to a brown, yellowy brown to grey?” (T35). 
        
       
      
    12 He was further asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In different locations. And based on your experience were you able to differentiate age, according to your experience? 
         
        A. Yes, with the first lot we found in the refrigerator I estimated it was about six months of age as it was an olivey brown colour. The first shed we looked at, it was a grey, grey brown sort of colour, and the third, third shed we looked at was a very grey and quite dusty. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And were you able to estimate the time from which it had been harvested, how long it had been in that particular location once it was found? 
         
        A. Yeah, in the first shed we – or I felt it was about twelve months of age. In the second shed, probably up to eighteen months or two years, because there was a lot of rat droppings and whatnot.” (T37). 
         
        
       
      
    13 In cross examination he acknowledged that his duties were primarily related to the identification of cannabis plants.  
     
      
    14 The trial judge ruled that he would admit evidence from Mr Wassell “as to the age” (T43). By “age”, the Judge meant the time since the plants had been harvested. He was not asked to, nor did he give, reasons for that ruling.  
     
      
    15 The issue of Mr Wassell’s expertise was explored in greater detail when he came to give evidence in the trial. In accordance with his Honour’s ruling that he would be permitted to give such evidence he said that he estimated that the cannabis found in the refrigerator had been harvested for about six months, that in the nailed cupboard in the out shed for about twelve months, and the third quantity in the pumping shed for possibly two years. 
     
      
    16 In cross examination he agreed that the course which he undertook did not have “any bearing whatsoever on the question of aging cannabis leaf.” He acknowledged that in the first of the statements which he had made he had merely indicated that the cannabis in the second lot was older than that inside the refrigerator and that that in the pumping shed was older than the previous lot. He agreed that he had no information to improve his state of knowledge as far as aging of cannabis was concerned since 4 September 2001. 
     
      
    17 Mr Wassell acknowledged that he had had no reference to literature nor had he carried out experiments in order to test the validity of his estimates of age. Having made such acknowledgment it was put: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What I suggest to you is that it (the opinion) is worthless because it fails to take into account any of the variables, what do you say about that? 
         
        A. I’ve got no real comments on it.” (T234). 
        
       
      
    18 He was asked these further questions: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In order to give any, not accurate, but any approximate assessment of the age of cannabis material, you have got to know something about, first of all, the condition of the material when it was harvested, don’t you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Because obviously if it was brown when it was harvested, you can’t draw any conclusion from it being found brown later, can you? 
         
        A. I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve indicated to his Honour and the jury that there were cannabis plants shown in the photos that were brown in colour in the ground, haven’t you? 
         
        A. That’s right, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The first variable, I’d suggest to you, is the colour at harvest; what do you say about that? 
         
        A. Sorry, in what respect? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The colour at harvest obviously needs to be taken into account, doesn’t it? 
         
        A. Normally, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You had no information as to what colour any of this material was when harvested, did you? 
         
        A. Oh, no.” (T234-5). 
        
       
      
    19 The cross examination later continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The second feature, I’d suggest to you, that may affect the appearance of material is the manner in which it was processed; what do you say about that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because it’s obviously the case, isn’t it, that if material is dried in the sunlight, it’s going to fade? 
         
        A. That’s correct, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it’s going to have a different appearance, isn’t it, to material which has been dried through some sort of drying process out of sunlight; correct? 
         
        A. I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sunlight fades, doesn’t it? 
         
        A. Normally, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And things that are out of the sun are not faded by sunlight, are they? 
         
        A. Normally not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So what I’m suggesting to you is the manner in which a thing is dried will affect its colour at the end of the drying process; what do you say about that? 
         
        A. It’s a possibility. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It’s more than that, isn’t it; it’s an inevitability?  
         
        A. I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What I’d suggest to you is that something which is dried in the sun will have a much lighter colour than something which is dried by some other process; what do you say about that? 
         
        A. That’s a possibility, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It’s an inevitability, I’m putting to you? 
         
        A. I’m not sure.” (T235-6). 
        
       
      
    20 The cross examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you agree with that, you have got no information obviously about its condition on harvest, have you? 
         
        A. I’m only going on my experience as a person who identifies cannabis leaf. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Please answer apply (sic) question: You have got no information about the condition of the leaf material when harvested, have you? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And similarly you have got no information about the process which it was subjected to after harvest, have you? 
         
        A. No, I haven’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The storage conditions after harvest are the third variable obviously; correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And there are a range of manners in which the storage conditions can affect the appearance of not only cannabis leaf but plant material; do you agree with that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. For example, in the light, whether it’s in the sunlight or whether it’s in the dark or in between; do you agree with that one? 
         
        A. Oh, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whether it’s in the open air or whether it’s in an airtight container? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The temperature? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The humidity? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Possible interference by vermin? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In relation to the material here what you’re able to do is make observations of the appearance of that material on the day you got there; correct? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re not able to say what had happened to it from time of harvest to the time you got there, are you? 
         
        A. Oh, no.” (T236-7). 
        
       
      
    21 It was an essential element of the Crown case that the drug be shown to have been harvested and in the possession of the appellant prior to his departure for overseas in May 2001. His Honour directed the jury thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “So possession can be whittled down to this. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did place the drugs in the position where they were as at 4 September 2001 when the police came and that would be the physical element of possession and the accused intended to have control and dominion over those drugs to the exclusion of all other people and that would be the mental element of possession.” 
        
       
      
    22 There was no direct evidence of possession by the appellant and it was the Crown case that, by reason of the harvest of the cannabis at a time before the appellant departed, the jury would be satisfied that he had been so in possession. The only evidence that the plants must have been harvested before the departure date was the opinion of Mr Wassell. 
     
      
    23 As the evidence showed, his claim to expertise was based solely upon asserted experience. His opinions were inadmissible unless permitted by s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “79. If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.” 
        
       
      
    24 Attention was directed to the discussion in the judgment of Heydon JA (as he then was) in Makita (Australia) Pty Limited v Sproules 2001 52 NSWLR 705 @ 743 where his Honour wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “In short, if evidence tendered as expert opinion evidence is to be admissible, it must be agreed or demonstrated that there is a field of ‘specialised knowledge’; there must be an identified aspect of that field in which the witness demonstrates that by reason of specified training, study or experience, the witness has become an expert; the opinion proffered must be ‘wholly or substantially based on the witness’ expert knowledge’; so far as the opinion is based on facts ‘observed’ by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on ’assumed’ or ‘accepted’ facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way; it must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it; and the opinion of an expert requires demonstration or examination of the scientific or other intellectual basis of the conclusions reached: that is, the expert’s evidence must explain how the field of ‘specialised knowledge’ in which the witness is expert by reason of ‘training, study or experience’, and on which the opinion is ‘wholly or substantially based’, applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded. If all these matters are not made explicit, it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert’s specialised knowledge. If the court cannot be sure of that, the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible, and, so far as it is admissible, of diminished weight. And an attempt to make the basis of the opinion explicit may reveal that it is not based on specialised expert knowledge, but, to use Gleeson CJ’s characterisation of the evidence in  
        HG v The Queen 
         (at 428, 1999 197 CLR 414), on ‘a combination of speculation, inference, personal and second-hand views, as to the credibility of the complainant, and a process of reasoning which went well beyond the field of expertise.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour’s dicta were adverted to in Sydney Wide Distributors Pty Limited v. Red Bull Australia Pty Limited [2002] FCAFC 157. Branson J commented that the approach of Heydon JA seemed a counsel of perfection although when her Honour elaborated her reservations, she noted that the existence of a field of specialised knowledge was something which might be assumed in cases where evidence is adduced without objection. In the present case there was specific objection. We would, however, respectfully agree with her later observation that the use of the word “sure” by Heydon JA should be understood other than in the usual sense of being subjectively certain: Evidence Act, s 142. 
     
      
    26 It is not necessary in the present case to engage in an examination of any differences in these views. The evidence fell far short of demonstrating that Mr Wassell (whose bona fides, we should mention, were not in question) could, by simply looking at cannabis, and in the absence of any information about appearance at the time of harvest, conditions between harvest and storage, the time at which the material was placed into storage, if storage may have affected its appearance and whether conditions varied during storage, establish when harvest had taken place. It is true, of course, that there was no issue about his being able to identify cannabis, but what he lacked by way of experience was assessing the “timetable” within which observable deterioration in plants took place.  
     
      
    27 In the appeal, senior counsel for the Crown submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “… If the view be taken that Mr Wassell had insufficient specialized knowledge with regard to the ageing processes of cannabis leaf in its harvested form, or that his opinion was not reached upon the basis of his specialized knowledge, and that the opinion expressed is properly to be seen as a lay opinion, there is a rational basis for Mr Wassell holding that opinion, namely the condition of the cannabis leaf and the circumstances in which it was found measured against his years of experience as an agronomist engaged upon the inspection of plants. …. In those circumstances, section 78 of the Evidence Act, 1995 applies.” 
        
       
      
    28 Section 78 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “78. The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if: 
         
        (a) the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event, and 
         
        (b) evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person’s perception of the matter or event.” 
        
       
      
    29 We would reject that submission. The only matter or event was the viewing and identification of the cannabis. The opinion evidence was an assertion of something said to have happened beforehand (harvest) and specifying the time which must have elapsed between the harvest and the viewing, a progression which Mr Wassell did not purport to see, hear, or otherwise perceive.  
     
      
    30 Ground 1 is made out. 
     
      
    31 It is significant in dealing with ground 2 to have regard to the evidence of just what Mr Wassell’s experience was. As earlier stated, his formal training had been focussed upon identification and he had had no reference to relevant literature. His experience did not include “timetabling” deterioration of cannabis from harvest until a time of inspection. Further he conceded, inter alia, that any opinion would require knowledge of the state (appearance) of the plant at the time of harvest and plainly evidence of that sort had not been, and now cannot be, forthcoming.  
     
      
    32 It is of interest to note his candour about the novelty (as far as he was concerned) of being asked about this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Wassell, would it be fair to say that the evidence you have given today is evidence of a type which you have never given in any court before, that is, relating to the age of cannabis leaf? 
         
        A. No, I haven’t done it before. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In cases other than this case? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, could I suggest to you that before giving evidence of this type, you need to undertake proper experiments to check the accuracy of your conclusions. What do you say about that? 
         
        A. Possibly. “ (T248). 
        
       
      
    33 The concession by Mr Wassell demonstrates that he is unable from experience to qualify himself to give the opinions which were led from him in evidence. Ground 2 should be upheld. 
     
      
    34 We turn to ground 3. We have already set out his Honour’s direction that the Crown had to prove possession by the placing of the drugs in the positions found, before 4 September 2001. The requirements of proof of the Crown case needed to go further than that. On the admitted facts of the appellant’s absence, it needed to be proved as an indispensable link in any chain of reasoning in this circumstantial case that the cannabis was harvested before 15 May 2001. There was no other evidence from which such an inference could be drawn without proof of that fact. His Honour was required to give a direction so that the jury would understand that they could not return a verdict of guilty unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cannabis had been harvested before the appellant left for overseas. No such direction was given: Shepherd v The Queen 1991 70 CLR 573. 
     
      
    35 It is conceded on behalf of the appellant that no application to withdraw the evidence of Mr Wassell such as is contemplated by ground 5 was made at trial. Rule 4 therefore applies. In this respect the Court was referred to BRS v The Queen 1997 191 CLR 275, in particular the expressions of Toohey and Gaudron JJ concerning the granting of leave pursuant to r 4 where a trial has miscarried for want of proper direction and a verdict of not guilty may have followed. 
     
      
    36 Counsel were unable to refer to any authority where evidence, once admitted, had been withdrawn by the trial judge from the jury other than in cases where the evidence was evidence of identification. In that regard the Court was referred to R v Tugaga 1994 74 A Crim R 190. Although not in the context of a jury trial it might be noted that Weinberg and Dowsett JJ in Sydney Distributors @ par 87 made these observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “The use of the phrase ‘strictly speaking’ in the last sentence should not be overlooked. It may well be correct to say that such evidence is not strictly admissible unless it is shown to have all of the qualities discussed by Heydon JA. However many of those qualifies involve questions of degree, requiring the exercise of judgment. For this reason it would be very rare indeed for a court at first instance to reach a decision as to whether tendered expert evidence satisfied all of his Honour’s requirements before receiving it as evidence in the proceedings. More commonly, once the witness’s claim to expertise is made out and the relevance and admissibility of opinion evidence demonstrated, such evidence is received. The various qualities described by Heydon JA are then assessed in the course of determining the weight to be given to the evidence. There will be cases in which it would be technically correct to rule, at the end of the trial, that the evidence in question was not admissible because it lacked one or other of those qualities, but there would be little utility in so doing. It would probably lead to further difficulties in the appellate process.” 
        
       
      
    37 In the light of grounds 1, 2 and 3 being made out it is unnecessary in this case to determine whether the power of a trial to withdraw evidence does extend beyond evidence of identification and we would reserve that question until an occasion when it is necessary so to decide and the matter can be considered in depth. 
     
      
    38 As we have recited, ground 4 is expressed in terms of the “tendency evidence” of Mr Sharp. The thrust of the evidence was that he had seen the applicant in areas of the property on which cannabis plants were growing, of the presence of which he must have been aware. If his evidence was tendency evidence, notice pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act was required. None was given. His Honour exercised his power pursuant to s 100 to dispense with such requirement (T167). However, his Honour had raised with counsel whether the evidence may not have been admissible simply on credit, that is to contradict the statements by the appellant to police that he had no knowledge of any cannabis on the property. Although the matter is not altogether free from confusion, it does appear that the evidence was admitted on this basis.  
     
      
    39 However, if the evidence was admitted limited to an issue of credit, the jury should have been directed as to the limited use they could make of it. They were not so directed. 
     
      
    40 What his Honour did say in his charge to the jury was: 
     
      
       
        
        “……. He (Mr Sharp) thought round about 1998 although he was not too sure of the dates, that he said that he, from a distance of about twenty-five metres, he had seen about thirty to fifty cannabis plants of up to about five feet tall I think he said, which were tied down and that he saw the accused right there amongst those plants but he could not see what he was doing which again the prosecution relies upon as showing that the accused did have an interest in cannabis.” 
        
       
      
    41 The use of the expression “an interest in cannabis” raises a matter of tendency of the appellant. No requisite direction as to limitation on the use of tendency evidence was given.  
     
      
    42 Neither counsel at trial sought redirection. Whatever the status of evidence of Mr Sharp there was no appropriate direction. We would grant leave under r 4 to raise this ground which is made out.  
     
      
    43 Whilst some of the grounds made good by the appellant are such as ordinarily to provoke consideration of ordering a new trial, that is not the case in respect of ground 2 in particular. We were satisfied that, without the evidence of Mr Wassell, it was not open to the jury to find the appellant guilty. The judge should have rejected his evidence and directed a verdict of not guilty. 
     
      
    44 For the foregoing reasons the orders were made at the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal.

      JUDGMENT [No 1] - On application of ABC for access to Exhibit A, being a CCTV video footage. 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Application has been made on behalf of the ABC for access to an exhibit in the trial which is taking place before me concerning the accused Shan Shan Xu. Ms Xu is charged with the murder of her son, Stephen Xu, on 31 March 2003. 
     
      
    2 The matter has proceeded before me, on the election of the accused, and with the consent of the Crown, as a judge sitting alone. It began with the Crown tendering material which was marked as Exhibit A and which included a video which is the subject of this application. 
     
      
    3 The Crown case is that Ms Xu took her son, who was then aged four and a half years, by train from Central to Meadowbank. She alighted and spent the afternoon with her son in a small park which is adjacent to a wharf in that location. 
     
      
    4 Being a wharf controlled by the transport authority, it is fitted with closed circuit television. Repeatedly throughout the afternoon there are images of Ms Xu and her deceased son which appear in that television footage. 
     
      
    5 At 6.41 pm, after darkness had fallen, the footage shows images of Ms Xu making her way with Stephen down the ramp which leads to the wharf. She is holding his hand. As they reached the end she paused. She then gathered him in her arms and again she paused. After some time, the footage shows Ms Xu and her son disappearing from the end of the wharf, such that one would infer that she then jumped into the Parramatta River below. 
     
      
    6 There is evidence within the various statements from exhibit A of what happened thereafter. She was seen by various people, including fishermen and fisherwomen, who were positioned on the nearby pylons of the railway bridge, which was to the west. She was also seen by people who were using the river for rowing and boating. Gradually she either swam or drifted to the west in the vicinity of the next peninsular which is Homebush Bay. 
     
      
    7 At roughly 7.55 pm, that is some considerable time after her entry into the water, she was noticed by passengers on a ferry which was operating along the Parramatta River. She was heard to cry for help. The boat's Master was persuaded to turn the boat around and the boat then went to her rescue. As they endeavoured to assist her and pull her from the water it became obvious that she was clutching her child. She was then taken on board, as was the child. Efforts were made to revive the child. An ambulance was summoned and the boat continued to the nearby wharf. Ambulance officers had by that time arrived. Attempts to revive the child were unsuccessful. 
     
      
    8 The Crown case, in the TV footage, included not only the truly horrific final moments of Stephen as the pair walk towards the end of the wharf, but several other poignant scenes, where mother and child played during the course of the afternoon in a section of the wharf set aside for passengers. The child can be seen jumping from one seat to another, like any normal four and a half year old. 
     
      
    9 The matter has proceeded after a plea of not guilty by the accused, it being indicated at the time of entry of that plea that she raised the defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    10 An extensive psychiatric history has accompanied the material which has been tendered. It includes the history in the months before these tragic events. It also includes her subsequent progress. It incorporates the opinions of doctors who have been qualified by the Crown and by the accused to express a view as to the defence that she raises. In each case those doctors support that defence, that is, that at the time of these events she was suffering from a major depressive illness with psychotic features such that she did not know the nature and quality of her act or if she did, she had no appreciation of the fact that it was wrong. 
     
      
    11 The trial has reached the point where the evidence is now complete. I have yet to hear submissions from counsel. I expect that counsel for the Crown and for the accused with one voice, will submit that I should find in this case that the accused has made out, as a matter of probability, the defence of mental illness. However, that lies in the future. I have yet, for my part, to read all the material and sift through the evidence and form a final view in respect of that matter. 
     
      
    12 However, it can be said, as a prima facie position, that there is a strong basis for finding, on the evidence as it appears to me at this time, that there is such a defence. 
     
      
    13 This matter, when it began, attracted a deal of media interest. There was at least half a dozen, if not a dozen media representatives present. A number of photographers were positioned outside the Court. That interest to some extent has continued. Having regard to matters which have currency in the press at the moment and the interest and legitimate concern of the public concerning matters of mental health, that is perhaps not surprising. 
     
      
    14 However, the particular issue that arises concerns the release of some of the images from the closed circuit television footage. 
     
      
    15 Mr Dawson of Counsel, who very ably represented the ABC, and who has provided helpful written submissions, has indicated that his client has no wish to screen the final moments of this woman's journey with her young son. He has made that submission against the background of certain evidence which was given at the end of yesterday from Dr Nielssen, which included the following comment made by Dr Nielssen, having heard a preliminary debate between counsel for the accused and comments by myself whilst he was waiting to give evidence. Dr Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist of some considerable experience, and no stranger to these courts as an expert witness, said this at page 34: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, if it assists, I wonder if I can make a comment on that last application from a psychiatric view. There is some research that shows depictions of suicide attempts in the media leads to imitators and there has been some studies that have shown a rise in suicides after very widely watched stories on suicide. I think it is taught to journalists to be very careful in reporting. I just wonder about seeing a video of someone attempting suicide, it might have some effect.” 
        
       
      
    16 Now, though the matter has been approached with some sensitivity by Mr Dawson and his client in that fashion, it does raise the question of general principle, though I will consider both the general principle and the more limited application made by Mr Dawson. 
     
      
    17 Before turning to the arguments I should refer to the relevant statutory setting within which this issue arises. My attention has been drawn to Practice Note 97 which deals with access to court files by non parties. Rule 2 of that part is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “2. Access will normally be granted to non-parties in respect of; 
        
       
       
        
        (A) pleadings and judgments in proceedings that have been concluded, except in so far as an order has been made that they or portions of them be kept confidential; 
        
       
       
        
        (B) documents that record what was said or done in open court; 
        
       
       
        
        (C) material that was admitted into evidence; and 
        
       
       
        
        (D) information that would have been heard or seen by and person present in open court, 
        
       
       
        
        Unless the Judge or registrar dealing with the application considers that the material or portions of it should be kept confidential. Access to other material will not be allowed unless a registrar or Judge is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist.” 
        
       
      
    18 The final words of that rule suggest a discretion which is framed in terms of the Judge considering, ""that the material or portions of it shall be kept confidential.” 
     
      
    19 Counsel for the ABC has drawn attention to a case involving Mr John Marsden. At the very outset of that litigation application was made by Mr Marsden for an injunction to restrain Channel 7 from publication. The application was heard in a small court within the Supreme Court where, as it happened, there were five people present. Channel 7 argued that the presence of those five people, when the application was heard, meant that the matter was then in the public domain, the broadcast having been aired before the Court, including those five individuals. 
     
      
    20 Levine J upheld that argument. He declined to restrain the publication. I have not seen a copy of the Judgment. I am simply repeating the gist of what has been given to me by Counsel. However, its application in this case, it is suggested, is this: At the very outset of this trial, when opening the case to me, the Crown showed me, and those present in court, including journalists, the footage which is now the subject of this application. It cannot therefore be said to be confidential. It is in the public domain. The only inhibition upon its dissemination and repetition is the fact that for the moment the Court has the exhibit to which the broadcasting corporation seeks access. That, in Mr Dawson's submission, is not a relevant consideration. It is in the nature of a mechanical inhibition which should not prevent access. 
     
      
    21 There is some force in that argument. Nonetheless, the matter has been approached before me on the basis that I have a discretion, as I believe I do, even though the matter has been aired in public. I, therefore, turn to the discretion which I have. 
     
      
    22 My attention has been drawn, helpfully, to a number of decisions by judges of this court, mainly the Equity Division, and mainly concerning access to affidavits which are taken as read. They form part of the court file but are not repeated in open court and therefore not available to parties, absent an order making them available by access to the file. A number of Judges have said that such material ought usually be made available. Such limitations as there appear to be upon such access, appear to deal with matters which are not read, that is not relied upon by the parties and which do not form part of the evidence in the proceedings. 
     
      
    23 The Practice Note and the decisions rightly place importance upon the presumption, which is included in the opening words of Pt 97 rule 2, that access will normally be granted. I approach the matter upon the basis that in respect of a public hearing and a matter which is marked as a public exhibit, there is a prima facie right of the public to have access to such material. That prima facie right, however, has been expressed to be subject to the qualification that access should not be granted in circumstances which the Court characterises as wholly exceptional. That was the approach taken by Studdert J in the case of R v LMW [1999] NSWSC 1111, picking up the words of Samuels JA in David Syme & Co Ltd v General Motors Holden Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 294 at 310. 
     
      
    24 My attention has also been drawn to the decision of the Court of Appeal in John Fairfax Publications v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324, in which the Chief Justice dealt with the circumstances in which a non publication order or a suppression order may be appropriate. His Honour referred, amongst other things, to John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd v Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465, where McHugh JA said, when sitting in the Court of Appeal, that the fundamental rule of common law was that the administration of justice must take place in open court. A court can only depart from that rule where its observance would frustrate the administration of justice or some other public interest for whose protection Parliament has modified the open justice rule. 
     
      
    25 His Honour went on to say that the principle of open justice also required that nothing should be done to discourage the making of a fair and accurate report of what occurs in a courtroom. Chief Justice Spigelman, with whom Handley JA and Campbell J agreed, characterised the principle of open justice as a human right, as well as a mechanism for ensuring the integrity and efficacy of the institutions of the administration of justice. 
     
      
    26 The issue, therefore, arises whether, in the circumstance of this particular trial, and the exhibit sought, it is appropriate to characterise such circumstances as wholly exceptional. 
     
      
    27 On one previous occasion, I have been confronted with a similar application. I was the trial judge in a case of R v RIK [2004] NSWSC 75, in which the accused was a juvenile, being four days short of his 18th birthday at the time of the alleged offence. He was accused of manslaughter. The circumstances giving rise to the charge concerned an incident on Redfern railway station. It was alleged that, having alighted from a train and without provocation, he began to remonstrate with a person who was sitting on a railway seat and to threaten that person physically, being restrained only by two females who accompanied him. 
     
      
    28 The person who was the subject of these remarks got up, walked around the seat, walked to the edge of the platform, jumped onto the tracks and endeavoured to make his way to the opposite platform. As he did so, a train coming in the opposite direction, on the adjacent platform, collided with him before he reached safety. The video footage was again poignant and graphic. 
     
      
    29 In that case, however, it seemed to me appropriate to accede to an application for access to it. It formed part of the Crown case. It was shown in open court. There were issues of public safety. There were, ultimately, if the accused were convicted, as he was, issues of deterrence. Accordingly, upon application, that footage was released. 
     
      
    30 Once released it then had a great deal of currency in the media coverage which followed. It was obviously more powerful than any description of the same events.  
     
      
    31 There being issues of public safety and public interest, it seemed to me wholly appropriate and entirely consistent with the principles of open justice that such material should be made available, even though the accused was, at the time of the offence, although not at the time of the trial, still a child at law. 
     
      
    32 In this case, however, the public interest in having photographs of the deceased and the accused on that afternoon and in the moments before the death of the young child, is less obvious, although I appreciate that that is not the test. 
     
      
    33 One of the concerns in this case is the future well-being of the accused, since, on any view, whatever the outcome of this trial, and whatever the verdict, she is a person who has experienced major depression and a period of lengthy hospitalisation. She is still under treatment. 
     
      
    34 There are also issues of responsibility. The accused is a person who has raised a defence which, if it is successful, will have the effect that she is not guilty of the murder of her child. 
     
      
    35 Questions arise as to whether the publicity which is intended, and that which is likely to follow, may make this case one which is wholly exceptional. As to that issue, a number of doctors have given evidence. Doctor Parmegiani has given the following evidence of this issue in answer to Counsel for Ms Xu: (T51) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What is being debated here is the transmission of some part of that footage, not as I understand it, including the final moments but other aspects which would depict the accused and her son in the time immediately before the final moments, or at some time before the final moments, and the issue is whether that transmission would be likely to have any detrimental effect upon the accused? 
         
        A. Yes, I believe it would because she obviously knows what comes after, even a small segment of that transmission. So she would be reminded herself of what happened and I would expect that if it is released in the media it would be shown several times, not just once in court, it would have a much larger audience than it had when it was aired here. She may again come across comments from friends, acquaintances or even strangers to the effect that they have seen the footage, and again be reminded of it. I believe this would be a cumulative experience. Seeing once, I think, is bad enough but having to see it several times would be re-exposed to it several times in various ways, would certainly be counter productive."" 
        
       
      
    36 In cross examination by Mr Dawson of Counsel, for the ABC, Dr Parmegiani's attention was drawn to the considerable media coverage of the trial to this point. Dr Parmegiani gave the following evidence: (T58) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Yes, I agreed she has received exposure. My argument is why add to that burden to that exposure; why add more exposure than what has already happened? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If there were to be impact upon the defendant as a result of media coverage of the trial, that impact, would you agree, has to some extent at least already taken place? 
         
        A. Yes, some of it has taken place and the more exposure she gets, the more impact she will suffer. That is my argument."" 
        
       
      
    37 In re-examination, Dr Parmegiani said this: (T59) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. In your experience is there a difference or is there potential difference from the impact in relation to the impact upon the accused by reason of media coverage describing the events and the circumstances relating to this case, as opposed to live images of her 4-year old son in the moments being depicted live on television, in the moments before he dies? 
         
        A. Yes, well, although it may be a cliché, there is a saying a picture is worth a thousand words. I think being directly visually reminded of the events just preceding the death of her son, may have a significant impact on her well-being. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Doctor, in your opinion is there any difference in relation to the potential impact upon her of the accused viewing the footage on one occasion in the controlled environment of this court on the one hand, and being exposed to it potentially on numerous occasions in an environment that is not controlled? 
         
        A. Yes, I think within the local context you may see it as a necessary part of the trial process, something that she can brace herself for, expect and deal with. Whereas any subsequent exposure in my view is totally unnecessary. It doesn't contribute anything to her, either the trial process or clinical progress, it is only for the purpose of the media having access to it and I think it would be counter productive for her."" 
        
       
      
    38 My attention has been drawn to the test which was defined by Spigelman CJ in the John Fairfax publication case. Having said that suppression of material is an exceptional jurisdiction, his Honour then said this at paragraph 94: 
     
     ""This test required a high level of certainty.” 
    39 Here the suggestion is that if the material comes to the notice of the accused, either through seeing the material herself or her attention being drawn to it by those who do, then that will be harmful to her rehabilitation. 
     
      
    40 Mr Dawson of Counsel, for the ABC, argues that in the context of a trial, which has proceeded with a deal of publicity to this point, the addition of images, such as the ABC wishes to include when reporting on these proceedings, is unlikely to bring about harm. Alternatively, there is no certainty of harm, as the test postulated by the Chief Justice would seem to require. What might happen, and the effects upon the accused, are speculative in the extreme. Were there harm, over and above that caused by the general publicity surrounding the trial, such matters could be dealt with by the accused's doctors in their counselling of her. 
     
      
    41 It is put on behalf of the accused that the principle of open justice is hardly put in jeopardy by depriving the media of this material. The matter has proceeded in open court. The media have been present throughout. They have seen the video. They are well able to describe what they saw. The only thing they are not able to do is add the spice that inevitably arises from an image. 
     
      
    42 I am persuaded, having heard the psychiatrists, that in some ways it would be preferable, therapeutically, had this trial (and others like it) not received any publicity at all. However, in our system of justice that is not an option. It is important that justice be open and that the media be in a position to report what happens in court, unless they are ordered not to do so for exceptional reasons. 
     
      
    43 However, it does seem to me that there are limits to open justice. One must, at the end of the day, in determining whether there are exceptional circumstances, weigh, on the one hand, the likely harm to the accused were she to become someone notorious as a result of publicity arising from her case, in the way, I might say, that the accused in the Redfern railway case did become the object of very close media scrutiny and may be said to have become notorious and, on the other hand, the compromise to open justice which is involved in the particular order which is suggested. Even if Ms Xu does not become notorious, and there is simply additional publicity, which includes her image and that of her son, what harm is likely to ensue from that? These essentially are the issues arising under the discretion. 
     
      
    44 Having seen the images and understood their poignancy, I do think that there is a risk that the matter may be given wide coverage, especially if images which are made available to this applicant are then taken up by others and used in the print media. Whether or not that happens, I do believe there will be further and not inconsiderable publicity, and that such publicity would be harmful to the rehabilitation of the accused. Compared to that potential harm, the sacrifice to open justice is, in my judgment, small. 
     
      
    45 In the circumstances, I am persuaded that the circumstances are wholly exceptional and that the application should be declined, even in the limited form put forward.

     REGINA v Linda WILSON 
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HUNT AJA: The appellant (Linda Wilson) was found by a Supreme Court jury not guilty of the murder, but guilty of the manslaughter, of a boy almost two years old (Jayden March) who was in her foster care. The jury had been directed that, if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm to the child, she would be guilty of manslaughter if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing the death of the child was an unlawful and dangerous one. Miles AJ sentenced her to imprisonment for nine years, with a non-parole period of six years and eleven months. 
     
      
    2 When sentencing the appellant, the trial judge interpreted the jury’s verdict as its rejection of the Crown case that she had acted alone in injuring the child, that the substantial injuries (which her husband said in evidence that he had inflicted on the child’s head and stomach the previous evening) had not been inflicted by her and that they had had not themselves been the cause of his death, but that her shaking of the child was the final causative factor in his death. These findings were based to a large part on the extensive medical evidence tendered by the Crown which established that the child had died from what the forensic pathologists called “Shaken Baby Syndrome”, causing his brain to swell and leading to asphyxia and death. The medical evidence was that this shaking would have occurred about thirty minutes before death. 
     
      
    3 The version which the appellant gave when extensively interviewed by the police was that, after observing that the child was playing and appeared to be normal, she returned within minutes to find him on his side, making a croaking noise, and shaking and holding his head. She had started to panic and was “just like patting him”, trying to wake him up. She telephoned her husband and, at his suggestion, she took the child to the local doctor’s surgery where, after unsuccessfully attempting to resuscitate the child, the doctor pronounced the child dead. The videotapes of these interviews were before the jury, having been tendered by the Crown. 
     
      
    4 The judge rejected the Crown’s submission that the unlawful and dangerous acts accepted by the jury demonstrated deliberate cruelty on the part of the appellant. He considered whether there had been any culpable delay by her in seeking medical attention, but said that he did not make any such finding against the appellant. 
     
      
    5 The husband was never charged with any offence. 
     
      
    6 The appellant has appealed against conviction and she seeks leave to appeal against her sentence. 
     
      
    7 The sole ground of appeal asserts that the trial judge erred in his directions to the jury concerning the fact that the appellant did not give evidence in the trial. The relevant directions were in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        As I say, she has presented a case partly by way of evidence and partly by way of argument presented on her behalf. Now, as far as the evidence goes, it is obvious that she herself has not given evidence. She has called evidence but she herself has not entered the witness box. Now, I cannot stress too strongly, it has already been said but it comes again from me, the accused does not have to give evidence. She has the right to give evidence if she wishes, but she can exercise the choice as she has in this case not to do so. It is essential that you remember that no inference of guilt can be drawn from the absence of the accused from the witness box. In no way can you draw an inference that she is admitting or confessing anything by declining to give evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        What the accused has said to other people in the past is itself evidence. It is hearsay evidence as I have mentioned earlier, but it is evidence and you must take it into account. It is a possible version of facts. You may consider it to be true. But remember that it is not evidence in the same sense as the evidence that has been given in the courtroom by witnesses who have gone into the witness box, in particular, it is not subject to cross-examination. What she has said to the police and to other persons in the past in so far as you have heard about it, for instance to the doctors in the hospital, is something that you will take into account but, of course, it is not evidence in the same sense as the evidence of the witnesses who have given evidence on oath or affirmation. 
        
       
       
      There was no complaint by counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial as to the adequacy of these directions. 
       
      
    8 There was no direct evidence that the appellant inflicted these injuries on the child, the Crown case being a circumstantial one based on the facts that the injuries causing death indicated that the child had been shaken, that they were inflicted shortly before death and that only the appellant was present in the room with the young child at the relevant time. A necessary implication of the version which the appellant gave to the police when interviewed was that, if the cause of death was the result of human intervention, she was the only person who could have inflicted the injuries at the relevant time. The appellant had also told another witness (a patient of the local doctor) that the child’s five year old sister was in another room at the time. There was no-one else in the house. 
     
      
    9 In the course of directing the jury in relation to the need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational explanation of these circumstances was the guilt of the appellant, the trial judge made it clear that the prosecution bore the onus of proving her guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that it was not for the appellant to prove her innocence “or, indeed, to prove anything at all”. 
     
      
    10 The appellant’s argument is that the judge failed to direct the jury in accordance with the judgment of four justices in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 at [51]: 
     
      
       
        
        In the course of argument of the present matters it was suggested that if a judge said nothing to the jury about the fact that an accused had not given evidence, the jury may use the accused’s silence in court to his or her detriment. Plainly that is so. It follows that if an accused does not give evidence at trial it will almost always be desirable for the judge to warn the jury that the accused’s silence in court is not evidence against the accused, does not constitute an admission by the accused, may not be used to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the prosecution, and may not be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It by no means follows, however, that the judge should go on to comment on the way in which the jury might use the fact that the accused did not give evidence. 
        
       
      
    11 It is conceded by the appellant that the judge’s directions satisfied the first two ingredients of that direction, but not the second two ingredients — that the absence of evidence from an accused may not be used to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the Crown, and may not be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant submits that the failure by the judge to direct the jury in the terms of the two missing ingredients led to “a significant possibility of a real injustice”. 
     
      
    12 Before dealing with the appellant’s arguments, it is important to emphasise that nothing which the judge said to the jury could reasonably have been construed by the jury as suggesting that the fact that the appellant had not given evidence could be used by them to accept the Crown case more readily, or to infer that her evidence would not have assisted her case (Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308, 312, 320-321), or that she was, or that she believed that she was, guilty of the offence charged (Evidence Act 1995, s 20(2)).  Indeed, the judge was at pains to deny the availability of any such inferences, and to ensure that the jury was obliged to take into account her statements to the police and other witnesses and which could assist her case. Of course, even in civil cases the rule in Jones v Dunkel did not permit an inference that the untendered evidence would in fact have been damaging to the party who could have tendered it or to fill gaps in the evidence: Jones v Dunkel at 308, 312, 320-321; Bridge v The Queen (1994) 118 CLR 600 at 615; Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 227, 235. 
     
      
    13 It is also convenient at this stage to note another matter. The relevant passage in the summing up does not include the warning, said to have been “ordinarily necessary” in Regina v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744 at 751), that there may be reasons unknown to the jury why an accused person remains silent, even if otherwise in a position to contradict or explain evidence. The phrase “ordinarily necessary” was said by this Court in Regina v Bargwan (CCA, 15 June 1998, unreported) to mean that it is only in extraordinary circumstances that such a warning should not be given. The implied criticism of the OGD judgment by the High Court in RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620 at [30] related only to any interpretation of it as authorising a Jones v Dunkel direction in any case where the accused has not given evidence. It was in that sense that it was said that OGD should be overruled; it did not relate to what has become known as an OGD warning, that there may be many reasons unknown to the jury why an accused remains silent. I interpret the agreement by Callinan J (at [110]) with what had been said by four justices at [30] in the same way. There is no complaint in the present appeal that the warning was not given at the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
    14 It is significant that the joint judgment in the Azzopardi case did not include an OGD warning in the warning which is now “almost always…desirable”, notwithstanding that the trial judge in the Azzopardi case had directed the jury, in a passage quoted in the joint judgment (at [71], p 76), that “[t]here may be many reasons why an accused person may decide not to give evidence”. In Regina v Nguyen [2002] NSWCCA 342 at [52], this Court said that it was not persuaded that it was still necessary to give the warning formulated in the OGD case where the warnings in the Azzopardi case have been given, provided that there has been no Jones v Dunkel direction given. That is clearly correct, as the OGD direction was designed to balance a Jones v Dunkel direction that a failure by the accused to contradict or explain incriminating evidence, in circumstances where it would be reasonable to expect him to do so, may make it easier for the jury to accept, or to draw inferences from, the evidence on which the Crown relies. An OGD direction is therefore only necessary where such a suggestion has been made. 
     
      
    15 With those matters put to one side, I turn now to consider the complaint which the appellant has made in her appeal. The High Court in Azzopardi’s case did not make it compulsory to give the suggested direction to be given in every case, or even in almost every case. Unlike the judgment in (for example) Dominican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 561-562, which laid down “special rules in relation to the directions which judges must give in criminal trials where identification is a significant issue”, the majority judgment in the Azzopardi case very carefully said only that it will “almost always be desirable” for the warning to be given where there is no evidence from the accused. (I have added the emphasis in both cases.) In my view, the difference is important — particularly where, as in the present case, no complaint was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    16 This is the approach which has been adopted by this Court in most of the cases in which the Azzopardi case has been considered. In Regina v Richards [2002] NSWCCA 38 at [29], it was said that the Azzopardi case cannot be taken to have ruled that it is compulsory, let alone desirable, for the warning to be given in every case. In Regina v SMR [2002] NSWCCA 258 at [105], it was said that the Azzopardi case did not state that it was mandatory in every case, and that some element of discretion was left to the trial judge. In Regina v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203 at [94], it was noted that the warning was not universally required, though “desirable”. In that case, too, no complaint had been made at the trial, and leave to rely on its absence on appeal pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was refused. An application to the High Court for special leave to appeal from the judgment was dismissed (12 October 2004). In most of the cases in which appeals had been dismissed notwithstanding the absence of a direction which satisfied every one of the four ingredients of the Azzopardi direction, directions had been given which satisfied the first two ingredients but not the second two ingredients — as in the present case. 
     
      
    17 There is, however, one decision of this Court in which a very different approach was adopted. It formed the principal basis of the appellant’s argument in the present case. In Regina v Macris [2004] NSWCCA 261, the trial judge answered a jury’s question as to why the accused had not given evidence by saying that the accused was entitled to put the Crown to proof, that he had the right not to give evidence and that no inference could be drawn against him for exercising that right. The judge elaborated that statement during the summing-up, adding that the accused had acted in accordance with legal advice. No complaint was made at the trial as to the adequacy of those directions. On appeal, the appellant complained of the judge’s failure to give directions in accordance with both the Azzopardi and the OGD cases. 
     
      
    18 This Court held that, as no Jones v Dunkel direction had been given, it was (in accordance with the Nguyen case) unnecessary to give an OGD direction provided that an Azzopardi direction was given. However, the Azzopardi direction given did not include its last two ingredients, warning the jury that the fact the accused had not given evidence may not be used by it to fill gaps in the Crown evidence and may not be used by them as a make-weight in assessing whether the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The Court stated (at [29]) that, although the Azzopardi case does admit of cases where a direction in its terms may not be necessary, there was “nothing in the facts of this case which would make such a direction inappropriate”. The Court held (at [31]) that, as the error “gives rise to the possibility of a real injustice being occasioned to the appellant”, leave to rely on the ground of appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld on that ground. No reference was made to the approach which had been taken in the earlier cases. With the greatest respect to the members of the Court in that case, such an approach is inconsistent with authority. 
     
      
    19 Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides, inter alia, that no direction or omission to give a direction at the trial shall, without the leave of this Court, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction or omission by the appellant. In order to obtain such leave, an appellant must first establish at least an arguable case of error — in this case, that there was a misdirection. The issue which arose in that appeal, and which arises in the present appeal, is therefore whether it was “desirable” for the Azzopardi direction (or any ingredient of it) to be given in the particular case, but there was no examination in that appeal of why it was “desirable” for the two missing elements of the Azzopardi direction to be given in that case. That it was “desirable” in that case is not established by demonstrating merely that there was “nothing in the facts of [his] case which would make such a direction inappropriate”. (I have added the emphasis.) 
     
      
    20 Next, leave to rely on an error where no point was taken at the trial will be granted only where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice: Regina v O’Brien (1920) 20 SR 486 at 490; Regina v Branscombe (1921) 21 SR 363 at 367, 378 (the third member of the Court said [at 372] that only under the most exceptional circumstances would an appellant be permitted to rely on a point not taken at the trial when he had been legally represented there); the High Court refused special leave to appeal, (1921) 29 CLR 602; Regina v Malas (1978) 21 ALR 225 at 232; Regina v Abusafiah (1991) 25 NSWLR 531 at 536. In Regina v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 195, this Court stated an even more onerous test for the grant of leave to rely on a point not taken at the trial, that leave will generally only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of law that it went to the root of the proceedings. However, the usual test for compliance with r 4 is that the appellant must demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    21 There is a miscarriage of justice where, by reason of the error made, the accused may have lost a chance fairly open to him of being acquitted: Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514. In the Macris case, the appellant had to show (as does the appellant in the present case) that the absence of the direction in question led to the loss of such a chance of being acquitted. This is the approach which has been adopted by this Court in cases in which the Azzopardi case has been considered and the appeal dismissed: see, for example Regina v Burns [2003] NSWCCA 30 at [50]. See also Regina v Le [2003] SASC 2 at [30]. No reference was made to this approach in the Macris judgment, and the basis upon which the Court was satisfied that the absence of the relevant direction in that case led to a miscarriage of justice was not identified. 
     
      
    22 In my respectful opinion, the decision in Regina v Macris was wrong, and it should not be followed. 
     
      
    23 It seems necessary once more to make it clear that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted in accordance with directions to which no objection has been taken to have a new trial in accordance with different directions which he could and should have raised at his first trial, unless the directions given have led to a miscarriage of justice. The trial in the present case took place long after the decision of the High Court in the Azzopardi case, and no argument is available that the rules by which it should have been conducted had been changed since the trial. 
     
      
    24 The requirements of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non-direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance of counsel to which he or she is entitled in the increasingly difficult task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge’s attention had been drawn to it, if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error operates fails to comply with his or her duty to draw the error to the judge’s attention, and if the error has caused no miscarriage of justice, it can hardly be called appropriate to permit an appellant to seek a new trial on the basis of that error in the hope that he may do better with a different jury. The right to a fair trial operates not only in favour of the accused; the Crown which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community also has a right to a fair trial. These statements have been made by this Court in many cases: see, for example: Regina v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536; Regina v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993) at pp 6-7; Regina v Sanderson (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 July 1994) at pp 7-8; Regina v Steeden (Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 August 1994) at 6; ; Regina v Mahoney (2000) 114 A Crim R 130 at [15] – [16]; Regina v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360 at [115]; Regina v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208 at [40] – [45] (the case reported on other matters at (2001) 123 A Crim R 310); Regina v Button [2002] NSWCCA 195 at [31] – [35] (the case is reported on other matters at (2002) 54 NSWLR 455). See also Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319. 
     
      
    25 It has never been suggested that, where it becomes “desirable” in the particular case to give only the first two ingredients of the Azzopardi direction, the failure to give a ritual incantation of the whole direction is an error giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. In my view, the joint judgment in the Azzopardi case should not be interpreted as leading to such a consequence. Was it “desirable” then for the whole Azzopardi direction to be given in the present case? And did the absence of the second two ingredients of that direction lead to the loss of any chance fairly open to the appellant of acquittal or to some other miscarriage of justice? 
     
      
    26 The summing up contained the following warnings in relation to the fact that the appellant had not given evidence — 
     
      
       she did not have to give evidence; she had the right to do so or to choose not to, and  
       
       no inference of guilt could be drawn from the absence of any evidence from her; she had not admitted or confessed anything by declining to give evidence. 
       
      Those directions sufficiently satisfied the first two ingredients of the  
      Azzopardi  
      direction — that the silence of the accused in court is not evidence against the accused and does not constitute an admission by the accused. As I have already said, this was conceded by the appellant. 
       
      
    27 The third and fourth ingredients of the Azzopardi direction are that the silence of the accused in court — 
     
      
      (3) may not be used to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the prosecution, and 
       
      (4) may not be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
      Counsel for the appellant argued that these missing directions should have been given because of the conflict between the medical evidence presented by the prosecutor and that presented by the appellant. This submission was not elaborated. In my view, it has not been made out. 
       
      
    28 Although the jury were instructed in very general terms that a doctor forms an opinion based in part on the history which has been supplied, it is clear from the medical evidence presented by both parties that, in this case, the opinions expressed by the doctors were based only on the examinations they conducted on the body of the deceased child (or, in some cases, on the examination by other doctors on that body). There was, the judge told the jury, nothing at all in any of the histories about the baby being shaken. 
     
      
    29 The medical evidence supporting the Crown case that human intervention had caused the death of the child was very strong. On the version given to the police by the appellant herself, there was no reasonable possibility that any person other than the appellant was in a position to touch the child at the relevant time. The medical evidence supporting the case for the appellant that there was a reasonable possibility that the child died from various natural causes was largely speculative, diffuse and in some respects contradictory. The submissions that the two missing ingredients from the Azzopardi direction would have (a) strengthened the weight to be afforded to the statements the appellant made to the police and other witnesses in her favour, and (b) provided the appellant with a chance fairly open to her of acquittal on that basis, should be rejected. 
     
      
    30 A more sustained argument was that — as the judge had instructed the jury that the hearsay evidence of the statements the appellant made to the police and other witnesses was not on oath or affirmation or subjected to cross-examination, and not evidence in the same sense as the evidence that had been given in court by witnesses — the missing ingredients would have balanced the effect of that instruction. This, it was suggested, was because the jury may reasonably have been persuaded by those missing ingredients to give her hearsay denial of mistreating the child greater weight than the direction given would have suggested to the jury. 
     
      
    31 The only “gap” in the Crown case was the absence of any direct evidence or admission that the child had been shaken and that it was the appellant who had shaken him. That had to be inferred from the nature of the injuries to the child, and the fact that those injuries were inflicted shortly before death when the appellant was the only person present in the room with the child at the relevant time. It was therefore certainly “desirable” in the present case to ensure that the jury did not treat the appellant’s silence in court as an admission that she was the person who had shaken the child. 
     
      
    32 The jury were not faced with total silence on the part of the appellant. They had had played to them her two interviews by the police. What is left is the fact that she had not given evidence supporting her statements to the police and been tested in cross-examination. The judge did direct the jury that no inference of guilt could be drawn from the appellant declining to give evidence. Her argument is that this direction did not deal specifically with the weight to be given to the statements made to the police, and that directions which included the two missing ingredients would have been effective to do so. 
     
      
    33 I do not myself interpret the two missing ingredients from the Azzopardi direction in this case as being concerned with the weight to be given to hearsay statements favouring the accused which have been tendered in evidence. Nor do I understand their purpose to be to balance the jury’s knowledge that hearsay statements made by an accused which favour his case are not evidence in the same sense as evidence given by witnesses in court. The reference to a “make-weight” in the last ingredient should not be confused with issues of the weight to be afforded to material in the case. A make-weight is no more than something placed in the scales to make up a required weight. 
     
      
    34 Both of the missing ingredients seem to me to be primarily directed to preventing the jury from reasoning that, if the accused had any answer to the Crown case, or to a particular part of the Crown case, he would have given evidence of that answer, and that he did not give evidence because he would himself have either filled any gaps in the Crown case or in some other way added to its weight. Yet the second of the directions which were given in this particular case (that no inference of guilt could be drawn from the absence of any evidence from the appellant, and that she had not admitted or confessed anything by declining to give evidence) — which is within the spirit of s 20(2) of the Evidence Act, and which in my view covers the same ground as the missing ingredients — adequately fulfils the purpose of those two ingredients. 
     
      
    35 Whilst the trial would not have suffered had the whole Azzopardi direction been given, I do not accept that it was “desirable” for the missing ingredients to have been included in the terms expressed by the joint judgment in the directions given in this case. The absence of the missing ingredients in those terms would not have led to the loss of any chance fairly open to the appellant of acquittal or to any other miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, I propose that leave to rely on the ground of appeal be refused and that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
     
      
    36 There is one further matter relating to the conviction appeal to which reference should be made. No complaint was made of the direction given by the judge that the appellant’s hearsay statements to the police and other witnesses were not on oath or affirmation or subjected to cross-examination, and were not evidence in the same sense as the evidence which had been given in court by witnesses. This direction was in much the same terms as the direction which appellate courts had permitted in relation to an unsworn statement by the accused at the time when trial judges were not permitted to comment upon the failure of the accused to give evidence. Such a direction is still permitted by ss 165(1)(a) of the Evidence Act in relation to hearsay evidence where the judge is requested by a party to give it. Section 165(2) requires the judge when giving the direction to: 
     
      
       
      (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable; and 
       
      (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable; and 
       
      (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
       
       
      The trial judge need not comply with the request if there are good reasons for not doing so (s 165(3)), and it is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
       
      
    37 There was no discussion of these provisions in the joint judgment in the Azzopardi case, but the general thrust of that judgment is that an accused person must not effectively be forced to give evidence by reason of the nature of the directions which may be given if he does not. This type of hearsay evidence of the version given by the accused to the police when interviewed is always led in the Crown case whether or not the accused intends to give evidence. If he does give evidence, then a direction in accordance with s 165(2) would be reasonable — subject only to any specific “good reason” which applies in the particular case. Where, however, the accused has not given evidence, it will be for the trial judge in the particular case to perform the delicate exercise of determining whether his decision not to give evidence is a good reason in that particular case for not doing so. 
     
      
    38 The direction in the present case was not given with s 165 in mind. Although it did not include any express suggestion that, by reason of its hearsay nature, such evidence is in fact of less weight than sworn evidence by the accused, that is how it would probably have been interpreted by the jury. Section 165(2) says that the warning should be that the hearsay evidence “may” be unreliable. A warning such as that given in the present case has been approved as not infringing the restrictions imposed in the Azzopardi case where the judge had expressly told the jury that hearsay evidence did not have the same evidential value as evidence given in court: Mule v The Queen [2004] WASCA 7 at [12-19]. Western Australia does not have any provision along the lines of s 165. The Court of Criminal Appeal of that State found justification for the direction in a decision of the House of Lords: Regina v Sharp [1998] 1 WLR 7. However, it should be noted that an appropriate warning was described by the House of Lords in that case (at 12) as drawing the attention of the jury to the different weights “they may think it right to attach” to hearsay evidence of the accused’s explanation as opposed to such evidence of his or her admissions, rather than suggesting that it is in fact of less weight. (I have added the emphasis in the quotation.) 
     
      
    39 This issue was not argued in the present appeal, but judges who intend to give such a warning would — in the light of the requirement of s 165(2) that the warning is that the hearsay evidence “may” be unreliable — do well to leave to the jury the issue of the weight actually to be given to the hearsay evidence in the particular case before them. 
     
      
    40 The appellant has also sought leave to appeal against her sentence of imprisonment for nine years, with a non-parole period of six years and eleven months. 
     
      
    41 The crime was a serious one. Any child not quite two years old, as was the child in this case, is in a very vulnerable situation, and is quite unable to protect itself or to communicate fully with other persons when in a position it is too young to understand. The responsibility of a parent or carer is great, and causing the death of a child by a dangerous and unlawful act constitutes a very serious breach of the position of trust which the appellant had accepted as the carer of this child. The appellant, who was then thirty years of age and who had had the care of children of her own, would necessarily have known of the danger involved in shaking a child as young as this one. 
     
      
    42 The appellant makes a number of complaints concerning the judge’s remarks on sentence. He referred to certain matters of aggravation identified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, without either accepting or rejecting them expressly. Sentencing judges should be careful to make it clear whether or not they accept the Crown’s submissions: Regina v Wickham [2004] NSWCA 193 at [31]. It will usually be the case that, if a judge does not expressly reject the matters to which reference is made, it will be taken on appeal that the judge accepted them. That is the approach which should be adopted in the present case. 
     
      
    43 Section 21A(2) provides that the aggravating factors to which it refers are not to be taken into account where the particular factor is in itself an element of the offence. The Crown concedes that the judge was in error when he took into account the actual use of violence (s 21A(2)(b)), as that was the whole basis of the Crown case on manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The appellant submits that the judge was in error in taking into account the fact that the act of the appellant “resulted in the death of a child”, as that, too, is an element of the offence. However, although the death of a person was an element of the crime, the relevant matter of substantial aggravation in this case was that it was the death of a child. That is clearly all that the judge was taking into account, and he was correct in doing so. 
     
      
    44 The Crown also conceded that the judge made a mathematical error by setting the non-parole period of six years and eleven months when he had apparently not intended to make the non-parole period greater than 75% of the head sentence. The period should have been six years and nine months. 
     
      
    45 The judge accepted the need for public deterrence, particularly in cases involving the death of a young child. He noted that the appellant had shown no contrition or remorse. At the same time, as I have already stated, the judge rejected many of the Crown’s arguments on sentence. This was a necessary consequence of his interpretation of the jury’s verdict. He rejected the Crown case that the appellant had acted alone, that the substantial injuries inflicted by the appellant’s husband the previous evening were also a causative factor in the child’s death, that the acts of the appellant demonstrated deliberate cruelty on her part and that she had been guilty of culpable delay in seeking medical attention. He said that there was no suggestion in the evidence of ill-treatment of the child by the appellant. 
     
      
    46 There appears to have been no detailed examination during the trial of a possible situation where the shaking of the child caused the child’s death by reason only of the pre-existing injuries caused by the appellant’s husband. The trend of the evidence was that the injuries caused by her husband had not themselves had any bearing upon the child’s death, and this is the way the judge viewed the facts for the purposes of sentencing the appellant. The way the trial was conducted could have denied to the appellant any mitigation upon the basis that less force was required to cause the child’s death than might otherwise have been required. The onus of establishing matters in mitigation, however, lay on the appellant. The effect of that possibility upon the sentence was nevertheless minor in this case because of two other factors. 
     
      
    47 The judge did not take into account any of the substantial injuries which the appellant’s husband had caused to the child the night before. In the light of the evidence this was correct. Moreover, the judge made no express finding as to the extent of the violence which was in fact inflicted upon the child. The medical evidence was that not very much violence was required to cause death in a Shaken Baby Syndrome case. In the absence of any express finding by the judge on this issue, it is appropriate in this appeal to assume in favour of the appellant that the extent of her violence was sufficient only to cause the child’s death. 
     
      
    48 The judge also made a number of findings relevant to mitigation in addition to his rejection of the Crown case to a significant extent. He stated that the appellant and her husband, contrary to the appellant’s hopes and expectations, were unable to cope with the child, and that she found herself in a situation for which she was insufficiently trained and temperamentally and personally unsuited. (The remarks on sentence used the word “temporally”, but it was agreed that this should read “temperamentally”.) The judge found that the appellant was, in hindsight, unsuited to the task of foster care and that it was only a matter of time before it would have become clear that she was demonstratively unable to cope with her responsibilities. He accepted that the appellant had had a troubled childhood and previous marriage, but was in a satisfactory marriage with her current husband. She had become a foster carer because, as a result of injuries she had received from her previous husband resulting in the need for a hysterectomy, she was unable to have children with her new husband. Following depression at the time of leaving her first husband, and against a background of previous emotional and physical domestic abuse, she had sought to make good by fostering this child and his older sister. The judge found that, when the appellant was unable to cope with this child, and realised that the fostering did not give her the satisfaction she craved, her sudden frustration and irritability with the child that morning resulted in his injury and death. 
     
      
    49 The principal attack upon the sentence imposed is that the trial judge proceeded on an understanding that there was a recognised range of sentences for the manslaughter of very young children by the unlawful and dangerous act of parents or carers where the accused’s plea of guilty of manslaughter has been accepted in satisfaction of a charge of murder. He saw this range as being of between five and ten years’ imprisonment. The judge effectively followed his own statement in those terms in Regina v Hoerler [2003] NSWSC 1187. No previous case was discovered where the matter had gone to trial on a charge of murder relating to a young child resulting in a verdict of manslaughter. The judge held that, in such a case, the range should be imprisonment from six to twelve years. However, the judge’s understanding that there was a recognised range in relation to a manslaughter plea was subsequently held by this Court to be erroneous: Regina v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184 at [36]. So various are the circumstances of such cases and so wide the degrees of culpability involved in them, there can be no such recognised range. This had also been stated by this Court many years earlier: Regina v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 12 December 1995) at [4]. In Hoerler, this Court substantially increased the sentence which the judge had imposed. 
     
      
    50 It follows that, in the present case also, the judge misdirected himself by having regard to an erroneous range of sentences when he imposed a sentence exactly midway within the range he had adopted in Hoerler. The Crown has submitted that the sentence imposed is nevertheless an appropriate one in the circumstances of this case. However, just as the rulings by this Court in Blacklidge and Hoerler demonstrate the judge’s error as to the top of the range he identified, so do those rulings demonstrate an error by the judge as to the bottom of that range. There must necessarily therefore be an error in his selection of a sentence exactly midway within that erroneous range.  
     
      
    51 No basis has been demonstrated by either party for interfering with the relevant findings of fact made by the judge in the sentencing process. Errors have nevertheless been demonstrated in relation to the range which the judge understood to exist in this class of case, in apparent double counting in one matter of aggravation and in the mathematics of setting a non-parole period which was 75% of the head sentence. In my opinion, the appropriate head sentence in this case would be one of six years. The appellant spent a period of six weeks and three days pending her trial sentencing. The judge backdated the sentence to commence on 28 October 2003, and the new head sentence should also be backdated in that way. 
     
      
    52 The appellant also seeks a finding that special circumstances existed warranting a non-parole period less than 75% of the head sentence. This is based on the finding by the trial judge that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Since [the applicant’s] incarceration following the trial, [her] condition has deteriorated. She is able to receive medication which helps the condition, but she cannot receive the long-term intensive therapy which is needed. Her condition is not likely to be helped by the fact that she is kept in segregation, with no contact at all with other prisoners, and that situation is likely to continue.  
        
       
       
      and on the fact that this is the appellant’s first custodial experience:  
      Griffiths v The Queen  
      (1989) 167 CLR 372 at 379. 
       
      
    53 The judge, however, expressly took into account the rigorous conditions of imprisonment in which the sentence would be administered when determining the head sentence he imposed (as have I in relation to the new head sentence). Such considerations are therefore also taken into account when the non-parole period is set in accordance with the statutory proportion, and any ascertainment of special circumstances must travel beyond what was considered in determining the head sentence: Regina v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [67] – [68]; Regina v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]. The judge made it clear that he was aware that the custodial experience will be a harsher one for the appellant than it would be for a prisoner in a less strict custodial environment (as am I). Prisoners found guilty of serious offences involving the death of a child usually do have to be kept in such conditions for their own protection from other prisoners. The judge accepted that the appellant’s psychiatric condition may well continue to deteriorate in such an environment. The basis upon which the judge rejected any finding of special circumstances was that the appellant’s prognosis was not sufficiently clear to lead him to the belief that a shorter non-parole period “might affect some beneficial change in the offender’s condition and conduct”. 
     
      
    54 I see no error in the approach which the judge took, and I would adopt the same approach in the re-sentencing exercise which this Court must now undertake. I am not satisfied that special circumstances exist.  
     
      
    55 I propose that leave be granted to appeal against sentence, the appeal be upheld, the sentence of imprisonment for nine years be quashed, a new head sentence of imprisonment for six years commencing on 28 October 2003 be imposed and a non-parole period of four years and six months be set. The earliest day on which the appellant will become eligible for release on parole will be 28 April 2008. 
     
      
    56 GROVE J: In this appeal I have read, in draft form, the judgment of Hunt AJA. I agree with that judgment but, as on one issue there is a conclusion expressed that a previous judgment of this Court ought not to be followed (Regina v Macris  [2004] NSWCCA 261) I consider it desirable to record my specific assent in that regard. 
     
      
    57 As his Honour has collated, it has been held in a series of cases in this Court that it does not in every circumstance constitute error for a judge charging a jury when the accused has elected not to give evidence, to refrain from incanting all four elements of warning articulated in the joint judgment in Azzopardi v The Queen 2001 205 CLR 50 @ 51: See Regina v Richards [2002] NSWCCA 38; Regina v SMR [2002] NSWCCA 258; Regina v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203. 
     
      
    58 In that Macris may be understood to endorse an approach different from those authorities, I am also of opinion that it should not be followed. I am further in agreement with his Honour’s comments on the implementation of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    59 For the reasons which he has given, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and the sentence proposed by Hunt AJA substituted for that imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    60 JAMES J: I agree with Hunt AJA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Grove J. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions presented an indictment alleging that the Applicant committed insider-trading offences on 21 occasions between 21 May 1998 and 15 July 1998. The Applicant challenged the standing of the Director to institute the prosecution. Alternatively, the Applicant submitted that the indictment should be quashed on the basis it disclosed no offence known to the law.  
     
      
    2 Grove J rejected the applicant’s case on 9 September 2004. The Applicant seeks leave to appeal. 
     
      
    3 Each count in the indictment referred to the purchase of shares in a company known as JNA Telecommunications Limited. Each count alleges that the accused: 
     
      
       
        
        “...did commit an offence against section 1311(1)(a) of the  
        Corporations Act 
          
        2001 in that contrary to section 1002G(2) of the  
        Corporations Act 
          
        2001 he did purchase securities...” 
        
       
      
    4 The two sections of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“the Corporations Act”) referred to in the indictment provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “1311(1) A person who:

    (b) the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that:

        (2) The insider must not (whether as principal or agent): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) subscribe for, purchase or sell, or enter into an agreement to subscribe for, purchase or sell, any such securities; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) procure another person to subscribe for, purchase or sell, or to enter into an agreement to subscribe for, purchase or sell, any such securities. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Where trading in the securities referred to in subsection (1) is permitted on the stock market of a securities exchange, the insider must not, directly or indirectly, communicate the information, or cause the information to be communicated, to another person if the insider knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the other person would or would be likely to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) subscribe for, purchase or sell, or enter into an agreement to subscribe for, purchase or sell, any such securities; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) procure a third person to subscribe for, purchase or sell, or to enter into an agreement to subscribe for, purchase or sell, any such securities.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 At the time the alleged offences were committed, that is between May and July 1998, the relevant legislation relating to insider trading was contained in the Corporations Law, being ss1311(1)(a) and 1002G(2) of that Law, enacted by the Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990 which adopted the Corporations Act 1989 (Cth) as a law of the State of New South Wales. Accordingly the charges in the indictment presented by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions were brought under a statute that was passed subsequent to the acts said to give rise to an offence.  
     
      
    6 The validity of the indictment turns on s1400 of the Corporations Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Subject to subsection (4), this section applies in relation to a right or liability (the  
        pre-commencement right or liability 
        ), whether civil or criminal, that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) was acquired, accrued or incurred under a carried over provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) was in existence immediately before the commencement.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        However, this section does not apply to a right or liability under an order made by a court before the commencement. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) On the commencement, the person acquires, accrues or incurs a right or liability (the  
        substituted right or liability 
        ), equivalent to the pre-commencement right or liability, under the corresponding provision of the new corporations legislation (as if that provision applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the pre-commencement right or liability). 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Note: If a time limit applied in relation to the pre-commencement right or liability under the old corporation legislation, that same time limit (calculated from the same starting point) will apply under the new corporations legislation to the substituted right or liability – see subsection 1402(3). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) A procedure, proceeding or remedy in respect of the substituted right or liability may be instituted after the commencement under the new corporations legislation (as if that provision applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the pre-commencement right or liability). 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Note: For pre-commencement proceedings in respect of substituted rights and liabilities, see sections 1383 and 1384. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 Section 1400 is found in Pt 10.1 Div 6 of the Act. Chapter 10 is entitled “Transitional Provisions” and Pt 10.1 is entitled “Transition from the old corporations legislation”. The object of Pt 10.1 is set out in s1370 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “1370(1) Subject to subsection (3), the object of this Part is to provide for a smooth transition from the regime provided for in the old corporations legislation of the States and Territories in this jurisdiction to the regime provided for in the new corporations legislation, so that individuals, bodies corporate and other bodies are, to the greatest extent possible, put in the same position immediately after the commencement as they would have been if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that old corporations legislation had, from time to time when it was in force, been valid Commonwealth legislation applying throughout those States and Territories; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the new corporations legislation (to the extent it contains provisions that correspond to provisions of the old corporations legislation as in force immediately before the commencement) were a continuation of that old corporations legislation as so applying. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Note: The new corporations legislation contains provisions that correspond to most of the provisions of the old corporations legislation. Generally, the only exceptions to this are provisions of the old corporations legislation that related to the fact that the Corporations Law operated separately in each of the States and Territories (rather than as a single national law). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) In resolving any ambiguity as to the meaning of any of the other provisions of this Part, an interpretation that is consistent with the object of this Part is to be preferred to an interpretation that is not consistent with that object.” 
        
       
      
    8 The Corporations Act relies, in part, for its constitutional validity on a reference of power by all States. The relevant enacting legislation in New South Wales is the Corporations (Commonwealth Powers) Act 2001 (the “State Referral Act”). Section 4 of that Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The following matters are referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the matters to which the referred provisions relate, but only to the extent of the making of laws with respect to those matters by including the referred provisions in Acts enacted in the terms or substantially in the terms, of the tabled text (including laws containing provisions that authorise the making of Corporations instruments that affect the operation of the Corporations legislation, otherwise than by express amendment), and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the matters of the formation of corporations, corporate regulation and the regulation of financial products and services, but only to the extent of the making of such laws with respect to those matters by making express amendments of the Corporations legislation (including laws inserting or amending provisions that authorise the making of Corporations instruments that affect the operation of the Corporations legislation, otherwise than by express amendment). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The reference of a matter under subsection (1) has effect only: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if and to the extent that the matter is not included in the legislative powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth (otherwise than by a reference under section 51 (xxxvii) of the  
          Constitution of the Commonwealth 
          ), and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if and to the extent that the matter is included in the legislative powers of the Parliament of the State. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The operation of each paragraph of subsection (1) is not affected by the other paragraph. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the Parliament of the State that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Corporations legislation may be expressly amended, or have its operation otherwise affected, at any time on or after the commencement day by provisions of Commonwealth Acts the operation of which is based on legislative powers that the Parliament of the Commonwealth has apart from the references, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the Corporations legislation may have its operation affected, otherwise than by express amendment, at any time on or after the commencement day by provisions of Corporations instruments, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the references are not made subject to any condition relating to: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the express amendment or affecting of the Corporations legislation by provisions referred to in paragraph (a), or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the affecting of the Corporations legislation by provisions referred to in paragraph (b). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) Despite any other provision of this section, a reference has effect for a period: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) beginning at the beginning of the commencement day, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) ending at the beginning of the day on which it terminates as set out in section 5, but not longer.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 The expression “tabled text” referred to in s4(1)(a) is defined in s3 to include the Bill for what became the Corporations Act which, relevantly, included ss1002G, 1311 and 1400. The expression “referred provisions” is defined in s3 to mean “the tabled text to the extent to which that text deals with matters that are included in the legislative powers of the Parliament of the State”.  
     
      
    10 The Applicant’s submissions focus on s1400(2). A number of propositions were not in contest: 
     
      
       
      (i) The reference to the “commencement” in s1400(2) is a reference to the commencement of the  
      Corporations Act  
      2001 (Cth), i.e. midnight on 14 July 2001. 
       
       
      (ii) As expressly stated in s1400(1), the words “right or liability” in s1400(2) extend to a criminal liability of the character alleged in the indictment. 
       
       
      (iii) A “pre-commencement liability” within s1400(1) arose under s1002G and s1311 of the pre-existing  
      Corporations Law 
       1991. 
       
       
      (iv) The relevant “corresponding provision[s]” of the  
      Corporations Act  
      2001 were also s1002G, as originally enacted, and s1311. 
       
      
    11 The starting point of the appellant’s submissions was that there was some difficulty with the concept of “equivalence” in s1400(2) by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth law could never have one property of the “pre-commencement right or liability”, namely that it was a liability arising under State law. Of course the new law does not have the quality of a State law. That was the point. That does not, however, render in any way ambiguous the word “equivalent” in s 1400(2).  
     
      
    12 The word “equivalent” does not mean “identical”. It does no more than identify the extent of the replacement “right or liability”. A fundamental object of the 2001 Act was to re-enact, as Commonwealth legislation, the scheme that had evolved over decades of Commonwealth–State co-operation, in order to avoid some of the difficulties that had emerged under the Corporations Law. 
     
      
    13 The next step in the Applicant’s submissions was to concentrate on the words “as if” in the phrase “as if that provision applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the pre-commencement right or liability”. It was submitted that the words “as if” are ambiguous in the sense that they could either represent some form of what was called “deeming”, in which case they would not give the Corporations Act a retrospective operation or, alternatively, the Act could have a retrospective effect in the sense that the substituted right or liability arose directly under Commonwealth law.  
     
      
    14 In my opinion the concentration on the words “as if” is misconceived. The primary operative part of s1400(2) is found in the words “acquires, accrues or incurs”. It is that part of s1400(2) which has the effect of, relevantly, imposing a criminal liability upon persons under the “corresponding provision”. When a statute contains words in parentheses it is often the case that those words are used only by way of example or, if intended to have operative effect, to do so by way of qualification or explication of earlier words which have the primary operative effect. The latter is, in my opinion, the case here. In terms of the effect on the operation of s1400(2) the words in parentheses are subordinate to the words “acquires, accrues or incurs”.  
     
      
    15 There is, in my opinion, no ambiguity arising from the words “as if”. The intended application of s1400(2) does not involve any bifurcation of the character upon which the Applicant relied. 
     
      
    16 Section 1400(2) has the effect of creating criminal liability as and from the commencement of the Corporations Act. The offence is created by s1311(1)(a) of the Commonwealth Act by reference to the then s1002G(1) of the same Act. The extent of the offence so created is “equivalent to” the criminal liability previously created under the State Corporations Law.  That a Commonwealth law may validly operate in this manner was established in Regina v Humby; Ex parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR 231. The same approach was applied to State legislation in Re Macks; Ex parte Saint (2000) 204 CLR 158, being legislation to validate decisions of the Federal Court and the Family Court in the exercise of the cross-vesting legislation that was struck down in Re Wakim; Ex party McNally (1999) 198 CLR 511. 
     
      
    17 In Humby a Commonwealth Act validated decisions previously held to have been made without jurisdiction in the form: “The rights, liabilities, obligations and status of all persons are ... declared to be, and always to have been, the same as if ... the purported decree had been made by ... ” a judge with jurisdiction. In Macks Gleeson CJ said of this decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “[15] Central to the reasoning of the Court was the conclusion that the legislation did not purport to validate the invalid decrees but, rather, established, as was within legislative competence, rights, liabilities, obligations and status of persons.”  
        
       
      
    18 The legislative scheme before the Court in Macks was legislation entitled, in each State, the Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act 1999. It contained the same formula, that is that the “rights and liabilities of all persons are, by force of this Act, declared to be, and always to have been the same as if ... each ineffective judgment of ... the Federal Court of Australia ... had been a valid judgment of the Supreme Court”.  
     
      
    19 In this regard Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[25] … The State Jurisdiction Acts operate to confer, impose and affect rights and liabilities of persons. They do that by reference to ineffective judgments of the Federal Court, as defined. They do not purport to affect those judgments. They do not purport to validate ineffective judgments of the Federal Court, or to deem such judgments to be judgments of the relevant State Supreme Court. The hypothesis upon which the judgments are defined as ineffective is that they were made without jurisdiction because the State Act purporting to confer jurisdiction was invalid (s4). The rights and liabilities declared by s6 are the same as if an ineffective judgment had been a valid judgment of a State Court. They are rights and liabilities of a kind which State Parliaments have legislative power to impose.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour finally concluded that the reasons given in Humby applied so that:  
     
      
       
        
        “[31] … [T]he the legal operation of the impugned legislation … does not purport to validate ineffective judgments. It creates rights and liabilities of persons. It does so by reference to such judgments; but it does not affect the judgments.” 
         
        
       
      
    21 To similar effect are the observations of McHugh J: 
     
      
       
        
        “[111] Section 6 of the State Act does not declare that a judgment of the Federal Court is or is not an ‘ineffective judgment’ as defined in s4. The ‘ineffective judgment’ is used as an historical fact only. By reference to that fact, the legislature of South Australia has declared the rights and liabilities of all persons and the consequences in respect of things done or omitted to be done in relation to them.” 
        
       
       
      (See also at [210]-[212] per Gummow J and [354]-[355] per Hayne and Callinan JJ). 
       
      
    22 Section 1400(2) operates in the same way. It creates a criminal liability under Commonwealth law, relevantly s1002G and s1311(1)(a) of the Commonwealth Act, (referred to in s1400(2) as the “substituted right or liability”). It does so by reference to the liability existing under the pre-exiting State law (referred to as the “pre-commencement right or liability” in s1400(1) and (2)). The pre-existing liability is “used as an historical fact only”, to use McHugh J’s formulation in Macks. Section 1400(2) creates a liability for an offence against the law of the Commonwealth, relevantly the offence created by s1311(1)(a). 
     
      
    23 As noted above s1400 was within the “tabled text” referred to in s4 of the State Referral Act. Accordingly the Commonwealth Parliament was expressly given by all States the power to enact, relevantly, s1400 as well as s1002G and s1311. Nevertheless the Applicant contends there is invalidity. 
     
      
    24 A similar issue arose in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland in R v Corbett [2004] 1 Qd R 146. In that case the Court was concerned with s1401 of the Corporations Act which is, relevantly, in identical terms to s1400. Section 1400 is concerned with those provisions of the Corporations Law that were re-enacted as laws of the Commonwealth. Section 1401 is concerned with continuing rights and liabilities under provisions of the Corporations Law which were no longer in force immediately before the commencement of the 2001 Act.  
     
      
    25 In Corbett, Davies JA with whom Williams and Jerrard JJA agreed, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “[24] The referral was, relevantly, in the terms of s 1401. It may be described, generally, as a referral of an existing liability to a State. But the way in which this was done was to deem persons who had incurred a liability to the State under s1064 and s1331 of the Law, on the date of commencement, to incur a liability to the Commonwealth equivalent to and in substitution for the liability which the previously had (s1401(3)); and for that purpose, to deem the Act to include s1064 and s1311 (s1401(2)(a)). 
        
       
       
        
        [25] If that is the correct construction of the referral and of s1401, it can be seen that it does not enable the Commonwealth to prosecute a State offence. What the referral does is to refer to the Commonwealth power to make laws in respect of what were, at the time of referral, existing liabilities for offences against State legislation; and to do so by deeming those liabilities to be liabilities for equivalent offences against Commonwealth legislation. And that is what s1401 does. 
        
       
       
        
        [26] Nor do the referral or s1401 operate upon past conduct by making past conduct unlawful. Rather they operate upon existing liabilities for that conduct. Prosecutions in respect of those liabilities instituted or, subject to the validity and operation of s1383, continued after the date of commencement would be prosecutions in respect of deemed Commonwealth offences.” 
        
       
      
    26 I would not myself use the terminology of “deeming”. I prefer the analysis in Humby and Macks referred to above. That is, however, mere terminology. Davies JA made it quite clear that the offence in issue was an offence under Commonwealth law. 
     
      
    27 Subject to the above observation, the analysis of s1401 by Davies JA is applicable to s1400. I note that special leave to appeal from this judgment was refused on the basis that it had insufficient prospects of success. (See Parker v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, High Court of Australia, 25 June 2003).  
     
      
    28 Notwithstanding the express terms of s1400 and its inclusion in the “tabled text” that was referred, the Applicant submits that the effect of the section is limited by s4(5) of the State Referral Act which, as quoted above, makes provision for a reference to have effect for a period beginning on the commencement date and ending on the day identified in s5, that is a five year period. The Applicant also invoked s4(4) of the State Referral Act, which indicates that the Corporations Act may be amended, or have its operation affected, by legislation or instruments after the commencement date. The Applicant submitted that if the Corporations Act can only have its operation altered after 15 July 2001, it must follow that it cannot have its operation extended to a time prior to that date. This submission should be rejected. 
     
      
    29 What was referred was legislative power, not legislation. As the Respondent submitted, s4(5) identifies the period in which the Commonwealth Parliament may legislate pursuant to the reference. It says nothing about the period for which it may legislate.  
     
      
    30 I can see no implication which prevents s1400(2) operating in accordance with its terms. It serves the object set out in s1370 which, to repeat it in part, is: 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... that individuals are ... put in the same position immediately after the commencement as they would have been if ... the new corporations legislation ... were a continuation of that old corporations legislation”. 
        
       
      
    31 Even if I was of a different view on the above matters, I have no doubt that insider trading in shares of a corporation is within the corporations power in s 51(xx) of the Constitution. Accordingly, ss1002G, 1311 and 1400(2) in their application to the circumstances of the present case, could be supported as a law of the Commonwealth under s51(xx) and the Commonwealth would not need to rely on the referral of power. Section 1400(2) is a section to which I would give an ambulatory operation. However, submissions were not directed to s51(xx) and it is not appropriate to determine the case on this basis. 
     
      
    32 Leave to appeal should be refused.  
     
      
    33 MASON P: I agree. The Applicant’s attempted bifurcation of s1402 into retrospective and non-retrospective parts is an unhelpful gloss on the text as regards the constitutional issues. One is reminded of the remarks of Windeyer J in Regina v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Ex parte Professional Engineers’ Association Australia (1959) 107 CLR 208 at 272:  
     
      
       
        
        “Counsel for the States started with the proposition that disputes are either industrial or not industrial. That is logically incontestable; and, as was said by counsel in  
        Repton v Hodgson 
          
        in a sentence which Jordan CJ brought to light in an essay, ‘Like Sinclair’s well-known division of sleeping into two sorts, namely sleeping with or sleeping without a nightcap, it would seem to exhaust the subject’.” 
        
       
      
    34 SANTOW JA: I agree with Spigelman CJ and Mason P. 
     
      
    35 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that leave to appeal is refused.

     REGINA v FRANK WAQA (No 2) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: On 29 August 2003 in the District Court at Parramatta, his Honour Judge Ellis sentenced the applicant, Frank Waqa, to various terms of imprisonment after he adhered to pleas to guilty previously entered in the Local Court in respect of 12 counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. In addition, 12 similar offences and one of attempted robbery were taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    2 In sentencing the applicant and a co-offender, his Honour said that he was allowing a discount “in the order of 25 per cent” on account of their early pleas and a discount “in the order of 20 per cent” on account of their assistance to the authorities. 
     
      
    3 The sentences imposed on the applicant at first instance amounted to an effective total sentence of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months.  
     
      
    4 Subsequently, the applicant failed to honour his undertaking to give evidence against a co-offender named by him and on an application by the Crown pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court on 26 November 2004 increased his sentence to an effective total 10 years with a total non-parole period of 5 years 6 months: R v Waqa [2004] NSWCCA 405. 
     
      
    5 The applicant has now applied to this Court pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to re-open the proceedings and impose lesser sentences on the ground that the sentences imposed were “contrary to law” in that the Court erred in the manner in which it assumed the discount for assistance had been calculated. Accordingly, the argument goes, the time added to the former sentences was in excess of the time allowed for future assistance and so was in excess of that authorised under s 5DA, and therefore “contrary to law”. As to the scope of the section, see R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. 6 It has been submitted that the calculation by this Court of the discount allowed for assistance was erroneous in that it was assumed that the 20 per cent discount for assistance had been added to the 25 per cent discount for the early pleas making a total discount of 45 per cent off the original notional head sentence and non-parole period whereas it should have been assumed that the 20 per cent for assistance was allowed off the sentence as reduced by the 25 per cent discount for the pleas; that is off 75 per cent of the original notional head sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    7 The difficulty with this submission is that, as I pointed out in my earlier judgment at [37], we do not know how the sentencing judge calculated the discounts, or whether he actually started off with a notional starting point at all. 
     
      
    8 It was submitted that we should assume that the discounts were applied consecutively and not aggregated because this is the only proper method of allowing multiple discounts, and R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195 was referred to. In that case, this Court allowed 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and considered a discount of 50 per cent should have been allowed for assistance to be rendered by the applicant. Hodgson JA said at [30]-[31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In my opinion this 50% should not be simply added to the other 20% to result in an overall discount of 70%. The 50% is meant as a discount to what the sentence would otherwise have been, but for this particular factor. By reason of the 20% utilitarian discount for the plea of guilty, the sentence is only 80% of the starting point, and the 50% discount for assistance results in the halving of this 80%, giving 40%. The total discount is 60%. 
        
       
       
        
        Thus, I would apply a 60% discount to the sentencing judge’s presumed starting point, giving rise to a term of imprisonment of eight years.” 
        
       
       
      Simpson J and Greg James J agreed; and Howie J with whom Simpson and Bell JJ agreed seems to have taken the same view in  
      R v El Hani 
       [2000] NSWCCA 162 at [70]. 
       
      
    9 However, in R v OPA [2004] NSWCCA 464 at [53], Hulme J (with whom Giles JA and Levine J agreed) doubted that applying the discount for assistance to the result after allowing the discount for the plea was the only way that the discounts for these 2 matters can be applied.  
     
      
    10 It cannot be said that one method rather than the other is more advantageous to the offender. If the discounts are allowed successively as in NP, the offender in fact receives a lesser discount for the future assistance and therefore a longer ultimate sentence i.e. discount of 25 per cent for the plea followed by a 20 per cent discount of the remaining 75 per cent for the assistance results in an ultimate sentence of 60 per cent of the original notional sentence, but if the two discounts are aggregated, the offender receives a total discount of 45 per cent and an ultimate sentence of only 55 per cent of the original notional sentence.  
     
      
    11 On the other hand, if the assistance is not forthcoming, the offender is liable to have the sentence increased by 15 per cent of the original notional sentence in the former case, but by 20 per cent in the latter case, although in either case the sentence to be served will amount to 75 per cent of the original notional sentence, provided always that the method used on the application under s 5DA is the same as that used in the original sentencing process.  
     
      
    12 In the light of these authorities, I am not convinced that the only manner in which a number of separate discounts may properly be calculated is on a successive and not on an aggregate basis. What is important is that the judge makes it clear which method he is adopting; and in this case, the learned sentencing judge failed to do so. 13 The important consideration is to make the process of giving credit for pleas of guilty, assistance to the authorities etc, transparent: R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [162]. This is best achieved, in my opinion, by the judge specifying a notional starting point before specifying the discount or discounts allowed, otherwise the offender may get the impression that although a percentage discount has been specified, no such discount has been in fact been allowed: R v Mako [2004] NSWCC 90 at [21], R v Lynn [2004] NSWCCA 222 at [13], R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [16]-[17]. 
     
      
    14 As pointed out in Thomson at [160], it is generally desirable to quantify the effect of the plea and particular encouragement is given to specification of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, although where there are other relevant considerations, such as contrition or assistance to the authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. As highlighted in this case, it will generally be desirable to specify separately the allowance that has been made for future assistance, so that applications by the Crown under s 5DA can be more conveniently and justly dealt with; in many cases this will be better specified in terms of years and/or months rather than in terms of a percentage. 
     
      
    15 Applied to the sentences in this case, the total effective sentences may be compared as follows:

      Final sentence of 7.5 years with non-parole period of 4 years 3 months represents 60 per cent of

      Less 25% for pleas of guilty 9.375 yrs 5.41 yrs 
       
      Less 20% for assistance 7.5 yrs 4.33 yrs 
       
       
      Aggregating Discounts 
       
       
      Final Sentence of 7.5 years with non-parole period of 4 years 3 months represents 55 per cent of  
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
                
                13.63 yrs 7.87 yrs 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      Less 25% for pleas of guilty 10.22 yrs 5.9 yrs 
       
      Less 20% of 13.63 (2.73) and  
       
      7.87 (1.57) for assistance 7.5 yrs 4.4 yrs 
       
      
    16 The method I applied in my earlier judgment was the latter, but on account of the past assistance I reduced the pre- assistance head sentence from 10.22 years to 10 years and the non-parole period from 5.9 years to 5.5 years i.e. 5 years 6 months. If the Successive Discount Method were applied, the pre-assistance sentence would be 9.375 years with a non-parole period of 5.41, i.e. approximately 9 years 4 ½ months with a non-parole period of almost 5 years 5 months from which minor reductions would be appropriate for past assistance. The different final results, although significant, are not great. 
     
      
    17 In his Remarks on Sentence, Judge Ellis did not specify which, if either, method he was adopting in applying the discounts, and I am not prepared to assume that he applied them successively rather than by aggregating them.18 It follows that I am not satisfied that the sentences imposed by this Court on 26 November last were “contrary to law”, so that no occasion has arisen for the application of s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    19 I propose that the application be dismissed and the sentences imposed on 26 November 2004 be confirmed. 
     
      
    20 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Dunford J. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes. 
     
      
    21 Because I was a participant in the decision in R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195, I should say something about the approach to accumulated discounts. It appears the passage extracted from NP in Dunford J’s draft judgment is sometimes taken to be intended to be prescriptive of the one true path to sentencing correctness. To the extent (if any) that NP can properly be so read, I resile. The circumstances attending sentencing and the application of sentencing discounts to which offenders may be entitled are of almost infinite variety, such that it is undesirable to formularise the process. By reason of the provisions of s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, it is highly desirable that any discount allowed in respect of promised future assistance to the authorities be specifically quantified. That is not necessarily so where the assistance has already been given, or where the discount is allowed for a plea of guilty. Many experienced sentencing judges, without error, give a rolled up discount for past assistance and a plea of guilty, and this is expressly authorised in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at [160 (ii)]. 
     
      
    22 An “instinctive synthesis” approach to sentencing has been recognised in the High Court in AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 4; 198 CLR 111; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616; 205 ALR 346; Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584. Too mathematical an approach can invite dissection of the sentence ultimately imposed in a manner that is artificial and may create unwarranted expectations in a sentenced offender. 
     
      
    23 It is true that the approach taken on appeal in NP is mathematically logical but that does not mean that it is the only correct approach. 
     
      
    24 HIDDEN J: I agree with the order proposed by Dunford J and with his Honour's reasons, as I do with the additional observations of Simpson J.

     REGINA v Monika KNORR 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The background circumstances of this appeal can be briefly stated.  
     
      
    2 On 15 May 2002 two police officers came to the Appellant’s residence in response to an emergency call in which she had indicated her intention to kill herself. After attending to her, the Appellant appeared to have settled down and the officers engaged her sister in conversation. During this time the Appellant emerged with a knife and, during the course of attempts by the officers to restrain her, she waved the knife in front of her and the police officers stepped back. 
     
      
    3 The use of the knife was the act which constituted the offence of which she was found guilty. She was acquitted on the second charge, the circumstances of which it is unnecessary to set out. 
     
      
    4 The Appellant was found unfit to be tried pursuant to s11(1) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 on 5 February 2003. On 5 November 2003 the Appellant stood trial at a special hearing pursuant to s19(1) of that Act. On 7 November 2003 the jury found that “on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged”, in accordance with s22(1)(c) of the Act in respect of count one on the indictment, that was “that on 15 May 2002, at Warrawong, she did use an offensive weapon, a knife, with the intent to prevent a member of the police force from investigating any act or circumstance which reasonably called for investigation”. 
     
      
    5 The Appellant relied on one ground of appeal as follows: the trial judge erred by failing to comply with s21(4) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. The Crown accepts that the appeal must be allowed on this ground. 
     
      
    6 Section 21(4) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the commencement of a special hearing, the court must explain to the jury the fact that the accused person is unfit to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, the meaning of unfitness to be tried, the purpose of the special hearing, the verdicts which are available and the legal and practical consequences of those verdicts.” 
         
        
       
      
    7 During her Honour’s opening remarks she explained the nature of the special hearing, what was meant by unfitness to be tried, the purpose of the special hearing and the verdicts which are available in accordance with the section. 
     
      
    8 In relation to “the legal and practical consequences of those verdicts”, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will give you directions as to the legal and practical consequences of the verdicts available to you when I sum up to you at the conclusion of the evidence and counsel’s addresses to you. That is all I propose to say to you at this point in time about the nature of the special hearing.” 
        
       
      
    9 The Crown’s concession in this appeal, is based on the decision of the High Court in Subramaniam v The Queen [2004] HCA 51; (2004) 79 ALJR 116. In a joint judgment, the High Court said, referring to s21(4) at [37]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … Nor did the trial judge attempt to explain what the legal and practical consequences of their verdict would be. All that he said as to these was that the legal and practical consequences were matters for him.” 
        
       
      
    10 In this respect the Court said at [38]: 
     
      
       
        
        “These were all matters that s 21(4) requires to be, not just touched upon, but explained.” 
        
       
      
    11 The Court went on to give a model explanation in accordance with the requirements of the section at [40] and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[41] It is not immediately clear why the jury should be burdened with the sort of detail that the act requires with respect to the legal and practical consequences of their verdict. Perhaps the requirement is intended to give the jury an assurance that guilty person will not escape the consequences of his or her crime by reason of a temporary mental infirmity, or that a mentally unfit person will be humanely treated, even if convicted. Whatever the reasons, the language of s 21(4) is mandatory and must be given effect.” 
        
       
      
    12 The Court also said at [44]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The mandatory requirements of s 21(4) cannot be and were not met by the explanations proffered piecemeal over the course of the hearing or in statements by counsel. … the explanations that the judge must give are essential to the special hearing. A departure from any one of the elements identified in subs (2) to (4) deprives the hearing of its fundamental character. Such a departure itself constitutes a miscarriage of justice for the purpose of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        1912 (NSW) and therefore requires the quashing of any conviction entered after such a departure.” 
        
       
      
    13 The Crown concedes that, in this case, English DCJ, although her Honour made some observations, in substance failed to explain the legal and practical consequences of any verdict reached by the jury in the special hearing. It acknowledged that failure to be a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    14 The High Court said in Subramaniam at [48]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A material departure from any of the elements described in s 21(2) to (4) of the Act is a departure from an essential requirement going to the root of the special hearing. Where such a departure occurs, it is unnecessary to consider further whether the miscarriage of justice that has occurred has affected the verdict of the jury. There is no need to weigh up the evidence and consider whether the jury’s finding was inevitable. The failure to comply with s 21(4) in this appellant’s special hearing is, of itself, a substantial miscarriage of justice with the result that the appeal should be allowed and the verdict quashed.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Court must now exercise a discretion as to whether there should be a new trial pursuant to s8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    16 Her Honour indicated that an appropriate sentence would have been a term of three years. The Appellant has already served half that term.  
     
      
    17 Ms A Francis, who appeared for the Appellant, submitted that the three year term was excessive. It is not necessary to determine whether that is so, it is sufficient to say that, on a new trial, a limiting term less than three years would, in all the circumstances, be within the range of the permissible exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    18 In any event, the nature of the judicial indication of a limiting term does not make provision for a non-parole period. Early release is a matter for the Mental Health Review Tribunal, not the judge. In the circumstances of the present case, if a non-parole period could have been fixed, eighteen months could very well have been that period. 
     
      
    19 As I have said, under the legislative scheme, early release is a matter for the Mental Health Review Tribunal. However, the Court was informed that the Appellant has not been referred to the Tribunal under s24 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. This will lead to further delay. 
     
      
    20 Some anxiety was expressed to the Court about the mental state of the Appellant. I am sure that there are other mechanisms that can be put in train by those who are responsible for her present custody to ensure that no harm befalls her and that such steps as may be appropriate under the mental health legislation are in fact taken. 
     
      
    21 This Court is concerned with whether or not it should order a new trial. In the circumstances I have outlined above, particularly the limiting term identified by her Honour, the fact that she has served half of that term and would, in sentencing terms, but not mental health terms, probably be entitled to release pursuant to a non-parole period, if that could have been set, and in view of the further delay that is implicit in the fact that she has not been referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal at all, in my opinion the Court should exercise its discretion under s8 so as not to order a new trial. 
     
      
    22 The orders I propose are 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (2) Verdict quashed. 
       
      
    23 WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree. 
     
      
    24 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    25 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence which was imposed by his Honour Judge Berman of Senior Counsel in the District Court on 21 November 2003 following his plea of guilty to an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm. An offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed at the same time, was taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    2 The sentence imposed was one involving a head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.  
     
      
    3 A discount of 10 percent was given for the plea, which was entered on the morning that the matter was listed for trial. Special circumstances were found. 
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
      
    4 His Honour found that the offence was committed in circumstances of provocation insofar as it occurred after the two victims had: 
     
      
       
      (i) damaged the security door to the applicant’s home while attempting, in a drunken state, to force entry to those premises;  
       
       
      (ii) had struck his son when he went out to investigate; and  
       
       
      (iii) had then assaulted him after he had pursued them up the street. 
       
      
    5 Having been the subject of these incidents, the applicant and his son armed themselves with baseball bats or pieces of timber, and resumed a pursuit of the two men in a motor vehicle. When they caught up with them, the applicant was seen to strike one man, Rex Tyson, with a full force blow to the head. After Tyson fell to the ground, the applicant continued to strike him and to kick him, as did his son, even though he lay unconscious and defenceless on the ground. When the other man, Brian Concannon, tried to assist Tyson, he too was struck by the applicant and by his son. 
     
      
    6 Mr Tyson suffered serious injuries in the incident comprising a fractured rib, a fractured skull, an intracranial haemorrhage which required surgery, and a lacerated spleen. He has been left with ongoing disabilities, including headaches, a loss of smell and constant ringing in the ear. 
     
      
    7 In support of the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive, it was contended that his Honour erred in his assessment of the gravity of the applicant’s conduct, and also in giving insufficient regard to his subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    8 It is not contended that his Honour erred in relation to the discount for the plea which clearly was a late plea. Nor is it contended that he failed to have regard to the matters to which attention needed to be given in accordance with Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Express reference was made by his Honour to the aggravating circumstances, which were found to include the use of weapons, the commission of the offences in company, the infliction of gratuitous cruelty, and the substantial injuries that were sustained. The mitigating factors found included the presence of provocation, the applicant’s previous good character, his favourable prospects of rehabilitation, his plea and his remorse. 
     
      
    9 It was argued that his Honour overstated the objective seriousness of the offence insofar as he observed that it was “difficult to envisage a more cowardly attack on a fellow human being”, since a more serious attack could readily be envisaged. 
     
      
    10 There are two answers to that proposition. First, his Honour’s observation needs to be understood in the context of the remarks which followed, which make it clear that the observation related to the fact that both the applicant and his son were armed with weapons and continued to use them on a man who was defenceless on the ground. Secondly, as was made clear in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, it is not fruitful to construct or to imagine other factual instances that may be even more reprehensible than that before the Court. 
     
      
    11 While the presence of provocation was an important aspect in assessing the applicant’s objective criminality, and while it provided a motive for what might otherwise have been an incident of unexplained or random violence, it did not excuse his conduct. It is not the case that the victim of a crime can take the law into his own hands and exact physical revenge. Both personal and general deterrence therefore had a role to play in sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    12 The response of the applicant was on any view a gross over-reaction and it involved a considerable degree of violence. I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in assessing the degree of objective criminality involved in this incident. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was however entitled to call in aid a very powerful subjective case. He was aged 44 years at the time of the sentence, he had a clear criminal history for the preceding 20 years, and he had been the sole carer of two sons for 15 years, as well as the carer of the half brother to one of those sons. There was impressive evidence available as to his good character and as to his extensive community contribution. That had included membership of the Board of ATSIC for which he had personally raised funds, participation in the activities of the McColls Glebe Estate Community Centre, support of the Waterloo Waratahs Junior Rugby League Football Club where he coached its youth teams, and membership of the Clovelly Surf Lifesaving Club. 
     
      
    14 Although he had overcome an earlier heroin addiction, he had been on sickness benefits and was suffering from depression and a fragile psychological state during the period leading up to the offence. This was associated with a number of factors, including stress arising from his chronic dysfunctional family background, the serious recidivism and anti-social behaviour of one son, the current coronial inquiry into the death in custody of the half brother of the son who had been his co-offender on this occasion, the recent diagnosis of a terminal illness in his brother and his witnessing of a violent crime only weeks earlier. 
     
      
    15 Doctor Tran provided a report in which he expressed the opinion that the applicant’s offending behaviour on this occasion could be partly attributed to his underlying psychological vulnerability. 
     
      
    16 There is no suggestion that his Honour overlooked any relevant aspect of the applicant’s subjective case, nor could there be in the light of his findings as to the applicant’s social and psychiatric state, his favourable prospects of rehabilitation, his remorse and the additional difficulty which custody would present for him given the background of a recent death in custody of the young man who he had taken into care, and his psychological state. 
     
      
    17 There being therefore no patent error of law, this application depends upon an assessment as to whether the sentence was so far outside a permissible exercise of the sentencing discretion, that some lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. That assessment does need to be made, as the Crown has pointed out, in the light of the seriousness with which this offence is regarded, as is indicated by the maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years see R v Watt NSWCCA 2 April 1997 and R v Wiki NSWCCA 13 September 1993. 
     
      
    18 It also needs to be taken into account in circumstances where a Form 1 offence was available and which was to be considered by his Honour in accordance with the principles established in Attorney General’s application under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 [2002] NSWCCA 518. That offence was itself a serious offence involving a separate assault which was not of a trivial nature.  
     
      
    19 Nevertheless after making full allowance for these factors, and for the degree of violence involved in what was a spur of the moment, and out of character attack, occurring in circumstances of provocation, I consider that the sentence exceeded the legitimate range for an offender with the very compelling subjective circumstances here demonstrated. 
     
      
    20 There is no basis for any concern as to the applicant’s future dangerousness. However the case is one that calls for an extended period of post release supervision in view of his psychological condition and his need for assistance in reintegrating into the community. Similarly to his Honour, I am satisfied as to the existence of special circumstances referable to those considerations, that would justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the term of the sentence and the non-parole period. 
     
      
    21 I would accordingly propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      2. Appeal allowed. 
       
      3. Sentence quashed and in lieu, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 21 November 2003, with a non-parole period of 3 years also to commence on 21 November 2003 and to expire on 20 November 2006 which date would be his earliest parole release eligibility date. 
       
      
    22 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
     
      
    23 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    24 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as indicated by Justice Wood.

     REGINA v John Chatfield JACONA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was convicted on 31 March 2004 after trial, before his Honour Judge Goldring and a jury, of two counts of maliciously injuring property, contrary to s247 of The Crimes Act 1900. The charges arose from the destruction of two sheds left on the Appellant’s property at Thirroul by the State Rail Authority of New South Wales. One shed was owned by that Authority and the other was owned by Wreckair Plant Hire.  
     
      
    2 There was no issue at the trial that the Appellant had done the acts that caused the damage to the sheds by pushing them with a bulldozer over and down sloping ground. It was also accepted that the sheds were on his property unlawfully. The issue left to the jury was whether the Appellant, having found the sheds on his property, was taking reasonable steps to remove them.  
     
      
    3 The Appellant asserted that there was no evidence on the basis of which the jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty of the offences as charged. He submitted that, in particular, there was no evidence which could satisfy the element of malice and that there was evidence that he was exercising a legal right to remove the trespass and that his actions in doing so were not unreasonable. 
     
      
    4 Goldring DCJ had directed the jury that where an owner of property finds something on the property that should not be there, he or she may take reasonable steps to remove it. The State Rail Authority had been in dispute with the Appellant over some damage caused by him in excavating a roadway at the southern embankment of the main South Coast railway line near Stanwell Park Station. That act gave rise to legal proceedings.  
     
      
    5 On 1 May 1986 the Authority wrote to Mr Jacona indicating that it intended to proceed to reinstate the railway embankment and would exercise its statutory right of access across his land to do so. In the course of preparing to carry out these works, the State Rail Authority placed two sheds on the Appellant’s land. It was not authorised to do so. The sheds had been placed on the edge of a slope. As indicated above, it was not in dispute that Mr Jacona used a bulldozer to push the two sheds down the slope. Damage was done to them as they proceeded down that slope.  
     
      
    6 In the letter of 1 May, the State Rail Authority referred to earlier proceedings against Mr Jacona in both the Land and Environment Court and in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court. With respect to the remedial work it proposed to undertake, it indicated that it would sue Mr Jacona for damages to recover the costs of those works. 
     
      
    7 The Appellant gave evidence at his trial. He said that on 15 June 1986 he paid a visit to the property and noticed that the two sheds were situated at a bend at the start of a steep incline. He said that he had come to the property on that day to work at that location with certain earth-moving machinery. He said that he decided to move the sheds out of the path of his work by pushing them with that machinery. However, the machinery was not up to the task. He had another piece of machinery which was more powerful. He commenced to use it for the purpose of the excavation he had come to do. The Appellant gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “In excavating this, the sheds were hit by several large rocks, as was the loader, and in danger of being demolished by the falling trees. I elected then to fully remove the sheds off the property. In doing so, by pushing both together - that’s two sheds together in line east towards Lawrence Hargrave Drive, which is the entry roadway or avenue - they snagged, buckled and veered down the side slope. I then went back to excavating, removing three or four large trees, a quantity of soil and rock for about twenty minutes at the most before rain stopped work for the day.” 
        
       
      
    8 He also gave evidence that he wished to push the sheds all the way off his property. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I wanted them right out of the way. Two reasons: I wanted them out of a workway for concurrent works and, secondly, my natural instinct was to take them off the property anyhow. I felt that they were on my property, it was my responsibility had been transferred from the SRA to myself. When the SRA placed those sheds on my property, I became responsible for them, apparently. There was nobody else seemed to have been responsible for them or is accepting responsibility for them."" 
        
       
      
    9 In the course of his cross-examination, he was challenged about his evidence that he had done work for his own purposes on the road. It was suggested to him that the photographic and other evidence indicated that there was no such work and that all he had done was to interfere with the work that the State Rail Authority had done on its access road and pushed the sheds down the slope. Whether or not the evidence supported his case in this respect was, of course, a matter for the jury.  
     
      
    10 He was also challenged on his credit on the basis that he had informed the police shortly after the incident that: “It was the kids that did it. It wasn’t me.” Goldring DCJ directed the jury on the use of lies.  
     
      
    11 During the course of his cross-examination, the Appellant also accepted that he had said on the previous occasion: “I only did it because the Railways are trying to sue me for the cost of building a road. But,” he said, “that was only one of the reasons.” He also said that “the Railways were trying to sue me for damages” and referred to the letter of 1 May 1986. The following also appeared in the course of the cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What I’m suggesting to you is that you were trying to move the sheds to do work. You were just trying - sorry, annoyed that the State Railway was suing you, and that’s why you did what you did. In other words, damaged the road and pushed the sheds off the embankment? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, but I didn’t damage the road. I did move the sheds for three reasons: one is because they threatened to sue, but hadn’t actually sued me; second reason was I needed to work there; and the third reason was the sheds needed to be moved off the property.” 
        
       
      
    12 He also accepted that, when he had been interviewed by a police officer who had asked him “Why did you wreck the two work sheds?”, he had said, “Seemed like the right thing to do at the time to get back at them for trying to sue me.” When challenged on the fact that he did not say anything to the policeman about needing to move the sheds to conduct any work, the Appellant said that it was not necessary to have done that.  
     
      
    13 In this Court, Mr Jacona, who appeared in person, asserted that there was no evidence that he had acted maliciously or that he was doing anything other than acting under a belief that he had a right to do what he did. He said that the evidence relied on as indicating malice was no more than an intention to move the sheds. He said that he was acting reasonably to bring about that result, as was his right as the owner of the property. 
     
      
    14 The issues that have arisen on this appeal are quintessentially issues for the jury at a criminal trial. There are circumstances in which this Court will intervene with a jury’s findings of fact, but those circumstances are very limited. The issues posed in the trial are the same as the issues posed to this Court. They were issues that it was not up to the judge to resolve, nor is it up to this Court to resolve. They were issues to be resolved, and which were resolved, by the Appellant’s fellow citizens sitting as a jury.  
     
      
    15 The issues clearly put to the jury included whether or not the Appellant was in fact acting as he said he was to conduct some kind of work at the very location where the sheds were located. His own comments immediately after the event, including the reference to “the kids” having done it, and his failure to refer to conducting any such work when interviewed by the police, were matters for the jury to assess as to whether they would accept his version of the facts that he was there to conduct work.  
     
      
    16 Similarly, it was for the jury to decide, on the basis both of the photographic evidence and the Appellant’s own evidence, as to whether or not he was acting maliciously or acting reasonably to bring about the result of removing the sheds. The very fact that he chose a piece of heavy machinery to move the sheds and push them down a slope in circumstances where the act of pushing would have been obviously likely to cause the damage that resulted was something for the jury to assess. 
     
      
    17 Similarly, it was for the jury to give such weight as it wished to the statements made by the Appellant himself that he had additional reasons for acting in the way he did. That is, additional to his own assertion that he had to conduct some work. Both in the police interview and his own evidence in the trial, he acknowledged that he was motivated in part because the Railways were trying to sue him. That motive was a matter which was able to be taken into account by the jury in deciding that he was acting maliciously and, when rejecting his assertion that he was acting reasonably in order to bring about a result that it was his right to bring about, namely, the removal of the sheds. 
     
      
    18 These were matters which were properly before the jury. In my opinion, there was evidence which it was open to the jury to accept that would result in his conviction. In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    19 WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. 
     
      
    20 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    21 SPIGELMAN CJ: That is the order of the Court, Mr Jacona.

     Judgment 
    1 BARR J: The appellant, Anthony O’Donoghue, appeals against a conviction entered in the District Court. He stood trial before a jury on two charges, namely - 
     
      
       
        
        1. On 22 March 2003 at Telopea in the State of New South Wales, he did break and enter a dwelling house at 3/6 Sturt Street and commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely, did assault Robbie Tenkate, occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that corporal violence was used on Robbie Tenkate. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) On 22 March 2003 at Telopea in the State of New South Wales, did assault Denise Grey occasioning to her actual bodily harm.  
        
       
      
    2 The jury found him guilty of both offences and sentence was passed. 
     
      
      THE FACTS 
      
    3 Mrs Denise Grey lived with her adult son in a ground floor unit. She knew the appellant, having met him two years previously. On Sunday 22 March 2003 she and her son were at home. Also staying with her was a friend of Mrs Grey, Mr Tenkate. During the evening the appellant went to the unit and banged loudly on the front door, demanding to be let in. As Mrs Grey moved towards the front door it flew open and the appellant entered accompanied by a large dog. He was angry. Apparently he had been evicted from his premises and asked Mrs Grey questions which implied that he was blaming her. He picked up a scooter and threw it at her. It missed her but hit the wall and the handlebars broke off. Mr Tenkate was asleep in an adjoining room at the time. The commotion woke him and he came into the room where the appellant and Mrs Grey were. When the appellant saw him he picked up the handlebars and ran at him. Mr Tenkate tried to fend off the appellant and get away from him, but the appellant pursued him through the house and hit him with the handlebars, bruising his forehead and his left wrist and cutting his left hand. 4 It is unnecessary to deal with the details of the attack on Mrs Grey.5 The charge of first count was laid under s112 of The Crimes Act which relevantly provides as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        112 Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence 
         
         
        (1) Whosoever: 
         
         
        breaks and enters any dwelling-house, or any building within the curtilage of any dwelling-house and occupied therewith but not being part thereof, or any school-house, shop, warehouse, or counting-house, office, store, garage, pavilion, factory, or workshop, or any building belonging to His Majesty or to any Government department, or to any municipal or other public authority, and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or 
         
         
        being in any dwelling-house, or any such building as aforesaid, or any school-house, shop, warehouse, or counting-house, office, store, garage, pavilion, factory or workshop, or any building belonging to His Majesty or to any Government department, or to any municipal or other public authority, commits any serious indictable offence therein and breaks out of the same, 
         
         
        shall be liable to imprisonment for fourteen years. 
         
         
        (2) Aggravated offence 
         
          
         
        A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
        
       
      
    6 By s105A, “circumstances of aggravation” means circumstances involving any one or more of a number of matters, including that the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person. 7 The Crown undertook to prove that the appellant had broken and entered Mrs Grey’s dwelling-house, that he had committed therein the serious indictable offence of assaulting Mr Tenkate occasioning him actual bodily harm and that he had done so in circumstances of aggravation. Those circumstances, the Crown said, were constituted by his using corporal violence on Mr Tenkate. 8 In summing up, her Honour said this to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        Now ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I will be going to the evidence the Crown relies upon in relation to count one but to bring in a finding of guilt, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in this case that Mr O’Donoghue used a T-bar and injured Mr Tenkate. That is to say, that by the use of the T-bar, striking or hitting by way of the T-bar which would, if you accepted it, be corporal violence and that, as a result of that use, he sustained injury or bruising to his forehead. There was also the contusion to the left wrist and also Mr Tenkate said (and I will go to the medical evidence specifically in due course) that there was an injury sustained to his left hand when it seems he has put his hand up in a defensive action and was struck with the T-bar. That is what you would have to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt in respect of the assault of Robbie Tenkate occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation. Any of the other behaviour would not suffice. Anything, even if you accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the dog bit Mr Tenkate, either in the legs or of course as Mr Donoghue says on the hand, that is not sufficient. That is not the behaviour relied on by the Crown. 
        
       
       
       
      THE APPEAL  
      
    9 There are two grounds of appeal which, because they raise the same question, may be dealt with together. They are -  
     
      
       
        
        (1) The evidence relied upon in the Crown case was not capable of supporting a conviction in respect of an offence contrary to s112(2)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Crown was not entitled to rely upon the same Act as constituting a serious indictable offence and a circumstance of aggravation.  
        
       
      
    10 It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the evidence did not support the conviction on the first count because the Crown relied on the same Act, namely, the striking with the handlebars, in order to prove the two elements of the charge, the commission of a serious indictable offence and the use of corporal violence. It is submitted that because the serious indictable offence involved no more than the occasioning of actual bodily harm, the result was that the appellant had been punished twice for the one act. 11 The attention of the Court was drawn to a passage in the judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1416 at 614 -  
     
      
       
        
        The expression “double jeopardy” is not always used with a single meaning. Sometimes it is used to refer to the pleas in bar of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict; sometimes it is used to encompass what is said to be a wider principle that no one should be “punished again for the same matter”. Further, “double jeopardy” is an expression that is employed in relation to several different stages of the criminal justice process: prosecution, conviction and punishment.  
        
       
       
        
        If there is a single rationale for the rule or rules that are described as the rule against double jeopardy, it is that described by Black J in Green v United States: 
        
       
       
        
        “The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offence, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty. 
        
       
      
    12 It is worth mentioning that their Honours were not concerned with any problem of the kind that is said to arise in this case, but with the sentencing of an accused person for a number of different offences which had common elements. Such a state of affairs would have arisen in the present case if, instead of the second count, the appellant had been convicted of breaking and entering Mrs Grey’s dwelling house and committing therein a serious indictable offence, namely assaulting Mrs Grey and occasioning her actual bodily harm. In that case, it would have been necessary for the sentencing Judge to acknowledge that the one act of breaking and entering the dwelling house had given rise to two offences and to make appropriate allowance in the sentences to be imposed, whether by reducing either of them or by ordering a period of concurrency. Otherwise, the appellant would have been punished twice for the act of breaking and entering the dwelling-house. 13 However, it is important to note that what the justices in Pearce v The Queen did not say was that a single act cannot be a component of more than one offence or that a single act may constitute more than one component of a single offence. 14 It seems to me that more guidance may be obtained from The Queen v De Simoni (1980-1981) 147 CLR 383. The respondent was convicted under the provisions of the Western Australian Criminal code. S391 of that code provided that - 
     
      
       
        
        Any person who steals anything and at or immediately before or immediately after the time of stealing it uses or threatens to use actual violence to any person or property in order to obtain the thing stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to its being stolen is said to be guilty of robbery. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    15 Section 393 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        Any person who commits the crime of robbery is liable to imprisonment with hard labour for fourteen years. If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument or is in company with one or more person or persons or if or at immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery he wounds or uses any other personal violence to any person he is liable to imprisonment with hard labour for life with or without whipping. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    16 Section 1(1) of the code provided that unless the context otherwise indicated - 
     
      
       
        
        The term “circumstance of aggravation” means and includes any circumstance by reason whereof an offender is liable to a greater punishment than that to which he would be liable if the offence were committed without the existence of that circumstance.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    17 S582 provided - 
     
      
       
        
        If any circumstance of aggravation is intended to be relied upon it must be charged in the indictment.  
        
       
      
    18 The indictment upon which the respondent had been convicted had charged him with using actual violence towards his victim but not that he wounded his victim. The sentencing judge was satisfied that the respondent had wounded his victim and sentenced him to a longer term that he otherwise would because of the wounding. The sentence was held bad and set aside by the full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia because the respondent had been sentenced for a wounding with which he had not been charged. 19 In the High Court of Australia it was held by Gibbs CJ, with whom Mason and Murphy JJ agreed, that there was no difference between using actual violence under s391 and using personal violence under s393. So when the element of actual violence required by s391 was satisfied by the use of violence, that element of the simple offence would also be a circumstance of aggravation for the purposes of s393: see his Honour’s judgment at pages 393-394. 20 There is, in my opinion, no significant difference between the facts of De Simoni and those of the present case. In each case, a single act was held sufficient at once to constitute an element of the simple offence and the circumstance which aggravated it exposing the offender to the risk of a higher sentence. 21 A further example will illustrate the rightness of the conviction appealed from. The offence created by s61L Crimes Act is commonly called indecent assault, but that name disguises the true nature of the offence, which is constituted by two elements, namely an assault and a contemporaneous act of indecency. It is well established that the one act of the accused may constitute both the assault and the act of indecency; R v Sorlie (1925) 25SR (NSW) 532, expressly approved in Fitzgerald v Kennard (1995) 38 NSWLR 184 in the judgments of Kirby A-CJ at 186-187, Sheller JA at 191-192 and Cole JA at 202. 22 In my opinion, the appellant’s act of attacking Mr Tenkate with the scooter handlebars and injuring him was sufficient to constitute both a serious indictable offence, namely an assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the circumstance of aggravation, namely the use by the appellant of corporal violence on a person.23 There is another argument, which I think is really a manifestation of the first, that because it has a component which, however described, amounts to corporal violence, the simple offence created by subs (1) cannot be aggravated by the addition of the element of corporal violence created by subs (2). The appellant was punished once for corporal violence under subs (1) and again for corporal violence under subs (2).  
     
      
    24 I think that the submission mistakes the nature of the relevant element in subs (1), which is not assaulting or doing bodily harm or corporal violence. All subs (1) requires is proof of an act which constitutes a serious indictable offence. The reference in the charge to the occasioning of actual bodily harm stated a particular of the element of the offence, not the element itself.  
     
      
    25 The analogy of an assault with an act of indecency is again instructive. All that that offence requires is an assault which has a particular quality, namely that of being an indecent act. All that the aggravated offence of which the appellant was convicted requires is corporal violence which has a particular quality, namely that of constituting a serious indictable offence. 26 In my opinion, the argument should be rejected. I would dismiss the appeal.27 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree.28 WOOD CJ AT CL: I also agree.29 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: Leave is sought to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Howie J. The applicant was convicted of the murder of his three infant children who were, at the time of their deaths, aged seven, five and four years respectively. Upon arraignment the applicant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. Those pleas were not accepted by the Crown. The issue at the following trial was whether the culpability of the applicant was reduced from murder to manslaughter by reason of substantial mental impairment as provided by s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900. As stated, he was found guilty of murder by the jury. There is no challenge to conviction. 
     
      
    2 His Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of twenty three years for the murder of Ryan (aged five) commencing on 21 August 2001; to a fixed term of imprisonment of twenty three years for the murder of Jarrod (aged four) commencing on 21 August 2005; and to imprisonment for twenty five years with a non parole period of twenty years for the murder of Ashley (aged seven) commencing on 21 August 2008. The effect of such sentences was a total term of thirty two years with the earliest date of eligibility for parole being 20 August 2028, by which date the applicant will have been in custody for twenty seven years. 
     
      
    3 Two grounds of appeal were raised: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly excessive, and 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in not finding that there were special circumstances producing a variation in the proportion between non parole period and the head sentence. 
        
       
      
    4 Neither ground attacked findings made by the judge for the purpose of sentence and his remarks provide a convenient and reliable resource for a sketch of facts sufficient for the purposes of dealing with this application. 
     
      
    5 The relationship between the applicant and his wife was troubled and they separated several times. In the course of arguments he threatened that she would never see the children and he made unspecific threats of harming them. By late 1997, the applicant’s wife had moved to a residence in Chippendale. For a time the applicant also resided there but in early 2001 he moved to a flat in Caringbah. Contact visits with the children were liberally arranged as Mrs Fraser encouraged this, believing it to be good for them. On occasions the applicant stayed over at the Chippendale house. 
     
      
    6 In May 2001 she told the applicant she wished to take the children to visit her parents in the Philippines during the school holidays. The applicant refused to sign necessary passport documentation but Mrs Fraser obtained an appropriate court order overcoming his refusal. The applicant’s mother purchased a ticket to enable him to travel also, but he decided that he would not. As Mrs Fraser and the children went to board the aircraft they were stopped and informed that the applicant had obtained a form of restraining order. Immigration officials contacted the applicant who confirmed his refusal to consent and the journey was abandoned. 
     
      
    7 Following this Mrs Fraser instituted proceedings relating to obtaining necessary permission to take the children out of Australia to visit their grandparents and in relation to obtaining formalisation of orders for access to the children by the applicant. Those proceedings were listed for hearing on 27 August 2001. In the interim, Mrs Fraser allowed the applicant to continue to see the children as he had previously done. Of course, the hearing never took place as the children had been murdered by the applicant about a week before the scheduled hearing date. 
     
      
    8 The applicant learned that during July, his wife had commenced seeing a man, who was referred to throughout the trial as “Sam”. The applicant began to question her about whether she was in a sexual relationship with Sam, and if so, what the nature of their activity was. Heated exchanges took place. On the weekend of the killings the applicant visited the house at Chippendale. A lengthy and emotional encounter took place between him and his wife. In the course of it, the applicant made reference to how his wife might feel if she did not have the children. In the event, the applicant left with the children in his wife’s car. She went out for the evening with Sam. She last saw her children alive as they departed in her car with the applicant. 
     
      
    9 There was some telephone contact on the next evening and Mrs Fraser mentioned that Sam had expressed the thought that they should reconcile if there was a chance of their relationship continuing. The applicant responded “Is that because he is son of Sam the serial killer?” His Honour found that the children were probably dead by then and this remark may have been intended to offer an implication that Sam should, in due course, be regarded as responsible for what had happened. 
     
      
    10 Following the weekend, the applicant’s mother who had been disturbed by his apparent state when she had spoken to him on the telephone earlier, arrived at Caringbah but could get no response. A locksmith was obtained to open the house. As a result of what he saw, the police were called. 
     
      
    11 It is a mild description to say that what was found was horrifying. At the entry point was a child’s toy stuffed monkey hanging from a noose, impaled by a knife and decorated with what turned out to be tomato sauce. The applicant later told a psychiatrist that the impaled monkey toy represented his wife.  
     
      
    12 Ryan’s body was on a mattress in the lounge room. The applicant had written on his face “I Luv U Ryan. RIP XO”. He had written on the walls. The graffiti included “I’m waiting, Sam. Come to papa”; “Real fisher man do not feel sorry for the bait”; “We have nothing to beer but beer itself”, and on the door of a cupboard the words of a once popular song “Che sera sera”. 
     
      
    13 In a bedroom Jarrod’s body was found. On his face had been written a message somewhat similar to that inscribed on Ryan. Above the bed upon which his body lay was written “I am not to be toyed with”. It might be noted that the word “toyed” was written over the word “trifled”.  
     
      
    14 Ashley’s body was on a bunk in the second bedroom, on the wall of which was written “There is no place like home”. It is important to note that post mortem examination of this little girl revealed marks consistent with pressure having been applied to her neck and other injuries apparently inflicted at the time of her death.  
     
      
    15 On a computer screen, arranged to appear when the instrument was turned on, was in effect a reiteration of the applicant’s threats about depriving his wife of the children.  
     
      
    16 The applicant was found naked in a bathtub full of water. As police entered, he was in the act of drinking some white substance. His Honour found that the applicant had made a genuine attempt at suicide by ingesting a large quantity of sleeping tablets on a presumption that in the induced sleep he would drown in the bath water. 
     
      
    17 It was undisputed at trial that the applicant had killed the children by administering sleeping tablets in order to subdue them and drowning them in the bath. There may have been as much as twenty four hours delay between killing the infant boys and killing Ashley. 
     
      
    18 This ghastly scene of multiple deaths was set by the applicant with the deliberate intention that his wife would be the first to come upon it and have it permanently imprinted in her memory. 
     
      
    19 After arrest and whilst in custody, the applicant’s behaviour seemed to be disturbed. In a monologue overheard by police he adverted to his hatred of his wife, and significantly, said that the drugs had failed to subdue the children and that they had struggled against his murderous activity. He gave more details about his failure to subdue Ashley whose injuries detected at post mortem, even if, as submitted, they were of a minor kind, were obviously received in a futile attempt at self protection. 
     
      
    20 The applicant had taken elaborate steps to equip himself with the drugs by visiting a number of medical practitioners. His Honour found that the fates of the children were already decided when the applicant took them away from Chippendale.  
     
      
    21 Howie J accepted that the applicant had consumed some substance before the killings to enable him to carry into effect his dreadful acts. His finding that this matters little because he had made his plans to kill the children and ingestion of whatever it was, was simply a step in carrying those plans into effect was plainly open to him. 
     
      
    22 The objective facts which I have related only in a limited way would justify the imposition of the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The sentencing judge so observed and I would endorse his observation. 
     
      
    23 However, it was expressly conceded by the Senior Crown Prosecutor who appeared at first instance that this was not a case where the maximum sentence would be warranted. His Honour considered that the concession was appropriate and acted upon it. It is not sought by the Crown to resile from that concession in this Court nor to argue that his Honour’s acceptance of the concession was in error. 
     
      
    24 The concession was based upon the culpability of the applicant being significantly reduced by reason of his mental state at the time of the killing, which was not disputed to have been highly disturbed and disordered. Although varying in their opinions on the critical issue at trial, the evidence of a number of psychiatrists supported the existence of that situation.  
     
      
    25 A diminution in the extent of culpability for murder, by reason of mental state, is not incompatible with the jury verdict that the mental state, as assessed by them, did not reduce culpability from murder to the lesser crime of manslaughter. 
     
      
    26 Although his Honour approached the assessment of sentence in accordance with this favourable concession, it is nevertheless argued that the sentences ultimately imposed were manifestly excessive. In support of this argument reference was made to a number of cases of what were described as a category of “family multiple killings”. That is not a legal category but a convenient way of describing the collection of cases to which counsel wished to refer.  
     
      
    27 Before turning to make reference to some of these, it is apt to cite some observations of authority which are applicable when the Court is engaged in the task such as the present. 
     
      
    28 In Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610 in a joint judgment McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision”. 
        
       
      
    29 And in Ryan v The Queen 2001 206 CLR 267 Hayne J also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is because sentencing, being discretionary, admits of no single ‘correct’ answer that the task of intermediate appellate courts, on appeal against sentence, is to examine whether the appellant makes good the allegation that the sentencer made an error of principle, not whether they agreed with the sentence imposed”. 
        
       
      
    30 I would add that the fact that I will refer to the assertedly comparable cases does not imply that a determinative conclusion on the ground advanced is to be found simply by identification of comparability. Every case is necessarily different and caution in making such comparisons is essential: see R v Morgan 1997 78 A Crim R 368.  
     
      
    31 The applicant referred to R v Cikos [2001] NSWSC 35. In this case there was in distinction from the case of the applicant a history of abuse of the offender by an adult victim. 
     
      
    32 In R v Cheatham [2001] NSWSC 560 the offender had acted on a delusion that he suffered from AIDS and believed that he would somehow infect his family. 
     
      
    33 In R v Jang [1999] NSWSC 1153 one victim withdrew her sponsorship by which the offender could remain in Australia. The other victim was an adult child of the first victim’s previous marriage. In this case the offender pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    34 A head sentence of twenty five years with a minimum term of nineteen years was imposed in R v Velevski, unreported NSWSC 26 September 1997 for the killing of a wife and children consisting of a daughter aged six and twin daughters aged three months. 
     
      
    35 In R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 142 the offender killed his wife and infant children aged three and two. He had been unfaithful to his wife who learned of his infidelity. A sentence of twenty six years imprisonment with a non parole period of nineteen and half years was undisturbed on a Crown appeal alleging inadequacy. In a dissenting judgment, Mason P expressed favour for a resentence of twenty six years imprisonment with a non parole period of twenty two years. 
     
      
    36 In R v De Gruchy [2000] NSWCCA 51 the offender, a teenager, killed his mother and two siblings. An effective sentence of twenty eight years with a minimum term of twenty one years was imposed and not varied on appeal. 
     
      
    37 In R v Merritt [2002] NSWSC 1159 and [2004] NSWCCA 19 the offender murdered his three children aged six, eleven months and eleven weeks. A life sentence initially imposed was reduced to thirty four years with a non parole period of twenty four years.  
     
      
    38 In R v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23, for the murder of four of her children and the manslaughter of one, an effective sentence of forty years imprisonment with a non parole period of thirty years was reduced by this Court to an effective sentence of thirty years imprisonment with a non parole period of twenty five years.  
     
      
    39 The submission is made that the present case should not be regarded as objectively worse than Jang, Velevski, De Gruchy  or Merritt. It is observed that only the lastmentioned received a sentence comparable to the applicant. 
     
      
    40 In any event, in my view, Jang would be excluded from comparison by reason of his entitlement to reflection of the plea of guilty and De Gruchy would at least be excluded by reason of youth. Merritt also pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    41 More importantly there is one factor which is present in the circumstances for which the applicant must be sentenced, which was absent from all the cases cited, and that is that the applicant’s motive in killing the children was, at least in part, to punish his wife. To that end he took steps to plan the homicides and to fulfil a threat which he had made on multiple occasions prior to carrying it out.  
     
      
    42 I would uphold the Crown submission that, given that anger directed towards his wife played a significant role in determining to kill the children, and that the anger was focussed upon his beliefs as to her relationship and the institution of legal proceedings, there was a heightened need for denunciation and general deterrence. Some remarks of Lander J in R v Hull [1997] SASC 6087 are pertinent: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is a case where aspects of general deterrence are important. Many persons become involved in marital disputes and many of those disputes often become heated and some unfortunately become violent. Too often, sadly, children become pawns in those marital disputes. That is bad enough but those who do become involved in marital disputes must clearly understand that they cannot visit violence upon their children for any reason whatsoever, but in particular for the purpose of upsetting or punishing their spouse. Such action, it should be understood, will attract very severe punishment. The community ought to be able to expect that the courts will be quick to protect the defenceless, particularly children”. 
        
       
      
    43 Hull had killed his ten month old son.  
     
      
    44 Howie J acknowledged the principle that a person suffering from a severe mental disorder may not be an appropriate vehicle for the expression of general deterrence but that does not mean that general deterrence cannot be an element to some extent in assessing sentence for such an offender: R v Letteri, unreported CCA 18 March 1992; R v Scognamiglio 1991 56 A Crim R 81. That recognized, there was no error in his Honour’s finding in this case that the objective facts were so serious that the diminution in culpability by reason of mental state should be reflected largely by refraining from imposing the otherwise appropriate maximum punishment of imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    45 No error by the sentencing judge is pointed to. I have mentioned in brief form some of the assertedly comparable cases. It is not necessary to epitomize every reference. The essay in comparison does not demonstrate the impositions to derive from idiosyncratic assessment. The sentences are not shown to be manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    46 I turn to ground 2. His Honour was expressly aware that as a result of the structure of the sentences imposed, the non parole period would exceed the proportion in the statutory formula. He stated that the non parole period was the absolute minimum that, in his view, the applicant should serve as punishment. I do not doubt that his expression included a consciousness that the non parole period specified on the count for the murder of Ashley commenced after seven years, part of the fixed terms for the other killings, had been served. He specified that the minimum term was effectively twenty seven years.  
     
      
    47 As his Honour’s remarks further reveal, on turning his mind to the question of special circumstances, and the proportion between total sentence and non parole period he concluded that there should be no reduction on that account. 
     
      
    48 Of course, there were circumstances which were capable of being assessed as special circumstances within the meaning of that expression in sentencing legislation, and senior counsel for the applicant has carefully and methodically referred to those which were available. It is, however, received doctrine that the mere fact that a matter is capable of amounting to special circumstances does not mean that a finding and application in favour of an offender must be made. See, for example,  R v Lupton [2003] NSWCCA 200 where, as in the present case, an accumulation of sentences had been ordered and a total non parole period exceeding the proportion in the statute was allowed to stand. The situation was similar in Folbigg in the resentence in this Court.  
     
      
    49 Ground 2 is not made out. 
     
      
    50 I return to the observation that every sentence is the result of the independent exercise of judicial discretion. No error by his Honour has been demonstrated and the impositions are, in my view, within the range of the sound exercise of that discretion. 
     
      
    51 Given the obvious length of incarceration consequent upon the sentences, I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    52 JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the presiding Judge. 
     
      
    53 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    54 GROVE J: The order of the Court therefore is that leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: At trial before Dodd DCJ and a jury at Sydney District Court upon an indictment charging a single count that the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 1st February 1998 and 5th May 1999, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Concourse Oil (NSW) Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in that Concourse Oil (NSW) Pty Limited failed to pay penalty surcharge on marked fuel” 
        
       
       
      the appellant was convicted. 
       
      
    2 The trial extended between 19 and 28 August 2002, the guilty verdict being found by the jury on the lastmentioned date. On 17 December 2002 his Honour sentenced the appellant to two years imprisonment dating from that day and ordered that he be released immediately upon entering a recognizance without security to be of good behaviour for two years, to appear for sentence if called upon during that period, and to notify any change of address during it. That recognizance is now expired and the appellant stands in no further jeopardy in respect of the charge. Mention was made at the hearing about confiscation of the proceeds of crime but no issue concerning such a matter is before this Court. 
     
      
    3 The appellant promptly gave notice of intention to appeal but a notice of appeal specifying grounds was not filed until 17 December 2003, on which date written submissions in support were also filed. It is not necessary to trace interlocutory directions by the registrar but a date for hearing of 21 February 2005 was fixed. In the meantime some further grounds of appeal were filed by the appellant on 20 November 2004. In response to what had been filed, written submissions from the respondent Crown were received on 14 February 2005. 
     
      
    4 However, on 17 February 2005 amended grounds of appeal with amended submissions were received in the registry from the legal representatives of the appellant. A Mr Crowther, solicitor of Southport, Queensland, appeared for the appellant in the appeal.  
     
      
    5 The Crown had received notification of the amended grounds and submissions of 17 February and prepared an outline of response, being content for the hearing of the appeal to proceed and be argued on the basis of the latest amendments.  
     
      
    6 An appreciation of the grounds can be better obtained if a background sketch is given.  
     
      
    7 Crude oil is a naturally occurring mix of chemical compounds. The refining process creates products of different utility and they range in nature from viscous substances, such as bitumen and lubricating oil, to light products such as petroleum gas. Between the extremes are some products which can be put to a variety of uses. In particular, there is a product which can be used as a solvent or for heating purposes or for fuelling diesel engines. Refined oil of this quality can be used interchangeably for any of these purposes. 
     
      
    8 The Commonwealth levies excise duties on the manufacture of oil products. The amount of impost varies in accordance with the use to which the product is to be put. Relevant to this appeal are rates of excise payable on a product suitable for multiple uses and these were, 0 cents per litre when used as a cleaning solvent, 7 cents per litre when used as burner fuel, and 43 cents per litre when used as fuel to power on-road diesel powered vehicles. The precise figures are not germane to any issue in the appeal and rates fluctuated at times but the figures cited give a broad guide to the applicable distinctions.  
     
      
    9 It can thus be readily understood why the Commonwealth, deriving revenue from the collection of excise, would be interested in ensuring that fuel upon which lower (or non existent) excise had been paid, was not used for a purpose which should attract higher rate. 
     
      
    10 To inhibit evasions of appropriate levy, there was legislated the Fuel Prices (Penalties Surcharges) Administration Act 1997. That Act took effect from 1 February 1998 with congruent statutes including the Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Act, the Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Act and the Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Act. The firstnamed statute created offences, imposed record keeping and like obligations and stipulated available punishments for various transgressions. 
     
      
    11 In practical terms, there was created a structure whereby fuel destined for other than on-road use was required to be “marked”. This was done by the introduction of a chemical additive or “tracer” known as mortrace MP. This introduction did not affect performance or characteristics of what became “marked fuel” and it could still be used, for example, either as solvent, heating oil or to drive diesel engines but testing could detect whether marked fuel was being supplied when it was destined for use in a diesel engine.  
     
      
    12 The penalty surcharge was equivalent to double the correct rate of excise payable. If the correct rate was 43 cents per litre, the surcharge rate would be 86 cents per litre. If marked fuel was supplied for on-road use the statutory construct imposed a requirement for payment by the vendor before the marked fuel was sold for on-road use and a requirement was also imposed on the user of the fuel before it was so used. 
     
      
    13 It is obvious that payment of penalty surcharge at any distribution or user point would be uneconomic and the principal legislative aim was deterrence. The foregoing would seem to be uncontroversial.  
     
      
    14 The corporation named in the indictment which I will refer to simply as “Concourse” was incorporated as such in about September 1997, but at all material times the appellant was the sole director, secretary and shareholder thereof. Its registered office was at his home at Kenthurst. There was no issue at trial about the identification of the appellant with Concourse. 
     
      
    15 The Crown case was founded upon Concourse, which possessed only one prime mover and tanker trailer, acquiring marked fuel from businesses known as Chemsol and, reversing the syllables, Solchem. Chemsol’s premises were at Smithfield, Solchem had premises at Chipping Norton. It suffices for present purposes to refer to only one of these businesses which were conducted by Messrs Denys and John Seymour.  
     
      
    16 The nature of Chemsol’s business was that it stocked only marked fuel. Concourse loaded marked fuel into its tanker and either, on the same day or the day following, delivered it to various transport companies for intended use in on-road diesel powered vehicles.  
     
      
    17 On 5 May 1999 Commonwealth officers charged with overseeing compliance with the excise payments requirements, visited the Chemsol premises and observed the Concourse tanker being loaded with fuel. Its capacity was about 36,000 litres if filled. At that time the driver was an employee of Concourse, Mr Hood. After discussion with the officers, he rang the appellant who instructed him to deliver the load to a customer which operated a fleet of diesel powered vehicles. Mr Hood declined to do this and eventually took the loaded tanker to the appellant’s premises at Kenthurst. Later the appellant delivered the fuel to a company associated with the customer to which Mr Hood had been directed to take the load.  
     
      
    18 On 6 May 1999 the appellant himself acquired a load of fuel at Chemsol and delivered it to a different transport company. This company was visited by the Commonwealth officers and thereafter the appellant was telephoned by a company employee in response to which call he attended and removed the fuel from that company’s storage tanks. This activity was, of course, outside of the dates specified in the indictment. No ground of appeal was said to be dependent upon this evidence having been admitted. 
     
      
    19 In the course of investigation a search warrant was executed at the Kenthurst premises. Consequently some customers of Concourse became identified. In ensuing days samples were taken from fuel delivered by Concourse to some of these customers, and samples were sent for testing. Tracer elements were found as a result of each test and the presence of marked fuel thereby established. 
     
      
    20 Over the period of indictment, the Crown case was that Concourse had purchased large quantities of fuel from Chemsol which, as abovementioned, marketed only marked fuel. Concourse had no storage facility other than the mobile tanker, the content of which was on-sold to customers who were mainly transport businesses operating fleets of diesel powered trucks. 
     
      
    21 The offence charged arose out of the conduct described, although it technically alleged failure to pay the penalty surcharge. It was not suggested that such a payment had ever in fact been made, although of course, dishonesty was an issue to be proved.  
     
      
    22 Ground 1 contends that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence, and it will be convenient to deal with it after other specific grounds. 
     
      
    23 Ground 2 contends “The learned trial judge erred in law in failing to allow the evidence of Professor Barry Batts”. 
     
      
    24 After the close of the Crown case, the defence sought to call a Professor Batts of the Department of Chemistry, Macquarie University. A voir dire hearing was held and two reports, exhibiting his intended evidence, were examined. The Crown objected to this evidence. 
     
      
    25 On 23 August 2002 his Honour gave detailed reasons for his ruling that the proposed evidence would be rejected.  
     
      
    26 The Crown case had included evidence from a chemist, Mr Flynn, who tested fuel samples obtained in the course of investigation and he had given evidence of the detection of various quantities of the tracer (mortrace MP) within the samples. 
     
      
    27 Professor Batts did not test any fuel and he did not postulate results different from those advanced by Mr Flynn. What he sought to do was to advance an opinion commencing from a premise that the tracer had a stability life of some two years (a fact to which Mr Flynn had testified), and to develop therefrom a theory that the tested fuel samples may represent contamination by residual tracer from deliveries other than from Concourse. He noted that Mr Flynn’s tests determined differing concentrations of tracer presence. Whilst there was evidence that Concourse had obtained fuel from sources which dealt only in marked fuel, it was entirely speculative that any customer whose fuel was sampled and tested had obtained marked fuel from anywhere else.  
     
      
    28 The opinions of Professor Batts were largely directed to criticisms of the methods of Mr Flynn but were based on assumptions which frequently were not sustained by evidence. For example, he assumed an absence of evidence from Mr Flynn about pre-calibration of instruments but this was a construct of his own which ignored Mr Flynn’s evidence about the laboratory process which included descriptions of calibration. Significantly this aspect of his evidence had not been challenged in cross examination. Professor Batts also premised part of his hypothesis upon an assumption of the use of a particular instrument, of which there was no evidence of use by Mr Flynn.  
     
      
    29 In somewhat discursive reports there was an attack on Mr Flynn’s note keeping quality but this was not linked to any demonstration of unreliability in test results. 
     
      
    30 His Honour ruled that, on analysis, the proposed evidence was directed to Mr Flynn’s credibility and should be excluded in accordance with statutory provision in regard to evidence of that nature. Further, he determined that the evidence was irrelevant. As earlier observed, whilst there was evidence that customers of Concourse obtained fuel from other suppliers, it was speculative to propose that the concentrations of tracer were to be sourced to those unidentified suppliers. Professor Batts ignored the evidence that Concourse was obtaining supplies from businesses which dealt only in marked fuel. The hypothetical situations proffered in the reports were not relevant in the sense of potential to contribute to determination of the issues of trial.  
     
      
    31 For reasons which he expressed, the judge ruled that he would, alternatively, exclude the evidence on the basis that it might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time (judgment transcript page 10). 
     
      
    32 It is apt to observe that the testing of the fuels possessed by Concourse’s customers was evidence called by the Crown to rebut possible assertion by the accused that investigators forfeited the opportunity to test. The Crown may have been held to have been able to anticipate such assertion and therefore bound to call evidence in rebuttal in its case in chief: Killick v The Queen 1981 147 CLR 565; The Queen v Chin 1985 157 CLR 671. 
     
      
    33 Insofar as the appellant’s submissions challenge the correctness of his Honour’s ruling, it was stated that Professor Batt’s material did not attack the credibility of Mr Flynn’s evidence but the adequacy of his testing methods. Such a proposition was not put to Mr Flynn, in any event, the proposition now advanced cannot be reconciled with other aspects of Professor Batt’s opinion where he seeks to use the differentials in concentration of tracer (established by Mr Flynn) to advance his theory about alternative sources. 
     
      
    34 It was put that, if his Honour thought parts of the reports lacked relevance, attacked credibility or might cause undue waste of time, he ought to have severed offending parts and permitted the balance. Identification of what severance of the report should have occurred in this fashion was not undertaken.  
     
      
    35 The appellant has failed to show that his Honour’s ruling was wrong, nor has he shown that insofar as discretion was exercised, that it miscarried.  
     
      
    36 Ground 2 is not made out.  
     
      
    37 Ground 3 alleges “The learned trial judge erred in law by rejecting the application made on behalf of the appellant at trial to inform the jury that the evidence of Denys and John Seymour was tainted in that they had received immunity from prosecution in respect of self-incrimination in other proceedings under Section 128 of the Evidence Act”. 
     
      
    38 An application was made by trial counsel for his Honour to inform the jury that Denys Seymour and John Seymour had given evidence “under the protection of a s 128 certificate”. His Honour declined to do so. (AB 155-160). 
     
      
    39 As mentioned, Denys and John Seymour were the principals of Chemsol. The statutory regime put in place by the legislation required, under pain of possible penalty, certain documentation including the provision of invoices when marked fuel was sold. Each of Messrs Seymour gave evidence. It appeared to his Honour that answers to questions concerning their compliance with the statutory regime may expose them to liability for prosecution. 
     
      
    40 Section 128 of the Evidence Act provides an elaborate procedure in circumstances similar to where, prior to that statute, a witness was cautioned as to entitlement to claim privilege against answering on the ground of possible self incrimination. Under the statutory provision, in short, if a court determines that a witness should answer a question of that quality, a certificate is given which, subject to exception not presently material, prevents that evidence, given under “protection of the certificate,” from being used in proceedings against that witness later. 
     
      
    41 The submission that these witnesses were given immunity from prosecution, by the certificate or otherwise, misunderstands what occurred. Both witnesses remained vulnerable to prosecution. No indemnity was received. Either could be prosecuted but the s 128 certificate did no more than prevent what was said on this occasion from being admissible against them in any such prosecution. 
     
      
    42 Ground 4 asserted “The learned trial judge erred in law in failing to warn the jury of the unreliability of the evidence of Denys Seymour or John Seymour”.  
     
      
    43 The short statement of the flaw in this ground is that, whilst s 165 defines some types of evidence which may be unreliable, warning is required when it is sought by a party: see s 165(2). No such warning was sought. On the contrary, it was specifically not sought. During his charge to the jury, but in their absence during an adjournment, his Honour asked counsel whether she wished a direction under s 165 in relation to the evidence of the Seymours. Counsel asked to consider the matter over the luncheon adjournment after which, before the jury returned, she stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “…… after giving it much more careful consideration I am not going to ask you to give a (section) 165 warning”. (AB 412-413). 
        
       
      
    44 Despite this circumstance, the ground was sought to be pressed. Criminal Appeal Rule 4 applies, nevertheless I shall refer to submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant. Reference was made to the expression in s 165(1)(d) to a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, but a warning of the type postulated is not in relation to that provision aligned with some collateral provision such as, for example, identification evidence, which, although defined in the contingent language of s 165 in subsection (1)(b), nevertheless attracts an overriding obligation on the part of a judge to give a direction, whether or not requested. See s 116. 
     
      
    45 In submissions, the appellant pointed to a number of aspects of the evidence of the Seymours, the greater part referring to the evidence of Denys Seymour. The Crown joined issue with the assertions but it is not necessary to recite the challenges item by item. Merely because it was open to the jury to accept or reject evidence of a witness (including the Seymours) does not give rise to a requirement that the judge warn the jury that the evidence of the witness may be unreliable. No more is demonstrated in the argument in support of this ground than there was scope for submission to the jury inviting them to doubt the evidence of these witnesses.  
     
      
    46 The defect in the appellant’s contentions on this ground can be exemplified from the submission that the evidence of the Seymours concerning the offer of invoices to Concourse’s drivers was contradicted (so it was said) by the witnesses Mr Hood, Mr Monaghan and Mr Butler. Applying the approach advanced by the appellant it would follow that if inviting the jury to consider whether to act upon the evidence of these witnesses, a warning should be given that it may be unreliable because it had been contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses, namely the Seymours.  
     
      
    47 This ground fails.  
     
      
    48 Grounds 5 and 6 were argued together. They contended: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. The summing up of the trial judge was unbalanced. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The summing up of the trial judge misstated the evidence and went beyond the Crown case and as such was procedurally unfair”. 
        
       
      
    49 The first observation that might be made is that it was inevitable that his Honour would spend considerably more time summarizing the Crown case than that of the defence. The factual matrix out of which the offence was alleged to have arisen necessitated reference to a considerable amount of detail. On the other hand, the defence material consisted of some documentation, the appellant having exercised his entitlement to refrain from giving any testimony. No complaint was made about the accuracy of his Honour’s observation to the jury that trial counsel  
     
      
       
        
        “confirmed to you that the only real issue in the trial was the accused’s knowledge and she submitted to you that you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that he was selling marked fuel”. 
        
       
      
    50 The “balance” of the summing up was appropriate to the circumstances. 
     
      
    51 Some specific complaints were raised. In a portion in the summing up his Honour referred to the testing of “any fuel” and this is said to have inaccurately described the overall results achieved by Mr Flynn. The Crown submits that his Honour was referring to all testing including some done, other than by Mr Flynn, at the behest of a Concourse customer, Austral Bricks.  
     
      
    52 Be that as it may, even accepting the appellant’s contention, its sting is more than blunted by the attempt to examine this observation in isolation from the whole case, at the heart of which were the repeated purchases of marked fuel from Chemsol which dealt exclusively in fuel of that category.  
     
      
    53 A second specific matter of complaint referred to the evidence of Mr Monaghan. He testified that he was employed by Mr Macarthur (presumably through Concourse) and drove the prime mover and tanker; confirmed that there was relevantly only one tanker possessed by Concourse; obtained supplies both from Chemsol at Smithfield and Solchem at Chipping Norton, and delivered his loads to “mainly transport companies as directed”. He finished his employment in early 1998. He said that it was by late 1997 common knowledge in the industry that the new excise regime was imminent. 
     
      
    54 He discussed this matter with the appellant. One aspect related to his conveying a pamphlet given to him by an employee of Chemsol to pass to his employer. Other evidence, notably from a Mr Taylor, showed that only one edition of a relevant pamphlet was made and distributed.  
     
      
    55 His Honour referred to the eliciting in cross examination of answers from Mr Monaghan which indicated “that his memory wasn’t all that good and he couldn’t precisely remember having given the pamphlet to Mr Macarthur”.  
     
      
    56 His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says well that merely reflects the honesty of Mr Monaghan in not being dogmatic about it and in being prepared to admit, as most of us would have to, that we can’t remember that kind of thing after such a passage of years in any precise detail”. 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to refer to the evidence which Mr Monaghan gave that he remembered receiving the pamphlet and being asked to pass it on to his employer. 
       
      
    57 The appellant complains that nowhere in the transcript did the Crown make a representation similar to what his Honour said regarding “the honesty and reliability of Mr Monaghan”. His Honour of course did not use the word “reliability” but only “honesty”. The context of his remark would be understood by the jury to be commentary rather than direction, and they had been given the usual cautions concerning their exclusive function in relation to fact finding. 
     
      
    58 The testimony of Mr Monaghan was, of course, but one piece of evidence relied upon by the Crown as pointing to its contention that it was inevitable that the appellant was aware of the regime.  
     
      
    59 In the search of his premises a memorandum was found, and this document appeared to relate to contact with a Mr Fraser who operated coaches in Dubbo. The document was tendered and read: 
     
      
       
        
        “I gave him details and quote him 60 cents a litre delivered. He is most interested but raised the query about tracer in the fuel. I advised that Concourse Oil was getting legal advice about that matter. He didn’t seem too concerned. The price interested him”. (Exhibit C). 
        
       
      
    60 It was also observed that the figure 60 appeared to be struck out and the figure 58 substituted. 
     
      
    61 It is not insignificant that what is now complained of did not seem to attract complaint from those acting in the interests of the appellant, who were able to gauge the atmosphere of trial. 
     
      
    62 Argument proceeded to assert that his Honour used emotive language to the detriment of the appellant’s case. Again those present at the trial would be in an advantaged position to gauge whether this was so and no application was made to his Honour to amend, withdraw, or supplement his charge to the jury. These grounds should be rejected. 
     
      
    63 Ground 7 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if the events of 5 May 1999 are deemed by the Court to constitute the appellant having been informed on that date of the legislative regime and the liability to remit excise and the appellant having disregarded that advice and delivered marked fuel in circumstances where an obligation to remit excise arose, that is not evidence of consistent breaches of the legislation by the appellant in respect of every tanker of fuel purchased by Concourse Oil from Chemsol over an 18 months period and the conviction has produced a miscarriage of justice warranting that the verdict be set aside”. 
        
       
      
    64 The submission in support of this ground included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if the Crown satisfies the required standard of proof that the conversation by the driver Mr Hood to the appellant after the testing of the Concourse Oil tanker on 5 May 1999 constituted notification to the appellant that the fuel in that particular tanker was marked and that he had a legislative obligation to remit excise and that he ignored such rights and delivered fuel in circumstances where excise in relation to that load was payable, that does not constitute conclusive evidence of knowledge over the entire period as the legislative requirements or that every tanker of fuel purchased by Concourse Oil from Chemsol was marked and on sold in circumstances where reliability to remit excise arose”. 
        
       
      
    65 The evidence of Mr Hood has been referred to previously. To recapitulate with some further detail he described his employment interview with the appellant who told him that his job would be to deliver diesel to customers who were mainly transport companies; the appellant took him to the Chemsol premises (where other evidence showed only marked fuel was marketed); on 5 May 1999 (his last day of employment) he was spoken to by revenue officers at Chemsol and told that the fuel was marked fuel and could not be used in combustion engines; he telephoned the appellant and passed this information and was told to take it (to his) home; he did so and whilst there obtained some advice from a solicitor; the appellant then rang him and told him to deliver the load; he refused and took the tanker to the appellant’s premises at Kenthurst and terminated his employment. 
     
      
    66 This evidence, insofar as it was probative of the appellant’s knowledge, was, of course, not proof of retrospective knowledge. The submission of the appellant seems to be founded on a proposition that this was “the only cogent evidence on those points”. This is simply not so. There was other inculpating evidence including, not insignificantly, the testimony of the Seymours and the memorandum found at the appellant’s home concerning Fraser Coaches. I recognize that it was not the Crown case that it had been shown that this memorandum was authored by the appellant, but it was open to the jury to conclude that Concourse was seeking legal advice about tracer in the fuel; to find that the pamphlet given to Mr Monaghan had in fact been passed to the appellant, and that he thereby had communicated to him (if he did not already know) sufficient pertinent information about the regime and it was a matter of almost inexorable logic that if legal advice was being sought, the seeker would be aware of the facts and circumstances in respect of which that advice was being sought.  
     
      
    67 Ground 7 should be rejected. 
     
      
    68 I return to Ground 1. 
     
      
    69 The appellant observes that for conviction to occur the jury had to be satisfied that marked fuel was sold by Concourse. That was indeed fundamental but the submissions in support substantially refer back to the proposed testimony of Professor Batts which offered no more than speculation based upon criticism of the evidence of Mr Flynn’s tests. As previously noted, that evidence was, in any event, of secondary importance to the Crown case.  
     
      
    70 Of primary importance was an exhibit which portrayed a schedule of Chemsol and Concourse invoices, very simple analysis of which would demonstrate the link between fuel obtained from Chemsol and delivered to Concourse’s customers. It was uncontradicted evidence that fuel obtained from Chemsol had to be marked fuel. 
     
      
    71 I have mentioned some of the evidence concerning the appellant’s knowledge in dealing with other grounds. The jury were entitled to accept evidence of the conversation between the appellant and Denys Seymour about the introduction of the marked fuel regime. They could also accept the evidence of a driver, Mr Butler, that the appellant told him not to write “unmarked fuel” on an invoice. From this, inference was available that the appellant must have had an awareness that there existed something other than “unmarked fuel”, the logical alternative being “marked fuel”. There was also evidence of a Mr Dow, from a transport company who queried whether Concourse had delivered marked fuel and the appellant told him that it was “okay”. Further, the evidence of Mr Monaghan and Mr Hood respectively was available to be acted on by the jury.  
     
      
    72 In final address the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the Crown case was quite straightforward. It was. He referred to four “steps”, first, during the period stated in the indictment, Concourse purchased marked fuel from Chemsol; second, Concourse sold that fuel for on-road use in internal combustion engines; third, Concourse did not pay the penalty surcharge applicable to marked fuel put to such use and thereby defrauded the Commonwealth, and fourth, the appellant was knowingly concerned in that fraud. 
     
      
    73 As counsel for the accused said in her address, the only real issue for the jury to decide was the appellant’s “knowledge”. As already observed, there was ample evidence upon which the jury could be so satisfied.  
     
      
    74 Lest the mention should lead to misapprehension, the remark that the appellant chose not to testify is acknowledged but it is important to bear in mind that the absence of evidence from him as to what his knowledge was or was not, is not to be treated as an impediment to the possible success of his appeal: Dyers v The Queen 2002 210 CLR 285. In his charge to the jury his Honour gave cautions according with what was required by Azzopardi v The Queen 2001 205 CLR 50 and no complaint is made in respect of those directions. 
     
      
    75 In the present case, the first three steps articulated by the Crown Prosecutor, whilst not admitted, were not specifically contested and the fourth, which was the focus of contest, was available to be found adversely to the appellant in the content of ample evidence from multiple sources.  
     
      
    76 None of the grounds of appeal is made out. The appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The court is in a position to give judgment in this appeal and I will call on James J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Cameron John Watt has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District court by his Honour Judge Berman on 16 April 2004. 
     
      
    3 On 1 December 2003 the trial of the applicant commenced before Judge Berman and a jury on eleven counts that whilst an employee of Baptist Investment and Finance Limited (“BIF”), a company associated with the Baptist Church, the applicant had used his position as an employee of BIF dishonestly with the intention of gaining an advantage for himself or, in the case of the fifth count, for someone else. These were charges of offences under s 184(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Commonwealth). It was alleged that the applicant had intended to gain an advantage by causing BIF to draw a cheque or by causing an amount to be credited to an account in the general ledger of BIF. 
     
      
    4 On 9 December 2003 the Crown, having presented all of its evidence, closed its case. On the following day 10 December 2003 the applicant commenced giving evidence in the defence case. Towards the end of the applicant’s evidence-in-chief his counsel asked him whether he believed that, in causing certain entries to be made in a ledger account, which were the subject of some of the charges, he had been dishonest. Apparently to the surprise of everyone in court, the applicant answered the question his counsel had asked in the affirmative. 
     
      
    5 After a short adjournment counsel for the applicant informed Judge Berman that the applicant would be changing his plea on some of the counts to a plea of guilty. The applicant was re-arraigned in the presence of the jury and pleaded guilty to counts 2 to 7 inclusive and count 11. The trial continued on the remaining counts in the indictment, counts 1, 8, 9 and 10. At the conclusion of the trial the jury returned verdicts of guilty on those counts. 
     
      
    6 On each of counts 2 to 11 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for two years to commence on 15 April 2004, which was the first day of the sentencing hearing and the day on which the applicant had gone into custody. On count 1 Judge Berman sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment for three years to commence on 15 April 2005, that is one year after the commencement of the other sentences. Accordingly, the effective head sentence was four years. His Honour set a non-parole period of two and a half years commencing on 15 April 2004 and expiring of 14 October 2006. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 184(2) of the Corporations Act is imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    7 In his remarks on sentence his Honour stated the fairly complicated facts of the offences at some length. The following brief summary is derived from the statement of the facts of the offences in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    8 The company BIF carried on the business of receiving payments of money from members of the public on which it paid interest and lending money it had received for purposes associated with the Baptist Church. Money which had been received but had not been lent out was invested. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was originally employed as the assistant general manager of BIF but, because of the illness of the general manager, he became the acting general manager. As his Honour remarked, the applicant was clearly in a position of trust. 
     
      
    10 I will now summarise the conduct of the applicant which grounded the various charges. I will deal with the counts in the indictment in the order in which they were dealt with in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    11 Count 2. On 11 May 2001 the applicant caused a cheque for $2500 made out to cash to be drawn on BIF’s bank account. One signatory to the cheque was the applicant himself. The other signatory signed the cheque, having been requested to do so by the applicant and believing that the cheque was for a legitimate purpose of BIF. The applicant cashed the cheque and used the proceeds to pay for registering his car and for some repairs which had been done to the car. 
     
      
    12 Count 3. On 15 May 2001 the applicant caused a cheque for $10,500 to be drawn on BIF’s account. The cheque was made payable to the Baptist Union. The applicant used the cheque to buy a car from the Baptist Union, the car to be used by him for his own purposes. 
     
      
    13 Count 4. On the same day the applicant caused a cheque for $853.31 to be drawn on BIF’s account. The cheque was made payable to an insurance broker and was used by the applicant to pay for insurance on the car he had just bought from the Baptist Union. 
     
      
    14 Count 5. On 28 May 2001 the applicant caused a cheque for $1800 to be drawn on BIF’s account. This cheque was not used by the applicant for his own purposes. It was donated by the applicant to a church with which the applicant had some association. However, this was not an authorised use of BIF’s funds and the church which received the funds was not a Baptist church. 
     
      
    15 Count 6. The applicant was acquainted with the general superintendent of the Baptist Church, a clergyman named Skinner, who, somewhat incongruously, was promoting a number of investment schemes, including the purchase of shares in a company called Great American Gold. The applicant wanted to buy shares in Great American Gold. On 30 May 2001 the applicant, in order to facilitate the purchase of shares in Great American Gold, caused the sum of $13,500 to be transferred from an account in the ledger of BIF styled “debtors-others” to an account in the name of a family company of the Reverend Mr Skinner. 
     
      
    16 Count 7. The applicant owed another employee of BIF the sum of $320. On 30 May 2001 the applicant paid the debt by causing the sum of $320 to be transferred from the “debtors-others” account to an account in the ledger of BIF in the name of that other employee. 
     
      
    17 Count 1. A result of the applicant committing the offences charged in counts 2 to 7 inclusive was that the “debtors-others” account in the ledger of BIF, which had been debited with the amounts of all the transactions, had a deficiency to the extent of $29,473.41. The applicant gave consideration as to how he could make good the deficiency. 
     
      
    18 One of the schemes being promoted by the Reverend Mr Skinner was investing with an entity called Anglo-Pacifique Inc which held itself out on the Internet as being a funds manager. An individual named Ray Johnson was associated with Anglo-Pacifique. In his remarks on sentence his Honour found that Anglo-Pacifique was a scam but that neither Mr Skinner nor the applicant knew that it was a scam. 
     
      
    19 I will now set out part of his Honour’s remarks dealing with the payment of $4,000,000 of BIF’s money to Anglo-Pacifique. 
     
      
       
        
        “He (the applicant) did not intend to steal the $4,000,000. In fact the offender intended, and I am satisfied he actually believed, that Anglo-Pacifique would pay his employer interest on the $4,000,000 at the rate of seven per cent per annum. That belief was naïve but not dishonest. The dishonesty arises from another aspect of what the offender did. Ray Johnson had told the offender that there was a possibility of further ‘bonus interest’ being paid on the investment. The offender was told that this could be as high as 3.5 per cent per month or, assuming that the interest was only credited at the end of the year and thus not compounded, 42 per cent per annum. The seven per cent interest supposedly going to BIF was, so it was said, guaranteed but there was a possibility of bonus interest of 35 per cent per annum being paid as well. The offender was naïve in believing that BIF would get its money back with interest. But more importantly he was dishonest because he formed the intention that he would keep for himself any interest paid by Anglo-Pacifique above seven per cent per annum.” 
        
       
      
    20 The applicant caused $4,000,000 of BIF’s money to be sent to Anglo-Pacifique by an international money transfer made by BIF’s bank, the Commonwealth Bank. This was the conduct of the applicant on which the first count in the indictment was based. The sum of $4,000,000 was never recovered. 
     
      
    21 In breach of the authority which the Commonwealth Bank had received from its customer BIF, which required any such payments to be authorised by two authorised signatories on BIF’s account, the Commonwealth Bank in making the payment acted on instructions from the applicant alone.  
     
      
    22 After the money was sent Anglo-Pacifique sent emails purporting to show that ordinary interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum and also bonus interest was being credited to BIF. The applicant asked Ray Johnson to remit part of the bonus interest and Anglo-Pacifique remitted the sum of $57,354.12. The applicant’s conduct in applying that sum gave rise to counts 8, 9 and 10. 
     
      
    23 Count 8. On 3 August 2001 the applicant caused the sum of $22,482.50 to be credited to an account in his own name in the ledger of BIF, thereby discharging his indebtedness to BIF on that account. 
     
      
    24 Count 9. On 6 August 2001 the applicant replenished the “debtors-others” account in the ledger of BIF by causing the sum of $29,473 to be credited to that account. 
     
      
    25 Count 10. On 6 August 2001 the applicant caused the sum of $5388.31, being what was left of the payment of $57,354.12 received from Anglo-Pacifique, to be credited to a savings account in the name of the applicant with BIF. 
     
      
    26 The remaining count in the indictment was count 11. The facts giving rise to this count were as follows. 
     
      
    27 On 3 October 2001 the applicant caused a cheque for $33,250 to be drawn on BIF’s account. The cheque was payable to a real estate agent and the amount of the cheque was the balance of a deposit payable by the applicant and his wife on the purchase of a house for themselves. The applicant signed the cheque himself and obtained a second signature to the cheque by presenting it for signature to the new general manager of BIF, while the general manager was speaking to somebody else on the telephone. The general manager assumed the applicant would not be asking him to sign a cheque, unless the cheque was for a legitimate purpose of BIF. 
     
      
    28 In October 2001 the new general manager of BIF was alerted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) to transactions between BIF and Anglo-Pacifique of which ASIC had become aware. The general manager carried out an investigation and the applicant’s offences were quickly discovered. Contracts for the purchase of the house by the applicant and his wife had not yet been exchanged and the cheque in favour of the estate agent was recovered. 
     
      
    29 In his remarks on sentence his Honour discussed the payment of the $4,000,000 to Anglo-Pacifique. Because what his Honour said is relevant to a ground of appeal relied on by the applicant, I will set out what his Honour said in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ultimately BIF did not bear the loss of $4,000,000 sent to Anglo-Pacifique. That loss was borne by the Commonwealth Bank because it had transferred the money overseas after obtaining only one of the required signatures rather than two which should have been the case. I do not regard it as relevant in any way to the ultimate sentences which are to be imposed on the offender that this enormous loss was suffered by a bank rather than the offender’s employer. That the offender breached the trust which his employer placed in him is obvious.” 
        
       
      
    30 Having stated the facts of the individual offences his Honour concluded that the commission of the offences demonstrated significant dishonesty and that the applicant had been motivated by greed. His Honour said that the applicant was to be sentenced on the basis that at the time of committing all the offences he knew he was acting dishonestly. His Honour found that the offences represented a significant breach of trust on the part of the applicant. The applicant had been able to commit the offences because other persons had unquestioningly trusted him. His Honour observed that general deterrence was an important purpose in sentencing for offences such as those committed by the applicant. In the case of the applicant there was also a need for personal deterrence. 
     
      
    31 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted some of the subjective features of the applicant. At the time of sentencing the applicant was twenty-nine years of age. He had grown up in what was described as a close knit, supportive and religious extended family. As a child he had suffered a serious head injury which caused him to occasionally suffer seizures similar to epileptic seizures. At the time of committing the offences he was undertaking a course in accountancy. 
     
      
    32 In his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to whether the applicant had made any restitution for his offences. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There was evidence in the trial that the offender had repaid to BIF some of the money he took from them. He is, however, scarcely likely to be in a position to compensate the Commonwealth Bank for the $4,000,000 they lost. The fact that he has made some repayments is a matter that I will take into account. But I must also recognise that through the offender’s conduct he has caused the Commonwealth Bank to lose a large sum of money. True it is, the offender did not intend anyone to lose $4,000,000 but, as I have said, he certainly accepted that risk when he organised for the money to go to the Caribbean.” 
        
       
      
    33 In parts of his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to whether the applicant had evinced any remorse for his actions. I will return to this subject later in his judgment. 
     
      
    34 His Honour expressed doubts about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If there is an unlikelihood of committing any further similar offences, this is more probably going to be because he will not be in a position to commit them rather than any acceptance by him of the wrongfulness of his conduct. I will take into account that because of these offences the offender will be less likely to be able to work in a similar position again. This is part of the punishment he will undergo as a result of having committed these offences. 
        
       
      
    35 The applicant had no previous criminal history. His Honour commented:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has no criminal history and was of good character until these offences were discovered. That is not something to which excessive weight should be given, however, especially in the light of the fact that such offences as these are invariably committed by people of prior good character, as well as the fact that these offences continued over a significant period of time. This was not a case where there was a single offence immediately regretted. On the contrary, once the offender started to use BIF’s money as his own he continued on with some enthusiasm.” 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour accepted that the applicant had been diagnosed by a psychologist as suffering from borderline clinical depression. His Honour accepted that for a number of reasons imprisonment would be more than usually onerous for the applicant.  
     
      
    37 A number of grounds of appeal were relied upon by the applicant in written or oral submissions I will deal with these grounds in turn. 
     
      
       
      (a) His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective criminality of the applicant in committing the second group of offences, that is the offences charged in grounds 1, 8, 9 and 10 and particularly count 1. 
       
      
    38 It was submitted that the second group of offences had been committed by the applicant, largely in order to try to repay the deficiency resulting from the commission of offences 2 to 7. Counsel contended that the Crown had not alleged that the decision by the applicant to invest $4,000,000 with Anglo-Pacifique had been dishonest. It was submitted that in assessing the applicant’s criminality the trial Judge had wrongly taken into account that by his conduct the applicant had caused the Commonwealth Bank to lose the large sum of $4,000,000. Counsel submitted that taking the loss suffered by the Commonwealth Bank into account was inconsistent with his Honour’s finding in his remarks on sentence that the applicant had not intended anyone to lose $4,000,000 and what was submitted to be his Honour’s view stated at p 11 of his remarks on sentence, that it was not relevant to the sentence to be imposed on the applicant that the Bank had suffered the loss of $4,000,000. 
     
      
    39 In support of this ground of appeal counsel for the applicant set out in written submissions parts of his Honour’s remarks on sentence, which I have already quoted earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    40 I do not consider that any of these submissions should be accepted. It is true that in his remarks on sentence the sentencing Judge, after stating the facts of the offences charged in counts 2 to 7 and after noting the resulting deficiency in the debtors-others account in the ledger of BIF, posed as a question which the applicant had had to attempt to answer “How was he (that is the applicant) going to repay that money?” 
     
      
    41 However, his Honour did not make a finding that the second group of offences had been committed only, or even largely, in order to try and repay the deficiency resulting from the commission of offences 2 to 7. The very magnitude of the amount of money sent to Anglo-Pacifique and the rate of bonus interest indicated by Ray Johnson would suggest that the applicant was hoping to obtain for himself from the investment a much greater amount of money than would be required simply to make good the amount of the deficiency. We were referred by counsel for the Crown to a number of parts of the evidence which would support a conclusion that the primary reason for the applicant sending $4,000,000 to Anglo-Pacifique was to obtain for himself a large sum in bonus interest to be used by him as he pleased. 
     
      
    42 It is not the case that the Crown did not allege at the trial that the decision by the applicant to invest $4,000,000 with Anglo-Pacifique had been dishonest. The very charge in the first count in the indictment was that the applicant had used his position as an employee of BIF dishonestly and with the intention of gaining an advantage for himself by causing BIF to pay the sum of $4,000,000 to Anglo-Pacifique. 
     
      
    43 In his remarks on sentence his Honour found that the applicant had acted dishonestly in sending the $4,000,000 to Anglo-Pacifique, because, even though he did not intend to steal the money, he intended to keep for himself any interest paid by Anglo-Pacifique over and above interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum. 
     
      
    44 On page 11 of his remarks on sentence his Honour did not say that it was not relevant to the sentencing of the applicant that the Bank had suffered a loss of $4,000,000. What his Honour said at page 11 was that it was not relevant to the sentencing of the applicant that the loss which had occurred had been suffered by the Bank and not by BIF, the applicant’s employer. 
     
      
    45 I consider this was a remark which his Honour could properly make. It was quite fortuitous and in no way thanks to the applicant that the applicant’s employer had succeeded in diverting to the Bank the loss that it would otherwise have suffered. As his Honour said in his remarks on sentence it was at least partly due to the applicant’s position in BIF and his abuse of the trust engendered by that position that the Commonwealth Bank had unquestioningly complied with the applicant’s instruction, unsupported by any other signatory on BIF’s account, to send the $4,000,000 to Anglo-Pacifique. 
     
      
    46 The fact the applicant had sent as large an amount of his employer’s money as $4,000,000 was clearly relevant to the objective criminality of the offence charged in count 1. That the investment was, to the applicant’s knowledge, a risky investment was also clearly relevant to the applicant’s objective criminality, as showing the extent to which the applicant dishonestly preferred his own interests to those of his employer, being prepared to incur the risk of his employer losing $4,000,000 in order to obtain a significant financial reward for himself. 
     
      
    47 I do not consider that his Honour was obliged to disregard that the risk of loss which the applicant had foreseen and had been prepared to incur had actually eventuated. His Honour could take into account the loss which actually eventuated, notwithstanding that it had been suffered by a third party and not by the applicant’s employer (see R v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353, especially at pars 42, 45 and 93. 
     
      
    48 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (b) His Honour gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s pleas of guilty. 
       
      
    49 It was not submitted that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s pleas of guilty for any utilitarian value they might have had. As his Honour noted in his remarks on sentence, the pleas of guilty to counts 2 to 7 and 11 had been entered during the trial and at a late stage of the trial after the Crown had presented all its evidence and closed its case and the trial on the remaining counts then continued until the jury returned its verdicts. His Honour was entitled to conclude, as he did, that such minor benefits as enured to the criminal justice system from the applicant’s pleas of guilty did not need to be reflected in a corresponding minor discount in sentencing.  
     
      
    50 What was submitted by counsel for the applicant was that insufficient weight was given to the applicant’s pleas of guilty as evidencing contrition; that his Honour, after initially accepting that the applicant’s pleas of guilty demonstrated remorse or contrition, had subsequently retreated from that position. 
     
      
    51 I do not consider that these submissions should be accepted. The applicant did not plead guilty to four of the counts, including the count charging the most serious offence, count 1. There was no inconsistency in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. At p 2 of the remarks his Honour merely said the applicant’s pleas of guilty might be relevant as “perhaps demonstrating the offender’s remorse” and said that he would return to the question of whether the applicant was remorseful later in his remarks. At p 17 of his remarks his Honour said that, although the applicant had expressed remorse, it appeared to his Honour that “this remorse is more focussed on the effect his offences have had had on his family and friends rather than the fact that he has committed a number of serious criminal offences”. This was a finding which was open to his Honour and could not be successfully challenged on this application. 
     
      
       
      (c) His Honour failed to adequately consider the reparation paid by the applicant. 
       
      
    52 It was submitted that the applicant had compensated BIF for its loss and that the loss to the Commonwealth Bank had occurred because of the Bank’s own default and not because of any criminality or further criminality on the part of the applicant. 
     
      
    53 In his Honour’s remarks on sentence, in a passage which I have quoted earlier in this judgment, his Honour expressly stated that he took into account in favour of the applicant that the applicant had repaid to BIF some of the money that he had taken. 
     
      
    54 His Honour did say in his remarks on sentence that he took into account, adversely to the applicant, that through his conduct the applicant had caused the Commonwealth Bank to lose $4,000,000 for which it was unlikely the Bank would be compensated. It is also true that the immediate cause of the Bank’s loss was not any wrongdoing by the applicant but the Bank’s act in transferring its customer’s funds without having proper authority to do so. 
     
      
    55 However, as I have earlier indicated, the point being made by his Honour was that the applicant had been prepared to run the risk of his employer losing $4,000,000 and a loss of $4,000,000 had occurred and it was not relevant that the loss that had actually occurred had, fortuitously, fallen not on the employer but on someone else. 
     
      
    56 I would reject this ground. 
     
      
       
      (d) His Honour failed to adequately take into account subjective findings favourable to the applicant. 
       
      
    57 It was submitted that his Honour gave insufficient weight to such matters as the applicant’s previous good character, his work history, his family support, that the sentence his Honour was imposing would be the applicant’s first experience of imprisonment, that because of the applicant’s health imprisonment would be more than usually onerous, that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and the hardship the applicant’s family would suffer from his imprisonment. 
     
      
    58 As I have indicated earlier in this judgment, most of these matters were expressly referred to by his Honour in his remarks on sentence and I am satisfied that none of them were overlooked by his Honour. As previously noted, his Honour expressly referred to the applicant’s previous good character. His Honour’s view that because of the nature of the offences not a great deal of weight could be given to the applicant’s previous good character was not erroneous (see R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284). His Honour was aware that the applicant had never previously been sentenced to imprisonment. His Honour found, for reasons which he stated, that imprisonment would be more than usually onerous for the applicant. His Honour’s findings about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were open to his Honour. 
     
      
    59 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    60 Having rejected all the grounds of appeal, I would propose that, although leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal itself should be dismissed.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 His Honour: The offender, Radwan Hamze, was committed for trial to this Court on a charge of hindering the discovery of evidence concerning a serious indictable offence. This is an offence contrary to s 315 of the Crimes Act for which a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years is prescribed. On 1 October 2004 he was arraigned before Barr J on an indictment containing two counts, the first being for the committal offence and the second being for an offence of being in possession of a prohibited firearm. The second offence was one contrary to s 7 of the Firearms Act for which the maximum penalty where the offence is dealt with on indictment is imprisonment for 14 years. The offender pleaded guilty to both offences. 
     
      
    2 It is necessary to say something shortly about the history of the matter. The offender was originally charged by police with affray arising from an incident on 10 June 2002 during which shots were fired killing one man and wounding another. Later he was charged with murder and being an accessory after the fact arising from an incident on 10 June 2002 during which shots were fired killing one man and wounding another arising from the same incident. At the conclusion of committal proceedings the magistrate discharged the offender on these charges but committed him for trial on the offence of hindering police. That committal charge arose from a concession made by Mr Button to both the prosecutor and the Magistrate that the offender was guilty of that offence but not guilty of the offences for which he had originally been charged. In fact an offer was made to the effect that the offender would plead guilty before the Magistrate to the hinder charge, if the other charges were withdrawn. However, the prosecutor refused the offer. Shortly after the offender was committed for trial on the hinder charge he indicated his willingness to plead guilty to that offence and he did so on his first arraignment in this Court. 
     
      
    3 There is also before me a Form 1 document in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act that contains three offences under the Firearms Act. I am asked to take those matters into account in sentencing for the second count on the indictment. 
     
      
    4 I have been asked to sentence the offender on the basis of an agreed statement of facts. Little other evidentiary material was placed before me but the agreed facts are sufficient to determine the appropriate sentence that the offender should serve for both offences to which he has pleaded guilty. It is unnecessary to set out the facts in full and they can be sufficiently summarised as follows. On 9 June 2002 a disagreement arose between a bouncer employed at a nightclub and some patrons. As a result one of the patrons was punched to the face by the bouncer and suffered a broken jaw. The bouncer happened to be the brother-in-law of the offender. 
     
      
    5 As a consequence of this incident a degree of bad feeling arose between certain members of the Lebanese community in the Greenacre area. In particular it resulted in considerable friction between persons who worked at two businesses operating in the area: one “Automobile Wreckers” was owned by the offender’s sister and the other “Just Vans” was owned by the person who was struck by the bouncer. 
     
      
    6 The escalating friction between these two groups came to a head in the afternoon of 11 June 2002 when there was a public confrontation between persons who had affiliations with one or other of the two groups. This involved persons yelling abuse and trading insults. There were also minor scuffles between the participants. The offender was present at the scene of this confrontation because of his allegiance to the employees of Automobile Wreckers. 
     
      
    7 At some stage in this hostile environment shots were fired wounding two men, one fatally. The offender was present at the time of the shooting. The deceased was considered to be the head of the family that was associated with the Just Vans business. After the shooting a number of unidentified persons present attacked the deceased while he lay mortally wounded on the ground. 
     
      
    8 Some of the participants, including the offender fled from the scene. As he did so, the offender bent down, picked up a pistol from the ground and placed it down the front of his trousers. He then entered the driver’s seat of a motor vehicle and drove away from the area. 
     
      
    9 Police later attended the scene of the incident and recovered 5 spent .38 cartridges and four unspent .44 cartridges. One of the .44 cartridges bore a firing pin strike mark. No firearms were located. 
     
      
    10 At 5 pm that evening police executed a search warrant on the premises where the applicant was residing. They located three firearms: a .22 self-loading rifle with an attached magazine containing a number of rounds; a 44.4 calibre lever action rifle without ammunition; and a 12 gauge pump-action shotgun without ammunition. Several boxes of .22 ammunition were found in a bag on top of a cupboard. Two of the rifles were discovered in unlocked cupboards and one was located leaning up against a buffet in the spare bedroom. The pump action rifle is the subject of the second count in the indictment. The other two weapons and the ammunition give rise to two of the three matters on the form 1. The third offence on that document refers to the pistol that is the subject of the hinder police charge. 
     
      
    11 The offender was arrested following the search and declined to make a statement to police. He was charged with affray and refused bail. He remained in custody until 2 July 2002 when he was released to bail. 
     
      
    12 On 16 December 2002, about six months after the shooting incident, the offender recovered the .44 pistol from where he had placed it shortly after he had taken it into his possession. The weapon was conveyed to the police through the agency of the offender’s solicitor. Shortly thereafter the offender participated in an interview with police in which he admitted taking the weapon from the scene. He said that he found it in an open condition and empty of any rounds. He admitted disposing of the weapon in bushland. 
     
      
    13 A ballistics examination of the weapon and the .44 rounds located at the scene of the shooting revealed that the weapon had been used to make the pin strike mark located on one of the unfired rounds. There is no evidence that the weapon was used to fire any rounds during the incident in Greenacre. It was not the weapon used to shoot the deceased. 
     
      
    14 The police investigation of the shooting incident was hampered by the reluctance of witnesses to assist. Clearly the weapon located by the offender and removed from the scene was an important piece of evidence in determining what had happened and might have provided evidence as to the identity of the person who took it to the scene. Its removal hindered the police investigation and it was taken with that purpose in mind. 
     
      
    15 In relation to the weapons found in his premises the offender told police in January 2003 that the firearms belonged to a friend who had gone overseas. The offender said he was given the weapons because he liked to go hunting. 
     
      
    16 The offender is aged 28 years with no prior criminal record. The relevant background material is contained in a pre-sentence report. He was born in Lebanon where his parents were farmers. He is the eldest of three sons in a family of eight children. He came to Australia in 1997 leaving his mother and some of his family in Lebanon. He has two siblings in Australia. He has been married twice and he has two children from his present marriage. They are aged three years and 15 months. The offender and his family live in a rented flat and he works as a mechanic in a garage. There are two letters before the court testifying to his general good character and his value as an employee in his present position. 
     
      
    17 Mr Button conceded that the offences before the Court are sufficiently serious to warrant a custodial sentence notwithstanding the offender’s prior good character. The submission was, however, that the Court could deal appropriately with the offender by ordering that any sentence be served by way of periodic detention. The Crown argued that the appropriate sentence was one of full-time custody. After hearing submissions I adjourned the matter and continued the offender’s bail but made it clear to him that he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment and the only question was what that term should be and whether, if it were less than three years, I could make the order sought by his counsel. 
     
      
    18 Although the pleas of guilty were not made until arraignment in this Court, they should be treated as having been made at the first reasonable opportunity. I do not believe that the Crown submitted otherwise. It was not realistic for the offender to plead guilty to the hinder police offence before his counsel made the offer during committal proceedings. The offer was not accepted but yet the offender was discharged from the more serious offences he faced. He was never really given the opportunity to plead guilty to the hinder charge before the magistrate but a plea to that offence was organised as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. The firearms offences were clearly always going to await the determination of the murder charge. The discount should be 25 per cent for both offences. 
     
      
    19 Mr Button submitted that I should take into account that both offences for which the offender is to be sentenced could have been disposed of in the Local Court. Technically that is so, but I do not believe that it would have been appropriate for the hinder police matter to be dealt with summarily. In my view the objective seriousness is too great. The Crown Prosecutor confirmed that the Crown would never have agreed to it being dealt with by a magistrate. 
     
      
    20 I am willing to assume that the firearm’s offences standing alone may have been appropriately dealt with in the Local Court although I am not altogether convinced that this is so. They were serious offences because of the nature of the weapons, because there was ammunition found in the offender’s possession that fitted one of the weapons and because they were found in unsecured places in a suburban dwelling. It is not a matter of mitigation that there is no evidence that the offender was going to use them for any unlawful purpose. The policy behind firearms offences is to control the use of weapons in the community generally and not simply to disarm the criminally minded. The Court of Criminal Appeal has emphasised the seriousness with which these types of offences must be treated: R v Cromarty (2004) 144 A Crim R 515. 
     
      
    21 However, there is little doubt that the first offence on the indictment is the more serious notwithstanding that the matters on the Form 1 are to be taken into account on the second offence on the indictment. The offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he knew he was removing evidence from the place where a serious criminal offence had taken place and he did so intending to make it more difficult for police to investigate the shooting and apprehend the person or persons responsible. He knew that a shooting had occurred, that persons had been injured and that he was removing a firearm. I do not sentence him on the basis that he knew or believed that the weapon had been discharged. But clearly he knew that the weapon was evidence capable of identifying some person as being present with a firearm and this is why he took the weapon. 
     
      
    22 The Pre-sentence report contains an account of the offender’s involvement in the incident and the taking of the weapon. I am not prepared to accept that account in the absence of evidence from the offender. In particular, I am not prepared to find as a fact that the offender was present at the place where the shooting occurred because he intended to intervene in an attempt to stop the confrontation becoming violent. Nor do I accept the account that he picked up the weapon because he panicked. 
     
      
    23 The following statement is found in that part of the report headed “Summary and Sentencing options”. 
     
      
       
        
         
        His confusion and anxiety at the scene of the crime appear to [have] over-ruled his commonsense  
        but in the final analysis, his action may have preserved for the police evidence which otherwise could have been destroyed 
        . 
        
       
       
      With respect I do not believe that there is the slightest basis for the comment that I have underlined and it is no function of an officer of the Probation and Parole Service to make such a gratuitous remark calculated to reflect upon the assessment of the criminality of the offender. 
       
      
    24 I accept that the offence was not planned in that it was not his assigned role to hinder police by disposing of evidence and that the offence was unpremeditated. But notwithstanding those findings, the offence was still a serious one of its kind when measured against the type of conduct that falls within the scope of the offence. I note, however, that so far as the maximum penalty for the offence reflects Parliament’s assessment of the seriousness of the conduct giving rise to the offence, a maximum penalty of seven years is a relatively modest one. 
     
      
    25 Mr Button asked me to take into account that the offender has served a period in custody arising from his involvement in the incident on the 11 June 2002. Although he was not in custody in respect of the offence for which he was being sentenced, that is a matter of chance. Had he been charged with the offence initially he would have been remanded in custody on all charges and I would have been required to take that period into account: s 24 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It was because the police suspected him of a more serious involvement in the incident that he was in custody at all. I accept that as a matter of general principle a court cannot take into account a period in custody unrelated to the offence for which sentence is being passed: R v Nias (NSWCCA, unreported, 16 November 1988) and R v Webster and Jones (NSWCCA, unreported, 3 August 1992). But that general principle cannot apply to the present situation where the period in custody is referable to an allegation of criminal conduct arising from the very same incident that gives rise to the offence for which the offender is being sentenced. 
     
      
    26 I am also asked to take into account the anxiety and uncertainty that would have been felt by the offender over the period during which the offender was facing a murder charge arising from the incident on 11 July. I accept that I should take into account that there has been an extended period of uncertainty leading up to the pronouncement of sentence arising from the fact that the offender was charged with offences more serious than those for which he finally pleaded guilty. However, I have considerable difficulty with the submission that I should give extra weight to this matter because the uncertainty for most of that period related to the fact that he was facing a charge of murder rather than some less serious offence. 
     
      
    27 With respect, this submission seems to me to call for too much exactitude in undertaking the synthesis that results in the formulation of an appropriate sentence. It seems to require that the process be akin to determining the amount of damages to be awarded in a personal injury claim. I do not believe that a sentencing court can realistically undertake, or should attempt to undertake, such a fine calculation, as an acceptance of this submission would require. But I do take into account the fact that the applicant’s life and that of his family has necessarily been disrupted by the anxiety attending the resolution of the charges arising from his criminal conduct on 11 June 2002 and that this period may have been shortened considerably had the accused been charged and dealt with shortly after December 2002 when he produced the weapon and admitted his criminal conduct in removing it from the scene. 
     
      
    28 There does not appear to me to be any of the aggravating factors listed in s 21A(2) present. I have already indicated a number of mitigating factors listed in s 21A(3) and I add that he also can have taken into account that he appears remorseful, he is unlikely to re-offend, subject to his ability to avoid similar internecine strife in the future. He also appears to be rehabilitated. The probation officer was of the opinion that there were no issues that could be addressed by the Service. 
     
      
    29 I have been handed statistical information as to the sentences imposed for the offences for which the offender is before the Court. These statistics relate both to sentences imposed in the District and Supreme Court and those imposed in the Local Court. I have already indicated that I do not believe that the hinder charge was one appropriate for disposal in the Local Court. The statistics for that offence are not such that one could draw any range that might be helpful in deciding the sentence to impose upon the offender when regard is had to the statistics of the higher courts. The statistics for the firearms offences indicate that only half the persons dealt with for such an offence received a gaol sentence and of those who did the majority received sentences between 12 months and three years. Of 711 cases dealt with in the Local Court only 49 received gaol sentences and of them the overwhelming majority received sentence between 6 months and 12months. I am prepared to act on the basis that the offender would have been sentenced for the firearms offences in the Local Court had there been no other offences charged against him. 
     
      
    30 I am of the opinion that no sentence other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate for the purposes of punishing either offence. 
     
      
    31 The appropriate sentence for the firearms offence and taking into account the matters on the form one after discount for the plea of guilty and taking into account the period spent in custody is imprisonment for 6 months. The appropriate sentence for the hinder police offence after discount is 27 months. The sentences should be cumulative. This gives a total sentence of 2 years 9 months to be served. 
     
      
    32 There are no special circumstances despite the fact that the offender has no prior convictions and is still a relatively young man. There is no present need for supervision and I doubt that he will require supervision when released from custody. There is nothing that I can see in the material that warrants me decreasing the otherwise appropriate non-parole period or increasing the period on parole from that which would result in an application of the usual proportion between the head sentence and non-parole period. He is in effect rehabilitated and if the period he spent in custody and the anxiety and stress related to his involvement in the criminal justice system has not deterred him from future criminal conduct arising from family loyalties then nothing will. However I do take into account that the two sentences are to be served cumulatively and I have adjusted the non-parole period in order to reflect that fact. 
     
      
    33 The question then arises whether I should order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. I accept that he is contrite and remorseful for what he did. I also accept that the offence was a spur of the moment one and he was moved by loyalty to the group with whom he had family ties. There has been a lengthy period between the commission of the offence and sentencing through no fault of the offender and during which he has served a short period in custody and then resumed his life without further incident. A child has been born to the marriage during that period. He did eventually retrieve the weapon and to the degree that he was able attempted to undo the harm he did by taking the weapon from the scene. General deterrence is a very significant matter in sentencing the offender but the fact that a person of no prior convictions and of otherwise good standing in the community is to serve a sentence of imprisonment is sufficient in the circumstances of this case to reflect that matter without requiring that the offender be returned to full-time custody. I do not believe that as serious as the offence is, that it is such that I cannot avoid a full-time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    34 In respect of the second offence in the indictment and taking into account the matters on the form 1 you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months. I order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. The sentence is to commence on Friday 11 March 2005 and to expire on 10 September 2005. 
     
      
    35 In respect of the first offence on the indictment you are sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months that sentence is to commence on 11 September 2005. There is to be a non-parole period of 18 months from 11 September 2005 and to expire on 10 March 2007 the date upon which you are eligible to be released to parole. I order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    36 The firearm in the possession of the police is to be destroyed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: These are applications for leave to appeal against the decisions of two magistrates in effect refusing applications made by the plaintiff that he should be allowed to withdraw a plea of guilty made earlier by him in the Local Court. The plaintiff requires leave to appeal to this Court because each of those orders was interlocutory: s 53(3) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act. If leave were granted to the plaintiff, the appeal would be concerned with whether either of the magistrates made an error of law in determining the application that was before him. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff is the defendant in summary proceedings in the Local Court for an offence contrary to s 61N(2) of the Crimes Act, that is an offence of committing an act of indecency toward a person above the age of 16 years. The allegation is that he touched a female customer of his hairdressing salon on the breast. 
     
      
    3 On 30 June 2004 the plaintiff, who was then represented by a firm of solicitors experienced in the conduct of criminal matters, pleaded guilty before the Local Court at Sydney to the offence charged. The sentencing proceedings were then adjourned for hearing to 11 August 2004. Before that date the plaintiff changed his legal representatives and the matter was re-listed on their application on 5 August 2004. The solicitor then instructed by the plaintiff appeared before a magistrate (the first Magistrate) and made an application “to have the plea of guilty entered reversed and to vacate the sentence date of 11 August and to have the matter listed for a defended hearing”. 
     
      
    4 After a brief hearing, during which no evidence was adduced in any form from the plaintiff, the first Magistrate refused the application and as a consequence refused to vacate the hearing set down for 11 August. 
     
      
    5 On that date, that is the date upon which the matter was listed for sentence, the plaintiff’s solicitor appeared before a different magistrate (the second Magistrate) and asked that the proceedings stand in the list until counsel, who had been briefed to appear for the plaintiff, arrived at court. The second Magistrate indicated that he was prepared to accede to that application. The solicitor then stated, “We will be making a further application to reverse the plea”. The magistrate responded to this as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “No. The decision’s already been made for that not to happen. You have an avenue of appeal have you not? I don’t intend revisiting this.” 
         
        
       
      
    6 Notwithstanding that the solicitor indicated to the Magistrate that it was an interlocutory matter and that there was no “issue of estoppel”, the Magistrate repeated his intention not to deal with the application. The solicitor informed the Magistrate that he had an affidavit that he would be seeking to rely upon if the application succeeded, but the Magistrate refused to receive the affidavit saying: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Not at this stage because I’m of a view unless I have something put before me to show otherwise that the decision has been made and that’s not for me to revisit.” 
         
        
       
      
    7 Shortly before the matter was stood down in the list and at the invitation of the Magistrate, the prosecutor indicated that she would be opposing the application. The Magistrate suggested that the prosecutor might wish to research the situation and then stood the matter down to later in the day. 
     
      
    8 The matter was called on again after counsel had arrived at court. I will shortly deal in some detail with the exchanges that occurred between counsel and the Magistrate, but at this stage it is enough to indicate that counsel was unsuccessful in having the application heard by the Magistrate who remained of the view that the application to withdraw the plea of guilty had been dealt with by another magistrate and that, in effect, he was being asked to revisit that decision as if by way of appeal. Counsel then asked the Magistrate to adjourn the matter so that an application could be made to this Court for relief against his refusal to hear the application. Hence the matter comes before me. 
     
      
    9 The proceedings before the Magistrate were conducted on behalf of the prosecution by a police officer. At the outset of the present proceedings the Court was informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions had taken over the matter in order to resist the challenge to the Magistrates’ rulings in this Court. The Director was represented by a Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    10 There was no dispute before me that an application to permit a defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty was interlocutory in nature. A recent consideration of interlocutory orders may be found in DPP (NSW) v Scheibel (2004) A Crim R 576 at 584. A decision refusing an application to withdraw a plea of guilty was dealt with as an interlocutory order in R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299. Nor was it in contention that a magistrate would be entitled to refuse to entertain an application for an interlocutory order that had already been determined by the court unless there was significant new material justifying the court exercising its discretion afresh on the basis that without new material the further application would be fruitless: Hall v Nominal Defendant (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 440-441. In substance the error of law which it is asserted that the second Magistrate made was his refusal to exercise his jurisdiction to hear the application simply because the application had already been determined by the first Magistrate. 
     
      
    11 The argument before me centred upon the determination of the second Magistrate. But before considering those proceedings, I should say something about the proceedings before the first Magistrate. I have already noted that the application was determined without any evidence being placed before the court. The solicitor for the plaintiff made statements from the bar table concerning the circumstances surrounding the plea as follows. His client had always denied touching the complainant on the breast and had instructed his former legal representative that he denied the allegation. The former representative gave him “certain advice”, his client was confused and “on the basis of that entered the plea which he now knows to be a mistake”. The solicitor advised the court that on the instructions he had been given he “would not be in a position to put to the Court a plea of guilty”. He finally submitted: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………that in the circumstances of this matter where from an early stage the allegations were denied, and that’s clear from the police facts, that in the interests of justice [the plaintiff] should be entitled to traverse his plea. 
         
        
       
      
    12 The police prosecutor opposed the application and referred the Magistrate to R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35. The prosecutor relied upon the plaintiff’s antecedents to submit that the plaintiff “knows what the court system is all about” and noted the experience of the solicitor who had previously acted for the plaintiff. The prosecutor referred in summary to the principles involved in such an application and commented that certain factual situations, which had given rise to a successful application on other occasions, did not “fit the bill”. 
     
      
    13 The first Magistrate briefly referred to some relevant authorities, the history of the matter and the plaintiff’s antecedents. He concluded that the plaintiff “could not possibly, in this Court’s view, be mistaken or have any misunderstanding of the facts alleged against him, the nature of the offence or the elements of it”. The Magistrate, therefore, dismissed the application. 
     
      
    14 With respect to those involved in the proceedings before the first Magistrate, I simply do not understand how a court can be asked to determine such an application without evidence being adduced from the defendant as to the circumstances in which he or she came to plead guilty. Nor do I understand how a court could resolve such an application in the absence of such evidence. In my opinion the prosecutor should have objected to the plaintiff’s solicitor giving his instructions from the bar table. The first Magistrate should have indicated that he was not going to determine the matter without evidence from the plaintiff. 
     
      
    15 There are a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal that have considered the basis upon which that Court will entertain such an application made by an accused person in indictable proceedings in the District or Supreme Court. The principles laid down in those cases apply equally to an application made by an accused before the District Court and they apply with as much force to an application by a defendant in the Local Court. The relevant principles were summarised in R v Van (2002) NSWCCA 148 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        48 What is necessary to be shown before an appeal might be successful from a conviction entered up as a consequence of a plea of guilty, has been variously expressed. See  
        Regina v. Boag 
         (1994) 73 A. Crim. R. 35;  
        Regina v. Meissner 
         (1995) 184 CLR 132;  
        Regina v. Maxwell 
         (1995) 184 CLR 501;  
        Regina v. Ross 
         (NSWCCA, unreported 20 February 1994);  
        Regina Liberti 
         (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 120 and the cases referred to by Spigelman, CJ. in  
        Regina v. Houra  
        [2001] NSWCCA 61 at paras.32-33. The principles have been conveniently summarised in the applicant's submissions taken from  
        Houra 
         (supra) as follows:- 
         
         
          
          ""• Where the appellant 'did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered' ( 
          Regina v. Ferrer-Esis 
           (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 231 at 233). 
           
          • Where the plea was not 'a free and voluntary confession' ( 
          Regina v. Chiron  
          (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220 D-E). 
           
          • The 'plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( 
          Regina v. Murphy  
          [1965] VR 187 at 191). 
           
          • Where there was 'mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt' ( 
          Regina v. Sagiv 
           (1986) 22 A. Crim. R. 73 at 80). 
           
          • Where the 'plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the appellant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty … some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( 
          Regina v. Concotta 
           (NSWCCA, 1 November 1995, unreported)). 
           
          • The 'plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt' ( 
          Maxwell v. The Queen 
           (supra) at 511). 
           
          • If 'the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( 
          Regina v. Davies  
          (NSWCCA, 16 December 1993, unreported)). See also  
          Regina v. Ganderton 
           (NSWCCA, 17 September 1998, unreported) and  
          Regina v. Favero 
           [1999] NSWCCA 320."" 
          
         
         
        49 To the cases cited should be added reference to  
        Regina v. Iral 
         [1999] NSWCCA 368 in which the failure of the appellant to appreciate the nature of the charge and difficulties with an interpreter lead to the appeal being upheld;  
        Regina v. Wilkes 
         [2001] NSWCCA 97 where the advice of trial counsel to enter the plea was held to be imprudent and inappropriate thus occasioning a miscarriage of justice;  
        Regina v. McLean 
         [2001] NSWCCA 58 in which senior counsel's inappropriate advice on the applicant's ability to challenge a relevant matter of fact occasioned a miscarriage of justice;  
        Regina v. KCH  
        [2001] NSWCCA 273 involving improper pressure by counsel and  
        Regina v. Becheru 
         (CCA, unreported 6 April 2001) and  
        Regina v. Toro-Martinez 
         (2000) 114 A. Crim. R. 533. 
         
        
       
      
    16 The authorities referred to in the above passage show that the issue is one of the integrity of the plea of guilty and the question to be determined is whether a miscarriage of justice would arise if the court acted upon the plea of guilty to convict and sentence the defendant. I simply do not comprehend how a court can resolve that issue or determine that question without evidence from the person who entered the plea of guilty. It may well be the case that evidence from the legal representatives who acted for the defendant at the time the plea was entered might need to be placed before the court. 
     
      
    17 I understand that there are short cuts undertaken in the Local Court because of the pressure on magistrates to deal with applications expeditiously by reason of the sheer volume of matters that come before them. I also appreciate that a degree of informality must attend upon applications made in the Local Court particularly if those applications are of an interlocutory nature. I imagine that there are few occasions when evidence is required unless one of the parties objects for good reason to the relevant material being given from the bar table. I would assume that there is a degree of co-operation between the prosecution and defence representatives as to the manner in which the magistrate will be informed of the factual basis for the various applications that come before the court. I have no doubt that, generally speaking, justice can be done on the basis that the court assumes the existence of certain facts or by the court relying upon assertions made informally by the legal representative of one side or the other. 
     
      
    18 But where the resolution of the application depends upon the magistrate forming a view as to the integrity of a plea of guilty as an acknowledgment or confession of guilt, and where that matter can only be resolved by forming a view as to the defendant’s knowledge and understanding of the effect of a plea of guilty or by determining the circumstances in which the plea was given, there is no room for short cuts or informality. There may be cases where the objective facts make it plain that a doubt must arise about the integrity of the plea, but that would be an exceptional state of affairs. 
     
      
    19 A plea of guilty is clearly a very significant step in a criminal prosecution. The ramifications arising from the plea are obvious. Yet a court is entitled to rely upon that plea as an acceptance by the defendant of his guilt and to convict and sentence him relying solely upon the plea: Meissner v The Queen at 141. The plea of guilty in the Local Court is so significant that a defendant can only appeal to the District Court against conviction following a plea of guilty with leave: s 12 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act. Therefore, if there were any basis upon which the integrity of the plea is seriously called into question or any other reason that would make it unfair for the court to act upon the plea, there would inevitably be a miscarriage of justice by refusing to allow the defendant to withdraw the plea and defend the charge. 
     
      
    20 In the proceedings before the first Magistrate the solicitor for the plaintiff informed the bench that the plea of guilty was “based on the provision of inadequate legal advice by his former legal representatives”. The nature of that advice was never revealed. It was said to have resulted in confusion on the part of the plaintiff, but it was a matter left for conjecture as to what it was that he was confused about or how that confusion impacted upon his decision to plead guilty. The submissions never touched on the crucial issue of what the plaintiff believed the plea of guilty meant or why it was that, notwithstanding his denials from the time he had been confronted with the allegation, he was prepared to plead guilty while legally represented. 
     
      
    21 It might be the case, as the first Magistrate found, that the plaintiff was no stranger to the courts and would have understood the nature of the charge against him. It can also be accepted that he had received the brief of the evidence and the allegation was a very simple one both factually and legally. But the allegation was that, because of “inadequate legal advice” and confusion that arose as a result of it, the plaintiff had entered a plea of guilty notwithstanding his denial of guilt. That allegation was never investigated, never considered by the Magistrate and never ruled upon either in favour of the plaintiff or against him. In the absence of evidence from the plaintiff to support the allegation, it could never have been properly determined one way or the other. 
     
      
    22 Of course the plaintiff had the onus of satisfying the Magistrate that a miscarriage of justice would have arisen had he not been permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty. Had he given evidence as to the circumstances in which he came to plead guilty and in particular, if he had asserted that for some reason or other he misunderstood the significance of his plea, questions of credit would arise and the matters to which the Magistrate referred in dismissing the application may have been highly relevant in that regard. Further, the Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated that a court should approach the question of allowing an accused to withdraw a plea “with caution bordering on circumspection” because of the significance of the plea of guilty: Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122. But the magistrate did not address the real issue raised by the application and the question arises as to whether in those circumstances there was an error of law in the determination to dismiss the application. 
     
      
    23 However, before examining that question I should return to the proceedings before the second Magistrate, because, if his determination to refuse the application were attended by an error of law, it would be unnecessary to consider further the proceedings before the first Magistrate. I have already noted that immediately upon being informed by the plaintiff’s solicitor that an application was being made to withdraw the plea of guilty the second Magistrate indicated that he was not minded to hear the application because another magistrate had already determined it. 
     
      
    24 When the matter was called on before the Magistrate later in the day, counsel who was instructed to appear in the matter, informed the Magistrate that the application was “pressed or should I say renewed”. The Magistrate stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        My view is that that’s tantamount to sitting as a court of appeal and revisiting a fellow magistrate’s decision. How can I do that? 
        
       
      
    25 Counsel, rather than answering that question by simply indicating that the plaintiff was relying upon material not before the first Magistrate, embarked upon a dissertation on interlocutory orders. This involved his drawing analogies between the application before the court and evidentiary rulings and bail applications. It is always easy to be critical with hindsight, but with respect this was not helpful because it simply distracted the Magistrate from the real issue, which was why the Magistrate should embark upon a hearing of an application that had already been determined. The Magistrate quite properly drew distinctions between the examples used by counsel to explain the nature of interlocutory orders and the application before him. 
     
      
    26 There are four pages of transcript of counsel’s submissions to the Magistrate but they contain very few references to what was the real basis of the application: that there was material relied upon that was not before the first Magistrate. The references that were made to this matter were put rather obliquely and during the course of an explanation of interlocutory orders. I do not understand that the Magistrate was disputing the fact that the application was an interlocutory one rather he was disputing the right of the plaintiff to have such an application reheard when it had already been determined. Yet counsel did inform the Magistrate during the course of his submissions that he had an affidavit that was to be the basis of the application and that it had not been before the first Magistrate. He also told the Magistrate that “there is now sworn evidence and [the application] is made on grounds that are fully particularised in the sworn evidence”. He submitted that, because the affidavit provided “the necessary evidential basis” for the application and as that material was not before the first Magistrate, the second Magistrate was “not prohibited at law from dealing with the application”. 
     
      
    27 These references to the fact that the application was based upon material not before the first Magistrate should have been sufficient to alert the second Magistrate to the fact that not only did he have jurisdiction to entertain the application but he ought to do so unless he was of the view that the evidence to be relied upon was in substance the same material as that considered by the first Magistrate. He could not form that view without at least inquiring of counsel as to what was the material being relied upon and how it differed from that which was placed before the first Magistrate. But the Magistrate seemed to be unmoved by any assertion that there was fresh material and he dismissed the application. In the course of his brief reasons he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I am still of the view that this application to withdraw the plea of guilty has been dealt with by another magistrate…….For me to revisit that application is tantamount to sitting as a court of appeal and without the benefit of other cases before me I am of a view that I should not deal with that issue. 
         
        
       
      
    28 I can understand that a court would be concerned that a defendant could have an application heard twice simply on the basis that, having chosen not to lead evidence on the first application, he wanted to call evidence on the second application. But that was the vice inherent in hearing the first application without evidence being placed before the court to support it. In any event, if the evidence to be relied upon in the second application merely reiterated the material placed before the first Magistrate from the bar table, the second Magistrate might have been entitled to find as a fact that the new material was not significantly different to justify a further hearing. 
     
      
    29 However, the second Magistrate refused to receive the affidavit or consider whether there was new material justifying a consideration of the application before him. He, erroneously in my opinion, believed that he ought not to hear the application made before him simply because the application had already been determined. In effect he refused to exercise his jurisdiction without good reason for doing so. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that this was an error of law and ultimately did not oppose leave being granted to hear the appeal in relation to the decision of the second Magistrate. 
     
      
    30 Initially I was asked to receive an affidavit by the plaintiff annexed to which was the affidavit that was sought to be relied upon in the proceedings before the second Magistrate. It was put before me on the basis that, if the appeal succeeded, I might consider the application myself rather than returning it to the Local Court. I declined to read the affidavit as it seemed to me that, in the event of the appeal succeeding, the most appropriate way to dispose of the matter was for the Local Court to consider the application afresh because it involved hearing evidence from the plaintiff. 
     
      
    31 However, I want to make it clear that it is for the magistrate before whom the application comes to determine whether there is material that warrants the further application being heard. I have accepted that the affidavit does contain material that at least requires a consideration of that issue in so far as it does contain particulars of the facts and circumstances leading up to the plea of guilty that were missing from the account given to the first Magistrate by the solicitor appearing for the plaintiff. 
     
      
    32 I also want to make it clear that I have not considered the merits of the application. I can draw some inferences about what is contained in the affidavit of the plaintiff at least to the extent that I understand that the plaintiff is asserting that he pleaded guilty after receiving some advice from his legal representative and notwithstanding that he was denying his guilt. For the assistance of the magistrate determining the application and without expressing any view of the success or otherwise of the application I make the following comments. 
     
      
    33 A court is entitled to accept a plea of guilty that is given in the exercise of a free choice in a defendant’s own interests and there will be no miscarriage resulting from reliance on the plea even though the person entering the plea “is not in truth guilty of the offence”: Meissner at 141. Justice Dawson stated the following at 157 (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. But the accused may show that a miscarriage of justice occurred in other ways and so be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and have his conviction set aside. For example, he may show that his plea was induced by intimidation of one kind or another, or by an improper inducement or by fraud. 
         
        
       
      
    34 There is a discussion as to the concept of a miscarriage of justice in relation to an application to withdraw a plea prior to conviction in Sewell, above. Smart AJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, at [39] pointed out the difficulty of trying to fit all the circumstances in which it might be in the interests of justice to permit a person to withdraw a plea of guilty “within one verbal formula”. 
     
      
    35 If the advice that the plaintiff received from his legal representative went to the nature of the charge, the elements of the offence, or whether any conduct of the plaintiff amounted to the offence charged, it might be that the court would more easily come to the view that the plea of guilty did not constitute an admission of all of the elements of the offence notwithstanding the plaintiff’s antecedents and his knowledge and familiarity with the criminal process. If the plaintiff is asserting that as a result of legal advice he was confused at the time of the plea of guilty, again the issue will probably be whether the plaintiff entered the plea of guilty from a consciousness of guilt or intending it to be an admission of the elements of the offence charged against him. 
     
      
    36 If, on the other hand, the advice was concerned with whether he should plead guilty despite his denial of the offence in order, for example, to obtain some advantage for himself then the focus of the proceedings might be different. Simply because a defendant is induced to plead guilty because of legal advice given to him, it does not follow that he should be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty even if others might disagree with the advice. This is because there will be no miscarriage of justice arising. The issue in such a case might focus on whether the plea of guilty was entered in the exercise of a free choice in the defendant’s own interests. Of course the fact that a person is induced into taking a course of action does not mean the person in acting on that inducement is not acting from a free choice. It is not every threat, inducement or pressure applied to a defendant that either requires or justifies a court in permitting the defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty: Sewell above at [34].  
     
      
    37 But if the plaintiff by taking the advice proffered to him, entered the plea of guilty as a result of the exercise of a free choice in what he believed to be his best interests at the time, and if, when he entered the plea, he understood that he was admitting his guilt of the offence to the court, it does not follow that a miscarriage of justice would arise by refusing the application simply because he maintains his innocence of the charge and has always done so, or because he now regrets taking the advice. As Dawson J stated in Meissner in the passage quoted above, a miscarriage of justice will normally only arise in that situation where the defendant did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it. 
     
      
    38 An admission of guilt by a plea in open court is not necessarily inconsistent with instructions to a solicitor that the defendant is in truth not guilty of the offence. There is a discussion upon the subject of pleas of guilty by a person who asserts that he or she is not guilty of the offence in R v Allison (2003) 138 A Crim R 378 at 384 under the heading “I am not guilty but I’ll plead guilty”. In that part of his judgment Jerrard JA considers the obligations upon counsel to obtain instructions in a situation where an accused insists on pleading guilty but nevertheless denies the offence. Whether there is anything of relevance to the disposal of the application in the present case is a matter for the magistrate hearing the application. But the case emphasises that the issue is whether the defendant when entering the plea of guilty understood that the plea was an admission of his guilt of the offence charged. 
     
      
    39 I should also point out that not only does a defendant bear the onus of proof in relation to an application to withdraw a plea of guilty, he must establish “a good and substantial reason for the Court taking that course”: Sewell at [39]. It goes without saying that the fact that the defendant asserts he is not in truth guilty of the offence is not itself a “good and substantial reason” for allowing the application. 
     
      
    40 Nor would the fact that the plaintiff’s present legal representatives have instructions inconsistent with the plea of guilty be a reason to permit the withdrawal of the plea. If by his submission to the first Magistrate that he was not able to “put to the Court a plea of guilty” the plaintiff’s solicitor meant that he could not represent the plaintiff on a plea of guilty because of his instructions that the plaintiff was not guilty, the submission was with respect without foundation. It should be clear from what I have written above, that there is no difficulty, either ethically or otherwise, with a solicitor appearing for a defendant on a plea of guilty notwithstanding that the person has given instructions denying guilt. If it were otherwise, the defendant could avoid the consequences of a plea of guilty simply by changing legal representatives. Meissner makes it quite clear that there is nothing necessarily inconsistent in the fact that a person pleads guilty and yet asserts that he is innocent of the crime charged. 
     
      
    41 Having reached the conclusion that leave should be granted and the appeal allowed in respect of the decision of the second Magistrate, it is unnecessary to consider further the decision of the first Magistrate. The appropriate order to make is one refusing leave to appeal against that decision and that is the order I make. 
     
      
    42 Leave is granted to appeal against the decision of the second Magistrate on 11 August 2002 dismissing the plaintiff’s application. The appeal is allowed and the order quashed. The matter is remitted to the Local Court to be heard according to law and conformably with this judgment. In accordance with an agreement between the parties I order that each party is to pay its own costs.43 Since judgment was handed down the Court has been informed that there was no agreement between the parties as previously advised. A short time after the Court had adjourned, it was notified that there had been an agreement reached between the parties but in terms different to those that had been earlier stated. By consent the order previously made as to costs is withdrawn and the Court now orders that the defendant pays the costs of the plaintiff.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: I will ask Justice Johnson to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The applicant, Wayne Mark Kopacka, seeks leave to appeal, out of time, against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Ellis on 5 February 2004 at the Parramatta District Court, following a plea of guilty to one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the aggravating factor being that the applicant had the prescribed concentration of alcohol present in his blood. The maximum penalty for such an offence under section 52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for eleven years. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years and six months to date from 5 February 2004 and to expire on 4 August 2008. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of two years and six months to date from 5 February 2004 and to expire on 4 August 2006. In addition, the applicant was disqualified from holding a licence for a period of seven years from 5 February 2004. His Honour recommended to the Roads and Traffic Authority that a licence not be issued to the applicant until evidence is provided that he has rehabilitated himself in terms of his consumption of alcohol. 
     
      
    4 A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 17 February 2004, but a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was not filed until 5 November 2004. 
     
      
    5 On 5 February 2004, his Honour Judge Ellis made orders pursuant to s 168 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 with respect to certain summary traffic offences which were related to the indictable offence under s 52A(4). Upon application made thereafter, his Honour, on 3 March 2004, set aside the orders made with respect to the summary matters and remitted them to the Local Court for mention on 11 March 2004. It is not necessary to make further reference to these matters for the purposes of determining the present application. 
     
      
       
      The Offence 
       
      
    6 In the early hours of the morning of 23 November 2001, the applicant drove an unregistered and uninsured Ford Falcon vehicle bearing cancelled New South Wales registration plates along Wellington Road, South Granville. The vehicle’s registration had expired on 1 October 2001. The applicant did not hold a motor driver’s licence, his licence having been cancelled on 19 September 1998. 
     
      
    7 The applicant drove up behind another car, causing the other driver to move into the left part of the lane. The applicant then overtook that other car by driving over double unbroken separation lines onto the incorrect side of the road. The applicant then swerved back onto the correct side of the road at high speed, his car fishtailed, he lost control and swerved back onto the incorrect side of the road, then off the road and into a tree.  
     
      
    8 There were two passengers in the applicant’s car. The applicant and his passengers were trapped in the car until released by rescue service. The front nearside passenger, Mr Tiu Kalolo, aged 37 years, required surgical intervention for fractures occasioned to his left forearm and left leg. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was conveyed to Westmead Hospital where a blood alcohol sample was obtained. That sample was analysed and returned a blood alcohol concentration of 0.281 grammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. To constitute a circumstance of aggravation for the purposes of s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, the prescribed concentration of alcohol means a concentration of 0.15 grammes or more of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood: section 52A(9). Accordingly, the applicant’s blood alcohol concentration was approaching double the level required to constitute a circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
    10 It was not until 15 May 2002 that the applicant was arrested and conveyed to the Merrylands Police Station, where he participated in an electronically recorded interview. Given the issues raised in the present application, it is appropriate to refer to some of the responses provided by the applicant to police during that interview. He said that he had just had a couple of glasses of beer to drink prior to the accident (Q&A 29, 29, 64, 100). He considered that he was in a fit state to drive (Q&A 105). He said that he had owned the car for a few months (Q&A 140) and that he had paid $50 for it (Q&A 127). He said that he called his car “The Devil Car” because it had a “mind of its own”, “for some reason it would want to spin out”, it would “decide to turn right or the back-end would decide to slide” (Q&A 165-171). He said that he did not have the car checked out but had a look all around it himself, because he was a mechanic, although not a qualified one (Q&A 172-175). He was aware that he did not have a current driver’s licence at the time of the accident (Q&A 109-113). He said that he thought that the car was registered at the time (Q&A 116). He said that he was aware that he had incorrect number plates on the car (Q&A 117). He said that he had been driving slowly on or under the speed limit prior to the accident (Q&A 78-80, 85, 89). He said that there were no other cars on the road and he did not overtake any other car (Q&A 147-149). He stated that he thought the accident was caused by the ball joint on the front of the car breaking (Q&A 16, 151-154, 160-162, 178). 
     
      
       
       
       
      History of Proceedings Before the District Court 
       
      
    11 The applicant was charged on 15 May 2002. He was committed for trial on 26 September 2002. On 24 October 2002 he pleaded guilty before her Honour Judge Tupman at the Parramatta District Court and the matter was adjourned with bail being continued. On 9 December 2002, the applicant failed to appear and it was not until 28 April 2003 that he was brought before the District Court again and was granted conditional bail. 
     
      
    12 On 13 June 2003, the applicant appeared before the Parramatta District Court and indicated a desire to seek leave to withdraw his plea of guilty to the s 52A(4) offence. There were a number of appearances before the District Court until, on 30 October 2003, the applicant abandoned his application to withdraw his plea of guilty and confirmed the plea of guilty. The matter was stood over to 5 February 2004 when proceedings on sentence took place before his Honour Judge Ellis with sentence being passed later that day. 
     
      
       
      Reasons for Sentence in the District Court 
       
      
    13 In his reasons on sentence, his Honour Judge Ellis characterised the injuries to the victim as being “at the low end of the scale so far as potential grievous bodily harm is concerned”, and observed that “that fact seems to me to bring this matter below the worst category of offence of this type”.  
     
      
    14 His Honour included as aggravating factors the extremely high blood alcohol reading and what his Honour described (correctly) as the applicant’s “absolutely appalling traffic record”. The applicant had been convicted on eight occasions for drink driving offences, between 1980 and 2001. His record included driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in 1980; driving with the lower prescribed concentration of alcohol and driving whilst disqualified in 1983; driving with the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol and driving whilst disqualified in 1984; driving with the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol in 1986; driving with the mid range prescribed concentration of alcohol and driving whilst disqualified in 1990; and two counts of driving with the mid range prescribed concentration of alcohol in 1995, and, in the same year, one count of refusing a breath test. 
     
      
    15 His Honour found that the moral culpability of the applicant was extremely high, bearing in mind his history of drink driving, his reason for driving, the level of his blood alcohol reading and the manner in which he drove. His Honour noted that the victim in this matter was also intoxicated and he and the other passenger, in that sense, could not be described as innocent members of the community. Accordingly, his Honour concluded that the offence was not aggravated by significant harm being caused to innocent members of the community, although grievous bodily harm was occasioned to a member of the public.  
     
      
    16 His Honour concluded, correctly in my view, that “the community would be outraged that for the ninth time since 1979 .... this man drove a motor vehicle on a public road whilst under the influence of alcohol”. 
     
      
    17 The applicant was aged 40 years at the time of the offence and 42 years at the time of sentence in February 2004. He had been in a de facto relationship for some 15 years at the time of sentence. The evidence before the District Court indicated that the appellant’s partner was employed on a full time basis and that she felt she was required to support him emotionally and financially. According to his partner, the applicant had not held employment for two years at the time of sentence. According to the applicant, this was not correct, and he had worked casually as an assistant carpet layer. There was evidence before the District Court that the applicant had a significant liver problem. 
     
      
    18 His Honour concluded that the applicant “had a problem with alcohol abuse for many years and that he has very little, if any, insight into that problem”. His Honour found that the applicant had done nothing since the accident in relation to his substance abuse and appeared still to have very little insight into his criminality. His Honour concluded that the subjective material provided to the Court failed to inspire any confidence in relation to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. Despite the applicant’s lack of motivation for rehabilitation, and lack of action in that respect, his Honour concluded that it was important when he was released from custody that there be some ongoing treatment, and counselling in relation to his substance abuse. 
     
      
    19 If that did not happen, his Honour observed that “it is likely that this merry-go-round of drinking and driving is likely to continue”. A finding of “special circumstances” was made by reason of the fact that the applicant would require long term treatment and counselling and that the present sentence would be the first substantial sentence of imprisonment that he had faced, and that it may provide an incentive towards rehabilitation upon his release. 
     
      
       
      Grounds in Support of Application 
       
      
    20 Against this background, it is appropriate to turn to the grounds filed by the applicant. The applicant has represented himself, both in the filing of the grounds in support of his application and at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal against sentence. He raises two matters in his grounds and has developed these matters in his written and oral submissions to the Court. 
     
      
      Ground 1 - “Change of plea because of evidence disappearing” 
       
      
    21 The present application is for leave to appeal against sentence only. The applicant has not sought leave to appeal against conviction.  
     
      
    22 This ground has its origin in the events following the accident on 23 November 2001 when the Ford Falcon vehicle, which the applicant had been driving, “disappeared”. The brief of evidence which was tendered in the sentence proceedings before the District Court indicated that the vehicle was removed from the roadway by a rostered tow truck. During his electronically recorded interview on 15 May 2002, the applicant told police that he did not pick the vehicle up after the accident and that he thought that maybe the council took it away. The statement of facts records that an investigation by police revealed that the car was left on the side of the road by the towing contractors and that there was no record of it being towed away by the council. In any event, the vehicle has not been located since and has not been subjected to any mechanical examination. 
     
      
    23 The applicant points to the absence of his vehicle as being crucial to his plea of guilty in the matter. He contends that the absence of the vehicle has deprived him of the opportunity of demonstrating that the vehicle contained a mechanical defect which, so he argues, brought about the accident. 
     
      
    24 The issue of the alleged mechanical fault was ventilated before his Honour Judge Ellis. The applicant gave evidence before his Honour. His Honour’s conclusions with respect to this issue were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “So far as the mechanical fault is claimed, there is no evidence before me of any actual damage to the ball joint as the vehicle was not seized by police and police have not subsequently been able to locate the vehicle. There is no record of it being towed away by the local council and it was not seized by police and it was left on the side of the road by the towing contractors. The offender indicated that the Ford Falcon had been given to him by a man he did not name, and he indicated in evidence that he did not know where the vehicle was, or indeed, what had happened to it. It is his opinion that the ball joint or tie rod broke and he adhered to that opinion in this Court. 
         
         
        I found him to be an unreliable witness, either because he is deliberately lying or more likely, because of his own self delusion. I do not accept his claim that he was driving within the speed limit. It seems to me that his driving at the speed which he was driving, the manner of swerving back onto his correct side of the road, and the fact that the vehicle then commenced to fishtail, may provide an explanation for the ball joint being placed under such stress failing. Nevertheless I accept the evidence of Ms Shaw, and it seems to me that it was likely the vehicle was out of control by the time any mechanical defect manifested, if in fact it manifested at all. Even were I to accept that it had manifested, it does not seem to me to ameliorate the criminality to any extent. This man must have known at .281 that he was under the influence of alcohol. For no reason, certainly no valid reason or excuse, he drove this vehicle and drove it at a high speed in a dangerous manner.” 
        
       
      
    25 The Crown submits that there was no realistic possibility that the applicant could have established, in accordance with s 52A(8) of the Crimes Act 1900 that the impact was not in any way attributable to the applicant’s intoxication, or the dangerous manner of his driving: R v F (1957) 57 SR 543. The applicant’s legal representative accepted on the application to withdraw the plea of guilty that the applicant would need to overcome s 52A(8) at any trial. The applicant’s decision to abandon his application to withdraw his plea was understandable. It was fanciful to think that he could discharge the onus under s 52A(8) in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    26 The Crown submits further that his Honour Judge Ellis did not make any error in dealing with this issue on sentence. His Honour found the applicant to be an unreliable witness and concluded, ultimately, that even if he were to accept that a defect in the car had in fact manifested itself, it was not a matter which ameliorated the applicant’s criminality to any extent. In his electronically recorded interview with police, the applicant disclosed prior awareness on his part of the defective nature of the vehicle, which affected adversely its stability, about which he had taken no remedial action. In these circumstances, even if some mechanical defect was revealed in the vehicle, it would have provided little assistance to the applicant. 
     
      
    27 No error has been demonstrated by the applicant with respect to this issue affecting the question of sentence. This ground should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Ground 2 - “15 percent reduction in sentence, rather than 25 percent reduction for pleading guilty” 
       
      
    28 The sentencing judge said in his reasons on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “He appears still to have very little insight into the criminality. He has displayed to my mind very little, if any, remorse, and he appears to be living in a world which is entirely divorced from reality when it comes to any recognition of fault on his part, or of substance abuse issues. 
         
         
        Nevertheless, I do take into account that he did plead guilty and I propose to allow him a fifteen percent reduction for the utilitarian value of his plea, despite the fact that with the reading of .281 his conviction was, in my view, inevitable.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    29 It was open to his Honour to allow a 15 percent reduction for the utilitarian value of the plea in accordance with the principles in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The applicant had not pleaded guilty at an early time and had spent some months attempting to withdraw his plea of guilty before maintaining it before his Honour Judge Ellis. In these circumstances, no error is disclosed in his Honour’s allowance of a 15 percent reduction within the range of 10 percent to 25 percent identified as a guideline in R v Thomson and Houlton. The 10 percent to 25 percent guideline creates no presumption or entitlement to a particular discount in a given situation: R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 at paragraph 28.  
     
      
    30 Given his Honour’s findings concerning contrition and remorse, there was no scope for any additional discount for the plea of guilty. No error has been demonstrated in the discretionary determination of his Honour. 
     
      
    31 Today the applicant has raised family difficulties since being in prison, including the deaths of several family members and friends, and other concerns he has with respect to his son. Such considerations do not assist him now on an appeal to this Court.  
     
      
    32 The applicant has not demonstrated error in the sentencing proceedings. Nor, in my view, could the Court conclude that some other sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    33 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) the time for filing a notice of application for leave to appeal be extended to 5 November 2004; 
       
       
      (b) leave to appeal against sentence be granted; 
       
       
      (c) the appeal be dismissed. 
       
      
    34 WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. 
     
      
    35 HISLOP J: I agree. 
     
      
    36 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will therefore be as Justice Johnson has proposed. The appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HISLOP J: On 20 November 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to three charges of break and enter contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 112(1). The offences occurred on 24 May 2001, 28 February 2002 and 6 April 2002 respectively. The maximum penalty for each offence is fourteen years imprisonment.2 On 16 April 2004 Tupman DCJ sentenced the applicant as to the offence on 24 May 2001 to a fixed term of two years imprisonment commencing on 11 November 2002; as to the offence on 28 February 2002 to a fixed term of two years imprisonment commencing on 11 May 2003 and as to the offence on 6 April 2002, to three years imprisonment commencing on 11 May 2004, with a non parole period of twelve months commencing on 11 May 2004 and expiring on 10 May 2005.3 Each of the subject offences involved breaking, entering and stealing from residential premises. Entry was gained by breaking windows, and, and in one case, by breaking a glass door. The total value of property stolen was approximately $19,000 of which $10,100 related to the last offence. None of the stolen property has been recovered. Her Honour described the offences (appropriately) as about mid range seriousness.4 The applicant had been previously sentenced by Tupman DCJ on 10 December 2002 to imprisonment for similar offences in March and April 2002. The applicant was eligible to be released to parole on 10 May 2004 in respect of those offences. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was born on 16 May 1964. He has a very lengthy criminal record. It commenced in the Children’s Court with an offence of break, enter and steal, and has continued since that time. Offences, in addition to a number of break, enter and steal offences, include larceny of motor vehicles, driving offences, assault and rob, false pretences, receiving, escaping from lawful custody, use of an offensive weapon with intent to resist arrest, disposing of stolen property, wilfully obstructing an officer in the execution of his duty and drug use and possession. At the time of the first of the subject offences, the applicant was on parole in respect of an earlier offence of aggravated break and enter, and at the time of all three offences, he was subject to an eighteen month bond. 
     
      
    6 Her Honour accepted pre-sentence reports which revealed the applicant was from a family of eight children who migrated to Australia from Lebanon when the applicant was eight. He apparently displayed learning and behavioural difficulties from an early age, he made a poor choice of peers and associates as a young person and this led to his criminal activity at that time. He is now married and has children. The marriage has suffered because of his use of illegal drugs, and there have been separations. He has a limited educational background, having left school at the age of fifteen without gaining literacy or numeracy skills. His employment has consisted mainly of short term unskilled positions. He started to use illegal drugs at the age of seventeen and from the age of about eighteen he has been addicted to heroin, although from time to time he has been able to cease use of drugs entirely. Her Honour found that the bulk, if not the whole of his criminal offending, was connected with his addiction to heroin and that was the key to his offending behaviour. 
     
      
    7 In January 2003, whilst in custody for the offences for which he was sentenced in December 2002, a DNA sample was taken from the applicant. The sample matched samples of blood taken from the sites where each of the subject offences occurred. In August 2003, the police interviewed the applicant in respect of these offences leading to the subsequent guilty plea. 
     
      
    8 The applicant is unrepresented in this Court and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. In his written submissions, he has asserted, “The additional sentence is excessive and request immediate parole”. The bases advanced in his submissions for that conclusion are discussed as follows: 
     
      
    9 The first basis is that the applicant has shown remorse and contrition. 
     
      
       
      There was no specific evidence led at the sentence hearing as to remorse or contrition on the part of the applicant. However, a plea of guilty is taken to be a manifestation of remorse or contrition and to warrant a reduction in sentence on that basis, see  
      R v Thomson  
      (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 386. Her Honour held that a full discount ought to attach to the pleas of guilty. In these circumstances it has not been demonstrated that her Honour made any error in this regard. 
       
      
    10 The second basis is that at the time of his arrest, the applicant had commenced medical treatment for psychosis arising from his drug addiction.  
     
      
       
      Her Honour accepted the addiction to heroin was the key to the applicants criminal offending and she accepted his evidence that he had no memory of having committed the subject offences because of his very lengthy history of addiction to heroin. No medical evidence was adduced at the sentence hearing or on this appeal. No error by her Honour in this regard has been demonstrated. 
       
      
    11 The third basis was that the applicant had undertaken a number of courses and drug rehabilitation programs prior to his conviction for the subject offences. He had been moved numerous times after the subject charges were laid. If this had not occurred he would have completed a number of other courses. The fact he was not able to show the sentencing judge the completed courses led to his additional sentencing.  
     
      
      Her Honour made express reference to the drug programs and vocational courses which the applicant had undertaken in her Remarks on Sentence. She expressly accepted that the applicant had taken full advantage of the range of programs that was available to him and to have used his time well in custody in that regard. There is no basis for the inference advanced by the applicant. 
       
      
    12 The fourth basis was that the additional imprisonment has led to stress and anxiety for the applicant and his family and in particular his father who has supported him throughout and who is suffering from terminal cancer and his wife who is on medication for depression and finding coping difficult. This morning the appellant informed the Court that his father had had a stroke two weeks ago and that there were marital problems between himself and his wife.  
     
      
       
      Inevitably, there is hardship which results to a family when the breadwinner is imprisoned. It is only when such hardship is extreme and goes far beyond the sort of hardship which inevitably results that the Court may take it into account, see  
      R v T 
       (1990) 47 A Crim R 29 at 40. There was no medical evidence before the court to confirm the applicant’s assertions. However, even accepting those assertions, the circumstances in this case are not so uncommon or extreme as to justify intervention. 
       
      
    13 The fifth basis is there was delay in proceeding against him in respect to the subject offences. Undoubtedly delay occurred between the commission of the offences and the ultimate charging and sentencing. However, her Honour referred to this in her Remarks on Sentence and expressly took it into account when expressing the appropriate penalties. As her Honour concluded in her Remarks on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ultimately, it seems to me, that the real issue for my determination is the question of totality. In other words, if I had been sentencing him for these offences on 10 December 2002 together with those for which I did sentence him, what would have been the appropriate sentencing outcome as a total package. It is on that basis that I propose to sentence him for these individual offences and to view them”. 
        
       
      
     The sentences imposed by her Honour effectively required the applicant to spend an additional year in custody in respect of the subject three offences. 
     
      
    14 The applicant this morning confirmed his reliance on his written submissions. He also drew attention to the fact that he spent some time in a drug rehabilitation program under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That release was revoked as a result of his breach and that matter was expressly taken into account by her Honour. No error in this regard is demonstrated. 
     
      
    15 The limitations on appeals must be borne in mind. As stated in R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388: 
     
      
       
        
        “An appellate court does not interfere with the sentence imposed merely because it is of the view that that sentence is insufficient or excessive. It interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error in acting on a wrong principle or in misunderstanding or in wrongly assessing some salient feature of the evidence. The error may appear in what the sentencing judge said in the proceedings, or the sentence itself may be so excessive or inadequate as to manifest such error”. 
        
       
      
    16 In my opinion, no error on the part of her Honour has been demonstrated. Each of the matters to which the applicant has made specific reference in his submissions was appropriately dealt with by her Honour. The overall sentence is within the range open to her and cannot be characterised as manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        2. Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: The appellant stood trial before O’Reilly DCJ and a jury at Penrith District Court on an indictment charging that on 21 March 2003 at Parklea in the State of New South Wales he did supply a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine, the quantity of which was not less than the commercial quantity prescribed in respect to that prohibited drug. 
     
      
    2 The trial extended from 1 to 4 March 2004 and on the lastmentioned date a verdict of guilty was found by the jury. On 13 May 2004 his Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of ten years and a total term of thirteen years four months, commencing on 4 March 2004. He appeals against conviction, and alternatively, seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 On 21 March 2003 police executed a search warrant at the appellant’s home. Significant finds included three containers in a freezer, the content of which was later shown to be 371.3 grams of methylamphetamine; two sets of electronic scales and sixty two resealable plastic bags of a type frequently used for packaging saleable amounts of prohibited drugs. The appearance of the contents in one of the containers in the freezer suggested that some of it had been removed.  
     
      
    4 In the course of search Police Sergeant Lofts asked the appellant if he could tell him what the frozen material was and he replied, “I have no idea what it is”. Later after being taken to the police station but returned to the premises he was again asked what the white powder was, but gave a similar reply. He was then asked if he could say who owned the material and responded, “I could, but I don’t wish to”. On returning to the police station he was formally interviewed. In summary, he told police a friend from South Australia, whom he did not wish to name, had asked him to drive to Coogee and collect a parcel. The appellant was a courier by occupation. He went to Coogee and parked his vehicle in a place which he could not exactly remember but whilst there he was approached by a person, who asked him if he was “Bob”, and upon giving an affirmative reply, this man handed him three bags of white powder. He came home and transferred the contents to Tupperware containers and put them in the freezer. He did not know what the substance was, but suspected it may have been heroin. Neither the friend from South Australia nor anyone else on his behalf had come to collect the goods. A visitor (also unnamed) with apparent knowledge of what was in the freezer came and asked for some of it but the appellant declined to supply any. He thought that this person may have been responsible for the appearance that some had been extracted from one of the containers. 
     
      
    5 The appellant gave evidence at trial. He confirmed the circumstances of obtaining the drug which he had described to investigating police. He corrected something he had said about when he collected the substance, to say that it had been in his possession for about three months, rather than three weeks which he had mentioned beforehand. He said he had been given the scales by his son to repair, and although he had done this he had simply not got around to returning the scales. He explained that he had the plastic bags because he used to store loose coins in them and give them to his nieces and nephews.  
     
      
    6 Inter alia, he admitted in cross examination that “a few days before the police got here” he became aware that the substances in the freezer were drugs but he kept them in accordance with the arrangement which he had made. He had not weighed the amount of drugs. 
     
      
    7 The appellant advanced two grounds of challenge against conviction. Ground 1 asserted: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge erred in directions to the jury regarding the element of supply”. 
        
       
      
    8 A submission on behalf of the Crown was that 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant’s story was not without its difficulties” 
        
       
       
      and elements which were vague, improbable and unlikely were pointed to, as were inconsistencies between what the appellant had asserted from time to time. There is much force in these observations but the ground appears to focus upon the basis upon which it might be concluded by the jury, so it was submitted, that the appellant had the drugs in possession other than for the purpose of supply. See s 29(a)  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
      . 
       
      
    9 The first proposition was that, until handed to the appellant, the man at Coogee had physical control of the drugs. When the appellant received them he did so as bailee for the owner whom he (and the jury) might reasonably infer was the man from South Australia. On these facts the jury ought to have been directed, a verdict of not guilty would follow, as on the balance of probabilities, the appellant had the drugs in possession to return them to the owner, which is a circumstance “otherwise than for the purposes of supply”.  
     
      
    10 Authority for this proposition is contended to be found in R v Carey 1990 50 A Crim R 163 and to be supported by R v Liberti 1991 55 A Crim R 120 and R v Frazer 2002 128 A Crim R 89. 
     
      
    11 In Carey, the sister of an accused woman had given her some packages of a drug (which apparently had not been located by police during a morning search), asking her to mind them overnight and stating that she would return to retrieve them on the following day. These facts were not in dispute. It was held that the mere transfer of physical control of drugs from a person who has them deposited with him or her back to the owner, or the person reasonably believed as such, was not included in the notion of supply either within s 3or s 29 of the abovementioned statute.  
     
      
    12 “Supply” has an extended definition for the purposes of the statute:  
     
      
       
        
        “Supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things”. 
        
       
      
    13 The judgment in Carey was delivered by Hunt J (Wood & Finlay JJ agreeing). Senior counsel for the appellant referred to expressions in the text of the judgment which his Honour articulated in terms of “transferring physical control” of drugs which he argued demonstrated a wider scope of applicability of the concept of holding drugs “otherwise than for the purpose of supply” than a limit of that concept to the strict circumstance of return to an owner. 
     
      
    14 He acknowledged, however, “that Hunt J’s opinion concerning the extended definition of “supply” was that none of the various limbs of s 3 would include the mere return of drugs to the owner or to the person reasonably believed to be the owner. There is no reason to conclude that Hunt J intended his remarks to be understood beyond the context of the facts in Carey which involved deposit by an owner with intent to return to that owner, and it stands as authority that that particular circumstance of intended return falls outside the definition. 
     
      
    15 In the judgment of Hunt J there appears a specific caution, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “I should also refer to one very common situation which that construction should not be understood as including. That is the situation where one person has obtained a quantity of drugs on behalf of another person or on behalf of a group of persons (which may or may not include himself) and where he transfers physical control of those drugs (or some portion of them) to that other person or to those other persons. That is in no sense analogous to the ‘bailment’ situation as is that with which the present appeal is concerned, and in my view such situation would necessarily fall within the ordinary meaning of the word ‘supply’ “. 
        
       
      
    16 The appellant’s assertion of facts, if accepted, would fall within that situation which is expressly distinguished from that of Ms Carey. The appellant received the drugs from the Coogee man on behalf of the South Australian man. He was not a receiver of them from the latter as a mere custodian but was a link in a chain of intended supply commencing with the man at Coogee and passing through the appellant’s possession ultimately to the man from South Australia. That does not demonstrate a possession by the appellant “otherwise than for the purpose of supply”.  
     
      
    17 Counsel contended that it was open to the jury to infer that the drugs handed to the appellant by the Coogee man were the property of the South Australian man. The evidence before the jury went no further than the response set out above in which the appellant claimed to know the owner but did not wish to say who it was and answers to questions recorded on an ERISP system: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q27. That Tupperware container was located in your freezer. Is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q28. Inside that is a(n) offwhite substance which was frozen. Can you tell me who owns that? 
         
        A. Not really, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q29. Do you know who owns it? 
         
        A. Not really, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q30. Do you know who gave it to you? 
         
        A. I do. I don’t know his name.” 
        
       
       
      There was no evidence that the appellant paid any money to the Coogee man. That is the only material which might provoke speculation that the South Australian man might have been (already) the owner of the drugs. A speculative possibility does not leave open a finding by inference. 
       
      
    18 It is notable that in each of the authorities cited by the appellant in support of argument, there was, on the facts, a mere deposit of temporary possession directly from an owner with an intention to return the goods to that owner. In Liberti the drug had been received from a friend who was afraid his house would be searched and the drug was to be later returned. In Frazer, in a car which stopped at a service station, one occupant gave the other a bubble like container which she secreted in her clothing, intending to return it to him when he came back from paying for the petrol. She did not do so because she had fallen back to sleep before he returned.  
     
      
    19 The Crown has collated other cases where a direction along the lines of Carey has been appropriate. In R v EAS unreported, NSWCCA 26 July 1990 cocaine was left with the appellant by his brother to keep for him until he returned from interstate; in R v Tucker unreported, NSWCCA 8 November 1991 cocaine was given to the appellant by a customer to hold for a couple of days until he paid money owed for some clothes that she had purchased; in R v Fong unreported, NSWCCA 20 November 1996 heroin was given to the appellant for a few days to look after and return and in R v Barnier [2001] NSWCCA 459 methylamphetamine was minded for a person who was to return and collect it. 
     
      
    20 The argument on behalf of the appellant is not sustained by application of or analogy to any of these cases. 
     
      
    21 Counsel frankly conceded that he could not point to any case in which, other than in circumstances of holding for return to an owner, a Carey direction had been held requisite or appropriate. 
     
      
    22 An alternative shade of the argument was premised on the appellant being unaware that he was taking possession of drugs (as such) until some time after the delivery of the packages to him by the man who located him in his parked vehicle at Coogee. If he was not a “deemed” supplier at Coogee because he was ignorant of the nature of the contents of the packages then, when he later appreciated what they were, his possession was only for the purpose of holding them until they were collected by the owner. 
     
      
    23 The appellant adverts to the law of bailment and asserts that when the appellant received the drugs at Coogee he possessed them as bailee of the owner. The decision of the Privy Council in Gilchrist Watt & Sanderson Pty Limited v York Products Pty Limited 1970 2 NSWR 156 was cited to demonstrate that it is not necessary for a bailee to receive goods by direct delivery from the bailor. To regard the appellant as a sub-bailee of the man at Coogee assumes that the latter was in fact a bailee of the man in South Australia and was passing that man’s goods to the appellant. There was no evidence as to what was the situation between these unidentified men vis a vis each other, and there was no basis for assuming that the goods were, before and at the time of transfer of possession to the appellant, the property of the man from South Australia.  
     
      
    24 It is noted that the appellant’s legal representative at trial accepted that Carey was inapplicable. That concession was correct. Criminal Appeal r4 is applicable. Ground 1, in any event, is not made out. 
     
      
    25 Ground 2 asserted: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge erred in directions to the jury regarding the mental element of the offence”.  
        
       
      
    26 A direction was given by his Honour to the jury in terms requested by the appellant’s trial advocate. It was: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the law that whether (sic) there is a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of prohibited drug the Crown must establish that the accused had either actual knowledge or a belief falling short of guilty knowledge that the amount of the drugs involved was not less than the commercial quantity, that’s the 250 grams. Or was aware of the likelihood in the sense that there was a significant or real chance that there was that amount of drug involved”. 
        
       
      
    27 The Crown drew attention to the decision in R v Lau 1998 105 A Crim R 167 where a direction to a jury in very similar terms to that was held to be appropriate. The passage from the charge in Lau is set out @ 172 viz: 
     
      
       
        
        “By ‘knowingly’ in this context is meant that the accused knew either of the existence or the likely existence of the item in question and was also aware that it was likely to be a narcotic drug. This means that Lau must have known or believed that the white plastic bag he was alleged to have in his physical possession contained drugs or he was aware that there was a significant or real chance that it did and that the amount of the drug was not less than the commercial quantity or at least that there was a significant or real chance that it was”. 
        
       
      
    28 Senior counsel for the appellant recognized the barrier to his argument created by Lau and submitted that, either it not be followed or it be determined that it was decided, in effect, per incuriam as there was no reference to Saad v The Queen 1987 70 ALR 667. The requisite intention to possess a commercial quantity is a question of fact and Saad cautions against succumbing to the temptation of transforming matters of fact into matters of law. Counsel pointed to the absence of reference to Saad in the judgment in Lau. On the same day as the High Court delivered judgment in Saad, it delivered judgment in R v Kural 1987 162 CLR 505 and in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane & Dawson JJ it was observed that what they were saying in Saad was derived from what had been said in Kural. There was citation of Kural in Lau @ 173 and the proposition that Lau was decided without being referred to appropriate authority should be rejected. Nor, in the light of what O’Reilly DCJ charged the jury, including matters to which I now turn is there any reason to embark upon a decision as to whether Lau should not be followed. 
     
      
    29 The complaint now raised on behalf of the appellant is that his Honour should have directed the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to possess more than 250 grams of prohibited drug: per Sheller JA in R v CWW 1993 70 A Crim R 517 @ 524 (which dealt with a commercial quantity of cannabis crop). 
     
      
    30 In the present case the passage of jury direction by O’Reilly DCJ which I have cited was followed shortly thereafter with a direction in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “What the Crown has to prove is that the accused intentionally had the substance in his custody or control, to the exclusion of others – I have told you about that. The Crown must also prove beyond reasonable doubt that in intentionally having such custody or control he did so with the knowledge or belief that the substance was a prohibited drug; not necessarily the particular prohibited drug charged here but a drug the possession of which is prohibited”. 
        
       
      
    31 The jury had previously been directed about the consequence of not being satisfied of knowledge concerning the presence of at least 250 grams in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “And I remind you again that if you are satisfied of knowledge of there being at least 3 grams of mixture there containing methylamphetamine but you are not satisfied that there was at least 250 grams then it is open to you to say not guilty on the commercial quantity count but guilty on the ordinary supply count of at least 3 grams”. 
        
       
      
    32 There was no request for additional direction. Those able to gauge the atmosphere of the trial had no apparent complaint about the adequacy of direction to the jury in the performance of their task given these various directions. I am unpersuaded that his Honour’s charge was defective in the fashion now claimed, but to the extent that it is complained that there was no independent direction of express requirement in the terms now suggested, I would apply Criminal Appeal r 4 and refuse leave to rely on this ground. 
     
      
    33 The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    34 I turn to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    35 The date of offence was 21 March 2003. Division 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 came into effect on 1 February 2003 and pursuant to the table in s 54B (Item 18) there was prescribed for the offence upon which the appellant was convicted a “standard non parole period” of ten years. An important judgment of this Court dealing with serious questions as to the interpretation of s54B was delivered on 11 May 2004: R v Way  2004 60 NSWLR 168. Also delivered on that day by the Court as then constituted was a judgment in which the principles illuminated in Way were applied: R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135. O’Reilly DCJ sentenced the appellant on 13 May 2004 noting that he had had access to the judgments in Way and Shi delivered two days earlier.  
     
      
    36 The sentence which he imposed consisted of precisely the standard non parole period specified in the table and a total term in which the proportion between total and non parole period matched that prescribed in s 44(2). That proportion may be departed from where a sentencing judge finds special circumstances. His Honour made no reference to special circumstances in his remarks.  
     
      
    37 Senior counsel for the appellant presented argument in support of the challenge to sentence under six grounds expressed as: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to determine the factual basis upon which the applicant was to be sentenced. 
        
       
       
        
         2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to give reasons for the sentence imposed. 
        
       
       
        
         3. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the quantity of methylamphetamine involved was ‘above the middle of the range’.  
        
       
       
        
         4. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence fell in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 
        
       
       
        
         5. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by the applicant’s criminal history.  
        
       
       
        
         6. The sentence was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    38 Grounds 1 to 5 focus upon different aspects revealed by the remarks on sentence of his Honour and it is convenient to deal with them compendiously. 
     
      
    39 The recitation by his Honour of the evidence at trial inculpatory of the appellant was obviously intended to indicate an acceptance of those facts. The submission that no findings of fact were made should be rejected. Nevertheless, whilst the difficulty identified in “the dearth of actual knowledge about simply what went on” should be acknowledged, it was important in this instance to assess what the appellant’s role was. I will return to this matter.  
     
      
    40 It is plain that the learned sentencing judge was taken aback by what he perceived to be obligations imposed by Division 1A of Pt 4. He said that he was “shocked to see what the nett result was likely to be for Mr Blair, but I have come to the conclusion that there is really nothing I can do to help him”. After imposing sentence he added, “…. And I hope for his sake there is some appealable error demonstrated”.  
     
      
    41 In Way, the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to give the Division practical utility it seems to us, in the light of the foregoing analysis, that a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question: ‘are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?’ 
        
       
       
        
        That question will be answered by considering: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1)”. 
        
       
      
    42 Although his Honour considered that he was not assisted by the result in Shi, it could have been of assistance by observing that the role of the offender is germane to the assessment to the objective seriousness of the offence, and its location in the notional range of seriousness. He recognized that determination of objective seriousness is not to be confined to consideration of those matters listed in s 21A(2) and s 21A(3) but he made no reference beyond the “s 21A criteria” which he could identify. 
     
      
    43 In Shi the offence was the same as that presently in focus, supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, although in contrast that offender had pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    44 However, Wood CJ at CL (Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence involved in this case was a serious offence, having regard to the weight and purity of the drugs involved, and also to the fact that the respondent knowingly and with his eyes open, lent aid to those who directed the supply network (for reasons subjective to that offender).  
        
       
       
        
        Clearly the case fell well below the middle range of seriousness, since the respondent was not a principal, and was not shown to have been engaged in the work of a courier on more than one occasion. There is also the fact that his supplier had taken advantage of him”. 
        
       
      
    45 The amount of drug in Shi was 999.2 grams of 84.5 percent purity. An analyst certificate (Exhibit N at trial) concerning the contents of the three Tupperware containers in this case, identified the contents of each as methylamphetamine and respectively as in one container: 321 grams of 6 percent purity; in the second, 13 grams of 14.5 percent purity and in the third, 37.3 grams of 14 percent purity. 
     
      
    46 I return to the absence of explicit finding as to the role of the appellant. Whilst, as the Crown submission on the conviction appeal noted, the appellant’s story would provoke likely scepticism, he should be sentenced for what has been established that he has done, bearing in mind of course, the statutory definition of “supply”. 
     
      
    47 The evidence shows that on one occasion he acted as a courier and type of storeman, moving the drugs from Coogee to the freezer. He was not shown to be the owner of the drugs nor a principal in any transaction or intended transaction, other than passing the drugs on to South Australia. His Honour appears to have accepted the existence of the man in Adelaide and the appellant acting at his behest. There was no evidence of what, if any, reward the appellant was to receive. If his assertion that he was acting in effect, as a favour for the South Australian man is disbelieved, the contrary remains unproved. 
     
      
    48 O’Reilly DCJ did not seek to answer the question postulated in Way by reference to matters outside of the scope of “s 21A criteria”. There was material to be found and it should have been examined in order to answer that question. 
     
      
    49 The Crown concedes that his Honour made a mistake when, making a comparison with a fact in Way, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The quantity being dealt with in this case (Way) was about 274 grams and of course the commercial quantity lies between 250 and 1000 grams, so that Mr Way was in a position where his quantity was below the middle of the range whereas Mr Blair’s is above the middle of the range”. 
        
       
      
    50 As a matter of arithmetic, the mid point in a range from 250 to 1000 is 625. The total quantity in the freezer was weighed at 371.3 grams. This error was drawn to attention and his Honour accepted the error but commented, “It won’t affect the reasoning”. Even if that be so, it could have potential effect in weighing the seriousness of the offence as indicated in the passage from Shi cited above. 
     
      
    51 His Honour said in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “Looking at the aggravating factors (d) applies, because there is a record of previous conviction and previous significant convictions subject to this qualification that there is nothing there about drugs”. 
        
       
      
    52 As the Crown submitted, it is obvious that his Honour was referring to the prescription in s 21A(2)(d) which is part of a list of specified “aggravating factors”, but I do not accept that it can be concluded that his Honour did not treat prior convictions as matters of aggravation, because he referred to the absence of conviction for drug-type offences. 
     
      
    53 I would suggest that it is unfortunate that the legislature has included “a record of previous convictions” in the list of aggravating factors, because it invites, as appears to have happened here, overlooking the qualification in s 21A(4) that a court does not have regard to any such factor as specified if it is contrary to “rule of law” to do so. “Rule of law” is construed to include common law principles: R v Johnson  [2004] NSWCCA 76. It is the common law that prior conviction does not operate to aggravate an offence but may deprive an offender of leniency or indicate that it is appropriate to give more weight to factors such as retribution, deterrence or community protection Veen v The Queen (No 2) 1998 164 CLR 465; R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193. 
     
      
    54 The appellant has succeeded in making good the matters which I have indicated in the foregoing. Accordingly, ground 6 should be sustained. I am unpersuaded that it is the situation that no less severe penalty than that imposed is warranted: Criminal Appeal Act s 6(3) and in my opinion the sentence should be quashed and this Court should proceed to resentence. 
     
      
    55 For that purpose, and without objection for such use, the Court has been provided with more up to date material by way of affidavits. The thrust is to draw attention to the appellant’s poor state of health. The sentencing judge had noted a reference to the possibility of the appellant suffering from Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, a rare illness which affects his sister. The new material offers no diagnosis but does show that the appellant is awaiting medical assessment for a number of reasons including cardiac, sleep and back conditions. He has multiple symptoms and on occasions he is assisted by other inmates. The work he is assigned to in prison does not involve real activity. He is given a large number of medications. It can be concluded that his incarceration is more onerous in the incidents of service of sentence than it would be for a prisoner in more robust health. 
     
      
    56 As set out above, the question to be posed in accordance with Way is whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period. I would answer the question in the affirmative. In particular, a prominent reason for determining that the offence does not answer the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind is that the role of the appellant was not that of a principal but the lesser, albeit culpable, role of a courier and storeman. In addition, the weight of prohibited drug was in the lower part of the range of defined commercial quantity and it was of extremely low purity.  
     
      
    57 The discretion to sentence (or in this case resentence) should be exercised in accordance with established sentencing practice by reference to matters identified in ss 3A and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as well as common law sentencing principles. Guidance as to established sentencing practice can be derived from the statistics published by the Judicial Commission. It has frequently been stated that the use of such statistics must be accompanied by caution and further caution is necessary because, as was recognized in Way, a consequence of the introduction of Division 1A Pt 4 may be a change in the established pattern in an increase of non parole periods and terms of sentence.  
     
      
    58 A survey of sixty one offenders whose offences were committed before 1 February 2003 showed the highest term imposed (on a single offender) as nine years imprisonment. A survey of offences after 1 February 2003 recorded only one case where, although the offender was unidentified, the sentence imposed was precisely that now under challenge. The statistic is likely to refer to the appellant. 
     
      
    59 Save the consideration relating to the appellant’s health, there is little in his subjective case which can be drawn upon to his benefit. Whilst there was understandable scepticism in the questioning of the appellant at trial by the Crown Prosecutor concerning the South Australian man described by him, the prosecutor was not in a position to deny his existence, and the appellant should stand for sentence on the basis that he probably committed this crime to assist this person. There was no evidence of personal gain by the appellant and there was no evidence that he had acquired the trappings of wealth. Nevertheless, there was no assistance to authority in identifying other participants, no contrition manifest in a plea of guilty, and no lenience to be gained by the appellant by reason of prior good record. 
     
      
    60 In setting the non parole period and the total term, I would take into account in the appellant’s favour matters pertaining to his health, but I would not by reason of special circumstances, vary the proportion between the elements of sentence from that prescribed in the statute. 
     
      
    61 I propose the following: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      3. Appeal against sentence allowed and sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      4. In lieu thereof the appellant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of five years three months, commencing on 4 March 2004 and expiring on 3 June 2009, and a total term of seven years commencing on 4 March 2004. 
       
      5. The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 3 June 2009.

      SAMI EL MAWAS v. DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application for leave to appeal to this Court by way of further amended summons from a decision of her Honour, Magistrate Mottley, sitting in the Local Court at Burwood on 30 June 2004.2 Her Honour was sitting in proceedings commenced by the defendant in the present proceedings variously described as Constable Simon Moore, or Sergeant Simon Moore, who had proceeded against the plaintiff in the present proceedings, Sami El Mawas, in respect of various offences which included two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm under the Crimes Act 1900 s 59; two counts of malicious wounding under the Crimes Act 1900 s 35; one count of maliciously destroy or damage property of value less than $200 under the Crimes Act 1900 s 105; one count of enter inclosed lands without lawful excuse (Enclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 s 4); and one count of enter building/land with intent to commit indictable offence (an offence under the Crimes Act 1900 s 114)3 Subsequently, the matter having come before this Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales, by virtue of sections 9 and 10 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 has assumed the conduct of the proceedings. Therefore, in accordance with the application made by Mr Lancaster on behalf of the Director, I join the Director as a party to the proceedings. I note an appearance has been filed on behalf of the Director.4 The plaintiff has proceeded on the further amended summons, claiming an order under s 55.3(a) of the Crimes (Local Court Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the order made by the magistrate. The order made by the magistrate dismissed an application by the plaintiff before her pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. It is further sought that the matter be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law. Coupled with those orders the summons also seeks a number of declarations. It was submitted by Mr Lancaster that I should regard the content of those declarations as referring to the grounds on which the summons contended the magistrate fell into error. That is appropriate because the declarations sought are in the familiar form of seeking it be declared that the learned magistrate erred in law in specific ways set out in the summons. The summons also has annexed to it, as the Rules provide, a description of the nature of the dispute and the issues likely to arise, together with a statement of the plaintiff’s contention that the learned magistrate had erred in law.  
     
      
    5 It is sought that leave to appeal should be granted as the application raises matters of importance to the general law of criminal responsibility as is concerned in the correct application of Part 3 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. It is submitted that leave should be granted because there has been, it is asserted, a demonstrable miscarriage of justice in the present case: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “By reason of the learned magistrate’s incorrect construction and application of section 32. 1(a) and (b) of the  
          Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 New South Wales”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 S 52.1 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “A person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court may appeal to a Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence ‘but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 The present applicant does not fall within that latter section since it is not sought to appeal against the conviction or sentence, but rather against the magistrate’s refusal to apply the provisions of s 32.2 and a finding that the plaintiff contends, should have been made in his favour under s 32.1(b). Leave is therefore necessary.8 S 32.1 provides that if it appears during the proceedings to the magistrate that the defendant is: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “(iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital .... and (b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law, the magistrate may take the action set out in 2 or 3.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 Subsections 2 and 3 allow the magistrate a number of options, including: the adjournment of the proceedings, granting bail, or making any other order the magistrate considers appropriate, dismissing the charge, discharging the defendant into the care of a responsible person, to attend upon a person or place specified for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition, or treatment or both, or unconditionally: by subsequent subsections the magistrate is given power to call up the defendant to appear and/or to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest.10 Sec 32 is contained within Part 3 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    11 It is instructive to consider the statutory history and context. The Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 was enacted to displace previous legislation and, in particular, Parts 11A and 11B of the Crimes Act 1900 by re-enacting provisions relating to proceedings involving persons affected by a mental illness, and to be cognate with the Mental Health Act 1990.12 The provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 go further than the earlier law, both common law and statute law, in referring, in particular, to persons who suffer other mental conditions. Part 1 of the Act includes s 3, which defines “mental condition”. “Mental condition” means: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “A condition or disability of mind not including either mental illness or developmental disability of mind.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    13 “Mental illness” is not defined by that Act but is defined in the Mental Health Act. Part 2 applies to criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court and District Court relating to persons affected by mental disorders. In particular, that part applies to proceedings on indictment, although its application also extends to the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. It may also be that Part extends to appeals in the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court from the Local Court to the District Court. It deals with unfitness to be tried under s 5, and the raising of the question of unfitness as well as its determination.14 The part also deals with the holding of a special hearing in consequence of a finding of the Mental Health Review Tribunal as to the fitness of a person to plead. It deals with the consequences of the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal and of the special hearing.15 By s31 Part 3, applies to summary proceedings before a magistrate, as applied to criminal proceedings in respect of summary offences or indictable offences, triable summarily before a magistrate. Sections 32 and 33 apply to the condition of the defendant at the time at which the magistrate considers whether to apply the relevant section.16 S 33 applies to persons mentally ill, that is, within the meaning of, “mental illness”, used in Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 1990. The magistrate is, in such a case, where it appears to the magistrate that the defendant is a mentally ill person within that meaning, empowered to make orders, including orders that the defendant be taken by police to and detained in a hospital for assessment and if not mentally ill, or not mentally disordered, to be returned to the Court, or to discharge the defendant unconditionally, or subject to conditions, into the care of a responsible person.17 A community treatment order may be made and the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990, other than certain specified sections, would apply. The Act contains other enabling provisions in that circumstance. When dealing with matters concerning sections 32 or 33, the magistrate, under s 36, may inform himself or herself as they see fit. 
     
      
    18 In Part 4 the defence of mental illness is explained. S 38 provides that if it is given in evidence on the trial of a person that the person was: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission was made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried, that the person did the act, or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time the person did or made same, the jury must return a special verdict that the person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19 Mental illness there referred to, which is not defined for purposes of the Act has been accepted in this State as referring to that state described in The Queen v M’Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718 (see R v Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182). It is not necessary for me to discuss that defence in detail here save to note that the section applies to jury trials, not to summary hearings before a magistrate to which Sec 32 and Sec 33 apply.20 It is trite that the defence of mental illness requires that at the time of the committing of the act the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and the nature of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong according to the standards of ordinary reasonable people.21 It is the existence of a disease of the mind which differentiates mental illness in the sense referred to in s 38 from the impulsivity of a personal kind that this mind experienced - see Porter (supra). A defect of reason is the inability of the accused to think rationally, to exercise a degree of composure and control over his actions - see Porter (supra), Sodeman v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 192.22 Where the accused cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in regard to the moral quality of what he is doing, and the other criteria of the defence are satisfied, he will have the defence, as it used to be referred to, of insanity, now mental illness - see Sodeman v The Queen (supra); R v Pangallo (1989) 51 SASR 254; R v S (1979) 2 NSWLR 1.The defence will not, however, be made out simply on proof that the defendant yielded to an irresistible impulse –Attorney General for South Australia v Brown (1960) AC 432.  
     
      
    23 Persons found to be not guilty on the grounds that they were mentally ill, were liable to be detained indefinitely or after statutory provision for the Mental Health Review Council, until released in accordance with the act. Until the statutory reforms persons who suffered from mental conditions but who were not mentally ill were simply treated in the same way as all other defendants. It was in that context of the common law and statutory law that sections 32 and 33 were introduced. I need not examine s 33 in more detail. That section applied to the prosecution of summary offences, the law as it had stood in s 38 and at common law in relation to offences triable on indictment before a jury.24 S 32, however, provides for the recognition, by the court, of the defendants mental circumstances, if I can call them that, bearing in mind the Act refers to “mental illness”, “mental condition” and “mental disorder” and other concepts, each of which seems to refer to something distinct from the others. S 32 relates to a condition of mind different to mental illness or developmental disability or mental disorder, when it refers to a mental condition “for which treatment is available in a hospital”, where a person is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 1990.25  It refers to the circumstances where the condition of the defendant is one of disability of mind, and that disability of mind is such that, having regard to the allegation of the offence, the magistrate should consider it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant by, amongst other things, making orders for the care of a responsible person, or for attendance on a person, for instance, a psychiatrist, or at a place, for instance, a hospital, for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition or treatment, or both.26 Application of the section enables, at least for the period of six months referred to in subsection 3A, some degree of supervision. The section is applicable to that entire range of offences, which might be tried summarily before the magistrate. It would be an error to restrict the operation of the section to any narrower spectrum of offence, or any more narrow circumstance.27 It appears that there is nothing in the Second Reading Speech that assists to define the ambit of s 32. Such discussion of concept as there is of a relevant kind in the Hansard extract with which I was furnished from the Second Reading Speech of the Honourable Peter Collins, Minister for Health, seems to relate to the purposes of the Mental Health Bill, which allowed for the amelioration of the regime that had then existed in respect of the mentally ill.28 The explanatory note to the Bill refers to clause 32 as: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “setting out procedure for the disposal of proceedings by a magistrate where a defendant is developmentally disabled, suffering from mental illness or some other mental condition, but is not a mentally ill person.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 That explanatory memorandum refers to the power of the magistrate. It does not refer to, nor does the Act expressly refer to, the basis upon which those powers might be exercised.30 In the present case the magistrate, on the application for her to find s 32 applicable, and to exercise the powers referred to in it, declined to do so. She published a short judgment of 30 June 2004. The prosecutor, at the commencement of the relevant passage in the transcript, which is annexure A to the affidavit of Stephen Hopper, sworn 1 November 2004, is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Mr El-Mawas is present. It is a s 32 application and I have got the report that I have served on my friend to hand up. There is also a report on the brief, but this one - I have spoken to the psychologist who made the report, and she has amended it with a care plan which hopefully will assist your Honour.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Her Honour says: 
         
          
          “Perhaps the facts and records should be tendered also, Mr Plummer.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    31 It is apparent Sergeant Plummer was appearing for the prosecution. One could be forgiven, when reading the language of that exchange, for believing that Sergeant Plummer was making the application and tendering the s 32 report.  32 In any event, whether the Sergeant was, or was not, making the application, it is perfectly apparent there was no opposition to it, and indeed it appears to be an application that went forward with the support of both parties. The facts and record were tendered. Her Honour then invited counsel for the applicant to tender more documents. There was discussion concerning, in particular, x-rays of the plaintiff’s skull. The plaintiff had had a work accident, suffered a significant brain injury, which produced appalling consequences, in particular of disinhibition occasioning problems. The report went on to refer to the plaintiff as needing further assistance from the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit at Liverpool Hospital. The report of the psychologist, Ms Natasha Langovski, concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “An impaired ability to control his behaviour and regulate his emotions seems to have landed him in his current predicament. These impairments are the direct result of his severe acquired brain injury. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
      
       She referred to the assistance he would require to generate strategies to manage his emotions and executive dysfunction, thereby reducing the likelihood of him (sic) offending in future. There was a supplementary section attached to her report setting out a plan for the treatment to be conducted, in particular at the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit at Liverpool Hospital.  
       
      
    33 In her conclusion the magistrate said,  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “That is not disputed that he has got an injury”. 
          
         
         Mr Hopper said: 
         
          
           “Yes, and you accept that this injury was the cause of his behaviour on that night and you would be guided by the suggested treatment plan by the psychologist.” 
          
         
        Her Honour said:  
         
          
          “Mr Plummer, what do you want to say?” 
          
         
        The prosecutor said:“ 
         
          
          I do not seek to address your Honour.” 
          
         
        The magistrate then said,  
         
          
          “This is a very serious allegation.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 She referred to the facts that had been provided by way of statement to the Court, which are part of annexure A to the affidavit of Stephen Hopper sworn 27 July 2004 and, in particular, that the plaintiff, after having been assaulted the evening prior, by his next door neighbour, the victim in the assault charged against the plaintiff, had apparently obtained the assistance of other persons, they had attended at the victim’s premises when he was there with another person, and severely beaten both of them, occasioning the victim a large laceration.35 The plaintiff, when arrested, and to police, had said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “I told the doctor at Liverpool Hospital I would send him two Asians tonight”.  
          
         
        and he called me a loser, so I said,  
         
          
          “I will send them to him. I am a winner”.  
          
         
        
       
      
    36 At the hospital he referred to having bashed two Asians and, apparently, to causing them to go to the hospital. In the attack upon him, the plaintiff had apparently suffered such a wound as minded the police to charge his next door neighbour assailant with maliciously wounding him.37 The magistrate held that the plaintiff was a person who satisfied the Court in relation to the first criteria of s 32. She held:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “He is clearly a person who is suffering from a mental condition.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    38 She referred to the brain injury and the report by Natasha Langovski. She referred to the suggested treatment plan. She referred to the plaintiff’s awareness of his lack of self control and his attempts to engage in avoidance behaviour. She referred to the psychologist’s opinion that the plaintiff has an impaired capacity for self control and regulation. She said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “He demonstrates disinhibition and impulsivity in his behaviour and he often finds himself behaving inappropriately and without self modulation.” 
           
          
         
        The magistrate referred to the psychologist’s observation - 
         
          
           “....impaired self control accounts for why many individuals with severe brain damage engaged in aggressive behaviour. ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 It was in that context that the psychologist recorded, and the magistrate noted:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “There is an inability to plan, recognise and choose alternatives in relation to any inappropriate behaviour.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    40 The magistrate then held that the present offence was:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “not an unplanned operation”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    41 She refers to the plaintiff having gone to the next door premises, armed with a mop handle and with two friends who were also armed. She said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “It suggests a degree of premeditation and planning, not an act of impulsivity.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    42 In her conclusion the magistrate said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “In determining whether to deal with the matter under s 32, firstly the Court has to address whether the applicant is suffering from a mental condition, and clearly Mr El-Mawas does. 
           
          The second condition the Court has to be satisfied of is that the proceedings are such that it is appropriate to apply the provisions of s 32.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 Neither statement by the magistrate in that extract from her judgment reflects the precise nature of the provisions of s 32.44 The mental condition to which s 32.1(3) refers, is a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital. The magistrate had accepted that there was treatment available for the applicant in a hospital, although she does not expressly, after that portion of her finding to which I have already referred, refer explicitly to that matter. S 32.1(b) does not provide that the magistrate’s function is simply to determine whether it is appropriate to “apply the provisions of s 32”.45 It is not the case, however, that I should, in construing her ex tempore judgment, treat it as if it were reserved, carefully considered, worded and drafted. Regard must be had to the exigency the magistrate faced, and it is to the content of the magistrate’s decision I should have regard, rather than mere questions of infelicity of expression - see Acuthan & Anor v Coates & Ors (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 478D-E.46 Yet, even allowing that degree of latitude, what it was incumbent upon the magistrate to decide is whether “it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law”. Two concepts are involved here, the first being that the person is a person who suffers from a mental condition, but not merely a mental condition, but a condition for which treatment is available and which treatment might be ordered if the magistrate made the appropriate order under subsection 3, which could be done if the magistrate held, under s 32.1(b) that it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant that way than to proceed in accordance with the application of criminal law and procedure. In that regard it is extremely important that the magistrate have regard, not only to the existence of the mental condition, but also to the prospect of treatment for it.47 Secondly, consideration is required by the magistrate of the appropriateness of proceeding by the usual criminal procedure, and of the appropriateness of considering proceeding by way of such an order for treatment. The magistrate held here: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Undoubtedly Mr El-Mawas is labouring under some difficulties and they relate to lack of self control, they relate to impulsivity and aggressive behaviour. The facts that have been described certainly suggest that Mr El-Mawas has engaged in aggressive behaviour, but there is no suggestion that his behaviour on this particular occasion lacked any thought, and was an act of passion or impulse. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          In relation to the matter I am of the view that the application of the provisions of s 32 to these proceedings is not appropriate and the application is refused.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    48 It has been argued on behalf of the defendant that the test the magistrate applied, that is, deciding that the application of the provision is not appropriate, was more favourable to the plaintiff than that which the Act provides, and on behalf of the plaintiff that it was different in nature to the test that the Act provides.49 Certainly it is not expressly what the Act provides. It appears to me that the magistrate seemed to consider that unless the features of the particular mental condition had a substantial causal relationship with the commission of the offence alleged, the application of the section would not be appropriate, whether or not treatment might be afforded for the mental condition from which the plaintiff suffered, whether or not, on balance, it was in the community’s interest that that treatment might be afforded, rather than traditional criminal procedure and sanctions he applied. 50 The further amended summons says that the learned magistrate erred in law by holding it was inappropriate to deal with the plaintiff in accordance with Part 3 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, because the circumstances of the matter were not of sufficient seriousness. That is a complete misstatement of the way in which the magistrate reasoned. 51 The magistrate seemed to have held, having regard to what had been alleged in the statement of facts that the offences were either too serious or characterised by a degree of planning such that it was inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. 
     
      
    52 Thus although the drafting of the reasons might be somewhat on the vague side, they certainly seem to suggest that the magistrate held that either the offence was too serious or that it was characterised by a degree of planning where the condition to which she had been referred was a condition itself mitigating against planning, so that the condition should not be seen to be causative of the crime, and that that rendered the matter inappropriate for the application of s 32.53 It seems, therefore, that underlying the findings of the magistrate were the errors of construction alleged. In Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions Howie J, in the only decision in relation to the application of s 32 to which the parties could refer me, held: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          16 It is clear that s 32 requires the magistrate to make a discretionary judgment as to the appropriateness of proceedings under the section rather than under the general criminal law. But the section requires a magistrate to arrive at a positive finding of fact before proceeding to deal with the defendant under the provisions of Part 3 of the Act. The magistrate can only proceed under s 32(3) to dismiss the charge or discharge the defendant where, in accordance with s 32(1)(b), the magistrate has determined that;  
           
           
          “………it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the Provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law.”  
           
          17 In order to determine whether it is more appropriate to deal with the applicant under Part 3 the Magistrate has to perform a balancing exercise; weighing up, on one hand, the purposes of punishment and, on the other, the public interest in diverting the mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system. It is a discretionary judgment upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions in any particular case. But it is one that cannot be exercised properly without due regard being paid to the seriousness of the offending conduct for which the defendant is before the court. Clearly the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the community and the less likely will it be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It should be emphasised that what is being balanced is two public interests, to some extent pulling in two different directions. It is not a matter of weighing the public interest in punishment as against the private interest of the defendant in rehabilitation.  
           
          18 Because the magistrate’s jurisdiction under the Act involves a discretionary judgment, what weight is to be given to the various factors that touch upon that judgment will be very much a matter for the particular magistrate. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for a defendant to convince this Court to intervene in the exercise of that discretion simply on the basis that the magistrate appeared to give more weight to one factor than another. As with any appeal against a discretionary judgment, the basis upon which this Court can intervene in the exercise of the power under s 32 is very limited. The question for this Court is whether the magistrate failed, either actually or constructively, to exercise the discretion conferred on the court by the section. 
          
         
        
       
      
    54 I am not sure that, even with the greatest respect, I agree entirely with Howie J. I do not see that a discretionary judgment, in the strict sense, is made by the magistrate. To my mind it is rather a value judgment concerning the appropriateness of dealing with the matter under one regime or another. The magistrate does perform a balancing exercise, weighing up, on one hand, the purpose of the criminal process and sentencing, which now are defined by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and, in particular, s 3A of that Act and the purpose of the new procedure under s 32.55 The purposes of sentencing of which s 3A speaks include deterrence, community protection, and rehabilitation as well as the other purposes therein set out, of which punishment is only one. The public interest to which Sec 32 relates, lies in diverting the mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system into a system of treatment, which system has also as one of its objects, the protection of the community. But the modes of achieving the objects differ according to the precise nature and degree of any mental condition and the available treatment.56 Howie J points out that the judgment that is made in those circumstances is one upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions in a particular case. I agree. I agree that due regard must be paid to the seriousness of the offending conduct, as Howie J has referred to. But one should not exclude from consideration, when considering the seriousness of the offending conduct, the degree to which the defendant is disabled from being able to control that conduct by limiting consideration to the “seriousness of the offence”.57 I do not see that the question of appropriateness is amenable to being decided by some short form test such as referring to “the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment”, not only because of the importance of treatment, but also because of the amplitude of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.58  I agree with Howie J that it is the protection of the community with which one is concerned. I do not agree that that renders it less likely in more serious cases, that it will be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. To my mind, the provision for treatment there recognises the concept of protection of the community by the provision of treatment. What weight is given to the various factors that touch upon the magistrate’s judgment is a matter for the particular magistrate.59 What policy considerations should properly be applied are dictated by the particular circumstances of the individual cases, and the principles to be applied - see Norbis v Norbis (1986) 161 CLR 513, but it does seem to me that, where a magistrate failed to have regard to the purposes of treatment and concluded, on a factual basis apparently not at all established by the material before the magistrate, that the offence did not seem to relate to the condition, that the magistrate has incorrectly construed the ambit and purpose of the section.60 I therefore conclude that leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal upheld, the declaration to which I have referred in the further amended summons numbered 2, should be made, and that the matter should be remitted to the Local Court for determination conformably with the reasons I have given.61 I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence which was imposed upon him on 27 May 2004 by his Honour Sorby DCJ in the District Court following his plea of guilty to one count of armed robbery (s 97(1) Crimes Act). That plea was entered on the first day of his trial. 
     
      
    2 The sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years, each backdated to 29 December 2002, that being the day on which he was first taken into custody. A discount of 15 percent was given for the utilitarian value of the plea, and special circumstances were found, referable to the Applicant’s need for continuation of his drug rehabilitation, resulting in a non-parole period being set that was two thirds of the head sentence. 
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      
    3 The Applicant and co-offender entered the Cheesecake Shop at Emu Plains during the afternoon of 29 December 2002 armed with a tyre lever and a socket wrench. There were four persons present, Mr and Mrs Horley, Louise Mayley and Emma Harvey. They were initially ordered to go into the chiller area, but on being informed that one of the staff members was pregnant, the offenders relented to the extent of requiring them to go into the cold room instead. That room apparently was an unrefrigerated pantry. Mrs Horley handed over about $877 being the float money. 
     
      
    4 Before leaving the premises the offenders also stole Ms Harvey’s wallet containing her personal papers and credit cards. 
     
      
    5 In sentencing the Applicant, his Honour made several observations which, it is now submitted, led him into error: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The Prisoner stated that he only got into the car at Blacktown and denied any knowledge of the robbery. When arrested he was found to have in his possession a canvas bag, the money in the canvas bag consisted of twenty-seven $5 notes, six $10 notes and  
        fifty 
         $20 notes. 
        
       
       
        
        The actual amount stolen was calculated by Mrs Horley as $877. The money that was found on the Prisoner was consistent with the type of money that was stolen from the Cheesecake Shop. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Armed robbery is an offence against a person as well as an offence against property. The authorities make it abundantly clear that general deterrence is very important when imposing a sentence for offences such as this, in addition to addressing the other purposes of punishment, namely, rehabilitation, retribution and the protection of the community. 
        
       
       
      
    6 In R v Spiro (1979) 22 SASR 543 King CJ, 549, (said) “It must be made clear beyond misunderstanding that when a person engaged in robbery while armed with a weapon he can expect when apprehended and convicted a long period in prison. Armed robbery is a crime which leaves little scope for leniency even when mitigating factors are present”. 
     
      
    7 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further the  
        community 
          
        has become tired of robberies 
         of premises or persons, the latter instilling fear in innocence (sic) persons. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) I have taken into consideration the mitigation and aggravating factors as set out in s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        . I note that the robbery was not planned with the Prisoner showing remorse and he has some prospects of rehabilitation. However,  
        there was a weapon involved 
         in the robbery, he was in company and there are multiple victims in the Cheesecake Shop. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) As I have said the offence is objectively serious and must attract a full-time custodial sentence in addition to that period that he has already spent in gaol. A weapon was used. People were put in fear by his behaviour. The offence of robbery  
        has become far too prevalent 
         in the community and the  
        community expects condign punishment 
         to be metered out to those who offend.” 
        
       
       
        
       
       
      Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred by finding that the possession of a weapon was a factor in aggravation of sentence for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
       
      
    8 Since the possession of a weapon was an element of the offence charged, it was not a matter to which additional regard could have been given, as an aggravating circumstance (s 21A(2)), if that led to an increase in the sentence that would otherwise have been passed. 
     
      
    9 Although the Crown sought to justify the reference to the weapon as having been directed to the nature and extent of the weaponry involved, and in particular to the presence of two weapons, I am not persuaded of the correctness of that proposition. 
     
      
    10 The other factors mentioned, namely, that the offence was committed in company and that there were multiple victims involved, were properly aggravating circumstances, as were two other facts not mentioned in this portion of his Honour’s reasons. They related to the vulnerability of the victims and to the fact that they were forced into a cool room where they were detained. 
     
      
    11 Although it may well be that his Honour was merely referring to the presence of a weapon in a general way, without using it as a circumstance of aggravation, the mention of it was perhaps unfortunate in the context of a paragraph in which reference had been made to s 21A. Whether the Court should intervene however depends upon a consideration of the remaining grounds and upon an overall assessment as to whether some other sentence was warranted in law. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred by finding facts in aggravation of the sentence that were not reasonably open on the evidence. 
       
      
    12 It is submitted that his Honour erred by inflating the number of $20 notes found in the Applicant’s possession from 5 to 50. This clearly was a slip of the tongue, it being obvious from his Honour’s finding that the sum stolen was $877, that there was no overstatement of the objective seriousness of the offence in this respect. The fact that half of the amount stolen was found in the bag of the co-offender was of no materiality in relation to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s role in the offence. 
     
      
    13 Secondly, it is submitted that his Honour did not give sufficient attention to the fact that the offenders required the victims to go into the cool room, rather than the chiller, and to that extent acceded to Mrs Horley’s concerns about the wellbeing of one member of staff. 
     
      
    14 I am quite unpersuaded that his Honour overlooked this circumstance, it being perfectly clear from his remarks on sentence that he understood the difference between the two rooms. The confinement of the victims in any portion of the premises, against their will, was objectively a serious aggravating circumstance. On any view the incident must have been one that occasioned the victims very great fear, in which they were threatened by two men wielding implements that were capable of occasioning serious physical harm, and were forcibly detained. 
     
      
    15 This ground is lacking in any merit and it is impossible to find any fault in his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, in so far as he found: 
     
      
       
        
        “This offence is objectively very serious. A number of persons were put in real fear by the actions of the Prisoner, including two elderly owners of the Cheesecake Shop and a pregnant shop assistant. These persons were shut in a confined space to enable the Prisoner and a co-offender to escape. A considerable amount of money, at least the victims, was taken.” 
        
       
       
        
       
       
      GROUNDS 3 TO 5 
       
      Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred by giving weight to community expectations about appropriate sentences for the offences. 
       
      Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in giving undue weight to the prevalence of armed robbery offences. 
       
      Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred by failing to alert the Applicant’s counsel that prevalence was to be taken into account so that counsel could address on the issue. 
       
       
      
    16 The submissions addressed in support of these grounds, in respect of what were entirely unexceptional observations by his Honour, should be dismissed out of hand. 
     
      
    17 As Begg J observed in R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 75: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the judges’ duty to reflect, in sentences passed by them, their beliefs as to the attitude of members of the public to the particular type of crime. They do this from their own experience and knowledge of human life. It is not a matter calling for inquiry on evidence.” 
        
       
      
    18 See also R v Underhill where Street CJ drew upon his understanding of the community’s attitude to knives, as being one shared by the courts, and similar observations by this Court in other areas of criminality: Application by the Attorney General Under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Under s 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (No 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303 and R v Hayes (1983) 11 A Crim R 187 per Street CJ at 190 and per Lee J at 191.  
     
      
    19 It would be absurd to suggest that the community regarded armed robberies as other than a very serious crime calling for an appropriate measure of punishment. See also R v Petrinovic NSWCCA 18 September 1990 where Hunt J referred to the community expectation as to the imposition of heavy sentences for armed robbery offences, rather than undue leniency because of an “unhappy upbringing or promises of reform”. 
     
      
    20 In any event it is obvious that his Honour did not consult the community. To the contrary, he took specific guidance from this Court’s decision in R v Henry [1999] 46 NSWLR 346, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted to me that this is a case in which  
        Henry 
         is applicable and on further reflection I think that is correct. Other than the Prisoner’s age all the factors set out in  
        Henry 
         are present here. I cannot accept that his period in custody to date is sufficient to satisfy community expectations in this type of offence nor would it be consistent with  
        Henry 
        . In  
        Henry 
         a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that a full-time sentence between four and five years imprisonment was warranted in cases involving seven characteristics, all of which fit the offence with the exception of the age of the Prisoner, who was in his early forties and cannot be considered young.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    21 The prevalence submission fares no better. The Applicant’s contention that his Honour assumed an increased incidence of armed robberies involves a significant overstatement of his Honour’s observation, which did no more than reflect the view which had previously been expressed by Spigelman CJ in R v Sharma (2002) 13 A Crim R 2389 at [74]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender: see  
        Pham 
         (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135;  
        Tran 
         [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[11];  
        AEM Senior 
         [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[102].” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    22 Similar observations concerning the prevalence of the offence were made by this Court in R v Broxham NSWCCA 3 April 1986, and R v Stefanovski NSWCCA 9 June 1994. 
     
      
    23 It may be acknowledged that, where a sentencing judge does approach a sentencing exercise upon the basis that the increasing prevalence of a particular crime calls for an increase in the preceding pattern of sentencing, then counsel should be warned so that they can deal with the issue: R v Downie (1988) 2 VR 517 at 522-3. Moreover, before coming to any such finding the judge would need to be satisfied, upon the basis of proper and sufficient evidence, that the factual assumption justifying such an increase is correct. 
     
      
    24 Normally such an exercise is better reserved for this Court by way of a guideline judgement such as R v Henry where that kind of analysis was in fact made. In the present case the Applicant suggested that the criminological research indicated that there was a decrease in the rate of armed robberies. The statistics upon which reliance was placed for this broad submission do not purport to isolate the offence of armed robberies in New South Wales, rather they relate to all categories of robbery throughout all States and Territories.  
     
      
    25 While the Crown has drawn attention to more precise and more recent statistics compiled by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research which show a fluctuating trend and differences within regions, any more specific analysis is better reserved for a guideline judgement in which all relevant parties can be heard, should it be thought at some time in the future that R v Henry should be reviewed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: The sentence imposed upon the Applicant was unduly severe and a more lenient sentence is warranted in law. 
      
     26 The head sentence fell in the middle of the sentencing range proposed by R v Henry being one in which almost all of the characteristics identified in that case were present. 
     
      
    27 While it may be that it falls somewhat above the median point for this offence, as disclosed in the Judicial Commission statistics, their limited use beyond providing generalised information as to a range of sentences with the aim of encouraging consistency is well established. See R v Perrett [1999] NSWCCA 115 and R v Bloomfield NSWCCA 15 July 1998. The fallacy in the Applicant’s submission based upon the median sentence argument was, moreover, correctly addressed by the Crown since, if that was to be regarded as the catalyst for appellate intervention, it would have the effect of bringing about a progressive reduction of the median. 
     
      
    28 The sentence which is to be imposed in an individual case depends substantially on its objective facts and upon the subjective circumstances of the offender. In the present case the objective circumstances were serious. The applicant’s subjective circumstances did not provide much by way of assistance in that, while his Honour accepted that he was remorseful and had not committed the crime to support a drug habit, he nevertheless had a history of drug addiction, as well as criminal antecedents for offences of dishonesty, extending over 20 years and had just completed a seven month supervised bond. His professed motive for the robbery, in order to fund a payment for the rental of the storage units which contained the belongings of himself and his fiancée, did not lessen his criminality. His financial need might help to explain why it was that he committed the offence, but it is not an excuse for it. 
     
      
    29 I am not persuaded in the circumstances that any sentence other than that imposed was warranted in law and should have been passed (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). 
     
      
    30 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      2. Appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    31 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    32 BUDDIN J: I also agree.

   Sentence 
    1 On 2nd May 2003 the offender was driving home. He said that he planned to call in to see someone on the way. Many other people were also driving home that Friday evening, looking forward no doubt to relaxing over the weekend. But as a result of the offender’s wrongdoing, 3 lives were lost and many more lives were shattered.2 The offender should not have been driving that day. He only had a driver’s licence because he told repeated lies to the Roads and Traffic Authority. Many times he told them that he did not have epilepsy, but that was not true. 3 The offender displayed an attitude of remarkable selfishness. Each time he renewed his driver’s licence he had a choice: he could choose to either tell the truth which would have meant a possibility of not being able to drive, which would in turn have caused him inconvenience and perhaps hampered his career, or he could choose to lie, and put countless lives at risk. It is not his fault that he suffers from epilepsy – but he is fully responsible for the tragic consequences of his lies. He deserves severe punishment.4 On 2nd May 2003 the offender did not believe that it was safe for him to drive and he appreciated that whenever he got behind the wheel of a car there was a real risk that he would suffer a fit. He took that risk, with dreadful consequences.The Collisions5 Despite being a danger on the road, and knowing that he was a danger on the road, at about 4.45pm on the 2nd May 2003 the offender was driving along Condamine Street at Manly Vale. The weather was fine, the road was dry and it was daylight. Condamine Street is a major road and there was the usual Friday evening build up so that the traffic was moderate to heavy. As the offender approached the corner of Condamine Street and Campbell Parade he had a seizure and lost control of the vehicle he was driving. At about the same time the traffic lights facing him changed from green to amber. The car in front of his was driven by Dr Currie who slowed her car intending to stop at the traffic lights. The offender’s car ran into Dr Currie’s car with such force that her car spun and was pushed into the middle of the intersection.6 The offender’s car did not stop after this collision. He was not in control of himself or the car. His arms and legs stiffened, forcing the accelerator downwards and causing the car to speed up. It continued along Condamine Street towards the intersection of Kentwell Road. The traffic in front had banked up, a common occurrence because of the traffic lights at the intersection of Condamine Street and Kentwell Road. 7 The car immediately in front of the offender’s was a green Mitsubishi Lancer driven by Cameron Howie with his wife Shannon Howie in the front passenger seat and their young daughter, Michaela Howie in a child’s car seat in the back. The offender’s car ran into the rear of the Howies’ car forcing it not only forwards but also to the right, across the median strip and into the path of oncoming traffic. One of the oncoming vehicles was a 4-wheel drive Nissan Patrol driven by Mr Michael Fuller. He was travelling at about 60 kph, that being the speed limit. There was nothing he could do to avoid colliding with the Howies’ car. The force of the impact between Mr Fuller’s heavy 4-wheel drive and the much lighter Mitsubishi sedan was enormous. The smaller car was destroyed, killing all 3 members of the Howie family. 8 Still the offender was unable to stop his car, because he remained under the influence of the seizure. He continued along in a northerly direction until he collided with yet another car, this a Toyota Corolla driven by Mr Peter Wiebe. The offender’s car, having pushed the Howies’ car out of the way, had continued on until it collided with the rear of Mr Wiebe’s car. Finally the offender’s vehicle came to a stop. The Harm the Offender has Caused9 As I have already said, 3 people were killed and the lives of many others shattered. A significant part of the sentencing proceedings was appropriately taken up by the reading of a number of victim impact statements. It is appropriate that those who suffer most from the commission of offences are able to reveal, in a public way, the harm that they have suffered because of someone’s wrongdoing. As I said at the time:  
     
      
      “It is appropriate that I acknowledge the devastating impact that this tragedy has had on so many people. Their loss is enormous, their pain is ongoing and their suffering overwhelms them.”  
       
      
    The Offender’s Background10 The offender grew up on the northern beaches, attending Manly Boys High School and Seaforth Technical College. He did some clerical work upon finishing his education before joining the Naval Reserves and, shortly thereafter, getting a job with the Navy as well. At the time of the collision he was employed as a public relations officer and was very highly received in that position. He has written a number of well regarded books and in 2001 he was awarded the Order of Australia for service he had given to the Navy. 11 He joined the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard in 2000 and donated his time to that organisation, and the people it helps of course, one day every 4 weeksThe Offender’s Character12 Apart from a series of lies told by the offender in order to cover up his epilepsy from those who needed to know about it, the offender is otherwise a man of good character. The evidence that I heard in the trial as to his character was supplemented by oral and written evidence during the sentencing hearing. I accept, and will take into account, that the offender has done much to be proud of. He has given up a great deal of his time on a voluntary basis to help others. He has acted bravely and indeed some suggest he has even saved lives. He worked hard and was a valuable member of the community. 13 I do, however, have difficulty in accepting the basic thrust of much of the character evidence. This was that the offender was “honest and trustworthy”. Many of the character witnesses had difficulty reconciling their view of the offender with his history of covering up, or to put it more bluntly, lying, about his epilepsy. At least one tried to minimise the misconduct by suggesting that what he had done was merely to “tick the wrong box” on the RTA form.14 Those who had formed the opinion that he was honest and trustworthy did so without knowing that he had told lies when applying to join the Naval Reserve, when getting a licence to drive a boat and most importantly when applying for and renewing his driver’s licence. That they remained of the view that he was honest and trustworthy even after learning of these lies is puzzling. I do accept that they genuinely believed him to have that character but I do not accept that their opinions are accurate. 15 Character is of course not indivisible and a man can act honestly and trustworthy in some areas of his life and not others. That is what the offender seems to have done. In every aspect of his life, apart from that most relevant to the present case, the offender seems to have been a man of good character.16 However good character is commonplace in offenders who are to be sentenced for offences of this nature. And where a person had displayed exemplary conduct and even heroism in one part of his life but acted dishonestly and criminally in another part of his life, less weight must be given to the evidence of good character of the offender (see R v Chad, unreported, CCA, 13 May 1997).The Moral Culpability of the Offender17 I received written submissions from both the Crown and Mr Barber on behalf of the offender. Appropriately a great deal of attention was paid to the guideline judgements of R v Whyte & Ors (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 and R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. 18 There has been something of a trend to treat those guideline judgments as though they are legislation. That is not the way they are to be interpreted. In particular I do not believe that there is a bright line between those cases where the offender has abandoned responsibility for his actions and those cases where the offender has not. As I understand the judgments, the concept of abandonment of responsibility is one way of assessing the moral culpability of an offender. It is necessarily an imprecise concept.19 One of the matters, and perhaps one of the most important matters, that must be determined in this present case is the level of the offender’s moral culpability and, amongst other assistance to be gained from them, the guideline judgments are helpful as indicating the sort of factors which should be looked at in determining that issue. 20 In the prisoner’s favour is the circumstance that he did not appreciate fully the level of risk that he represented to other road users in May 2003. This is because, unbeknownst to him, he was at that stage developing sleep apnoea. That condition is a well known and a well-accepted trigger for epileptic fits. I am satisfied that it was that condition which led to a significant change in the way the offender’s epilepsy manifested itself. He did not know that he was developing sleep apnoea and so his moral culpability is lower than it would have been if the offender had been aware that it was.21 On the other hand there are of course factors pointing the other way. I will set them out. They demonstrate, I am satisfied, a high level of moral culpability.22 By the offender’s lies, and repeated lies, he denied the authorities the opportunity of assessing his suitability to drive. The RTA never sought any advice as to whether it was safe for the offender to drive because he told them that he did not suffer from epilepsy when that was not the truth. He told lies to the RTA in 1990, 1995 and 2000. I have found the reason the offender told those lies was because he believed that if he told the truth there was a risk that his licence would be taken from him. This is perhaps the best indication of all of the offender’s moral culpability. It was a deliberate series of lies which were motivated by the offender’s desire to keep driving and a willingness to run the risk that he would injure someone if he suffered a fit.23 Although of course I have to assess the offender’s moral culpability on the 2nd May 2003 I am entitled to take into account what earlier circumstances reveal about the offender’s attitude towards his epilepsy and driving. In particular there is the circumstance, which I referred to in my judgment and verdict, that he was driving in May 1987 despite having 3 daytime seizures earlier that year and a daytime seizure in 1986. 24 Then in 1993 he suffered a fit while driving which led to a collision between his car and 2 others. I am satisfied that the offender was aware that the collisions on that occasion also resulted from an epileptic fit. Fortunately no one was injured on that occasion, but that should have brought home to the offender the risks that he represented to other road users. Surprisingly, the offender continued to drive. Indeed there has been no suggestion that he ever took himself off the road at any stage of his life, even when having a daytime seizure was a common occurrence. 25 After the 1993 incident the offender renewed his licence. Almost exactly 2 years later, on the 14th August 1995 the offender filled in his licence renewal form and denied that he had epilepsy. When asked by Mr Barber in the trial why he had answered “no” to the relevant question, he said that he “felt that the drugs were controlling me perfectly”. However he had not changed his medication between 1993 and 1995 and being aware, as I have found, that the 1993 collision resulted from him having a seizure, the lie told to the RTA on the 14th August 1995 cannot be justified by the offender in that way. 26 The offender at no stage believed that taking his medication meant that he would not have a seizure. He said that Tegretol which he was prescribed after seeing Dr Beran following the incident in 1986 reduced the chance of him having a seizure “a hell of a lot”, but in light of his history of daytime seizures after taking the medication, he could not have “felt that the drugs were controlling me perfectly” as he said in evidence in an attempt to justify his lie to the RTA in 1995.27 Dr Worthington, one of the doctors consulted by the offender, did actually raise with him the question of whether he should continue driving. The offender said that he told Dr Worthington that he didn’t drive all that much. Evidence in the trial from the offender himself indicated that only a very generous interpretation of that phrase would allow it to be consistent with the offender’s driving. It was Mark Twain who first suggested that truth should be used economically and only someone prepared to be economical with the truth, or who was putting a spin on things, could have described the offender’s driving as minimal. 28 Dr Worthington told the offender of his concern about his failure to inform the RTA about his seizure disorder in August 2001 less than 2 years before the 2nd May 2003. In assessing the offender’s moral culpability I take into account that he was warned by Dr Worthington about the risks he represented, but continued driving nevertheless.29 It is also relevant to the offender’s moral culpability that these fits, the offender well knew, came upon him without warning. The offender knew even without being aware of his sleep apnoea that there was a significant risk of him having a seizure whilst driving. The offender was aware that when he suffered a daytime seizure it came upon him unannounced. The offender knew therefore that if he suffered a seizure whilst driving he could do little if anything to avoid the consequence that the car he was driving would continue out of effective control whilst the seizure ran its course. 30 Many of those who commit an offence of this nature drive dangerously for only a short time. Some are inattentive for mere moments. It is an aggravating circumstance of this type of offence if there is a prolonged course of dangerous driving. The present case is unusual in that, over an extraordinary period of time, the offender was prepared to take the risk that he would kill someone if he lost control of his car. He knew that if he did have a seizure while driving there was nothing he could do to control the car and that therefore it would continue on until it ran into something to stop it. The sort of thing which happened on 2nd May 2003, with the accused’s car running into 3 others as it hurtled down Condamine Street, was the predictable result of the offender having a seizure whilst behind the wheel 31 As I said in my earlier judgment and verdict in this matter, the offender was not afraid of his licence being unfairly taken away if he told the truth – he was afraid that if he disclosed that he suffered from epilepsy, any subsequent investigation by the RTA, undertaken by them before deciding whether or not to renew his licence, would reveal his true medical state. The offender knew that this would have gone beyond the simple fact of his epilepsy. He knew that the investigations would have revealed the history of his seizures, their frequency, their effects upon him, the fact that they came upon him without warning, and the fact that medication had not prevented them.32 Sometimes the number of people put at risk by the offender’s driving can be a relevant factor in assessing his moral culpability. In one sense there were people put at risk every time the offender got behind a wheel, those risks increasing as the offender’s sleep apnoea developed. Even just looking at the 2nd of May 2003 it must be remembered that Dr Currie, Peter Wiebe, Michael Fuller and Thomas Fuller were lucky to escape uninjured.33 At times in sentencing there is a tendency to focus on the offender and to almost put the offence to one side. But in truth the objective gravity of an offence is a fundamental consideration which must be at the forefront of the thinking of any sentencing judge. And in assessing that objective gravity, the moral culpability of the offender must be firmly borne in mind. 34 So given: the offender’s repeated lies to the RTA; the offender’s decision to keep driving after the seizures in early 1987; the offender’s decision to keep driving after the 1993 collisions; the offender’s decision to keep driving after the warning given to him by Dr Worthington in 2001; and the fact that the offender knew that he had no warning of a seizure; I am therefore satisfied that the moral culpability of the offender was very high indeed. I make this finding fully aware that the offender did not know that he was developing sleep apnoea.35 He knew he was a danger on the road, and that he should not have been driving. Nevertheless, for his own purposes, he decided to run the risk that he would kill or injure someone if he suffered a seizure while driving. 36 Deaths which could have been easily avoided are amongst the most tragic. Those that are left behind are burdened by the overwhelming knowledge that those killed died completely unnecessarily. All it took for the deaths of the Howies to be avoided was for the offender to be prepared to put up with the consequences of being unable to drive.37 It would have been an inconvenience for the offender if he had been unable to drive. Maybe his career would have suffered too, particularly if the reason he was unable to drive became known to the Navy (as of course it should have been anyway). Perhaps then he would not have been able to write the books of which he is proud. Perhaps he would not even have been able to do the good work which led to him having been awarded the Order of Australia. But a desire to avoid inconvenience and a desire to do good work does not justify the offender risking the lives of others on the road, all of whom have lives filled with promise and whose deaths are devastating to those left behind.Other Matters to be Considered 
    38 The offender has no prior criminal history though he does have a number of driving matters on his traffic record. I have taken into account the lack of any previous convictions although, as I have noted, such a circumstance is relatively common when sentencing for offences of this nature. 39 There was some dispute between counsel as to a matter of fact - namely whether the offender would serve his sentence on protection. I accept that because of the nature of the offender’s offence there is a risk that he will serve his sentence on protection and there is a risk that he will therefore serve his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. Whether in fact he will serve his sentence on protection, and perhaps more importantly whether if that happens he will do his time harder, remains to be seen. Nevertheless as I have said I will take into account that those risks are present.40 I am satisfied that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and indeed I am hopeful that he will never be given the opportunity to re-offend in this way and will be making a recommendation at the end of this sentence that the offender never again be licensed to drive. In those circumstances his prospects for rehabilitation are somewhat irrelevant although I must say that I have my doubts as to whether, even after the events of 2nd May 2003 for which the offender is responsible, the offender could be trusted to tell the truth where it is to his apparent advantage to lie. Remorse41 There was some evidence on which Mr Barber relied in order to suggest that the offender was remorseful. I accept that the offender is remorseful because he is concerned for his family. I accept also that the offender is profoundly saddened by the circumstance that he was involved in a collision in which 3 people died. I am not convinced however that the offender fully accepts responsibility for those deaths. When Mr Gillam, a witness called on the offender’s behalf, was asked to explain how it was that the offender felt extreme remorse and sorrow he answered in terms which suggested that the offender was most concerned for his innocent family. That is somewhat different to the remorse a person feels when he or she accepts the wrongfulness of their conduct. 42 The situation is, I am satisfied, similar to that referred to in R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 where Simpson and Howie JJ (who I understand is no relation to any of the Howies involved in this case) say this: 
     
      
      He may be remorseful for the consequences of the accident, and he may genuinely feel sorrow for the loss suffered by the families. We have little doubt that he would wish to turn back the clock. But true contrition does not arise without an acceptance of guilt. This lack of contrition affects both the measure of denunciation required in response to his conduct resulting in the death of two young persons and the prospects of his rehabilitation. 
      
    General Deterrence43 These proceedings and the sentences I will soon impose should serve as a lesson to those who may be tempted to act dishonestly, indeed criminally in order to be allowed to drive. The sentences I impose on the offender need to reflect a substantial component of general deterrence. The roads are dangerous enough even when drivers are sober, awake, and fit to drive. General deterrence requires that the sentence I impose on this offender serve as a warning to others who may be tempted to risk the lives of road users by driving when it is not safe for them to do so. The Sentences will not be Concurrent.44 I will not impose concurrent sentences. It has never been the law that simply because 3 offences arise out of exactly the same circumstances they should be dealt with by concurrent sentences. Indeed many years ago in R v Wilkins (1988) 38 A Crim R 445 an offender who killed 3 people had his sentences accumulated to the extent that the total sentence exceeded the maximum penalty for a single offence.45 In Price the Court said: 
     
      
      It will rarely be the case that sentences for multiple offences of dangerous driving causing death could be made wholly concurrent. Because… the criminality in the offence is not simply derived from the culpable act of driving without having regard to the consequences, the fact that more than one person is killed means that the criminality will not usually be sufficiently comprehended by a sentence that is appropriate for a single offence. 
      
    46 The sentences will not, however, be totally cumulative. The principal of totality of course operates in this case.Aggravating Features in s21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act47 In his written submissions, the Crown Prosecutor said that there were a number of aggravating features as listed in Section 21A(2) present in this case. I do not accept what the Crown Prosecutor submitted: 
     
      The offender does not have a record of previous convictions in the sense I understand 21A(2)(d) to be directed (see R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78).  
     
     
      I regard the aggravating features in Section 21A(2)(g) and (i) as elements of the offence.  
     
     
      I do not accept that the offender abused a position of trust or authority as those terms are used in paragraph (k).  
     
     
      Each individual offence involved only one victim and the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity.  
     
     
      The possibility that the offender is a risk to society will depend on whether he gets his licence back. As I have said if my recommendation is followed that will not happen.  
    Special Circumstances48 Mr Barber asked me to find special circumstances in this case. True it is that there are present in this case matters which have, in the past, been considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal to be capable of amounting to special circumstances. I refer in particular to such things as this being the offender’s first custodial sentence and the possibility that the offender will serve his sentence on protection. But I know of no case which says that such factors must invariably result in a variation from the statutory ratio. 49 I do not consider that the offender will need any assistance at all in rehabilitating himself once he is released. The offender’s plans for the future, and the support of his family and friends will mean that the offender, I am satisfied, will require no supervision upon release. Even if he would benefit from supervision, the period of eligibility for parole is sufficient. In any case the effective non-parole period I will shortly announce is the shortest I can impose which adequately reflects the objective criminality of the offender’s conduct. 50 The overall sentence will reflect the statutory ratio but because I am accumulating, the individual sentences will not.Disqualification51 I do not have the power to disqualify the offender from driving for the rest of his life. Nor should I circumvent that limitation by ordering a determinate period of disqualification which amounts in effect to disqualification for life. Instead I will disqualify the offender for driving for a period of 10 years from today. It is my strong recommendation, which I ask the Crown to convey to the RTA, that he never again be allowed to drive. He can not be trusted to tell the RTA the truth about his ability to drive, and there is a real risk that he would conceal from them matters relating to his medical condition which make him a danger on the road. Sentences52 On Count One which concerns the death of Cameron Douglas Howie the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 25th November 2004 which is the day on which the offender first went into custody in relation to these offences. That is a fixed term because of the other sentences I will now impose. 53 On Count 2 which relates to the death of Shannon Howie, I set a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months to commence on the 25th November 2005. This will expire on the 24th August 2009. The total term of this sentence is also imprisonment for 5 years. 54 On Count 3 which relates to the death of Michaela Howie, I set a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months to commence on the 25th November 2006. This will expire on the 24th February 2010 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. The total term of this sentence is once again imprisonment for 5 years.55 The overall sentence is thus one of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 BRYSON JA: An account of the facts and of the trial of the appellant has been given by Hoeben J. By subs.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Court of Criminal Appeal is empowered to set aside the verdict of the jury “…on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice …” This power is considerably wider than a power to decide whether there was evidence upon which reasonable people could find the verdict which was found; the power of the Court extends to setting aside the verdict on a basis referred to, briefly, as that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory. The expression “unsafe or unsatisfactory” appears to have been drawn from English legislation in different terms to subs.6(1), and does not accurately or completely refer to the test applied in Australia. The test is to be understood from M v. Regina (1994) 181 CLR 487, and approval expressed in Jones v. Regina (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450 to 452 by the majority (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) of passages in M v. Regina, particularly in the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 493-494. In my opinion it is authoritatively established by the majority judgment in Jones that the appropriate test for determining whether a verdict should be set aside is as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. 
        
       
      
    2 The test in Jones cannot be applied with complete precision, and sometimes leads to differences of judicial opinion on appeal; Jones itself is an example, as is M v. Regina. Notwithstanding observations of Brennan CJ in Jones at 441, it is my understanding that the test is not identical with the exposition given in Ratten v. Regina (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516 by Barwick CJ which included the statement “If the Court has a doubt, a reasonable jury should be of a like mind.” The test in Jones significantly qualifies this statement and requires regard to be paid to the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence.  
     
      
    3 In the present case, some circumstances and some aspects of the evidence make it seem disquieting to me that the jury convicted the appellant. The first and most prominent source of my disquiet is that the complainant did not make any complaint, and did not tell anyone at all that the offence had been committed, until there had been a delay of almost seven weeks, or perhaps almost eight weeks. It is not possible to ascertain the length of the delay because the complainant was unable to state the date of the offence: the complaint she made to the police left a wide margin, narrowed down by her evidence at the trial to four possible days. There were people readily to hand to whom she could complain, including Simon Scott her de facto partner, who returned to the house later on the evening of the offence, and Catherine Scott, Mr Scott’s mother, who was in the house at the time of the offence. No legal rule imposes a time limit on such a complaint and no legal rule disables a jury from coming to a conclusion about whether it is true. To my mind it is a considerable difficulty for believing her evidence that, although she said she was the victim of an outrageous sexual assault, she did not tell people who were readily to hand and were members of the same household as she; nor did she complain to the police; until a long interval had passed.  
     
      
    4 The complainant explained that she did not make a complaint to Simon Scott or to Catherine Scott because she was scared. She said in evidence: “I was scared too because of what he had done to me, scared that something was going to happen.” The complainant’s explanation never became more full or clear than saying that she was scared, and she said to this effect a number of times. She said that at the time of the offence she did not look around for help, and that she did not call out or yell, because she was scared and did not think of it. She explained that she did not ring the police, although there was a telephone in the house, as she was scared. The complainant did not see her doctor after the offence, and when challenged to explain why again said that she was too scared. The complainant did not give any clear evidence of what it was that she was frightened might happen, or of any threat, although her evidence was that the appellant said to her, after committing the offence “Don’t say [anything], I know people.”  
     
      
    5 To my mind ordinary human motivations and behaviour mean that a person who had suffered such an outrage would probably complain, and would do so at the first or at an early opportunity, and would be motivated to do so by a wish to have protection, as well as by a wish to seek redress. It would be plain to a reasonable person in the complainant’s position that prompt complaint to police would improve the prospects of effectual redress by enabling investigations to begin early; and would also improve the prospects of her being protected in an effectual way against the offender.  
     
      
    6 There are other circumstances which have given me disquiet. The circumstances of time and place as given by the complainant are improbable; the rear yard of an occupied house, near another house from which observation might conceivably be made, in circumstances where it would be plainly likely to an offender that the complainant might call out and get help. It was the complainant’s evidence that the appellant’s voice was louder than normal when he spoke to her. These circumstances seem to make it unlikely that an offence took place. 
     
      
    7 Another source of disquiet is that recurring and undue attention was given during the trial to the appellant’s having stayed away for some weeks from the house where the complainant lived with Mr Scott, although he had earlier attended there often. Witnesses spoke of the appellant’s changing an earlier pattern of attending at the house, but to different effects about when and for how long this happened. It is not possible to attribute significance to the suggestion that the appellant stayed away from the house. Times and lengths of this absence cannot be established. There are a number of different interpretations available on the evidence of the complainant and Mr Scott, while Mrs Scott put the period of absence at a different time, after the complainant had complained to the police. There were various references in the evidence to the complainant’s attitude when he did come around: “When he reappeared he was talking to Simon, he was not talking to me” and the appellant spoke of “bad vibes” from the complainant, in a context which, so far as it can be understood, suggests that the complainant might have resented the appellant taking Mr Scott away to go fishing. 8 This inconsequential subject received an unfortunate amount of recurring attention during the hearing. The appellant’s simply not visiting the house for some time, although he had visited there before, could not rationally have any probative force in support of guilt. However I do not see any sign that counsel for the Crown adopted any wrong course, or sought to make much of this essentially neutral circumstance, and the summing up contained no error on this subject; nor, so far as I can observe, on any subject; and no error was contended for. The last word the jury heard was the Trial Judge reminding them that defence counsel had pointed out that it was rather flimsy material to support the allegation. 
     
      
    9 The reasons for the disquiet I have expressed fall into two parts. First, I see grounds upon which reasonable people deciding the facts could very well lack confidence in the complainant’s evidence. Secondly, it seems procedurally unfair that the appellant was not given the advantages which a fresh complaint would have given him in explaining and establishing by evidence when and where he was at the time of the alleged offence. The delay in making the complaint must have produced some unfairness to the appellant, as on the assumption, which must be made for the purpose of testing fairness, that he was innocent, he was deprived of opportunities to recall the facts, and to prove the facts, possibly with the aid of evidence of persons other than himself, which he would have had if he had been told promptly of what was alleged against him, with details of time, place and circumstances. It is possible that he might have been able to explain in a clear way with circumstances that he was at some place where it was not possible for him to have committed the offence; he might have been able to call witnesses to establish that this was so, as well as to rely on his own evidence, or he might have been at a location not inconsistent with his having committed the offence, yet still have been innocent. After a delay of some weeks, and with a range of possible times of the offence, narrowed at the time of the trial to four different days, but in terms of the complainant’s first complaint to police considerably wider, the opportunity to give a full and clear account of his whereabouts was greatly diminished, and the possibility of inaccuracy in the account he gave was increased. I cannot see any more that the appellant could have done to present his case to the jury than actually was done. 
     
      
    10 The Trial Judge pointed out to the jury, carefully and fully, adverse implications against accepting the prosecution case which flowed from the delay in making the complaint. His Honour gave the jury a careful and clear warning of the danger of relying on the complainant’s evidence in the circumstances, and careful and to my mind complete instructions about the significance of delay in making a complaint. His Honour reminded the jury of the line of reasoning that delay was conduct inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person when such an offence occurred, and also pointed out that delay in making a complaint did not necessarily indicate that the evidence of the complainant was false; that there might be good reasons to hesitate in making a complaint. His Honour referred the jury to the complainant’s evidence that she was scared. His Honour further pointed out, quite fully, the difficulties for the appellant arising from delay and the effects of delay on the appellant’s ability to defend himself, and on the opportunity of police to make investigations. His Honour told the jury  
     
      
       
        
        Now you think about that. You think and appreciate the difficulties which this delay and the vagueness and imprecision about the dates creates for the accused in this case. These are not possible problems, these are real problems.  
        
       
       
      There could have been no misunderstanding about the importance of this matter and about the need for the jury to consider it carefully. 
       
      
    11 The Trial Judge also directed the jury on the significance of their decision’s turning on word against word, and pointed out fully and clearly the need to be satisfied of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt upon the complainant’s evidence, in terms which should have dispelled any idea that it was a simple matter of deciding which person’s evidence was preferred. His Honour gave the jury a careful warning about the danger of convicting on the evidence of the complainant alone, accompanied by an explanation of the jury’s entitlement to do so if they found it was right. 
     
      
    12 The task of finding the facts in a criminal prosecution, never I suppose easy, was acutely difficult in the present case; it was the duty of the jury to resolve these acute difficulties. None of the matters mentioned in the test approved in Jones as overcoming the jury’s advantages of seeing and hearing the evidence appears to me to apply. The grounds on which I think that the complainant’s evidence may lack credibility must have been sufficiently explained, to the thinking of the jurors who heard the evidence given and saw the manner in which it was given. To my mind the evidence displays some inadequacy, but it should not be said that it contained significant discrepancies or was tainted, or that for that or any other reason it lacked probative force in such a way as to lead me to the view that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, when I make allowance for the advantages which the jury had. There is no objectively discernible reason why the complainant’s evidence lacked probative force.  
     
      
    13 It appears to me that the advantages which the jury had in finding the facts were enhanced by the circumstance that the appellant as well as the complainant gave evidence. Such a complete conflict of testimony could only be satisfactorily resolved by a jury. Unless the jury fully believed and accepted the claimant’s evidence they must have had a reasonable doubt, in view of the appellant’s evidence and sworn denial. From the verdict it must be understood that the jury disbelieved and rejected the appellant’s evidence of denial. This situation, recurring in litigation, of completely contradictory testimony about whether an event happened, from two sources both of whom must know what in truth happened, must in criminal cases be left to a jury to resolve, except where the test in Jones authorises intervention. Evidence which is not overwhelmingly strong, or is firmly contradicted, may yet base a verdict which the Court is not empowered to set aside. 
     
      
    14 With the benefit of the summing up by the Trial Judge the jury should not have misunderstood their task, what they were called on to decide if they were to accept the prosecution case and the possibility of error and injustice. The Trial Judge explained in a clear way how much the prosecution depended on accepting the complainant’s evidence, and his Honour’s directions should have dispelled any misconception that what was involved for the jury was the simple apposition of one witness’ evidence with another. The transcript of evidence which I have read has left me with the feeling that if the task had been mine I might very well have come to the conclusion that there was a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. The appellant gave evidence which distinctly denied the offence, he was challenged in cross-examination, and adhered to his position. The verdict of guilty seems to carry the implication that the jury did not regard his evidence as carrying any weight, for otherwise they could not, it seems to me, have reached any other conclusion than that there was a reasonable doubt about guilt.  
     
      
    15 The jury’s advantages over myself are very considerable. The jury, sitting in Bega and hearing evidence about events which occurred in Eden, and seeing and hearing the complainant and the appellant in Court giving their evidence, were far better able to place the complainant’s explanations and the facts generally in the context of the demeanour and the personal physique of the complainant and the appellant, and in a context of community life and social behaviour; very little of this is accessible to me, deciding the case on the papers. The jury were in a better position than I am to appraise and understand what significance should be given to realities of human interaction and the force of what, to me and at this distance, seem rather obscure references to the complainant’s being scared, her evidence that the appellant said “I know people” and the effect which deeply veiled threats and obscure statements might produce on the behaviour of the complainant. The jury also had the benefit of seeing and hearing the appellant giving evidence, and were able, in accordance with the directions given to them by the Trial Judge, to bring that advantage to bear on their deliberations and their verdict; and so too, with the rest of the evidence. They had a full opportunity to consider the bearing of circumstances of time and place, the significance of the absence of a prompt complaint and the explanation which the complainant gave for there not being a prompt complaint. It is plain to me that with those advantages all the disquiets I have expressed may have been completely dispelled. What appears to me to be a sworn denial with a fair claim to be considered as raising a reasonable doubt obviously appeared altogether differently to the jury; there must have had a reason, and I see no ground, within the test stated in Jones for overriding the jury’s decision. 16 After the consideration I have given I continue to see that it is possible that the appellant might have been convicted although innocent, but my perception does not survive the test that I must make full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury in coming to a conclusion. In my opinion the Court of Criminal Appeal should not set aside the verdict, but should dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    17 BARR J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Hoeben J. I agree with his Honour’s summary of the facts, save for the reference to the evidence of Mrs Scott. In her evidence-in-chief she said that the complainant and her husband had moved from Victoria to live in her house at the beginning of 2003 and that other relatives of hers used to visit the house. Her evidence continued -  
     
      
       
        
        Q Anyone in particular? 
        
       
       
        
        A Mark, Mark would come in and visit and go fishing and – with Simon. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q I’m sorry I didn’t hear that. You say Mark came in did he? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah Mark would come and visit and go fishing and – with Simon and that.  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q How regularly would Mark visit? 
        
       
       
        
        A He’d come up all the time mainly. You know.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Did Simon, your son and Mark get on well? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes I think.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Now do you recall, was there any change in those visits by Mark Manton?  
        
       
       
        
        A There was a bit there after Simon and Diane told me what happened. He stopped coming around for a little while, but I was wondering why, but – yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You recall that was when? 
        
       
       
        
        A After Simon said – I mean Diane said that she got raped.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Approximately how long was it that Mark was not coming around?  
        
       
       
        
        A About a few weeks there, but he’d come now and then you know in between, that’s about it.  
        
       
       
      
    18 In cross examination there was this evidence -  
     
      
       
        
        Q You said that he stopped coming around for a period, do you remember saying that? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q That period wasn’t very long was it? 
        
       
       
        
        A No it wasn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q How long would you estimate it was? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well about one or two weeks, not long.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q Now, this period when you say he stopped coming, you said, in your evidence was “a few weeks”? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Do you remember making a statement to the police about this on 21 May last year? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You said “ I remember” – this is paragraph 5, “that there was a period of time when Mark stopped coming around. This only lasted a week and a half or so and I didn’t think anything of it”. That’s what you said to the police? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Was that correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah that was correct, but I didn’t know about the rape and that at the time too.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You didn’t – first of all you told the police it was only a week and a half or so? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah, Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was that accurate? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah, around about that. I’m not quite you know, straight on.  
        
       
       
        
        Q It’s about a week and a half, that’s what you’re telling the police? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q A the time, it didn’t seem unusual or strange? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well not really. You know he’d come and go. Mark used to live with me a long time ago.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You’re his aunt? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah or first cousin.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You told the police you didn’t think anything of this, that is you didn’t think anything of him not coming around for about a week and a half? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah.  
        
       
      
    19 I do not think that Mrs Scott would have wondered why the appellant stopped coming to the house after the complainant broke her silence. If the complainant was telling the truth, it would have been obvious to Mrs Scott why the appellant had stopped visiting. Her answers in cross-examination show, I think, that she was saying that the appellant stayed away during a period of time before the complainant told Mrs Scott that he had raped her. That construction better explains her answers in chief - 
     
      
       
        
        But I was wondering why. 
        
       
       
      And in cross examination -  
       
       
        
        But I didn’t know about the rape at the time.  
        
       
      
    20 The appellant did not disagree with a suggestion in cross-examination that he did not go to the house for a period anywhere between a few weeks and a couple of months. He explained it, however, because he said that he fished with his Uncle Warren at those times rather than with the complainant’s husband. There was also this question and answer - 
     
      
       
        
        Q There was a period of anywhere up to a couple of months where you didn’t go fishing with Simon? 
        
       
       
        
        A Sort of on and off.  
        
       
      
    21 The complainant’s evidence about the rape was basic, but sufficient, if believed, to justify a finding of guilt. The evidence of the complainant was supported by her own evidence as well as that of her husband and Mrs Scott and, to the extent that I have summarised, the appellant, that the appellant stayed away from the house for a significant time. Circumstances that might have tended to raise a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant’s account were that she said that the rape took place at a place and a time when the incident might have been seen by strangers. The complainant was unable to fix the time of the event. She did not complain straight away but waited several weeks before telling anybody.  
     
      
    22 The impression the complainant made on the jury was critical. This appeal illustrates the difficulty which an intermediate appellate court has in assessing evidence without the opportunity to see and hear the witness.  
     
      
    23 The evidence shows that the complainant was of aboriginal descent. She and her husband had lived in Victoria for some indeterminate period and in Eden, New South Wales, some few weeks before the event complained of. A reading of her evidence suggests that she was usually able to understand the meaning of the question she was asked. She failed to answer some questions, but that may have been because she was distressed by the process of examination. It is not possible, however, to say that that accounts for every failure of hers to answer questions.  
     
      
    24 The complainant told the jury that she did not tell anyone about the matter because she was scared. That was a statement the jury had to consider in deciding whether to accept her evidence. The reason why she was scared, she said, was that the appellant told her that he “knew people”. Whether that explanation for her silence was plausible depended very much on an assessment of the personality of the complainant. An experienced, worldly woman might have difficulty convincing a jury that she could be silenced by such a vague statement. What, then, was the complainant like? Was she strong-minded, timid, diffident? The jury knew, but this Court can gain very little idea. Her background does not suggest any degree of sophistication. She may have been cowed by the vague threat.  
     
      
    25 The same remarks may be made about the complainant‘s failure to identify the precise evening on which the attack took place. Failure of memory about such matters is not unusual in cases of this kind. The complainant was obviously not very good at remembering dates. The fact that she could not remember a date, however, did not point more to the falsity of her story than to its truth. If she had made up the story, she had made a poor fist of her lie. If she was telling the truth, she had made a poor fist of describing something that really happened.  
     
      
    26 The event central to the Crown case was not something the complainant could have been mistaken about. Either it happened or she was lying. The jury were required to assess her honesty. In my opinion the demeanour of the complainant as she gave evidence must have given the jury a much more reliable indication of her honesty than can be obtained by a reading of the cold word on the page. The weaknesses in her evidence were capable of explanation and the jury accepted the explanation. There was some support independently of the complainant’s evidence of the truth of what she said. I have assessed the evidence, as I must, and I have acknowledged the superior position in which the jury were, as I must. It has not been made to appear to me that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
     
      
    27 I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    28 HOEBEN J:  
     
      
      Offence and sentence 
       
      Mark Anthony Manton, the appellant, came for trial before Judge Knight and a jury at Bega between 23 and 26 February 2004. The indictment charged that the appellant, between 28 February 2003 and 31 March 2003 at Eden had sexual intercourse with Diane Carol Howden without her consent and knowing she was not consenting, in breach of s61I of the  
      Crimes Act NSW 
       1900. On 26 February the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
       
      
    29 On 5 April 2004 Judge Knight sentenced the appellant to a period of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, such non-parole period to commence on 26 February 2004 and expire on 25 August 2007. The parole period was to commence on 26 August 2007 and expire on 25 February 2009. 
     
      
    30 The appellant has appealed against his conviction on the basis that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. It is not contended that his Honour Judge Knight erred in his conduct of the trial, or in his directions to the jury. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    31 Diane Carol Howden, the complainant, gave evidence that she had moved to Eden with her de facto husband, Simon Scott, and four children two months before the incident, ie late January 2003. The family lived with Simon’s mother, Catherine Scott, at Rodd Street, Eden. A regular visitor to Rodd Street was the appellant, who was Simon’s cousin. He and Simon would often go fishing. 
     
      
    32 The complainant said that on a Thursday or Friday evening between 9 and 10 pm she went into the backyard to retrieve some washing from a line. The four children and Mrs Scott were in bed. Simon had gone out, taking his car. In the yard she heard someone say “Oi”. It was the appellant. He asked for sex. The complainant refused. The appellant’s eyes were red and glassy and his voice was louder than normal. He grabbed the complainant and pushed her to the ground. He said that “He knows people”. The complainant was scared and thought she might be hurt. 
     
      
    33 The complainant said that he removed her tracksuit trousers and knickers and put his penis in her vagina. The act of intercourse took five to ten minutes. When he stopped he said “Don’t say nothing, I know people”. This made the complainant feel scared. She ran inside, locked the door and had a shower. She then went to her room and cried. She did not say anything to Catherine Scott that night. She did not say anything to Simon Scott that night. She did not do so because she was scared. “I was scared too because of what he’d done to me, scared that something was going to happen.” (T.25.1) 
     
      
    34 The complainant did not tell anyone about the incident until a day or so before she made her statement to the police on 9 May 2003. The first person she told was Simon Scott. The complainant estimated that the incident had occurred on 13 or 14 or on 20 or 21 March 2003. She was able to say this because she knew the incident occurred on either a Thursday or a Friday night and because “it happened more at the end of the month and the last week of the month I got my period”. (T.26.12) The complainant had had two periods between the date of the incident and when she made her statement to the police. Her menstrual cycle was regular and normally occurred in the last week of every month. 
     
      
    35 The complainant could not remember anything about the clothing which the appellant was wearing. She did not scream out because she was scared. She was scared that she was going to be hurt. She said that after this incident she did not see the appellant for a couple of months because he stayed away. After a couple of months he came back and started going to the house again. The complainant broke down and wept on at least two occasions while giving her evidence in chief. 
     
      
    36 The complainant was cross-examined. She agreed that she had told the police in her statement on 9 May 2003 that the incident happened in March or April. The complainant agreed that in that same statement she had told the police that she did not know the date when the incident happened “but it was before the Easter school holidays and a couple of months after we moved to Cathy’s place”. It was common ground that the Easter school holidays commenced on 18 April 2003. She now realised the incident could not have taken place in April. She said that when she made the police statement, she could not think properly. She was too stressed to give an accurate date.  
     
      
    37 The complainant gave evidence at committal proceedings on 17 October 2003. In those proceedings this exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You said in your statement as well that it happened before Easter. Did you have any idea roughly how long it was before Easter or? 
         
        A. I knew it wasn’t too far. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would you say a week or two weeks before Easter? 
         
        A. I’m not sure”. 
        
       
       
      The complainant said that she gave that answer because she could not think properly. She agreed that the incident could not have occurred a week or two before Easter (T.35). 
       
      
    38 The complainant thought she had last seen the appellant either on the day of the incident, or the day before. The appellant had quit his job before the incident (T.37.33). The complainant was adamant that the appellant stayed away for a period longer than a week, and it seemed like two months. In her statement to the police the complainant had referred to the appellant staying away for “a month or more”. Thereafter the appellant resumed visiting the house, but not as regularly as before, going for drives with Simon and going into the bush with him looking for plants (T.38.40). 
     
      
    39 Despite sharing a room, she did not tell Simon of the incident that night. She did not tell his mother Cathy of the incident, either that night or the next day. She did not cry in front of either one of them the next day. She did not appear upset in front of them the next day. She could not think of any behaviour on her part in the weeks following the incident which might have indicated that she had been sexually assaulted. She told no one during that time. 
     
      
    40 She did not see a doctor because she did not feel as though she had been injured. She was too scared to go to the doctor. This was despite the fact that she was planning to have another child. She did not tell the police until 9 May. She was too scared. She kept the clothes she was wearing, but had washed them. She did not think to keep the clothes unwashed so that they could be tested by the police.  
     
      
    41 The backyard where the attack took place was well lit. It was overlooked by two buildings one of which gave a good view into the backyard. The neighbours were close enough to have heard the complainant if she had screamed. She did not do so. She did not look around to see if there was anyone about. She was too scared to think. She did not yell out for help because she was too scared. There was a phone in the house that night, but she did not use it. The complainant said that she did not know when she thought she might get hurt, but was scared that the appellant was going to hurt her if she rang the police or told anyone. The complainant broke down and wept on at least one occasion during cross-examination. 
     
      
    42 Simon Scott gave evidence that there was a period when the appellant had stopped coming around, that he thought he had offended him in some way and that the complainant was different with the appellant after the incident, but he did not know the dates. 
     
      
    43 Mrs Scott gave evidence that the appellant had stopped coming around for one or two weeks after the complainant had told Mrs Scott what had happened. Mrs Scott had not noticed anything unusual or strange about the appellant or the complainant.  
     
      
    44 The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. He denied that he had sexually assaulted the complainant. He was a little vague about whether he had reduced the number of visits to Rodd Street. He agreed that for a period he had not gone fishing with Mr Scott as often as before. It was his custom to visit Rodd Street on weekends and sometimes during the week. He thought the complainant did not like him taking Simon away to go fishing. He had not found out about the allegation by the complainant until an occasion when he borrowed some videos from Mrs Scott and he mentioned it to Simon the next day when he returned the videos. 
     
      
    45 Warren Russell, Mr Scott’s uncle, gave evidence. He and the appellant had both worked on an oyster farm until 30 March 2003. The appellant would work during the week and get a lift into Eden and stay with him on weekends. 
     
      
     
     
      
      Deficiencies in Crown case 
       
      
    46 The complainant’s evidence was entirely uncorroborated. The Crown case was totally dependent upon her evidence. There was no scientific or medical support for the claimed sexual assault. There was no complaint at the time or for a considerable period thereafter (six or seven weeks on the complainant’s testimony). 
     
      
    47 The appellant’s suggested cessation of visits to Rodd Street did not corroborate the complainant. There was a factual issue as to whether such a cessation of visits had taken place and if so, for what period of time. The complainant was unclear as to length of time, varying between one month, two months, and more than a week which felt like two months. Mr Scott said a month and a half – two months. Mrs Scott said there was a period of one or two weeks after the complainant had reported the incident. The appellant said there was a period when he stopped fishing with Mr Scott but still visited every weekend. 
     
      
    48 There was a legal issue as to how that evidence was to be used. In address the Crown sought to use the evidence of the complainant and Mr Scott on that issue to challenge the credit of the appellant. In cross-examination, however, it had been put to the appellant that the reason he stopped coming around was because he had raped the complainant, ie consciousness of guilt (T84.54). No direction in accordance with Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 211 was sought or given on that issue. 
     
      
    49 It is difficult to see what use could or should have been made of that evidence by a reasonable jury. The evidence itself was contradicted and contradictory. It was not corroborative and was open to a number of innocent explanations. There was a real risk that the emphasis given to that evidence by the Crown may have misled the jury. It is difficult to see how that evidence supported the Crown case.  
     
      
    50 The complainant’s cross-examination demonstrated inconsistencies in her identification of when the assault had taken place. In the police statement of 9 May 2003 and in the committal proceedings on 17 October 2003, she had referred to the incident taking place shortly before Easter (the Easter school holidays commenced 18 April). Her evidence at trial identified four possible dates in March. She agreed that the incident could not and did not occur in April. Her explanation was that she was too stressed and could not think properly on those occasions when she referred to April. It was clear from her evidence that the dates nominated at trial were a reconstruction by her based on the occurrence of her periods since the incident and that she had no actual recollection of the date.  
     
      
    51 The delay in complaint raised considerations of inherent improbability. Once the door of the house was locked against any intruder, there was ample opportunity to either complain to Mrs Scott, to Mr Scott when he returned home, or to telephone the police. That opportunity continued for the whole period of the delay until a day or two before 9 May 2003. The explanation of being scared was, in the circumstances, unsatisfactory. No actual violence had been used during the assault, nor any specific violence threatened. The expression “I know people” was vague and non-specific. 
     
      
    52 The delay in complaint created major problems for the appellant in defending himself. If innocent, his ability to recall events which took place at the time of the incident was impeded, particularly when the date was so non-specific. It had the effect of relegating the appellant from giving an account of what actually happened to “what must have happened”. 
     
      
    53 The appellant’s opportunity to obtain evidence refuting the circumstances of the offence was significantly reduced. The appellant’s and the complainant’s movements on the day of the alleged incident were material facts. Proof of them would have gone far to support one or other of the opposing cases. The situation for the appellant as to whether the incident took place on a Thursday or a Friday may have been significant given the evidence that he worked at the oyster farm during the week and went to Eden on the weekends. 
     
      
    54 If complaint had been made promptly and the appellant was innocent as he claimed to be, he may have been able to obtain DNA or other scientific evidence which exculpated him. This was not only rendered impossible by the delay but also because the complainant had washed the clothes she was wearing at the time of the incident and she was unable to remember and therefore identify the clothes which the appellant was allegedly wearing at the time. 
     
      
    55 Apart from those matters, there were other problems in the Crown case. The complainant did not look to the neighbouring houses for assistance despite one of them overlooking the backyard which was well lit. She did not yell out, despite there being no actual threat of immediate harm. Although intending to have another child, she did not consult a doctor. In the circumstances of the assault as described, one would have expected the complainant to have had a justified fear of infection. Finally, there was nothing in her behaviour or demeanour, immediately following the incident and in the weeks thereafter, to indicate that it had occurred. 
     
      
    56 The appellant was not shaken in cross-examination. He made appropriate concessions. Given the vagueness of the time frame of the allegation against him, calling Mr Warren to establish that he worked at the oyster farm at Pambula during the week and spent his weekends fishing, was the best that could be done to mount a defence. The appellant’s sworn evidence denying the allegation must be properly taken into account. 
     
      
       
      Power of this Court 
       
      
    57 Under s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 this Court is required to set aside a conviction if it is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the Court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    58 In M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492, the majority said that although the phrase “unsafe or unsatisfactory” did not appear in s6, it allowed a verdict to be set aside when the verdict was unreasonable or not supportable on the evidence. In the same case, McHugh J said (p 523) that a “miscarriage of justice” arose whenever the accused had not had a fair trial according to law or whenever the nature of the evidence, the directions to the jury or the procedures that were followed raised a real doubt as to whether the conviction could be regarded as a safe or just conviction. Having regard to the statements in M, there can be no doubt that “a miscarriage of justice” also occurs when the finding or verdict of the jury raises a real doubt as to whether a conviction is safe or just.  
     
      
    59 In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (p 493) that the test for an unsafe or unsatisfactory verdict was whether the court thought that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was “open” to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. This decision was reached, however, not merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. 
     
      
       
        
        “In answering the question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” (p 493) 
        
       
      
    60 The majority explained the application of the test as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a Court of Criminal Appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the Court of Criminal Appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” (p 494)

      Conclusion 
       
      
    61 This was not a case which depended upon which of two witnesses the jury preferred. Even if the jury preferred the evidence of the complainant it still had to be satisfied as to the commission of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. There was nothing inherently improbable in the account given by the appellant which could have led a jury to reject his version of events. There were, on the other hand, a number of inherent improbabilities in the complainant’s evidence relating to her failure to complain, her post accident conduct and her inability to particularise when the incident occurred. I am of the opinion that the implausibility of the complainant’s evidence was such that it could not be overcome by the advantage which the jury had of seeing and hearing the witnesses. 
     
      
    62 In my opinion, the proper application of the test formulated by the majority of the High Court in M and which was specifically approved in Jones v The Queen requires that the conviction of the appellant be set aside on the basis that it was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
     
      
    63 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (ii) The conviction is quashed and in lieu thereof, a verdict of acquittal is to be entered.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       1 GROVE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed upon him by Delaney DCJ in Parramatta District Court. Following pleas of guilty the applicant was sentenced upon seven counts of armed robbery with an offensive weapon. He asked to be taken into account pursuant to a Form 1, three further offences of armed robbery with an offensive weapon and two offences of assault with intent to rob with an offensive weapon. 
     
      
    2 Sentences were imposed on 20 May 2004. The applicant was in custody serving a balance of parole in respect of a previous conviction, that balance expiring shortly thereafter on 28 May 2004. 
     
      
    3 His Honour constructed sentences in the following fashion. On two of the counts the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of four years commencing on 20 May 2004 and expiring on 19 May 2008, to be served concurrently. On two further counts, to fixed terms of four years commencing on 12 November 2004 and expiring on 11 November 2008, to be served concurrently. On a further count to imprisonment for a fixed term of four years commencing on 20 May 2005 and expiring on 19 May 2009. On a further count, to imprisonment for a fixed term of five years commencing on 20 May 2005 and expiring on 19 May 2010. On the final count, taking into account the matters on Form 1, to imprisonment for seven years and six months commencing on 20 August 2005, with a non-parole period of five years and six months commencing on that date and expiring on 19 May 2010.  
     
      
    4 Thus, taking the earliest date of custody referable to these offences, it can be stated that the impositions involved an effective total term of eight years nine months, with a non-parole period of six years and nine months.  
     
      
    5 The applicant relies upon a single ground, asserting that his Honour erred with regard to the relationship between the length of the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period. “Aggregate” is a reference to the effective sentence just mentioned. 
     
      
    6 The argument of the applicant is focussed upon s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides that the balance of a term of sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period unless the court determines that there are special circumstances for departing from that proportion. Counsel for the applicant points out that the aggregate non-parole period is 77 per cent of the aggregate head sentence. This, it is contended, is incompatible with a finding by his Honour that special circumstances, in the sense of the use of that phrase in s 44, existed, and were to be taken into account. 
     
      
    7 Attention is drawn to relevant remarks by the learned sentencing Judge. His initial reference was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I state at this stage, although I will refer to it again, that on the basis of the report from the Probation and Parole Service, the report from Dr Westmore and the evidence which has been given by the offender I have reached the conclusion that this will be a case in which the application of special circumstances will be appropriate to vary the usual ratio of 75 per cent - 25 per cent between the full time sentence and non-parole period in this case, for such sentences which are not fixed term.” 
        
       
      
    8 Of course, fixed terms do not involve the setting of a non-parole period at all, but it can be observed that, in this case, there was only one sentence in which a non-parole period was fixed. His Honour made no reference to aggregate but it can be observed that he spoke in the plural of “sentences which are not fixed term”, despite the fact that there was only one of these. 
     
      
    9 However, his Honour’s later remarks make it clear that he had in mind the single sentence when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act there is evidence before the Court which would justify the Court reaching the view that there should be a finding of special circumstances in respect of  
        the offence 
         for which a non-parole period is to be set, thereby justifying the Court from (sic) altering the statutory ratio.” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
       
      Again, when imposing the various sentences, he stated: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of count 6 I take into account the matters on the Form 1 and I find special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.” 
        
       
       
      The relevant count (numbered 6) involved imposition of a total sentence of imprisonment of seven years and six months. An application of the statutory proportion would, as a matter of arithmetic result in a non-parole period of five years and seven and a half months. Thus there was, as his Honour stated that he intended, a reduction, although it must be conceded, the reduction was very small indeed. Nevertheless, at no point did his Honour state that he intended that his finding of special circumstances would be applied in relation to the overall period of custody including the impositions of fixed terms. 
       
       
      It is submitted that it can be concluded that his Honour overlooked the effect of accumulation but, with respect to that submission, it is plain that his Honour did not. He followed a course of inviting counsel to check the impositions which he proposed with specific reference to commencement and expiry dates and it was expressly acknowledged by counsel appearing at trial that the specified dates appeared to be correct. 
       
       
      As I have mentioned, as at the date of sentence for these matters, the applicant was nearing the expiry of the service of a balance of parole. This service was in connection with sentences for offences including robbery using corporal violence imposed at Liverpool District Court in March 1998. The applicant’s record was such as to disentitle him to leniency which he might otherwise seek.  
       
       
      No challenge was made to the short summary of facts by the learned sentencing Judge, which was in these terms: 
       
        
        “The first two offences occurred on 9 December 2001 at Yagoona when the offender used a knife to rob the IGA Supermarket. When he entered the supermarket he produced a large kitchen knife and demanded money from a cashier. The cashier emptied the register and the handed the money to him. He then made a further demand to another cashier for cash and was also given money by that cashier, after which he ran from the store.  
        
       
       
        
        The second and third offences (sic - third and fourth) occurred on 14 February 2002 when he entered a Roselands Day and Night Chemist at Roselands. He produced a kitchen knife and demanded money from the cash register and safe. The cash register was open, the offender removed $290 and then threatened a shop assistance requiring her to hand over her handbag and removed $800 from it being allegedly pay and rent money. He then left the store. 
        
       
       
        
        The fifth offence occurred on 17 February 2002 at Roselands. The offender entered the store being the same chemist shop, Roselands Day and Night Chemist. He produced a silver replica pistol. He demanded the cash register and safe be open to remove cash from the register but did not take any money from the safe. 
        
       
        
       
        
        The next offence was on 14 February 2002. He stole a mobile phone and cash from Joseph Saleh whilst armed with a meat cleaver. He robbed Mr Saleh at the Boian Night Chemist, Beverley Hills. He threatened, with a co-offender, the persons in the store and stole bags belonging to them. Four of the matters on the Form 1 relate to thefts he committed on those premises. 
        
       
       
        
        The seventh matter was an armed robbery using a replica pistol at Liverpool on 18 February 2002. On that date at about 1.50 p.m. he entered the Black and White Pharmacy, Hume Highway, Liverpool, and produced a silver replica pistol making demands to the staff to hand over money and property. He took $160 in cash leaving the scene of the robbery in a red coloured Commodore sedan owned by his de facto wife.” 
        
       
       
      On 19 February 2002 he was arrested by police, and at the time was in possession of a silver coloured replica pistol. He made full admissions in respect of the robberies when taken to the police station. All offences were committed whilst the applicant was on parole. 
       
      
    10 Whilst, as previously indicated, I am of opinion that the ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is not made out, I have made reference to the facts briefly in order to provide some elaboration for my further view that no lesser sentence than that imposed by the sentencing Judge was warranted, and the power of this court to intervene should not be invoked. 
     
      
    11 I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    12 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     
      
    13 HALL J: I agree. 
     
      
    14 GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I have proposed.
