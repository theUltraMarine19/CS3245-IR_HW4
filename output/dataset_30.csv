District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:
1              The complainant wife asked for $8750 as maintenance for herself and one child.
2              I awarded $100 as nominal maintenance for the complainant and $2400 for the child monthly, with effect from 1 January 2006. I also made an order for the respondent husband to contribute an additional sum of $500 yearly towards the child’s year-end school expenses. 
3              The complainant wife appeals against the order.
Background
4              Parties were married in Hong Kong in 1987. The complainant wife is currently a manager with xxx Ltd in Singapore. The respondent is a manager with a freight forwarding company in Hong Kong. They have one daughter aged 7 who is currently living with the complainant in Singapore.
5              The complainant said that she completed her O levels in Singapore and then returned to Hong Kong. After she married the respondent, they came to live in Singapore between 1991 to 1997 and obtained their Singapore citizenship. They returned to Hong Kong in 1998 and their daughter was born there.
6              In May 2005 the complainant left Hong Kong with their daughter and they have been living in Singapore since.
7              The respondent filed a divorce petition in Hong Kong in September 2005 and the matter was pending at the time of the maintenance hearing. The complainant had also made a custody application in Singapore. Pursuant thereto, in December 2005 by-consent orders were made for the parties to have joint custody of the daughter, with care and control to the complainant.
8              The respondent in his first affidavit said he was making his affidavit without prejudice to his application for a stay of all proceedings in Singapore. However this stay argument was not pursued at the hearing.      
9              The complainant filed1 affidavit ( CA 1 ) and the respondent filed 2 affidavits ( RA 1 and RA 2 chronologically).    
Respondent’s financial means
10            The respondent said that he could only afford to pay S$2000 for the child and a separate sum of S$800 as his contribution towards the monthly mortgage payments for the xxx apartment the complainant and their daughter were living in.
11            The respondent’s monthly salary was HK$67,000. After his MPF ( provident fund ) deduction, he took home about HK$63,500 ( about S$12,730 ). He also received a monthly travel allowance of HK $4000, and year-end bonus and additional salaries of HK $170,000 annually ( RA 2, paragraph 7 ).
12            His monthly income after MBF and income tax but inclusive of additional salaries and yearly bonuses worked out to about HK$ 66,232 ( S$13246 ). He claimed he was in deficit of about HK$5816 each month. In his revised list of expenses, his personal monthly expenditure ( excluding MBF and income tax ) was HK$72, 048 ( S$14,409 ) [ paragraph 9, RA 2 ].
13            I found the respondent’s claims of being unable to provide more for the complainant and the child without merit.  After deducting the HK$ 14,810 he said he spent monthly on rent and other household outgoings including a domestic help ( items 1, 7,8,10 & 11 on his list of expenses ) and the HK$9000 he sent for the child’s maintenance, this would leave him with HK $42,422 ( S$8484 ) monthly net of MBF and income tax to manage his personal and other expenses. It was a substantial sum and it was hard to see why he should be in deficit especially as he did not have any debts, mortgage or car loan to pay. 
14            It was not disputed that when the family lived together in Hong Kong, the respondent would hand the complainant HK$30,000 for their household expenses. Even after deducting the rent he was still paying and the household outgoings ( HK $14,810 ) and the sums he was sending for the child ( HK $9000 ), there was a balance of HK$6190 from this HK$30,000 he previously set aside for the family’s expenses.  Moreover when the complainant first came to Singapore with the child, the respondent could afford and did voluntarily remit them HK$18,000 per month, which he later reduced to HK$9,000.
15            Whichever way one looked at it, clearly the ability of the Respondent to pay a reasonable sum for the maintenance of the complainant and the child beyond what he was offering was not in issue. The issue turned on what would constitute a fair and reasonable sum for the maintenance of the complainant and the child.
16            Before moving to the quantum issue, I should add that many of the items of expense the respondent claimed in his revised list of expenses were on the high side, while others were voluntary payments that he could reduce or terminate. They could not be set up as reasons for not being able to provide more maintenance.
17            While I would accept that the Respondent might wish to maintain their apartment as his home in Hong Kong for the time being as the Hong Kong divorce proceedings were pending and custody was still in issue, the monthly sums he claimed for utilities ( HK$1100 ), expenses incurred in relation to access in Singapore (HK$12,000 ), clothing and shoes ( HK$2500 ), groceries and daily meals ( HK$5600 ) [( items 7, 12-14, 21-22 respectively in his list of expenses] could be reduced. 
18            The utilities claim for HK$1100 monthly appeared large for someone living alone in the apartment. As for his food bills, he chose to eat out mostly which was his lifestyle choice and even then, cheaper dine-out options were always available. Likewise as he chose to fly by Cathay Pacific to see his daughter each time, it was again a matter of his choice as cheaper airfare options were available. His claim for clothing expenses worked out to a hefty HK$30,000 ( S$6000 ) a year.
19            As regards the HK$9000 savings he said he was setting aside for his daughter each month ( item 3 on his list of expenses ), this savings account was in his name and he was free to deal with the sums whatever his proclaimed intentions. The payments were voluntary and he could terminate or reduce them if the need arose.
20            As for the HK$6,632 monthly he claimed to be spending on insurance polices and mutual fund savings for himself and his daughter ( item 5 of his list of expenses ), some of these expenses related to policies taken out in the 1990s while others related to more recent investment subscriptions. These latter payments could also be reduced or terminated without prejudice to the respondent and again, they could not be set up as reasons for not being able to pay more maintenance. 
Complainant’s income and expenses
21            The complainant earned a gross income of S$7800 monthly. After CPF she took home $6240. Her gross income last year inclusive of bonus was $97,400, and this worked out to S$8117 monthly.
22        In her expenses list, she said she spent S$3502 on herself every month ( PA 1, page 42 ), and S$5228 monthly on their daughter ( PA 1, page 14 ).
23            It would seem that based on her maintenance claim for $8750 which she had set out in her complaint form, she was asking for the respondent to bear her expenses and the child’s expenses on a 100% basis. In my view there was no merit to any contention that the respondent should have to fully bear the maintenance expenses of the complainant and their daughter, as the complainant had always been and continued to work full time earning a substantial salary, and the maintenance of their daughter was a shared parenting obligation.  
Main items in dispute
24            The respondent had objected in principle and quantum to the inclusion and\or the manner of apportionment of certain items claimed as maintenance expenses for the complainant and their daughter.
Mortgage expenses on the xxx apartment serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF
25           The complainant included as part of the maintenance claims of herself and their daughter a monthly mortgage sum of S$1418. She had apportioned it equally to herself and their daughter ( $709 each ). This mortgage related to the xxx apartment in which the complainant and their daughter were currently living in.
26            The xxx property was bought in the joint names of the complainant and the respondent. When they were in Hong Kong the property was rented out. The complainant kept the $1200 rental and used it to top-up shortfall payments to the mortgage. The mortgage had been serviced by both parties’ CPF sums.   
27            The complainant said that after she came to Singapore she made a cash repayment of S$240,000 to reduce the mortgage outstandings on this xxx apartment. 
28            It was submitted for the complainant that the respondent had reaped the benefit of the complainant’s large cash repayment to the xxx mortgage because the complainant was currently able to finance the $1418 monthly mortgage payment solely from her CPF without assistance from him. It was also argued that as the respondent was obliged to provide a roof for the complainant and their daughter, the monthly mortgage payment should be notionally included as part of the maintenance expenses of the complainant and the child and the respondent is obliged to share responsibility for the mortgage expenses as part of his maintenance obligations. 
29            If the mortgage sum was notionally factored into the list of maintenance expenses, this would inflate the sum total of the maintenance expenses of the complainant and daughter that the respondent was being asked to bear as part of his maintenance obligations. This would also mean that part of the maintenance sums paid by the respondent would include the notional mortgage expense but no sum would actually be applied towards the payment of the mortgage which was being serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF.
30            This would not be equitable on a number of fronts. The respondent would not be able to claim the benefit of any direct financial contribution towards the property even though his maintenance payments included the mortgage expenses. On the other hand the complainant would have in her hands the windfall of a cash payment from the maintenance sum that was not being applied towards any actual mortgage expense. Further the monthly mortgage payments she serviced entirely from her CPF would be attributed solely to her as part of her direct financial contributions to the property.
31           
 
To the respondent’s credit, he had volunteered to pay a separate sum of S$800 as his monthly contribution towards the mortgage if the complainant would credit that sum as his financial contribution for the mortgage. I thought this was a fair proposal, however this was rejected by the complainant.   
32            The fact remained that the mortgage payments being currently serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF did not affect her monthly disposal income. The mortgage payments were also capital payments and if the respondent were required to bear part of these payments as maintenance expenses, he should get due credit for it.
33            While the respondent may be said to have reaped the benefit of the complainant’s large cash repayment towards the mortgage, this had resulted from a voluntary act initiated by the complainant. It was not the complainant’s case that there was some pressing reason for her to make the payment of $240,000 towards the mortgage from her own funds because of some act or neglect of the respondent, or that it was the respondent who initiated or suggested the lump sum repayment. In fact the evidence was that the respondent had voluntarily remitted her HK$100,000 when he found out that she wanted to make a capital repayment. 
34            The complainant would receive due credit for her direct financial contributions to the property in the event of a division of assets. Both her cash and CPF payments to the mortgage would be computed as part of her direct financial contributions to the property and this would increase her equity stake in the property. The monthly mortgage payments from her CPF were also identifiable sums that would be refunded back to her CPF account upon a disposal of the property and they remained her personal assets.
35            I therefore excluded the mortgage payment serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF from the list of maintenance expenses the complainant wanted the respondent to bear. The reality of the situation was that the complainant did not currently need any financial assistance from the respondent with the mortgage.
36            A maintenance order is made taking into account the status quo of the parties as they have ordered their affairs. In the present case the complainant had decided to live in their flat which was previously rented out and she had made financial arrangements to service the mortgage entirely from her CPF. If the complainant had made alternative arrangements for her accommodation or ordered the mortgage situation differently such that cash sums or financial assistance from the respondent were required, these sums could have been identified and included in the maintenance expenses to be shared by the respondent. This was not the case here. However should the circumstances change the complainant was at liberty to apply for a variation of the order.
37            However what I included as maintenance expenses for the complainant and child were the monthly running costs of the property and other household outgoings. This comprised the management corporation fees, property tax, wear and tear, utilities and telephone bills which the complainant said amounted to $906.90 monthly. Of this sum of $906.90, the complainant had apportioned 50% of the management fees, property tax, utilities and telephone bills amounting to $359.20 to their daughter’s list of expenses, and the balance sum of $547.70 monthly was included in her list of maintenance expenses.
Car loan and related expenses apportioned to the list of child’s expenses 
38            The complainant included as part of the maintenance expenses of herself and their daughter a monthly sum of about $1074 paid for the car loan, petrol and car-related expenses. This $1074 was made up of $660 for the car loan and insurance, $124 for car maintenance and carpark charges, and $281 for petrol.
39            The complainant had sought to apportion 50% of the monthly car loan and the insurance (amounting to $334.50 ) and 50% of the petrol costs ( amounting to $140.44 ) to the child’s monthly maintenance expenses.   
40            The car was bought in the complainant’ name. The respondent said the decision to buy a car was her own, and they did not have a car in Hong Kong.     
41            I disallowed the 50% apportionment of the car loan as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. The car was a capital asset purchased  in the name of the complainant. Neither was it the complainant’s case that the car was used or purchased mainly for their daughter. In fact the evidence suggested the contrary. The complainant told the court that the daughter took the school bus one-way to school. The complainant car pooled with some neighbours to fetch the child for the return trip. There was also the maid who assisted to bring the child about for her after-school activities like tuition.  
42            It appeared that the car was purchased primarily for the complainant’s convenience. Neither did it seem that the car was used by her and the child equally. The car was a capital asset in her name and she could deal with as she pleased.
43            In principle the respondent should not be made to bear any part of the capital costs of this car as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. The complainant should not be allowed to apportion any part of the car loan to the child’s maintenance expenses. I disallowed the $265.50 being 50% of the car loan she was seeking to include as part of the child’s maintenance expenses.
44            The running expenses of the car stood on a different footing. I allowed some of the running costs of the car to be included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. I accepted that the daughter did ride in the car, and the complainant sometimes fetched the child from school as part of a car pool arrangement and about for the daughter’s other activities.
45            However the complainant was seeking to apportion 50% of the car insurance and petrol expenses (amounting to $69.09 and $140.40 monthly respectively) as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. The complainant had not established that the car was used equally by herself and the daughter. In fact the daughter’s transportation routine showed otherwise. This purported 50% apportionment of the car’s running costs to the daughter’s list of expenses could not be sustained. In my view it would be more equitable to allow about one-third of the total monthly car insurance and petrol cost expenses (amounting to $140 ) to be included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. 
Child’s education fund
46            The complainant included a sum of  $500 monthly she described as the child’s “ education fund “ in the expenses list of the daughter ( item 21 ).
47            In court the complainant said that this $500 was a monthly payment for a 5 –year renewable unit trust she bought in 2003 in Hong Kong. She had been making the monthly payments for this unit trust from her own funds all along. The respondent said he was not aware of this unit trust.
48            This item 21 expense was for a fund separate from another “education fund” policy she bought in 2004 for their daughter and the life insurance policy for their daughter ( item 20 ). The 2004 education fund policy was being paid for by sums in a Standard Chartered Bank account into which ang pows and other gifts meant for their daughter had been deposited. The life insurance policy had been bought when the daughter was born and the complainant had been paying the monthly premiums.   
49            The complainant said that the $500 monthly expenses for the “education fund” in item 21 was in fact paid for a unit trust bought in her sole name. However it was argued that it should be included in the maintenance expenses as she had bought the unit trust as an educational fund for the child, and she had also made a will for everything to be bequeathed to the child.
50            This $500 should be excluded from the child’s maintenance expenses to be borne by the respondent. The expense was paid for a capital asset legally owned by the complainant. Whatever the complainant’s intentions as regards this unit trust or the provisions of her will, she was free to deal with this unit trust as her own, and she could also terminate the payments at will. The respondent should not be subsidizing as part of the child’s maintenance a capital asset legally owned by the complainant.
51            I had treated this $500 payment for the unit trust in the complainant’s name in a similar manner with the HK$9000 monthly savings the respondent said he was setting aside in the bank for their daughter. They were both voluntary payments for investments legally held by the parties which could be discontinued anytime. Even if the parties intended to set aside these assets for their daughter, it was not a matter that should affect the quantum of the child maintenance to be ordered.     
52            The respondent did not dispute the $43.50 paid monthly for their daughter’s life insurance policy (item 20). He said he was aware of this insurance policy purchased for the child, and the sum was included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses.
Maid’s salary and related expenses apportioned entirely to the child 
53            As part of the child’s expenses, the complainant claimed a total of $904.15 monthly for the maid’s salary and related expenses (items 9-11 on the child’s list of expenses).
54            In my view it would not be correct to apportion all the maid expenses to the child. Even if the maid was engaged primarily for the child as the complainant was a full-time working mother, the maid would also assist with household chores and this would directly benefit the complainant. If the maid expenses were entirely factored into the list of the child’s expenses, this would inflate the sum total of the child’s expenses the respondent was being asked to bear and ignore the benefits derived by the complainant personally.
55            In my view it was more in keeping with the reality of the situation to apportion the maid’s expenses between the complainant and the child. The larger part of the maid’s expenses should be apportioned to the child in recognition that the full-time maid was engaged more for childcare reasons as the complainant was a full-time working mother.  I therefore apportioned the maid’s expenses one-third and two-thirds between the complainant and the child (amounting to $301 & $603 respectively). 
Piano and Computer expenses
56            The complainant claimed $357.33 and $58.23 monthly as the instalment payments for the piano and a computer ( items 4 & 22 on the child’s list of expenses ).
57            I allowed the piano instalments to be included in the child’s list of maintenance expenses. The complainant said the child needed a piano to practise on, and the child had already been having piano lessons when they lived in Hong Kong. Although the piano instalments were a capital expense the piano was purchased solely for the child and had not been unreasonably incurred.
58            Respondent counsel had argued that the sale proceeds of the piano would belong to the complainant. In my view it was quite unnecessary to split hairs over the legal ownership of the piano or its sale proceeds. In all likelihood the piano would remain with the child for some time. In any event its value was not large and it was a depreciating asset.
59            The complainant said that the piano instalment payments would continue until 2007. While the piano instalment payments would cease over time, they may be offset by an increase in existing expenses or new expenses may arise. It would not be possible for the court to factor in all the future variables. Parties would be at liberty to apply to vary the order should there be a material change in the expenses of the child over time.
60            The computer expenses stood on a different footing. The complainant said the computer loan was taken out in her name and the computer was still in Hong Kong. She had all along been paying the computer loan herself. She did not explain why the computer expenses should be included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses, nor was it her case that she had been prevented from taking the computer with her to Singapore.             
List of maintenance expenses for the complainant and child
61            After the reapportionment of the car loan and related expenses, the maid expenses and the computer expenses in the above manner and the deduction of the mortgage serviced by the complainant’s CPF, the complainant’s monthly expenses were recomputed as follows:
 
 
 
 
Property management, tax & wear & tear (items 2 -4 )
 
 
 
  $255
 
 
 
 
 
Car mortgage, insurance, maintenance,carpark & petrol ( items 5-8
 & 26 )
 
 
 
  $934.30
 
 
 
 
 
Utilities, telephone & broadband( items 9 & 10 )
 
 
 
  $292.70
 
 
 
 
 
Maid salary, levy and related expenses ( apportioned one-third )
 
 
 
  $301.40
 
 
 
 
 
Computer in Hong Kong
 
 
 
  $58.23
 
 
 
 
 
Food, medical, insurance, clothes, recreation & other personal
 expenses ( items 11-14, 16-20 )
 
 
 
  $1804
 
 
 
 
 
Total
 
 
 
  $3645. 63
 
 
 
 
62            The above computation of the complainant’s expenses was done without disturbing the quantum claimed by the complainant for each expense item or her apportionment of these expenses between herself and the child such as utilities, food etc (other than the treatment of the car and maid expenses described in the preceding paragraphs ).
63            The maintenance expenses for the child were recomputed as follows :
 
 
 
 
Property management & tax ( items 2 & 3 )
 
 
 
$175
 
 
 
 
 
Instalments for piano ( item 4 )
 
 
 
$357.30
 
 
 
 
 
Car insurance & petrol( items 6 & 26 )
 
 
 
$140
 
 
 
 
 
Utilities, telephone ( items 7 & 8 )
 
 
 
$184.20
 
 
 
 
 
Maid salary, levy and related expenses ( items 9-11 )
 
 
 
$603
 
 
 
 
 
Piano, Chinese, Maths, Ballet lessons & tuition ( items 12-16, 19,
 28 )
 
 
 
$1037.30
 
 
 
 
 
School fees & school bus ( items 17 & 18 )
 
 
 
$102
 
 
 
 
 
Life insurance policy
 
 
 
$43.50
 
 
 
 
 
Groceries & Dining ( items 24 & 25 )
 
 
 
$227.45
 
 
 
 
 
Misc (item 23 )
 
 
 
$150
 
 
 
 
 
Total
 
 
 
$3019.75
 
 
 
 
64            In the above computation the quantum the complainant claimed for each expense item was left undisturbed, save for “Misc” where she had claimed $396.10 monthly. In my view this sum was excessive as most of the child’s needs and more had already been catered for. I instead allowed a sum of $150 monthly for miscellaneous expenses.
65            As regards item 27 ( clothes, shoes and school bag ) the complainant had claimed $58.67 monthly. This would amount to about $700 yearly. As a substantial part of this expense item would relate to year-end school expenses like textbooks, uniforms and shoes etc, I did not include this in the monthly expenses but I ordered the respondent to pay an additional $500 yearly as his contribution towards the child’s year-end school expenses.
66            The complainant’s current monthly take-home salary of $6,240 was about 46% of the respondent’s monthly take-home monthly salary of HK$67,940  ( S$13,588 ). It formed about 31.5% of their combined monthly take-home salary of about S$19,828.
67            In court the respondent had offered to share 60% of  the child’s expenses while the complainant had suggested a 70:30 split of the full sum of $5228.30 she claimed as the child’s expenses in the proportion of their earned income.
68            It was clear that the respondent should bear a greater portion of the child’s maintenance expenses because of his higher income. Moreover when the parties lived in Hong Kong the respondent had borne the larger share of the household expenses. The complainant said the Respondent used to give her HK$30,000 monthly and she would top up another HK$10,000 for the family’s expenses. The sum of HK$12,500 was used for rental and HK$13,000 for household outgoings, groceries and the domestic help. Another HK$11,630 was spent on the child’s educational and other expenses. She also paid for the family’s dining expenses on an alternate week basis.
69            I ordered the respondent to pay S$2400 for the child’s monthly maintenance, this being about 80% of the $3019.75 required to maintain the child monthly. The complainant would have to shoulder the balance 20% of those expenses as part of her maintenance obligations of their daughter. 
70            As for the complainant’s maintenance, the complainant acknowledged in court that she could live within her means. However it was submitted repeatedly that the respondent earned twice as much as the complainant. With respect, when fixing the quantum of maintenance the court is to have regard to all the factors set out in Section 69(4) Women’s Charter, and the income of the parties is only one of the many factors to be considered. The court in fixing maintenance is not primarily engaged only in the exercise of apportioning the respondent’s larger income between the estranged parties.   
71            The complainant had a take-home salary of S$6240, and her personal maintenance expenses amounted to $3646 per month. Even after taking into account the 20% of the child’s expenses she was to bear ( amounting to about $600 ), this would still leave her with about $2000 monthly ( excluding bonuses ), being about one-third of her monthly take-home salary to manage her other liabilities, investments and savings. This was a comfortable financial margin. 
72            Looking at the parties’ lifestyle before they separated, it could not be said that the complainant had become accustomed to a lifestyle made possible by the respondent’s monies that she could not now sustain without substantive maintenance from the respondent, nor was it her case that the respondent had all along been supplementing her personal expenses.
73            While the respondent had paid HK$30,000 monthly for the family’s expenses when they lived in Hong Kong, the complainant herself had also chipped in financially to support the family’s monthly expenses by paying another HK$10,000. Further the HK$30,000 was paid for the household expenses of the entire family and not to supplement her personal expenses.  According to her account, the bulk of the pooled HK$40,000 had been spent on the rent, the maid and the child’s expenses.
74            The respondent continued to bear the major part of the maid and child’s expenses under the $2400 maintenance order for the child. The complainant now only had to shoulder 20% of the child’s expenses ( about S$600 ), compared to the 25% contribution ( HK$10,000 ) she previously made for the family’s expenses.
75            It was not possible to put parties back to the same exact financial positions they were in before they parted. There are now the expenses of 2 households when previously there was one, and the respondent had to incur additional expenses to come to Singapore to see their daughter. While the complainant did not currently need any financial assistance with her accommodation arrangements, the respondent continued to pay rent on the Hong Kong apartment.
76            Neither did I find that the complainant would suffer a drop in her standard of living if the respondent did not pay her substantive maintenance. She was living in a private apartment jointly owned by the parties, she continued to have the services of a maid, and the sums she claimed as food, dining and entertainment expenses for herself and their daughter were factored in full in assessing their maintenance claims. On the contrary it might be argued that her standard of living had been somewhat improved as she now owned and drove a car in Singapore when parties did not previously enjoy that benefit when they lived in Hong Kong.
77            In the circumstances I thought it appropriate to order nominal maintenance for the complainant. This would preserve her maintenance rights should there be a change in her circumstances. I made an order for the respondent to pay her $100 nominal maintenance monthly.",2006-04-17 00:00:00,SG District Court
